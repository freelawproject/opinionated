L. c. 121A contains an implicit cap on the amount developers must pay a city or town in lieu of taxes pursuant to their urban redevelopment contracts. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review to consider whether a Superior Court judge erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants, holding that the plaintiffs are bound by their contracts created under G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 6A, even though they are paying more than they would if they were not exempted from property taxes assessed pursuant to G. L. c. 59.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we conclude that G. L. c. 121A does not contain language to the effect that the financial burden created under \u00a7\u00a7 6A and 10 must always be less than or equal to taxation amounts otherwise required under G. L. c. 59, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural Background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">We begin by briefly discussing the general statutory scheme of G. L. c. 121A. Designed to eliminate conditions that cannot be alleviated by the ordinary operation of the real estate market, G. L. c. 121A encourages private developers to foster urban redevelopment projects. G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 2. A developer initiates and designs the project before applying for approval from the appropriate government agencies. G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6. Under G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 10, a developer is exempt from ordinary real estate and property taxes under G. L. c. 59, but instead pays a statutory excise. Pursuant to G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 6A, the developer of a redevelopment project must enter into a written contract with the city or town, agreeing to be bound by the provisions of the statute. Additionally, \u00a7 6A allows for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>developer to pay an amount additional to the statutory excise. The developer suggests this amount in the initial application, as an incentive to be chosen for the project, and it then becomes part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">There are no material facts in dispute. We take our facts from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision, supplemented by undisputed facts in the record. The plaintiffs, Anderson Street Associates (Anderson) and Marcus Garvey Apartments (Garvey), are owners of low-to-moderate income housing developments governed by G. L. c. 121A. The defendants are the city of Boston (city) and the Boston Redevelopment Authority (authority), a public body originally organized under G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26QQ, a precursor statute to G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 4, and an \u201curban renewal agency\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In March, 1978, pursuant to G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 6A, Anderson entered into a written contract with the city, agreeing to be bound by the provisions of G. L. c. 121A. Garvey entered into a similar written contract in July, 1979. The contracts, which by the plaintiffs\u2019 choice have forty-year terms, obligate the plaintiffs to carry out the projects in accordance with the statute, the terms required by the city, and the regulatory agreements into which they entered under G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 18C. The contracts require the plaintiffs to pay the Commonwealth an \u201curban redevelopment excise tax\u201d mandated by a formula in G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each contract also sets forth an additional forty-year \u00a7 6A payment based on varying percentages of the project\u2019s gross rental collections.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The additional contractual payments must be made only if they exceed the excise required under \u00a7 10. Because of their statutory exemption from State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>and local taxation under G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 10, the plaintiffs received preferential tax treatment on entering into these \u00a7 6A agreements, as the amounts owed under \u00a7 10 and the terms of the \u00a7 6A agreements were less than the amount of taxes that would otherwise have been owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">However, at some point following the enactment of Proposition 2Va in 1980 (G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 21C, inserted by St. 1980, c. 580, \u00a7 1), which limited property tax increases to two and one-half per cent of the previous year\u2019s tax revenue based on full and fair cash value, the plaintiffs\u2019 G. L. c. 121A payments exceeded the payments required under G. L. c. 59.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs made their annual payments to the city in accordance with the terms of their contracts until at least 1996. Beginning in 1996, the plaintiffs attempted to persuade city officials to address the significant gap between their payments and the payments they would be making if they were subject to G. L. c. 59 instead of G. L. c. 121A. In addition, the plaintiffs sought abatements of their G. L. c. 121A payments for tax years 1996, 1997, and 1998, arguing that their payments were disproportionate, unreasonable, and unconstitutional. The Department of Revenue (department) denied these requests on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims related to an underlying constitutional question on which the department lacks authority to render a decision. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Tax Board, which has not taken any action in part due to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In April, 1999, Anderson and Garvey filed virtually identical complaints against the city and the authority, asserting claims based on common-law principles, public policy and constitutional violations, and requesting declarations that the G. L. c. 121A contracts were unenforceable both prospectively and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>retroactively. The defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts, which the judge granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>7</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). \u201cAn order granting or denying summary judgment will be upheld if the trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992), citing <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 556 (1976). Because we conclude that the motion judge\u2019s rulings on undisputed material facts were correct as a matter of law, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">2. <em>Interpretation of G. L. c. 121 A. </em>\u201c[T]he primary source of the insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). \u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 595, 598 (1973). Accord <em>ROPT Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. 601, 603 (2000); <em>Weitzel </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Cos., </em>417 Mass. 149, 153 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., supra </em>at 537. Absent a clear indication to the contrary, statutory language is to be given its \u201cordinary lexical meaning.\u201d <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>384 Mass. 171, 176 (1981). \u201cWhile a court must normally follow the plain language of a statute, it need not adhere strictly to the statutory words if to do so would lead to an absurd result or contravene the clear intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 278 (2004). Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the result in this case is far from \u201cabsurd.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">General Laws c. 121A, \u00a7 10, provides in relevant part that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>urban redevelopment corporations \u201cshall be exempt from taxation and from betterments and special assessments.\u201d However, G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 6A, provides that \u201c[n]othing in [\u00a7 10] shall prevent such contract from further providing for such corporation' to pay to the city or town. . . such specific or ascertainable amount in addition to the excise prescribed by [\u00a7 10] as may have been stated in the application.\u201d Section 6A also provides that such payments in addition to the excise prescribed in \u00a7 10 \u201cshall be in lieu of taxes.\u201d Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, G. L. c. 121A does not provide tax concessions to the developers so that the total tax burden under \u00a7\u00a7 6A and 10 will be less than or equal to taxation amounts otherwise required under G. L. c. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">To interpret G. L. c. 121A to include a cap on the amount developers must pay would require this court to read words into the statute that are not there.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The fact that tax breaks may have been envisioned as part of the incentive for developers to engage in urban redevelopment projects does not equal a guaranty that the statutory payments would always be less than or equal to local property taxes. Had the Legislature intended G. L. c. 121A to guarantee tax concessions to be permanent, it could have included statutory language to that effect. It has done so elsewhere. For example, G. L. c. 121C, \u00a7 9, dealing with economic development, exempts corporations from taxes, betterments, and special assessments, requiring instead that the corporations pay, in lieu of taxes, a sum determined by the municipality; however, such sum may not exceed \u201cthe amount that would be levied at the then current tax rate.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Similarly, in G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 15, the Legislature required ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>ditional payments to be made to a municipality if the gross receipts exceeded the funds needed to maintain the project, up to an amount that the developer would have paid if it was not exempt from ordinary taxes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 15 includes a statutory cap on the excess payments a developer must pay. The Legislature could have chosen to include a similar cap in either \u00a7 6A or \u00a7 10, but it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Although our previous cases state that tax concessions were envisioned, it is undisputed that the plaintiffs received such tax concessions after signing the agreements. The fact that the concessions did not continue for the entire term of these contracts does not violate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 contracts under \u00a7 6A are unambiguous and must be enforced in accordance with their plain terms. <em>Freelander </em>v. <em>G. &amp; K. Realty Corp., </em>357 Mass. 512, 515-516 (1970). The terms of the contracts are clear in that they require annual payments based on specific and straightforward formulas under \u00a7 10 and the additional monies the plaintiffs contracted to pay under \u00a7 6A. There is no basis for arguing that the clear contractual terms of the contracts cannot be enforced. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 760, 787 (1960) (because additional payments under \u00a7 6A are obtained by contract, anyone undertaking project has \u201cno ground for complaint\u201d). In negotiating their contracts, the plaintiffs could have insisted on a provision assuring that their payments under the contract would never exceed local property taxes. They did not do so and cannot now attempt to insert or imply such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Although the calculations of the plaintiffs\u2019 payments have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>remained unchanged since the inception of the agreements, the plaintiffs argue that, since the enactment of Proposition <em>2l!i, </em>their payments have become unfavorable because developers who do not operate under G. L. c. 121A are paying less in taxes under G. L. c. 59. However, the parties to these negotiated contracts were not unsophisticated and there is no suggestion that the plaintiffs were not represented by counsel. Indeed, the plaintiffs entered into these contracts with their eyes open and were the ones who offered the additional payments under \u00a7 6A in their initial applications. In these circumstances, where sophisticated parties choose to embody their agreement in a carefully crafted document, they are entitled to and should be held to the language they chose. Nothing in Proposition 2Va has changed the amount that the plaintiffs agreed to pay. Rather, in light of Proposition <em>2xh, </em>the contract \u201cprice\u201d they agreed to does not look as favorable as it did when the contracts were signed. We cannot now, with hindsight, undo the contracts merely because the contract formulas do not presently give the plaintiffs the favorable treatment they anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The plaintiffs argue that our interpretation of G. L. c. 121A will deter developers from entering into urban redevelopment contracts with municipalities. However, this argument is without merit, as any new project will involve its own negotiation and the municipality will need to offer a deal that provides sufficient incentive to the potential developer. Thus, any contract created pursuant to \u00a7 6A will reflect a deal beneficial to the public and the developer. If the \u00a7 10 formula has become onerous because of the passage of Proposition <em>2lli, </em>it is the responsibility of the Legislature to address the issue, not the court. Moreover, we disagree with the notion that holding parties to their contracts violates public policy, particularly in this case where the plaintiffs will own the projects debt-free in fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">3. <em>Common-law contract theories. </em>The plaintiffs assert that the judge also erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs\u2019 common-law contract claims. There was no error because the common-law claims are based on the assumption that the Legislature clearly intended G. L. c. 121A to provide tax benefits throughout the forty-year commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>4. <em>Constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 6A and 10 payments. </em>The plaintiffs further argue that their payments in lieu of taxes constitute an unconstitutional tax because they impose unreasonable, disproportionate, and unequal taxation on them, claiming that there is no rational or reasonable justification for charging them double what they would pay under G. L. c. 59. However, this argument is without merit, as the money owed under G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 6A, is not a tax; rather, it is a contractually agreed upon amount in lieu of taxes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, as noted above, because the plaintiffs voluntarily contracted to make additional payments under \u00a7 6A, they have no basis for arguing that the clear contractual terms of the \u00a7 6A contracts cannot be enforced. <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In any event, our previous cases have upheld the constitutionality of the G. L. c. 121A payments on the ground that the public interest served by urban redevelopment justifies the separate classification and treatment for tax purposes. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>343 Mass. 375, 383-384 (1961); <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 778; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 760, 763 (1956). There has been no material change to the statute itself that requires us to take a second look at its constitutionality. We agree with the motion judge that the fact that the G. L. c. 121A tax concessions ultimately were not advantageous for the entire term of the contract does not make the taxation scheme unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The plaintiffs further argue that the city\u2019s failure to renegotiate with them violates their right to equal protection because the city has renegotiated with other G. L. c. 121A developers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For the purposes of this opinion, we assume, without deciding, that the plaintiffs raised this claim in their complaints. However, because we conclude that there is no unequal tax treatment, we affirm the judgment below. Although the defendants have agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>to revise the G. L. c. 121A contracts of other developers, no law requires this; rather, as the defendants argue, they are entitled to decide whether to modify a contract based on whether they determine that modification would be in the public interest in a particular case. <em>Lafayette Place Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., 427 </em>Mass. 509, 525-526 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1177 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Equal protection claims will succeed only if the decision to treat the plaintiffs differently from those similarly situated is wholly \u201carbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts State Lottery Comm\u2019n, </em>300 F.3d 92, 104 (1st Cir. 2002), quoting <em>Maine Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Brotherhood Maintenance of Way Employees, </em>813 F.2d 484, 492 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 825 (1987). The plaintiffs failed to put forth any specific facts to support the assertion that they were similarly situated to the other G. L. c. 121A developers that renegotiated their contracts with the defendants or that the renegotiations were arbitrary. In fact, the evidence indicates that the defendants renegotiated with developers based on their projects\u2019 needs. Indeed, despite being questioned repeatedly at oral argument, the plaintiffs were unable to articulate a specific hardship the project would suffer if their contracts were not modified. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claims cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that G. L. c. 121A does not include a cap on payments requiring that the tax burden under G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7\u00a7 6A and 10, must always be less than or equal to taxation amounts otherwise required under G. L. c. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The excise imposed by G.

Rather, every statute or case mentioning this phrase or terminology either explicitly stated in a definition that payments in Ueu of taxes must not exceed regular tax payments or was silent on the issue.
