Carter, of possession of an infernal machine (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A) and unlawfully cultivating marijuana (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C). The defendant appeals only from his conviction of possession of an infernal machine, claiming that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty because the Commonwealth failed to show that he possessed a constructed infernal machine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>reversed the conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 205, 215 (2004). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we agree with the Appeals Court and conclude that merely possessing the components that could be used to construct an infernal machine is not enough to convict one of possession of an infernal machine, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural Background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">We summarize the relevant facts. On October 15, 1999, pursuant to a search warrant, police searched the defendant\u2019s home and seized a brick-shaped object, confirmed to be C-4 plastic explosive, and a container holding ten percussion blasting caps. The police found the items in a drawer of a metal cabinet. The C-4 was inside a nylon bag, and the blasting caps were inside a plastic case. The plastic case containing the blasting caps was not inside the nylon bag, but was located toward the back of the drawer, which contained tools and other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">After the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty of possession of an infernal machine; the judge denied the motion. The defendant did not renew the motion at the close of all the evidence, but filed a timely notice of appeal. He claims that the judge erred in denying the motion for a required finding of not guilty because the Commonwealth\u2019s proof failed to establish that he possessed an infernal machine within the meaning of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, \u201cwe consider the evidence, together with permissible inferences from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and \u2018determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 400 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 175 (1992), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>To support a conviction of possession of an infernal machine, the Commonwealth must present legally sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the defendant possessed \u201cany device for endangering life or doing unusual damage to property, or both, by fire or explosion.\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Here, the Commonwealth produced evidence that the defendant possessed both C-4 and blasting caps; however, the evidence shows that there was no assembly of the materials, but rather that they were stored separately. Massachusetts case law makes clear that a device \u201cmust be something which is made. It cannot be simply one element. It must consist of more than one part in order to be a device, instrument or machine or contrivance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bushway, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 715, 718 (1979) (plastic trash bag filled with gasoline and tied with a knot is an infernal machine). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 1006 (1987) (cigarette package filled with explosive gun powder is an infernal machine). By itself, the C-4 is not an infernal machine that could endanger life or do unusual damage to property, as required by G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A, because it is only one item and is not capable of detonating without a blasting cap. Additionally, the blasting caps, while highly sensitive, are also not in themselves infernal machines because they are not capable of inflicting \u201cunusual\u201d damage as they cannot create significant explosions on their own. In this case, to be an infernal machine, the C-4 and blasting cap would have had to be combined, not stored separately. Moreover, unlike two Federal statutes defining a \u201cdestructive device,\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A, does not provide for punishment of a person possessing items that could be assembled into an infernal machine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We conclude that until assembled, the C-4 and the blasting caps do not constitute a device and therefore the Commonwealth failed to prove an essential element of the case, that the item was an infernal machine. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of judgment for the defendant on indictment no. 103121.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-14\">The defendant also claims that the judge erred in allowing the Commonwealth to play a videotaped explosion for the jury and in telling the jury that certain evidence was unavailable to them because she had ruled it inadmissible. Because of our conclusion, we need not address these other issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-10\">It is worth noting that the Commonwealth could have charged the defendant with unauthorized possession of explosives pursuant to G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 35, but did not do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(4) (2000) defines a \u201cdestractive device\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">\u201c(A) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas \u2014 (i) bomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses; [and] (C) <em>any combination of parts </em>either designed or intended for use in converting any device described in subparagraph (A) . . . and <em>from which a destructive device may be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number><em>readily assembled\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(f) (2000) (similarly defining \u201cdestructive device\u201d).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
