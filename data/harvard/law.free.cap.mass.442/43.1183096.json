L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; negligent misrepresentation; and unfair and deceptive trade practices, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, against a mutual fund, its investment manager, and its corporate managing entity, on allegations that the manager made materially misleading statements to the plaintiff before and after the plaintiff\u2019s investment in the fund, and that the plaintiff sustained losses on its investment. Edward Marram, as trustee for Geo-Centers, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (plan), maintained that Frederick R. Kobrick (Kobrick) made misleading statements concerning Kobrick Offshore Fund (offshore fund), which Kobrick controlled, in an effort to attract and retain the plan as an investor. The defendants countered that the express terms of the offshore fund\u2019s offering memorandum and subscription agreement, which Marram acknowledged having received, read, and understood in full, precluded Marram from bringing his claims. The defendants placed particular emphasis on the terms of an integration clause in the subscription agreement, which we discuss below. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all claims pursuant Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), which the defendants filed ten days after the action commenced. Marram appealed, and we transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>complaint in its entirety must survive the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The standard of review for a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule 12 (b) (6) is well settled. We take as true \u201c \u2018the allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor . . .\u2019 <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C., </em>420 Mass. 404, 407 (1995). In evaluating the allowance of a motion to dismiss, we are guided by the principle that a complaint is sufficient \u2018unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).\u201d <em>Warner-Lambert Co. </em>v. <em>Execuquest Corp., </em>427 Mass. 46, 47 (1998). Although errors of law based on the facts alleged will not surmount a rule 12 (b) (6) challenge, the plaintiff\u2019s burden is \u201crelatively light.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Gibbs Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Truck Leasing Corp., </em>399 Mass. 8, 13 (1987). Under the \u201cgenerous principles\u201d governing our review in this matter, <em>Connerty </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>398 Mass. 140, 143 (1986), we summarize the facts alleged in the unverified complaint and in uncontested documents of record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">2. <em>Alleged facts. </em>The plan is a profit-sharing plan for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>employees of Geo-Centers, Inc., a high technology and professional services firm headquartered in Massachusetts. The offshore fund is a hedge fund<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that solicits business in Massachusetts. It is incorporated under the mutual fund laws of the Cayman Islands.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The complaint alleges that, on December 17, 1999, Marram and Kobrick met to discuss the possibility of the plan investing in one of Kobrick\u2019s mutual funds. Marram told Kobrick that the plan was seeking to invest in a diversified fund that would preserve capital. Kobrick touted his \u201clong history of success as a fund manager,\u201d represented that the offshore fund was \u201cdiversified\u201d and \u201cinvested in a variety of industries,\u201d and \u201crepresented that the stock of high technology companies did not constitute a majority of the [offshore fund\u2019s] holdings and that he managed the [offshore fund] in such a way that it would not be a volatile investment vehicle.\u201d After the meeting, Kobrick forwarded to Marram a private offering memorandum and a subscription agreement for the offshore fund. The documents contain numerous representations and covenants. We summarize some of the pertinent terms here, reserving others for later discussion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The private offering memorandum describes the offshore fund\u2019s objectives as follows: \u201cto achieve above-market growth in shareholders\u2019 capital, principally through investment in equity securities and equity related instruments while seeking to control risk.\u201d It further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cThe Fund will hold a diversified portfolio of securities, use leverage in pursuit of additional return and hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>short positions as a hedge and potential source of additional return. . . . The Fund expects to invest in companies of all sizes and a variety of industries. However, the Fund does not have fixed guidelines for diversification and may concentrate investments in specific industries or companies if the Investment Manager believes that such concentration will offer optimal opportunity for risk adjusted capital appreciation. ... In general, the Fund\u2019s investment program has been broadly structured to provide the Investment Manager with maximum flexibility to achieve the Fund\u2019s investment objective.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Elsewhere, the private offering memorandum describes the offshore fund as \u201cspeculative\u201d and entailing \u201ca high degree of risk.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The subscription agreement directs the investor to \u201cthe risk factors referred to in the [mjemorandum.\u201d Two statements in the subscription agreement are particularly germane here. The first represents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">\u201cThe Investor has received and read a copy of the Memorandum outlining, among other things, the organization and investment objectives and policies of, and the risks and expenses of an investment in, the Fund. The Investor acknowledges that in making a decision to subscribe for Shares the Investor has relied solely upon the Memorandum, the other Fund Documents and independent investigations made by the Investor. The Investor understands the investment objectives and policies of, and the investment strategies which may be pursued by, the Fund. The Investor\u2019s investment in the Shares is consistent with the investment purposes and objectives and cash flow requirements of the Investor and will not adversely affect the Investor\u2019s overall need for diversification and liquidity. The investor acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to ask questions of the Investment Manager, prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>sale of the Shares and to obtain any additional information to the extent the Fund possesses such information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense, necessary to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the Memorandum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The second is an integration (or merger) clause, whereby the investor acknowledges: \u201cThis Subscription Agreement constitutes the entire arrangement and understanding between the parties hereto regarding its subject matter, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, arrangements and understandings, written or oral, between the parties regarding the same.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">On January 1, 2000, shortly after Marram executed and submitted the subscription agreement, the plan purchased 1,500 shares of Series 2 stock for $1.5 million. On March 1, 2000, the plan invested an additional $500,000 in the offshore fund, purchasing 500 shares of Series 4 stock. On March 23, 2000, three months after the plan\u2019s initial investment, Marram received the offshore fund\u2019s audited financial statements for the year ending December 31, 1999. The report stated that the offshore fund was not diversified and was heavily invested in high technology stock.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Beginning in March, 2000, the offshore fund\u2019s value declined precipitously. Thereafter, Kobrick made numerous, almost monthly, reassuring statements to Marram, by letter, by telephone, and by facsimile transmission, that the offshore fund\u2019s losses would be recouped and that the market situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>worked well for Kobrick\u2019s investment style.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When the two men met on October 19, 2000, Kobrick urged Marram to maintain the plan\u2019s investment, telling him that no investors had left the offshore fund and that new money was coming into it. While declining to provide Marram with a list of securities in the offshore fund\u2019s portfolio, Kobrick told Marram that the offshore fund was diversified, that the \u201ceconomy plays well into [his] philosophy,\u201d and that the economy was rebounding. Yet share value continued to fall. By November 30, 2000, the Series 2 stock had declined 60.67%, and the Series 4 stock had declined 67.60%.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">On December 11, 2000, Marram directed the offshore fund, by letter, to liquidate the account. Kobrick asked Marram to reconsider. In a telephone conversation with Marram on December 27, 2000, he urged Marram to stay with the offshore fund. Kobrick stated that he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that, in doing so, the plan would reap the \u201chighest reward[s].\u201d Kobrick also promised to provide Marram with a list of companies the offshore fund held, an analysis of the sectors that caused the offshore fund\u2019s losses, and an analysis of the sectors that would recover losses. Kobrick allegedly told Marram that the offshore fund had started to do better, and that it was not invested in any \u201cdot.corns.\u201d After this conversation, Marram rescinded the December 11, 2000, liquidation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Marram never received the information Kobrick promised. On April 3, 2001, Marram again requested that the plan\u2019s invest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ment be liquidated. While it is unclear from the complaint exactly when the shares were liquidated,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Marram alleges that, in total, the plan invested $2 million in the offshore fond and incurred a loss of $1,415,210 over the investment period.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">3. <em>Uniform Securities Act, G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410. </em>Before addressing the merits of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the securities claim, we discuss in some detail the background and purpose of G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2). The Uniform Securities Act, G. L. c. 110A (act), broadly regulates securities offerings in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Like its counterpart, the Federal Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77a et seq. (2000), the act creates criminal and civil liability for securities-related infractions. See, e.g., G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7\u00a7 409, 410. See also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k, 771, 77y. However, G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2), \u201cprovides the only civil remedy under the Uniform Securities Act for misrepresentations and omissions.\u201d J.C. Long, Blue Sky Law \u00a7 9:23 (2003). It imposes \u201ccivil liability for sales [of securities] by means of fraud or misrepresentation.\u201d L. Loss, Commentary on the Uniform Securities Act, draftsmen\u2019s commentary to \u00a7 410 (a), at 147 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The Legislature has directed that we interpret the act in coordination with the Securities Act of 1933. See St. 1972, c. 694 (enacting G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 415, and directing court \u201cto coordinate the interpretation and administration of this chapter with the related federal legislation\u201d). See also <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Hyannis Harborview, Inc., </em>838 F. Supp. 676, 684 n.9 (D. Mass. 1993) (Massachusetts securities laws \u201care substantially similar to the Federal securities laws and therefore decisions construing the Federal statutory language are applicable to the state statute as well\u201d). General Laws c. 110A, \u00a7 410 (a) (2), \u201cis almost identical with \u00a7 12 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00a7 771(2).\u201d L. Loss, <em>supra </em>at official comment to \u00a7 410 <em>(a), </em>at 146. See <em>id. </em>at draftsmen\u2019s commentary to \u00a7 410 (a), at 147 (\u201cThe resemblance to \u00a7 12 [2] of the Securities Act of 1933 will once more make for an interchangeability of federal and state judicial precedence in this very important area\u201d). Accordingly, we look to Federal decisions under \u00a7 12(2), as well as to the plain language of the statute and decisions of our appellate courts, for our interpretation of G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We begin with the general purposes of G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2). The statute\u2019s thrust is both \u201credressive\u201d and \u201cpreventive.\u201d Shulman, Civil Liability and the Securities Act, 43 Yale L.J. 227, 227 (1933) (Shulman). It aims, of course, to compensate the buyer for a loss.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> More importantly, it creates a strong incentive for sellers of securities to disclose fully all material facts about the security. Section 410 (a) (2) \u201cprovidefsj a heightened deterrent against sellers who make misrepresentations by rendering tainted transactions voidable at the option of the defrauded purchaser,\u201d regardless of the actual cause of the investor\u2019s loss. <em>Casella </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>883 F.2d 805, 809 (9th Cir. 1989) (construing \u00a7 12[2] of the Securities Act of 1933). See Kaminsky, An Analysis of Securities Litigation Under Section 12 (2) and How it Compares with Rule 10b-5, 13 Hous. L. Rev. 231, 239 (1976) (\u201c\u00a7 12 [2] is designed to induce sellers to be assiduous in insuring full disclosure to the buyer by threatening the seller with liability almost as an insurer in the event that there has been any material inaccurate disclosure or nondisclosure in the sale traceable in any way to the seller\u2019s carelessness or affirmative wrongdoing\u201d); J.C. Long, Blue Sky Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9:24, at 9-38 (\u201cThe Securities Act was intended to reverse the age-old concept of caveat emptor and replace it with the concept of caveat venditor or seller beware\u201d). The \u201c[a]ct seeks not only to secure accuracy in the information that is volunteered to investors, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>also, and perhaps more especially to compel disclosure of significant matters that were heretofore rarely, if ever, disclosed.\u201d Shulman, <em>supra </em>at 227 (discussing Federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Thus, the act provides strong protections for a buyer who received misleading information from a seller of securities. While not imposing strict liability on the seller for untrue statements or omissions, it holds the seller to the heavy burden of proof \u201cthat he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission.\u201d G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2). See J.C. Long, Blue Sky Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9:23, at 9-35 (defendant held to \u201cinverse negligence standard\u201d that is \u201ca very difficult defense to sustain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s burden is considerably lighter. It is enough for the plaintiff to establish that (1) the defendant \u201coffers or sells a security\u201d; (2) in Massachusetts<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; (3) by making \u201cany untrue statement of a material fact\u201d or by omitting to state a material fact; (4) the plaintiff did not know of the untruth or omission; and (5) the defendant knew, or \u201cin the exercise of reasonable care [would] have known,\u201d of the untruth or omission. G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2). See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>National Warranty Co., </em>953 F.2d 256, 262 n.3 (6th Cir. 1992) (listing elements of \u00a7 12[2] claim); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Hyannis Harborview, Inc., supra </em>at 686 (fisting elements of \u00a7 410 [a] [2] claim); J.C. Long, Blue Sky Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9:24 (listing elements of Uniform Securities Act claim). Oral as well as written material misstatements are actionable. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 771(2) (\u201coffers or sells a security ... by means of a prospectus or oral communication\u201d); <em>Mid-America Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express Inc., </em>886 F.2d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir. 1989) (interpreting \u201cuntrue statement of a material fact\u201d under Oklahoma Securities Act to apply to both oral communications and written prospectus); L. Loss, Commentary on the Uniform Securities Act, draftsmen\u2019s commentary to \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2), at 148 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>(1976) (noting that \u201cfor clarity\u2019s sake, it would be better\u201d if statute explicitly stated \u201cby the use of any written or oral communication which contains any untrue statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">There are other factors providing substantial protection to a buyer of securities who receives any false or misleading information. The plaintiff does not need to prove either negligence or scienter to meet his burden of proof. J.C. Long, Blue Sky Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9:23, at 9-34.1. Moreover, because G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 (a) (2), holds the seller liable for inaccurate disclosure or nondisclosure of material information, \u201c[f]oremost among the elements that the buyer does not have to prove is reliance.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Kaminsky, An Analysis of Securities Litigation Under Section 12 (2) and How it Compares with Rule lob-5, 13 Hous. L. Rev. 231, 264-265 (1976). The buyer\u2019s sophistication is also irrelevant to his claim. See <em>MidAmerica Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express Inc., supra </em>at 1256 (distinguishing 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 claim, where reliance is element, from \u00a7 12[2] claim, where reliance is not element); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>National Warranty Co., </em>953 F.2d 256, 262 (6th Cir. 1992) (\u201cSection 12 [2], on the other hand, has no requirement of justifiable reliance ... a purchaser\u2019s investment sophistication is immaterial to a [\u00a7] 12 [2] claim\u201d); L. Loss, <em>supra </em>at draftsmen\u2019s commentary to \u00a7 410 (a) (2), at 148 (\u201cThe \u2018by means of\u2019 clause ... is not intended as a requirement that the buyer prove reliance on the untrue statement or the omission. He must show only that he did not know of it\u201d). Nor does the buyer have any duty to investigate or to \u201cverify a statement\u2019s accuracy.\u201d <em>MidAmerica Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express Inc., supra </em>at 1256. The buyer needs only to show \u201clack of knowledge of a misleading statement or omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>sion in order to prevail.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1254. \u201cAll that is required is ignorance of the untruth or omission.\u201d <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>John Nuveen &amp; Co., </em>619 F.2d 1222, 1229 (7th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1005 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">As a counterweight to its consumer-oriented focus, the act contains several provisions favoring sellers. First, it holds the plaintiff to an abbreviated limitations period.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Second, it specifically allows for two affirmative defenses in addition to a direct attack on one of the prima facie elements of a \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2) claim, i.e., the defendant was not a \u201cseller\u201d or did not offer securities \u201cin Massachusetts.\u201d It \u201cpreclude[s] recovery whenever a plaintiff [buyer] actually knows that a representation is false or knows that existing information has been withheld.\u201d <em>Haralson </em>v. <em>E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., </em>919 F.2d 1014, 1032 &amp; n.10 (5th Cir. 1990), overruled in part by <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Alloyd Co., </em>513 U.S. 561 (1995). See <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Oil Field Sys. Corp., </em>803 F.2d 749, 755-756 (2d Cir. 1986) (defendants not liable where plaintiff testified in deposition to reading prospectus and thus had knowledge of fact misrepresented). And it provides that the defendant is not hable if he \u201cdid not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission.\u201d G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 (a) (2). <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Hyannis Harborview, Inc., </em>838 F. Supp. 676, 688 (D. Mass. 1993). Finally, the act limits the buyer\u2019s remedy to recision (returning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>buyer to status quo). See G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2) (\u201cDamages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it and interest at six per cent per year from the date of disposition\u201d). Contract damages are not recoverable, nor are punitive or multiple damages. <em>Cabot Corp. </em>v. <em>Baddour, </em>394 Mass. 720, 724 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Against this background we turn to the merits of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the securities claim. The defendants assert that, as a matter of law, they are immune from the plaintiff\u2019s claims because (1) Marram purchased shares in the offshore fund solely on the basis of written representations contained in documents, whose truth is uncontested, (2) Mar-ram\u2019s sophistication and equal bargaining power are relevant to the applicability of the integration clause, and (3) the defendants could not possibly have been aware that Marram secretly purchased the securities in reliance on preinvestment oral representations as well as on the documents. These are contract defenses. Were this a contract action, they might have merit. But it is not. As we have seen, rebanee and sophistication of the buyer are not elements of this statutory claim. And the existence of contradictory written statements, in an integration clause or otherwise, does not provide a defense to the charge of preinvestment materially misleading oral statements. See, e.g., <em>MidAmerica Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc., supra </em>at 1256 (babibty even where misleading oral statements corrected by written prospectus); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>National Warranty Co., supra </em>at 262 (\u201cSection 12 [2], on the other hand, has no requirement of justifiable rebanee on the part of a purchaser. Because of this, a purchaser\u2019s investment sophistication is immaterial to a [\u00a7] 12 [2] claim\u201d). Indeed, to permit the seller of securities to discharge, or to defeat, his statutory obbgation of truthfulness to the buyer merely by attaching an integration clause to a subscription agreement would enfeeble the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In any event, in this case it is far from obvious that the representations in the offering memorandum and the subscription agreement contravene the specific, detailed oral representations that Kobrick is abeged to have made to Marram. We note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>for example, that Kobrick allegedly told Marram that the offshore fund was \u201cdiversified\u201d in a \u201cvariety of industries.\u201d This oral representation is echoed in the statements in the offering memorandum, quoted above, i.e., that the offshore fund \u201cwill hold a diversified portfolio of securities\u201d and that the offshore fund \u201cexpects to invest in companies of all sizes and a variety of industries.\u201d To be sure, the offering memorandum also represents that the investment manager \u201cmay\u201d concentrate holdings in one industry in order to maximize returns, but such statements do not refute the specific representations about diversification that Kobrick made to Marram during their preinvestment meeting and that are echoed elsewhere in the offshore fund\u2019s documents. At trial the defendants may wish to introduce the written representations in the offshore documents as evidence to refute Marram\u2019s allegations. See <em>Meason </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>226 Ga. 862, 864 (1976) (integration provision has \u201cevidentiary value on the question of whether representations were made to the purchaser inducing the stock purchase other than those contained in the prospectus\u201d). However, the mere existence of the integration clause is insufficient, in itself, to support the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the securities claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">We find further support for our conclusion that an integration clause cannot release the defendants from liability under G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 (a) (2), in another section of the Uniform Securities Act. General Laws c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(g),</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>prohibits any person from waiving compliance with any provision of the Act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See L.

Other jurisdictions have held that written contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>terms, including an integration clause, cannot be construed to waive the plaintiff\u2019s rights under Federal or State securities law. \u201cTo permit this remedy to be \u2018waived\u2019 or \u2018released\u2019 prior to or contemporaneously with the sale of unregistered securities would thwart the very objective of the statute and violate the declared public policy of this State. Such a holding would pave the way for the virtual nullification of this important legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Holsman, </em>10 Ill. 2d 551, 554 (1957) (written agreement contained release of liability from provisions of Illinois Securities Act). See, e.g., <em>FS Photo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Picturevision Inc., </em>61 F. Supp. 2d 473, 480 (E.D. Va. 1999) (merger clause in settlement agreement, \u201cwhile not an explicit waiver of compliance with the Securities Act, is nonetheless covered by \u00a7 78cc[a] [the equivalent Federal statute] and is thus ineffective to bar plaintiffs\u2019 federal securities fraud claims\u201d); <em>Doody </em>v. <em>E.F.

Since the securities laws are a remedial measure intended to encourage the prosecution of securities fraud actions, the Court refuses to enforce this indemnity provision\u201d); <em>Meason </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra </em>(\u201cWe also reject the seller\u2019s contention that the [integration] clause as a matter of law estops the purchaser from raising any alleged oral misrepresentations\u201d).

Litig. </em>v. <em>Kraftsow, </em>890 F.2d 628, 641 (3d Cir. 1989), quoting <em>TSC Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976). The determination of materiality is a mixed question of law and fact ordinarily decided by the trier of fact. \u201cOnly if the alleged misrepresentations or omissions are so obviously unimportant to an investor that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality is it appropriate for the district court to rule that the allegations are inactionable as a matter of law.\u201d <em>TSC Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Northway, Inc., supra </em>at 450. <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>UJB Fin.

It is difficult to imagine concerns more material to the reasonable investor when considered in the total mix of information that drives an investment decision. See <em>DeBruyne </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, </em>920 F.2d 457, 465-466 (7th Cir. 1990) (\u201callegations as to . . . risk and volatility . . . appear more likely to raise a genuine issue of fact as to misrepresentation,\u201d but dismissing securities claim for other reasons); <em>Casella </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>v. <em>Webb, </em>883 F.2d 805, 807 (9th Cir. 1989), quoting <em>Admiralty Fund </em>v. <em>Hugh Johnson &amp; Co., </em>677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982) (\u201ctest for materiality is \u2018whether the existence or nonexistence of the fact in question is a matter to which a reasonable man would attach importance in determining his choice of action\u2019 \u201d); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>New Am.

L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(a) </em>(2), to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">4. <em>Negligent misrepresentation. </em>Although it has no bearing on a claim pursuant to G.

App. Ct. 256, 257 (1999). However, in some circumstances a plaintiff\u2019s reliance on oral statements in fight of contrary written statements is unreasonable as a matter of law. See, e.g., <em>Sound Techniques, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 425, 433-434 (2000) (\u201cno reasonable basis [existed] for ignoring the plain language of the merger clause, in which [the plaintiff] agreed that it was entering into the contract free from influence by or in reliance upon any representations other than those set out in the contract\u201d). Our courts have so held, but generally only after some record has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>been established on a motion for summary judgment or after a trial. See, e.g., <em>Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co. </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., </em>438 Mass. 459, 468 (2003) (summary judgment appropriate because it was unreasonable to rely on oral statements that conflicted with written quotation, where \u201c[a]ll that was required of [the plaintiffs\u2019 representatives] was that they read the document to ascertain the obvious\u201d); <em>Mahaney </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1978), quoting <em>Yorke </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>332 Mass. 368, 374 (1955) (ajfter trial, court held as matter of law that it was unreasonable to rely on oral statements that were \u201cpreposterous or palpably false\u201d in face of contradictory written statements). See also <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Ridefilm Corp., </em>212 F.3d 657, 665 (1st Cir. 2000) (summary judgment affirmed where \u201c[i]t was unreasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the alleged oral representations because of the express written word\u201d); <em>Triforo </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins.

Confronted by such conflict a reasonable person investigates matters further; he receives assurances or clarification before relying\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We do not agree with the defendants and the Superior Court judge that the issue of Marram\u2019s reliance on the oral representations alleged in this case is ripe for decision at this preliminary stage. First, as this appeal concerns a motion to dismiss, there is no factual record that the specific oral representations Kobrick allegedly made to Marram were contradicted elsewhere. Additionally, extinguishing the plaintiff\u2019s negligent representation claim would be inappropriate because the subscription agreement implicitly acknowledges Kobrick\u2019s preinvestment oral statements to be part of the mix of preinvestment information available for the prospective buyer to weigh. The private offering memorandum states that the offshore fund \u201cwill make available to each prospective investor ... the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers\u201d from the offshore fund administrator concerning \u201cthe terms and conditions of this offering of Shares,\u201d and from the offshore fund manager concerning \u201cthe investment program of the Fund.\u201d The private offering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>memorandum further states that the administrator will provide the investor, on request, with such additional information \u201cnecessary to verify the accuracy\u201d of the memorandum as the administrator \u201ccould acquire . . . without unreasonable effort or expense.\u201d See also note 10, <em>supra. </em>Implicit in these representations is the guarantee that whatever information the agents of the offshore fund provide will be reliable. In essence, the subscription agreement and private offering memorandum implicitly vouch for the accuracy of Kobrick\u2019s preinvestment oral statements to Marram about the offshore fund. In such circumstances, and without any factual record developed through discovery, we cannot conclude that, as a matter of law, no factual scenario exists under which the plaintiff might establish a claim of negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">5. <em>General Laws c. 93A claim. </em>The third count of the complaint alleges violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> unfair or deceptive trade practices resulting in proximate and foreseeable losses. The claim applies to both Kobrick\u2019s preinvestment and postinvestment statements to Marram. The Superior Court judge reasoned that the postinvestment statements were not actionable because (1) they were statements of opinion, not fact, and (2) the plan redeemed its shares at the earliest date it could under the subscription agreement and thus could not establish actual damages, as required by the statute. The judge also agreed with the defendants that the integration clause rendered the preinvestment statements immaterial. We conclude that the plaintiff may maintain a cause of action under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, as to each class of statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In a G. L. c. 93A claim, the existence of unfair or deceptive acts ordinarily must be determined from the circumstances of each claim. <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 615-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>616 (1983). Because a negligent misrepresentation may be so extreme or egregious as to constitute a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and because Marram\u2019s claim for negligent misrepresentation remains viable while the specific content is yet to be explored, the G. L. c. 93A claim as to preinvestment statements must be reinstated. See <em>Golber </em>v. <em>BayBank Valley Trust Co., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 261 (1999), quoting <em>Glickman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 235 (1985) (\u201cnegligent misrepresentation of fact the truth of which is reasonably capable of ascertainment is an unfair and deceptive act or practice under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 [a]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Marram also has properly alleged a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices for the postinvestment statements made by Kobrick. Marram avers that Kobrick made postinvestment misrepresentations about the offshore fund\u2019s investment portfolio and misleadingly offered to forward him a list of the offshore fund\u2019s holdings and an analysis of its underperformance, causing Marram to rescind the December 11, 2000, liquidation order. On the facts alleged, it cannot be said conclusively at this early stage of the proceedings that such statements are unactionable \u201cmere puffery,\u201d as the defendants claim. See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 616 (\u201cCourts have deliberately avoided setting down a clear definition of conduct constituting a violation of G. L. c. 93A\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Nor can we say as a matter of law that in no set of circumstances will the plaintiff be able to establish that the plan suffered actual damages as a result of the defendants\u2019 postinvestment actions. The defendants maintain, and the judge concluded, that the plan could not have sustained cognizable damages because the earliest it could have redeemed shares after notice was the quarter ended March 31, 2001 (that is, the last day of the first fiscal quarter after a one-year mandatory holding period) and the plaintiff requested redemption of the plan\u2019s shares on April 3, 2001.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But Marram did in fact request redemption on an earlier date, December 11, 2000. He alleges that further false information from Kobrick caused him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>rescind that instruction. Had he not done so, the plan\u2019s investment could have been liquidated earlier. In any event, just because the plan\u2019s investment may have been liquidated soon after the end of the March quarter does not mean that the plan suffered no actual damages from holding its 2,000 shares beyond the end of the March quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the judge\u2019s decision allowing the motion to dismiss and remand the matter to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">General Laws c. 110A, \u00a7 410 (a) (2), states in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who . . . offers or sells a security by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the buyer not knowing of the untruth or omission, and who does not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission, is liable to the person buying the security from him . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The defendants attached the offering memorandum and subscription agreement to their motion to dismiss, and the documents are included in the record.

Under Federal law, the limitations period for \u00a7 12(2) claims is one year from the time the buyer is on notice, but in no event more than three years. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b82-5\">General Laws c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(g), </em>states: \u201cAny condition, stipulation, or provision binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or any rule or order hereunder is void.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201cThe foregoing rule is obviously a specific application of the general doctrine, widely accepted, that, since the requirements of a statute enacted for the public good may not be nullified or varied by private contract, the donee of a private right created by such a statute does not have legal power to make an anticipatory waiver of such right.\u201d Annot., 61 A.L.R.2d 1308, 1308 n.1 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In light of our conclusion concerning waiver, we need not consider further the defendants\u2019 argument that, in acknowledging in writing that he had read and understood the integration clause, Marram wrongfully brought claims based on Kobrick\u2019s oral statments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The misrepresentation or omission need only be material; it need not be the cause of any loss.

In general, the statement or omission must concern a fact, and not an opinion or belief, <em>Craftmatic Sec.

App. Ct. 581, 587 (1996), quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552(1) (1977). Negligent misrepresentation differs from an action for fraud because \u201cliability for misrepresentation does not require a showing that the defendant even knew that the statements made were false or that the defendant actually intended to deceive the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Kitner </em>v.
