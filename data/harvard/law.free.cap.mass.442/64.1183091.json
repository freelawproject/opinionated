(Blue Cross), commenced an action in the Superior Court seeking to hold Blue Cross hable for allegedly defamatory statements made to White while he was employed by Blue Cross and subsequently communicated by White to prospective employers. A Superior Court judge allowed Blue Cross\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted because White conceded that Blue Cross had not communicated the defama<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tory statements to any third party. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). White appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion to consider whether we should recognize the doctrine of compelled self-publication defamation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We decline to do so, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>As alleged in his complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> White was previously employed as a \u201cquality initiatives manager\u201d for Blue Cross. In January, 2002, he attended a meeting with representatives of Milton Hospital and Winchester Hospital to plan a conference for a health care financial management association.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On March 19, 2002, White was called to a meeting with Patrick Cuniff, Blue Cross\u2019s director of human resources, and Allen Hinkle, its vice-president of innovation, quality, and cost. Hinkle informed White that a complaint had been received from Winchester Hospital to the effect that White, while in the presence of representatives from the other hospitals, had divulged the details of a confidential financial settlement between Blue Cross and Winchester Hospital. Hinkle told White he would be discharged immediately because of this conduct. White denied the accusation, and claims that he did not even know about any settlement between Blue Cross and Winchester Hospital, let alone divulge its details to anyone. Despite White\u2019s request that Blue Cross investigate the matter further, Cuniff did not do so, allegedly acting on the advice of a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">White subsequently applied for numerous jobs in health care management, to no avail. This was predictable, he alleges, because most prospective employers inquired about his reason for leaving Blue Cross. Because he refused \u201cto lie,\u201d he was \u201ccompelled,\u201d he says, to reveal that he was discharged \u201cfor allegedly disclosing confidential financial information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">As noted earlier, White does not claim that Blue Cross com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>municated the alleged defamatory statements (the accusation that he improperly divulged confidential information) to any third person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues that his own disclosure of Hinkle\u2019s accusation to prospective employers permits him to recover from Blue Cross for defamation because such disclosure should have been reasonably foreseeable by Blue Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>To prevail on a claim of defamation, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant was at fault for the publication of a false statement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> regarding the plaintiff, capable of damaging the plaintiff\u2019s reputation in the community, which either caused economic loss or is actionable without proof of economic loss. See <em>Ravnikar </em>v. <em>Bogojavlensky, </em>438 Mass. 627, 629-630 (2003). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 558 (1977). The publication element of defamation requires that the defendant communicate the defamatory statement to a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 629; <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>437 Mass. 505, 519 (2002). Some courts, however, have recognized compelled self-publication as an exception to that requirement. Self-publication claims have arisen most frequently in the employment context where, as here, a discharged employee is called on to explain to prospective employers the circumstances of his discharge. See 1 R.D. Sack, Libel, Slander, and Related Problems \u00a7 2.5.2, at 2-81 \u2014 2-82 (3d ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 2003). See also <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, </em>110 Cal. App. 3d 787, 795-796 (1980); <em>Theisen </em>v. <em>Covenant Med. Ctr., </em>636 N.W.2d 74, 83-85 (Iowa 2001); <em>Grist </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>16 Mich. App. 452, 483-484 (1969); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Ins. Soc\u2019y, </em>389 N.W.2d 876, 886-888 (Minn. 1986). The exception to the requirement of third-party publication is warranted, it is reasoned, because of \u201cthe strong causal link between the actions of the [employer] and the damage caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>republication.\u201d <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra </em>at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Recognition of the doctrine of compelled self-publication defamation is far from unanimous. Some State courts of last resort have rejected it. See <em>Gore </em>v. <em>Health-Tex, Inc., </em>567 So. 2d 1307, 1308-1309 (Ala. 1990); <em>Cweklinsky </em>v. <em>Mobil Chem. Co., </em>267 Conn. 210, 226 (2004); <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. in Haw., </em>100 Haw. 149, 171-173 (2002); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Baptist Memorial Hosp., </em>995 S.W.2d 569, 571-574 (Tenn. 1999); <em>Lunz </em>v. <em>Neuman, </em>48 Wash. 2d 26, 33 (1955).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is also the view of the Restatement. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 577 comment m (1977) (rejecting self-defamation except where plaintiff repeats statement but is unaware of defamatory nature).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the other hand, the highest courts of four States have adopted the doctrine. See <em>Theisen </em>v. <em>Covenant Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>636 N.W.2d 74, 83-84 (Iowa 2001); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, </em>389 N.W.2d 876, 886-887 (Minn. 1986)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; <em>Overcast </em>v. <em>Billings Mut. Ins. Co., </em>11 S.W.3d 62, 70 (Mo. 2000); <em>Hedgepeth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Coleman, </em>183 N.C. 309, 313-314 (1922).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After a Federal District Court predicted that the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine would adopt the doctrine, <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Mt. Desert Island Hosp., </em>910 F. Supp. 7, 11-13 (D. Me. 1995), the court declined to reach the question. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>752 A.2d 1189, 1193 (Me. 2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">White acknowledges that some appellate authority counsels against his argument, but invites us to adopt the doctrine of compelled self-publication where the employee claims that the employer knew or should have known that the defamatory statement was false. We conclude that, even in these circumstances, adoption of the doctrine is ill-advised. We recognize the conundrum faced by discharged employees who are required by prospective employers to explain the circumstances of their discharge. But as the leading authority on defamation has explained, compelled self-publication defamation in the employment context is \u201ctroubling conceptually.\u201d 1 R.D. Sack, <em>supra </em>at 2-84. \u201cIt is the termination and the reasons for it, not the communication, about which the plaintiff is actually complaining . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-85. Any harm arising from the employee\u2019s discharge is more appropriately dealt with under principles of employment law, and not under the law of libel and slander. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It is surely for that, among other reasons, that several courts have pointed to the doctrine\u2019s unpredictable effect on at-will employment. See <em>Cweklinsky </em>v. <em>Mobil Chem. Co., supra </em>at 225-226; <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. in Haw., supra </em>at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"A9q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted, recognition of the doctrine of self-defamation, when combined with the doctrine of defamation per se,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cgives employees who regret not having negotiated an employment contract a tort surrogate for it.\u201d <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Nova Biomedical Corp., </em>38 F.3d 909, 912 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1111 (1995). White could have demanded an employment contract with Blue Cross, but did not do so. The law should not permit him to secure indirectly what he failed to negotiate directly. And contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, <em>post </em>at 79, compelled self-defamation is not \u201ca natural extension of Massachusetts case law,\u201d but a dramatic departure from the principles governing employment at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">White no doubt would counter that the harm he has suffered is occasioned not by his discharge, but by his failure to obtain alternative employment, an entirely foreseeable consequence, he argues, of Blue Cross\u2019s failure to investigate the truthfulness of Winchester Hospital\u2019s charge against him. But recognition of the doctrine of self-publication would run counter to another important aspect of employer-employee relations, an employer\u2019s privilege to \u201cdisclose defamatory information concerning an employee when the publication is reasonably necessary to serve the employer\u2019s legitimate interest in the fitness of an employee to perform his or her job.\u201d <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 509 (1984). Communications between former and prospective employers concerning an employee are similarly privileged. See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>353 Mass. 115, 118-119 (1967). These privileges serve the important public purpose of promoting the free flow of information in the workplace, and are lost only when the employer recklessly makes \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable or excessive\u201d publications. <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., supra </em>at 509, 515 n.11. There is no such claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Recognition of the doctrine of compelled self-publication defamation brings with it the potential to stifle communication in the workplace. See <em>Cweklinsky </em>v. <em>Mobil Chem. Co., supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>220; <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. in Haw., supra </em>at 172; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Baptist Memorial Hosp., supra </em>at 573. Defamation litigation is costly. The expenditure of time, resources, and money required to defend a claim of compelled self-defamation inevitably will induce self-censorship by employers. See, e.g., <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 708 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 940 and 485 U.S. 962 (1988) (\u201ccosts of litigation may induce an unnecessary and undesirable self-censorship\u201d). The consequent harm to employees will be significant. Performance evaluations, which often inform discharge decisions, are a standard feature of modem management practices, and are widely endorsed as valuable to employees and employers alike. See, e.g., J. Katzenbach, Peak Performance: Aligning the Hearts and Minds of Your Employees 203-207 (2000). Beneath a dangling sword of defamation, employers are unlikely to provide employees with any reasons for employment decisions, including discharge, depriving employees of any opportunity to contest those decisions. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Baptist Memorial Hosp., supra </em>at 574. There is surely nothing more harmful to a discharged employee who must tell a prospective employer, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was fired. I was never given a reason.\u201d A person in White\u2019s position can at least counter a false accusation if he is informed of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Blue Cross was well within its rights to give White any reason, a false reason, or no reason at all for his termination. <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 305 (1982) (\u201can employer has no duty to give any reason at the time of discharging an employee at will\u201d). But at-will employees, no less than others, benefit immensely from open communications concerning their performance, prospects for advancement, and related matters, even if discharge results.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">White argues that the \u201ccompulsion\u201d element of the doctrine, that White was actually compelled to communicate the false information and that such compulsion was foreseeable to Blue Cross, will curtail any explosion of defamation litigation. We are not so sanguine. It is all but inevitable that a discharged employee will be called on to explain the circumstances of his discharge to prospective employers. And discharged employees will inevitably feel compelled to describe negative performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>evaluations as reckless or false, whether communicated directly at the time of discharge, or contained in the employee\u2019s personnel file. The calculation of damages for self-defamation will also be unpredictable, and entirely within the control of the discharged employee. See, e.g., <em>Olivieri </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>122 F.3d 406, 409 (7th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1110 (1998) (noting that employee retains control over publication and may \u201cblurt out\u201d to multiple prospective employers \u201cground of his discharge in the most lurid terms\u201d to increase damages). Recognition of the doctrine also creates a perverse incentive for a plaintiff not to mitigate damages. See <em>Cweklinsky </em>v. <em>Mobil Chem. Co., </em>267 Conn. 210, 223-224 (2004); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Baptist Memorial Hosp., 995 </em>S.W.2d 569, 574 (Tenn. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">There are, in addition, pragmatic reasons why the doctrine should be rejected. The search for future employment may extend over a considerable period. Even a discharged employee who secures new employment may later move to a new position, and will be called on to explain once more the circumstances of an earlier discharge. If the discharged employee is free to commence an action any time he claims to be harmed from self-disclosure of the \u201cdefamation,\u201d procedural rules, such as the statute of limitations become meaningless. See 1 R.D. Sack, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.5.2, at 2-84 (compelled self-publication permits discharged employees \u201cto control the manner and timing of the defamation as a litigation tactic\u201d and \u201ccould also allow the plaintiffs effectively to void the statute of limitations\u201d). As the dissent frankly notes, <em>post </em>at 73 n.1, the discharged employee may publish and republish the alleged defamatory statement \u201cfor the remainder of his professional life.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We are mindful of the harm White may have suffered. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>reason for Ms discharge, if false, may have damaged the professional career of an innocent person. But where there was no legal obligation on Blue Cross to investigate Winchester Hospital\u2019s accusation about WMte, and no obligation on Blue Cross so much as to inform White of the accusation, <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., supra </em>at 305, Blue Cross cannot reasonably be characterized as a \u201cwrongdoer.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 73. WMte is in any event not bereft of remedies to compensate for any harm he has suffered. He may, for example, bring an action against Winchester Hospital for defamation, intentional interference with advantageous relations, or both. See, e.g., <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 635, 652 (2003). If defamation law is to provide a remedy for WMte, the correct party to be charged with culpability must be, as it always has been, the originator of the defamatory statement communicated to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The defamation doctrine at issue is variously called \u201ccompelled self-publication,\u201d see, e.g., <em>Cweklinsky </em>v. <em>Mobil Chem.

Because in those cases there was evidence that the defendant knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>precisely the third party who would (and did) read the defamatory statement in a letter intended for the plaintiff, the defendant could not defend on the ground that the letter was addressed to the plaintiff alone.

The court, citing public policy concerns, states that permitting compelled self-defamation to meet the \u201cpublication\u201d element of defamation would be \u201cill advised.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 68. In my view, it is at least as ill advised to allow employers, by their own reckless actions or omissions, to put employees in situations such as the one confronted by the plaintiff. The defendant here, by allegedly reckless indifference, caused foreseeable harm to the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims that the defendant had no basis for believing the accusation that was made against him, and that the defendant refused to make any effort to resolve the matter by investigation or otherwise prior to terminating Ms employment. The court expresses numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>pus policy concerns, some wholly legitimate, about protecting employers and workplace communication. But in weighing the public policy interests in such a situation, where there is an absence of legislative direction on the subject, we should be at least as concerned with protecting the victim as we are with protecting the wrongdoer. Contrary to the court\u2019s conclusion today, the doctrine of compelled self-defamation is not the innovation it has been characterized to be, does not threaten at-will employment, and is not incompatible with the other principles of employment law cited. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">If we accept as true the allegations in the complaint, see <em>Eyal </em>v. <em>Helen Broadcasting Corp., </em>411 Mass. 426, 429 (1991), the defendant received a false accusation from a customer, explicitly refused to investigate that accusation, repeated it to the plaintiff as the reason for firing him, and then suggested that the plaintiff lie about that reason during subsequent job interviews. The plaintiff then was faced with three equally untenable alternatives while interviewing with prospective employers. He could follow the defendant\u2019s advice and lie, he could refuse to answer questions regarding his termination, or he could answer those questions openly, thereby republishing a defamatory statement. The first option, lying, is not an acceptable alternative to republication, see <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Mt. Desert Island Hosp., </em>910 F. Supp. 7, 12 n.3 (D. Me. 1995), and the plaintiff should not be penalized for refusing to do so. The other two options, in the real-world context of the modem job market, are not practical because they will simply result in the plaintiff\u2019s failing to find subsequent employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">As the court acknowledges, the plaintiff\u2019s claim makes out a prima facie case for defamation, except for the publication element. See <em>Ravnikar </em>v. <em>Bogojavlensky, </em>438 Mass. 627, 629-630 (2003). For at least fifty years, courts facing similar fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>patterns have allowed compelled self-defamation to satisfy this element, based on the simple and unremarkable tort law concept of foreseeability. See, e.g., <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>954 F. Supp. 744, 755-756 (D. Vt. 1997); <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Mt. Desert Island Hosp., supra </em>at 11; <em>Chrzanowski </em>v. <em>Lichtman, </em>884 F. Supp. 751, 755 (W.D.N.Y. 1995); <em>Odom </em>v. <em>Fairbanks Memorial Hosp., 999 </em>P.2d 123, 130-131 (Alaska 2000); <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, </em>110 Cal. App. 3d 787, 797 (1980); <em>Colonial Stores Inc. </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>73 Ga. App. 839, 840-841 (1946); <em>Theisen </em>v. <em>Covenant Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>636 N.W.2d 74, 83 (Iowa 2001); <em>Grist </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>16 Mich. App. 452, 484 (1969); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, </em>389 N.W.2d 876, 886-888 (Minn. 1986); <em>Overcast </em>v. <em>Billings Mut. Ins. Co., </em>11 S.W.3d 62, 70 (Mo. 2000); <em>Chasewood Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Rico, </em>696 S.W.2d 439, 444 (Tex. Ct. App. 1985). See also <em>Rohan </em>v. <em>Networks Presentation, LLC, </em>175 F. Supp. 2d 806, 816 (D. Md. 2001); <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Electronic Data Sys. Corp., </em>799 F. Supp. 1086, 1090-1092 (D. Kan. 1992); <em>Hedgepeth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>183 N.C. 309, 313-314 (1922). Where circumstances are such that the defendant could have foreseen that the plaintiff would be forced to repeat a defamatory statement, these courts have concluded that the publication requirement of defamation may be met by the plaintiff\u2019s repetition of that statement, because of \u201cthe strong causal link between the actions of the [defendant] and the damage caused by the republication.\u201d <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra </em>at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Although the Restatement endorses self-defamation only where the plaintiff is \u201cwithout an awareness\u201d of the republished statement\u2019s defamatory nature, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 577 comment m (1977), a careful reading of that section reveals that it is compatible with the concept of compelled self-defamation as presented in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Comment m is primarily concerned not with employment situations, but with letters sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>by a defendant to a plaintiff, which the plaintiff then shows to a third person. The comment is accompanied by illustrative situations. In these, a letter is received by a blind plaintiff, or is written in a language the plaintiff cannot read, so that the plaintiff is \u201cunaware\u201d of the defamatory nature of the letter at the time he inevitably shows it to a third person who is able to read it or translate its contents. In these cases, the Restatement declares that the defamatory utterance is \u201cpublished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although these hypothetical plaintiffs are characterized as being \u201cunaware,\u201d one could just as easily describe them as being \u201ccompelled\u201d to show the letters to a third person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also W.L. Prosser &amp; W.P. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 113 at 802 (5th ed. 1984) (defendant can be liable for plaintiff\u2019s republication of defamatory matter where \u201cbecause of the plaintiff\u2019s blindness or immaturity, or because of some necessity [the plaintiff] was under to communicate the matter to others, it was reasonably to be anticipated that he would do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">While this court has not previously considered the narrow question whether compelled self-defamation satisfies the \u201cpublication\u201d element of defamation, the concept of holding the original utterer of a defamatory statement liable for foreseeable republications is established here. See <em>Bander </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass 337, 347-348 (1943) (defamatory contents of sealed letter addressed to plaintiff could be considered published where defendant had \u201cgood reason to believe\u201d letter would be opened and read by plaintiff\u2019s manager); <em>Rumney </em>v. <em>Worthley, </em>186 Mass. 144, 145 (1904) (defamatory letter addressed to plaintiff could constitute publication if defendant \u201chad good reason to believe\u201d that plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>daughter would open and read letter in plaintiff\u2019s absence). The <em>Bander </em>and <em>Rumney </em>cases were cited with approval by <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra </em>at 796-797, a frequently cited case on the subject of compelled self-defamation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, long before these cases were decided, this court stated that a defamation defendant was responsible for the \u201cnatural and probable publicity\u201d subsequent to his original publication. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>6 Cush. 71, 74 (1850).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">As to the court\u2019s public policy rationale, permitting compelled self-defamation to meet the \u201cpublication\u201d requirement of defamation is not incompatible with at-will employment. An employer is entitled to terminate an employee for any reason, or no reason, <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 305 (1982), provided public policy is not violated thereby. See <em>Smith-Pfeffer </em>v. <em>Superintendent of the Walter E. Fernald State Sch., </em>404 Mass. 145, 149-150 (1989). As the court points out, even giving a false reason does not violate public policy. <em>Ante </em>at 70. See <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>402 Mass. 555, 557 (1988), citing <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., supra </em>at 306. But a false reason and a defamatory reason are not the same thing. Nothing in the doctrine of at-will employment requires that an employer, in the context of discharging an employee, be permitted to speak knowingly or recklessly in a manner that defames the employee. <em>Van-Go Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>971 F. Supp. 90, 103 (E.D.N.Y. 1997), quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Guarinello, </em>165 Misc. 2d 720, 725 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995) (\u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>license to fixe at will does not carry with it permission to poison with immunity\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Permitting compelled self-defamation to satisfy the publication element of defamation will not curtail the employer\u2019s at-will rights. Vindication of the policies underlying employers\u2019 rights to terminate at-will employees may require that employers be given almost unlimited discretion to discharge. However, it does not require that employers also be permitted to defame the discharged employee with impunity. Both the employer and the employee have rights, and our system of justice has not become so effete that it cannot identify and enforce the rights of each class.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Moreover, the employer\u2019s conditional privilege is not abrogated by, nor is it inconsistent with, recognition of the concept of compelled self-defamation. The two concepts manage to coexist in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Herberholt </em>v. <em>dePaul Community Health Ctr., </em>625 S.W.2d 617, 624-625 (Mo. 1982) (accepting doctrine of compelled self-defamation <em>[Overcast </em>v. <em>Billings Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 70] but dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim because of employer\u2019s privilege). See <em>Van-Go Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City Bd. of Educ., supra </em>at 105-106 (same). See also <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Electronic Data Sys. Corp., supra </em>at 1091 (same). In Massachusetts, an employer has a \u201cconditional privilege to publish defamatory material if the publication is reasonably necessary to the protection or furtherance of a legitimate business interest.\u201d <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 512-513 (1984). This privilege is abused, and thus lost, when the employer utters a defamatory statement knowing it is not true, or with reckless disregard as to its truth. <em>Id. </em>at 514.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, in order to recover for defamation against an employer, an employee must show that the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>at issue was made with at least reckless disregard as to its truth. This differs from the ordinary defamation standard in which a private individual may recover by showing that the publisher was merely negligent in the publication of the falsehood. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 858 (1975). Thus there is established a compromise between the employer\u2019s legitimate interest in open communication regarding its employees and the employee\u2019s interest in protecting his or her reputation. <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., supra </em>at 513, citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 594 comment e, at 265 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">If Blue Cross had spoken directly with a prospective employer of White instead of to White himself, the employer\u2019s conditional privilege would have applied unless Blue Cross spoke falsely intentionally or recklessly. <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., supra. </em>See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>353 Mass. 115, 118-119 (1967). The present case is no different. If Blue Cross were only negligent when it initially uttered the statement in question, White would have no claim. However, if White can show that Blue Cross had knowledge of the statement\u2019s falsity or acted with reckless disregard as to its truth, then Blue Cross would have abused and lost its privilege. Whether a conditional privilege is abused is a question for the jury, <em>id. </em>at 514, and thus in the present case the allegation of abuse ought to be left for another day. The court, however, prevents any further consideration of the matter by concluding that the mere existence of the employer\u2019s conditional privilege prevents White from bringing his claim in the first place. By the court\u2019s logic, the existence of any privilege would \u201crun counter\u201d to any defamation claim, whether it involves self-publication or otherwise. <em>Ante </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The court warns of the dangers of a culture of \u201cself-censorship,\u201d but a culture of unremedied libel and slander is no more desirable from a public policy standpoint, and no more consistent with the promotion of open communication. <em>Ante </em>at 70. The court can think of \u201cnothing more harmful\u201d to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>hypothetical job seeker than having to announce, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was fired.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 70. The court should be more imaginative. I am extremely skeptical that statements such as, \u201cI was fired for revealing confidential information,\u201d or even, \u201cI was accused of revealing confidential information,\u201d are somehow more likely to lead to new employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The court sympathetically announces that the plaintiff has remedies against the alleged originator of the defamatory remark, i.e., Winchester Hospital or its representative. However, in many self-defamation cases the defamatory statement originates with the employer, and a claim against some other party will not be available. See, e.g., <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, </em>110 Cal. App. 3d 787, 792 (1980); <em>Colonial Stores Inc. </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>73 Ga. App. 839, 840-841 (1946); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, </em>389 N.W.2d 876, 881 (Minn. (1986). The court understandably is concerned also that a plaintiff may distort an original oral statement while repeating it. Where the defamatory statement is expressed orally, the possibility of distortion is present, but this is simply a factual matter for resolution by the fact finder. These considerations do not persuade me that allowing a former employee to meet the \u201cpublication\u201d element of defamation with his own forced repetition of the defendant\u2019s statements is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">This case presents an issue ultimately best left to the Legislature. However, in my view, compelled self-defamation is a doctrine grounded in well-recognized tort principles. It is a natural extension of Massachusetts case law, and there is no urgent or overwhelming public policy rationale counselling against it. Therefore, in the absence of legislative direction explicitly barring compelled self-defamation from satisfying the publication element in defamation claims, the plaintiff should be allowed to proceed with this action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\">It has been suggested that the plaintiff simply can tell the truth and then dispute the defamatory remark by explaining its context. The idea that such an explanation would not often fatally harm the plaintiff\u2019s job prospects, especially in a competitive employment market, is wholly contrary to common sense and misses the point. If a defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff is false, he should not be burdened with the task of explaining its context for the remainder of his professional life.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The court characterizes my citation to the Restatement as seeking to dispense with the \u201clong-established\u201d requirement that the defendant must publish the defamatory statement to a third party. <em>Ante </em>at 67 n.6. On the contrary, I cite Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 577 comment m ,(1977) to demonstrate that this requirement is paired with a \u201clong-established\u201d exception, whereby the publication requirement of defamation may be met by the actions of the plaintiff. This exception, as the court recognizes, includes sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tians in which the plaintiff \u201cmust disclose [a defamatory statement] to a third party,\u201d and therefore it is reasonable to consider it in the context of this case. <em>Ante </em>at 67 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The Restatement also contemplates that the original utterer of a defamatory statement may be responsible for foreseeable republications. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 577 comment k (publication element of defamation can be met where \u201ca reasonable person would recognize that an act creates an unreasonable risk that the defamatory matter will be communicated to a third person\u201d). See also <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 576 (\u201cThe publication of a libel or slander is a legal cause of any special harm resulting from its repetition by a third person if . . . the repetition was reasonably to be expected\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\"><em>McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, </em>110 Cal.

The <em>Wilcox </em>case was recently cited by <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., 954 F. Supp. 744, 755 </em>(D.

Co., </em>313 Mass. 337 (1943); <em>Rumney </em>v. <em>Worthley, </em>186 Mass. 144 (1904); and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>6 Cush. 71 (1850), and to assert that these cases did not involve compelled self-defamation. <em>Ante </em>at 71 n. 11.1 do not suggest that they did. I cite these cases merely to point out that one who utters a defamatory statement may be liable for the republication of that statement by another if such republication was foreseeable, and to demonstrate that concepts akin to compelled self-defamation are not unknown to Massachusetts jurisprudence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In the context of employment, a defamatory remark uttered with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard as to its truth is to be distinguished from a defamatory remark uttered with mere negligence, which is protected by the employer\u2019s conditional privilege.

Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 513-515 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The court cites <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs.
