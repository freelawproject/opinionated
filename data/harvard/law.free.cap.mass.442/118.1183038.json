L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, the school zone statute. Tyrone Bell and Wade Crawford were charged in complaints filed in the Boston Municipal Court with distribution of a class B substance (crack cocaine) in violatian of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A, and distribution of the substance within 1,000 feet of ABCD University High School, in violation of the school zone statute. Before trial, the Commonwealth sought to preclude defense counsel from referencing, in opening statements, certain regulations promulgated by the Department of Education (department) that define a \u201csecondary school\u201d and impose certain requirements on secondary schools. Defense counsel sought to use the regulations to establish that ABCD University High School is not a secondary school under the school zone statute. After proceedings described below, the Commonwealth filed a petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking \u201ca supervisory order\u201d precluding \u201cthe [judges] of the Boston Municipal Court from admitting into evidence regulations promulgated by the [department] that define \u2018secondary school,\u2019 and any expert testimony about said regulations, in school zone cases.\u201d A single justice of this court reserved and reported the case, without decision, to the full court. We conclude that the Commonwealth is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AXm\">A private, nonprofit, incorporated human services agency, Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), operates ABCD University High School, in collaboration with the Boston Public Schools, as a \u201csatellite\u201d alternative education program. The school was established to solve a student capacity problem, to leverage Federal funding, and to provide a cost-effective, alternative education for students who would \u201chistorically drop out of school.\u201d ABCD University High School offers classes for grades nine through twelve for \u201cat-risk\u201d students at Boston public high schools and some students from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. ABCD University High School follows a Boston public school calendar so that its students may fulfil Boston public school graduation requirements. There are approximately one hundred students at ABCD University High School. The school is open from 8:10 a.m. to 1:19 p.m. The students attending ABCD University High School remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>registered at their \u201chome\u201d high schools, and receive diplomas from their \u201chome\u201d high schools. While ABCD University High School offers students some after-school activities, its students, who have not been expelled from their \u201chome\u201d schools, may seek permission to participate in sports programs at their \u201csending\u201d schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We next outline the complicated proceedings that led to this petition. After the defendants\u2019 arraignments, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine, seeking to preclude counsel for the defendant Bell<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from referencing in her opening statement regulations promulgated by the department that define a \u201csecondary school\u201d and list requirements that secondary schools must meet. One regulation defines a \u201c[secondary school\u201d as \u201cany school, be it public or private, that has been designated or approved as a secondary school by the school committee.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 33.03 (1993). Other regulations impose requirements on secondary schools, including a requirement that the school year \u201cincludes at least 185 school days,\u201d see 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.03(2) (1998), and a requirement \u201cthat every secondary school student is scheduled to receive a minimum of 990 hours per school year of structured learning time,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> see 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 27.04(2) (1998). A Boston Municipal Court judge continued Bell\u2019s case without an express ruling on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. The Commonwealth moved to report questions of law to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979), and to stay the proceedings. The judge denied the motion to report, and he again continued the case. After considering various other mo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>lions and memoranda filed by both parties,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this judge entered an order referring the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to the trial judge, and denying (for a second time) the motion to report. Concerning the motion in limine, the judge stated that, assuming he had previously made any preliminary rulings, such rulings were \u201crevoked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On the day scheduled for trial, the Commonwealth moved to stay the proceedings in order \u201cto seek further appellate action pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.\u201d A different Boston Municipal Court judge held a hearing on outstanding pretrial matters, including the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to stay, which, as best we can determine from the audible portion of the hearing, pertained to the issue of what constitutes a \u201csecondary school\u201d under the school zone statute. The prosecutor informed the judge that prior rulings concerning the definition of, and evidence pertaining to, \u201csecondary school,\u201d had been \u201cwithdrawn,\u201d and that the parties were \u201cstarting from scratch.\u201d The prosecutor argued that the department\u2019s regulations should not be admitted in evidence, and that the judge should not read the regulations into the record or state them in his charge to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After denying the prosecutor\u2019s request to report the case to the Appeals Court, the judge allowed a continuance on the cases to enable both defendants to procure a witness from the department to testify \u201cas to the regulations.\u201d The judge noted that this action would obviate the need for the Commonwealth to seek relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and that the Commonwealth would have \u201cno standing to object to [the] continuance\u201d allowed. The judge left the issues concerning the meaning of the term \u201csecondary school,\u201d as well as other pretrial motions, for the trial judge. Trial was rescheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Commonwealth next sought, in the county court, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>supervisory order to stay the trial to enable it to pursue its petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. A single justice entered a stay, and the Commonwealth filed its petition. The single justice then made his reservation and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">1. The defendants argue that we should not exercise our power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to review the matter because (1) there is no actual ruling or order to review; (2) evidentiary rulings ordinarily are not subject to review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3; and (3) we have never granted relief to the Commonwealth from a <em>prospective </em>evidentiary ruling. Each of these arguments is technically correct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yelle, </em>390 Mass. 678, 687 (1984). We conclude, nonetheless, that it is appropriate to exercise our general superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We arrive at this conclusion for several reasons. First, the issue raised by the Commonwealth\u2019s petition is not solely evidentiary. Rather, the petition presents the question how the trial judge should instruct the jury on an essential element of the offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzales, 33 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 728, 730 (1992) (\u201cin a prosecution pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, the Commonwealth is required to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the school is one of the types enumerated in the statute\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellerbe, </em>430 Mass. 769, 772 (2000), and cases cited. This issue cannot be avoided and, without immediate intervention, will arise soon again in these cases (and in others). The defendant Bell acknowledges as much in a pretrial memorandum. Additionally, the judge refused to report the case to the Appeals Court, and fashioned his ruling allowing a continuance, to prevent the Commonwealth from seeking relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The Commonwealth has shown that it has no other means of effective appellate review. The appeal thus represents one of those most exceptional occasions appropriate for us to act under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, \u201cto correct and prevent errors and abuses.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yelle, supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>437 Mass. 276, 281 n.2 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 962 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">2. As had been said, in a prosecution under the school zone statute, the Commonwealth must prove that the school is one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the types enumerated in the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellerbe, supra. </em>The school zone statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adt\">\u201cAny person who violates [G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A] <em>while in or on, or within one thousand feet of the real property comprising a </em>public or private accredited preschool, accredited headstart facility, elementary, vocational, or <em>secondary school </em>whether or not in session, or within one hundred feet of a public park or playground shall be punished by a term of imprisonment in the [Sjtate prison for not less than two and one-half nor more than fifteen years or by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not less than two nor more than two and one-half years. No sentence imposed under the provisions of this section shall be for less than a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of two years. A fine of not less than one thousand nor more than ten thousand dollars may be imposed but not in lieu of the mandatory minimum two year term of imprisonment as established herein. In accordance with the provisions of [G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 8A] such sentence shall begin from and after the expiration of the sentence for violation of [G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32AJ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuW\">\u201cLack of knowledge of school boundaries shall not be a defense to any person who violates the provisions of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmV\">G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 321. The statute does not define the term \u201csecondary school.\u201d Because the defendants sought to have the judge instruct the jury on the definition of a \u201csecondary school\u201d using only the department\u2019s regulations, to the exclusion of other definitions, the issue requires that we ascertain the legal definition of the term \u201csecondary school.\u201d The Commonwealth has not argued that the defendants cannot challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s proof that the school was included in the school zone statute. That the prosecutor may have stipulated to the admissibility of certain evidence is not in any sense a waiver of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the department\u2019s regulatians concerning secondary schools cannot serve as the sole legal definition of a secondary school under the school zone statute. The stipulations, even if made (what is apparent from the record is that certain stipulations were made as to authentic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ity of certain documents, not as to admissibility), are immaterial to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We reject the defendants\u2019 argument that the department\u2019s regulations are controlling as to the definition of the term \u201csecondary school\u201d that will be provided to the jury. \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). \u201cWe derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dictionary definitions of the term \u201csecondary school\u201d are not vague and include \u201ca school more advanced in grade than an elementary school and offering general, technical, vocational, or college-preparatory courses,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2051 (1993); \u201ca school intermediate between elementary school and college and usually] offering general, technical, vocational, or college-preparatory courses,\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1060 (1989); \u201c[a] school that is intermediate in level between elementary school and college and that usually offers general, technical, vocational, or college-preparatory curricula,\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 1630 (3d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">While we may look to definitions of the term \u201csecondary school\u201d used in other legal contexts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., supra, </em>doing so in this case, by resorting solely to the department\u2019s regulations, would be inconsistent with the purpose of the school zone statute. In contrast to the dictionary definitions quoted above, the department\u2019s regulations concerning what constitutes a \u201csecondary school\u201d are restrictive and, by reason of their accreditation requirement (by the school committee), would exclude ABCD University High School as a qualifying school under the school zone statute. See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 33.03. This would, in effect, add a qualification to the term \u201csecondary school\u201d that is not in the statute itself. Such an exclusion would also clearly negate the intent of the Legislature to provide drug-free school zones, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 651 n.7 (1992) (Governor Michael S. Dukakis \u201cindicated that he was propos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ing the legislation that ultimately became G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, in order to \u2018establish a 1,000 feet drug-free school zone .... [in order to make] every school and surrounding community safe from the destructive impact of drug trafficking and drug abuse\u2019 \u201d). The broad purpose of the school zone statute, which is expressed in the statute\u2019s language and legislative history, as well as in decisional law, should not be unnecessarily limited. By its terms, the school zone statute applies to schools whether \u201cpublic or private,\u201d \u201cwhether or not [the school is] in session,\u201d and whether the drug dealer has knowledge of the school boundaries, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. 224, 229 (1992). Moreover, since the enactment of the school zone statute, see St. 1989, c. 227, \u00a7 2, the Legislature has expanded the zone of safety to include other places where children would likely be present, see St. 1993, c. 335 (expanding the zone of safety to \u201cwithin one hundred feet of a public park or playground\u201d) and St. 1998, c. 194, \u00a7 146 (expanding protection to an \u201caccredited preschool [and] accredited head-start facility\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Decisional law has determined that it matters not whether the drug dealer has knowledge of the location and existence of a qualifying school, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klusman, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1999), quoting <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>State, </em>603 N.E.2d 1376, 1380 (Ind. Ct. App. 1992) (\u201cAlthough some schools are not clearly recognizable as such from all points within the 1000 foot radius, the dealers bear the burden of ascertaining where schools are located and removing their operations from those areas or face enhanced penalties\u201d). As correctly noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klusman, supra, </em>quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Baez, </em>238 N.J. Super. 93, 97 (1990), a violation of the school zone statute \u201chas nothing to do with the nature of the school[].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The department\u2019s regulations are irrelevant. The fact that a particular educational facility might not be in technical compli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>anee with all of the educational requirements imposed on an accredited \u201csecondary school\u201d does not mean that the facility is not a \u201csecondary school,\u201d nor would that technical noncompliance make it any less compelling that drug dealers be kept away from that facility\u2019s students. At trial, the judge should not admit the department\u2019s regulations in evidence, permit expert testimony about them, or use the regulations to define \u201csecondary school\u201d in the charge to the jury. The jury charge should employ one or more of the dictionary definitions quoted above and advise the jury that they would be warranted in finding ABCD University High School a \u201csecondary school\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">3. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition inappropriately seeks relief in all school zone cases pending in the Boston Municipal Court. We confine our decision to the defendants\u2019 cases (if tried separately or together). As so limited, the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is allowed with the direction that the trial judge should not admit the department\u2019s regulations in evidence and should not allow any expert to testify as to the meaning of the department\u2019s regulations. The judgment shall also provide that a trial judge may not use the department\u2019s regulations to fashion a definition of \u201csecondary school\u201d in the charge to the jury, but rather should instruct the jury as indicated above. The stay entered by the single justice is vacated, and the case is remanded for entry of an appropriate judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">This matter derived from proceedings in Bell\u2019s case, but pertains also to Crawford\u2019s case.

He argued that the department\u2019s definition and regulations \u201cshould take precedence over common law and dictionary definitions.\u201d He submitted evidence to show that ABCD University High School did not satisfy the department\u2019s regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The transcript belies the defendants\u2019 contention that the only issue before the judge was whether they could refer to the department\u2019s regulations in their opening statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The fact that the Legislature was aware that various schools \u201cwere tightly regulated [by] the [department] and by [Fjederal and [S]tote statute[s]\u201d is no indication that the Legislature intended that the department\u2019s regulations should be applied to the school zone statute.
