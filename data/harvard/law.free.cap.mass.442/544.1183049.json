L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, to issue prebirth judgments of parentage and to order the issuance of a prebirth rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ord of birth, see <em>Culliton </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr., </em>435 Mass. 285 (2001), where neither the genetic parents nor the gestational carrier with whom they contracted to bear a child reside in Massachusetts, but where the contract specifies that the birth occur at a Massachusetts hospital? A judge in the Probate and Family Court answered that question in the negative, and dismissed the genetic parents\u2019 (plaintiffs) uncontested equity action for a declaration of paternity and maternity and for a prebirth order. She then reported her decision to the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996). On June 22, 2004, a single justice of the Appeals Court enjoined the defendant Berkshire Health Systems, Inc., corporate owner of Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield (hospital), from issuing any birth certificate for a child bom of the gestational carrier, or filing the same with the Commissioner of Public Health. See G. L. c. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, 3A. On June 25, 2004, we transferred the matter here on our own motion. We conclude that, in the circumstances here, the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief they seek: judgments of paternity and maternity and a prebirth order establishing their legal parentage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The plaintiffs, who are married, reside in Connecticut. The gestational carrier and her husband, both nominal defendants, reside in New York. The hospital, the other nominal defendant, is a hcensed Massachusetts hospital whose statutory duties include, among others, reporting information concerning births at the hospital to the city or town clerk where the birth occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In April, 2003, the plaintiffs, the gestational carrier, and the gestational carrier\u2019s husband entered into a fifteen-page \u201cContract Between a Genetic Father, a Genetic Mother, a Gestational Carrier and Her Husband\u201d (gestational carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>agreement). The parties represented that each had been advised by counsel of their choice prior to entering into the agreement. Among other things, the gestational carrier agreement provided that any child resulting from the agreement would be delivered at the hospital, if at all possible,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that in any event the gestational carrier would \u201ctake all reasonable steps to give birth to any child carried pursuant to this Agreement at a Hospital located in the State of Massachusetts.\u201d It is undisputed that the parties chose Massachusetts as the site of the birth in part to facilitate obtaining a prebirth order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The parties\u2019 preference for Massachusetts was further expressed in the following choice of law provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cThe Gestational Carrier and [her] husband agree that they are entering into this Agreement with the intention that in accordance with the laws of the State of Massachusetts, they will take whatever steps are necessary to have the Genetic Father and the Genetic Mother named as the natural, legal and genetic parents, to have the Genetic Father and the Genetic Mother named as the father and mother, respectively, of [the] child on the child\u2019s birth certificate, and to permit the Genetic Father and the Genetic Mother to obtain physical custody of any child born as the result of this Agreement. . . . The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>further agree that this Agreement shall be governed by Massachusetts law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Approximately six months after the parties entered into the gestational carrier agreement, the gestational carrier was successfully implanted with an embryo produced from the male plaintiff\u2019s sperm and the female plaintiff\u2019s egg. The implantation took place in Connecticut. The gestational carrier received at least some prenatal care at the hospital. At oral argument on June 30, 2004, counsel informed the court that an induced delivery was planned at the hospital the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">2. <em>Jurisdiction. </em>In her report, the Probate and Family Court judge stated that \u201c[t]he primary question presented is whether, under the circumstances of this case, this Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief requested?\u201d The Probate and Family Court\u2019s jurisdiction over this case, however, is clear. First, as a general matter, the Probate and Family Court has subject matter jurisdiction in questions of law and equity concerning parentage. See, e.g., G. L. c. 209C; G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6. More specifically, as we held in <em>Culliton </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr., </em>435 Mass. 285 (2001), a Probate and Family Court judge has authority pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, to consider a request for a prebirth order where, as here, \u201c(a) the plaintiffs are the sole genetic sources of the [child]; (b) the gestational carrier agrees with the orders sought; (c) no one, including the hospital, has contested the complaint or petition; and (d) by filing the complaint and stipulation for judgment the plaintiffs agree that they have waived any contradictory provisions in the [gestational carrier] contract (assuming those provisions could be enforced in the first place).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291-292. That the gestational carrier, her husband, and the plaintiffs all reside outside of Massachusetts does not bar the Probate and Family Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, because the equity statute poses no residency requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cf. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 5 (in proceeding for divorce, plaintiff must be domiciled in Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>sachusetts); G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 3 (for probate of will, decedent must have been inhabitant or resident of respective county at time of death).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Second, personal jurisdiction is also proper. The Probate and Family Court, of course, has personal jurisdiction over the hospital, a Massachusetts corporation. See G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 2. Indeed, it is doubtful that any other State could grant the plaintiffs the injunction they seek requiring the hospital to report certain information about the child\u2019s parentage to Massachusetts officials. The Probate and Family Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over the gestational carrier and her husband derives from their stipulation for entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 79 (1998) paraphrasing in parenthetical to <em>Precision Etchings &amp; Findings, Inc. </em>v. <em>LGP Gem, Ltd., </em>953 F.2d 21, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1992) (\u201cthe defense of lack of personal jurisdiction . . . may be waived by express submission, conduct, or failure to assert the defense\u201d). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). In short, the jurisdictional issues here are not problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">3. <em>Choice of law. </em>The driving issue in this case, rather, concerns choice of law. The interested couples come from different States; the chosen hospital from yet a third. None of the individual parties resides in the Commonwealth, yet they have contracted that Massachusetts law govern the gestational carrier agreement and, by extension, the petition for judgments of parentage and for a prebirth order. We must consider whether to respect their choice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The gestational carrier agreement implicates the policies of multiple States in important questions of individual safety, health, and general welfare. Complicating matters is the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>that the laws of Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts, the three States that potentially could govern the agreement, are not in accord. In Connecticut, where the genetic parents reside, gestational carrier agreements are not expressly prohibited by, and perhaps may be contemplated by, the recently amended statute governing the issuance of birth certificates. See Conn. Gen. Stat. c. 93, \u00a7 7-48a, 2004 Conn. Legis Serv. P.A. 04-255 (West 2004) (\u201cOn and after January 1, 2002, each birth certificate shall contain the name of the birth mother, except by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction . . .\u201d). The gestational carrier resides in New York, a State that has expressed a strong public policy against all gestational carrier agreements. See N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 122 (McKinney 1999) (\u201cSurrogate parenting contracts are hereby declared contrary to the public policy of this state, and are void and unenforceable\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Massachusetts, as we have noted, recognizes gestational carrier agreements in some circumstances. See <em>Culliton </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr., </em>supra; <em>R.R. </em>v. <em>M.H., </em>426 Mass. 501 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In light of these differing State policies and the parties\u2019 declared intent to follow Massachusetts law, we look to our established \u201cfunctional\u201d choice of law principles and to the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, with which those principles generally are in accord.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Bushkin Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>393 Mass. 622, 631-632 (1985). As a rule, \u201c[wjhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the parties have expressed a specific intent as to the governing law, Massachusetts courts will uphold the parties\u2019 choice as long as the result is not contrary to public policy.\u201d <em>Steranko </em>v. <em>Inforex, Inc., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 260 (1977), citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187 (1971).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Watsco, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 672, 674 (1982) (\u201cMassachusetts law has recognized, within reason, the right of the parties to a transaction to select the law governing their relationship\u201d). The Restatement similarly presumes that the law the parties have chosen applies, unless \u201c(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties\u2019 choice, or (b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state\u201d and is the State whose law would apply under \u00a7 188 of the Restatement \u201cin the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 187(2). See note 14, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Under the two-tiered analysis of \u00a7 187(2), we readily conclude that Massachusetts has a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d to the transaction. See \u00a7 187(2)(a). That substantial relationship is anchored in the parties\u2019 negotiated agreement for the birth to occur at a Massachusetts hospital and for a Massachusetts birth certificate to issue, and bolstered by the gestational carrier\u2019s receipt of prenatal care at a Massachusetts hospital in anticipation of delivery at that hospital. See \u00a7 187 comment f, <em>supra </em>at 566-567 (place of partial performance considered to be sufficient to establish a reasonable basis for the parties\u2019 choice of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Turning to the second prong of \u00a7 187(2), it is a close ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>tian whether applying the parties\u2019 choice of law would be \u201ccontrary to a fundamental policy\u201d of another State with a \u201cmaterially greater interest.\u201d See \u00a7 187(2)(b). Certainly the interests of New York and Connecticut are material and significant, for the contracting parties reside in these States. Nevertheless, the interests of New York and Connecticut may be at cross purposes here. New York, the home of the gestational carrier and her husband, expressly prohibits gestational carrier agreements in order to protect women against exploitation as gestational carriers and to protect the gestational carrier\u2019s potential parental rights. See N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law \u00a7 122.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> New York has thus expressed a \u201cfundamental policy\u201d on a matter in which it has a great interest. Connecticut, the plaintiffs\u2019 home State, is silent on the question of gestational carrier agreements, but in any event does not expressly prohibit the plaintiffs from entering into such an arrangement. Massachusetts also has interests here, including interests in \u201cestablishing the rights and responsibilities of parents [of children bom in Massachusetts] as soon as is practically possible\u201d and \u201cfurnishing a measure of stability and protection to children bom through such gestational surrogacy arrangements.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Culliton </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr., supra </em>at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">However, even if we were to decide that New York had a \u201cmaterially greater interest\u201d than both Connecticut and Massachusetts, New York\u2019s policy would not operate to overrule the parties\u2019 choice of law unless New York would have been the applicable law in the absence of any articulated choice by the parties. The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187(2)(b) directs us to a list of factors enumerated in \u00a7 188 to determine what law would have applied if the contract itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>were silent on the issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Bushkin Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 632. Again, consideration of the factors listed in \u00a7 188 leads to inconclusive results. For example, the \u201cplace of contracting\u201d and the \u201cplace of negotiation,\u201d see \u00a7 188(2)(a)-(b), are both unknown, although presumably these activities took place in New York or Connecticut, or both.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The \u201cplace of performance,\u201d see \u00a7 188 (2) (c), arguably is the intended place of birth (Massachusetts), or the place of prenatal care (at least partly in Massachusetts), or the place where the pregnancy evolved (New York), or the place where the genetic carrier was inseminated (Connecticut), or any combination of these. The location of the \u201csubject matter of the contract,\u201d see \u00a7 188(2)(d), is equally difficult to determine, and the final consideration, the \u201cdomicil\u201d of the parties (New York or Connecticut), see \u00a7 188(2)(e), in this case is not helpful. Thus, whatever New York\u2019s interest in protecting the gestational carrier and her husband, it is doubtful that the principles of \u00a7 188 would result in application of New York law to this particular contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u201c[WJhere the significant contacts are so widely dispersed that determination of the state of the applicable law without regard to the parties\u2019 choice would present real difficulties,\u201d the Restatement instructs that the parties\u2019 choice of law will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>honored. \u00a7 187 comment g, <em>supra </em>at 568. This conclusion comports with our functional conflict of laws analysis, which requires consideration of factors such as \u201cuniformity of result, maintenance of interstate order, and simplification of the judicial task\u201d and \u201cthe justified expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Bushkin Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We conclude, then, that the judge should have applied the parties\u2019 choice of law, the law of Massachusetts, to resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the judge in her decision prudently raised the issue of forum shopping in declining to consider the complaint, we are satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, the parties\u2019 choice of law is one we should respect. We are also satisfied that our established conflict of laws analysis will work to prevent misuse of our courts and our laws.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, on July 1, 2004, we ordered that the judgment of the Probate and Family Court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint be vacated, and the injunction pending appeal ordered by the single justice of the Appeals Court be dissolved. We remanded the case to the Probate and Family Court where a judgment was to enter declaring the plaintiffs to be the legal parents of the unborn child and ordering the hospital, Berkshire Health Systems, Inc., through its reporters, on the birth of the child, to place the plaintiffs\u2019 names on the record of birth created pursuant to G. L. c. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, and 3A, listing the plaintiffs as the father and mother, respectively, of the child.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Based on the representation of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that the birth of the child would be induced imminently, on July 1, 2004, we issued an order with opinion to follow vacating the Probate and Family Court judge\u2019s order dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We also dissolved the injunction pending appeal ordered by the single justice of the Appeals Court. We further directed the Probate and Family Court to issue a judgment declaring the plaintiffs to be the legal parents of the unborn child and ordering the hospital, on the child\u2019s birth, to place the plaintiffs\u2019 names on the record of birth created pursuant to G. L. c. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, and 3A, as the child\u2019s father and mother, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Specifically, the gestational carrier agreement provided: \u201cA normal delivery will take place at Berkshire Medical Hospital, in Pittsfield, MA; a high risk or pre-term delivery will take place at a hospital in Massachusetts, Vermont, or New Hampshire that is equipped to handle this situation and participates in the Gestational Carrier\u2019s insurance plan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In their brief to this court, the plaintiffs represented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201cThe hospital was chosen because it was a good hospital and was located half way between both parties. This half way point made it convenient for all parties and allowed the plaintiffs to attend prenatal appointments, view ultrasounds and experience the joy of pregnancy, although vicariously. The plaintiffs also believed that they would be able to obtain a pre-birth order in Massachusetts and that they would not have to adopt their own genetic child or go through other costly and lengthy procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">At oral argument, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel further represented that the gestational carrier\u2019s insurance would not provide coverage for delivery at a Connecticut hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">No statutory directive limits the court\u2019s jurisdiction in actions relating to gestational agreements to Massachusetts residents.

Moreover, the statutory scheme for the recording of births in Massachusetts makes no distinction between resident and nonresident parents. Pursuant to G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 1, each town clerk is responsible for recording \u201cdate of birth, place of birth, name and sex of child; names, places of birth, and dates of birth of both parents; and residence and birth surname of child\u2019s mother\u201d for each birth that \u201coccur[s] in the town.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b574-14\">We are concerned here only with those portions of the gestational carrier agreement that pertain to the choice of Massachusetts law and the complaint to establish parentage and for a prebirth order.
