L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4. We transferred the case to this court from the Appeals Court on our own motion. The defendant asks that we vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the G. L. c. 209A abuse prevention order on the bases that (1) the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of establishing the existence of a \u201csubstantive dating or engagement relationship\u201d as required by G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 <em>1(e); </em>and (2) the District Court judge violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights by not permitting him to call any witnesses on his behalf or otherwise to challenge the evidence presented by the plaintiff during the hearing on the question of continuing the temporary order. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and hearing oral argument, this court issued an order vacating the abuse prevention order. This opinion addresses the reasons for that order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant and undisputed facts of this case as set forth in the parties\u2019 briefs and pleadings. The defendant, M.M., is a seventeen year old high school student accused of having sexually assaulted a fifteen year old schoolmate. The plaintiff in this case, C.O., is the mother of the young woman who was allegedly abused (\u201cdaughter\u201d). Shortly after the alleged incident, the plaintiff filed a complaint and supporting affidavit on behalf of her daughter and obtained an ex parte abuse prevention order against the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit alleges that the defendant offered to drive the daughter home from school and, along the way, stopped at his house, invited the young woman inside, and then forcibly sexually assaulted her in his bedroom. The defendant contests the occurrence of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">One day after an ex parte emergency temporary abuse prevention order was issued, see G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4, the defendant was arrested on charges arising from the alleged assault. The defendant was arraigned on these charges and subsequently released on bail. He was suspended from high school as a result of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">After a hearing during which both parties were represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>by counsel, a judge of the Brockton District Court extended the abuse prevention order for a period of one year. Defendant timely appealed the issuance of the order and shortly thereafter filed a motion to suspend the order pending appeal. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suspend the abuse prevention order pending appeal, and the defendant timely appealed the denial of that motion as well. Subsequently, the district attorney\u2019s office entered a nolle prosequi on all pending charges related to the alleged sexual assault, and the defendant immediately filed a motion to modify the abuse prevention order and requested an evidentiary hearing on his earlier motion to vacate. A different District Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to modify, and the defendant once again timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We first consider whether the plaintiff\u2019s daughter and the defendant were engaged in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. We then discuss whether the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated during the hearing on the question of continuing the temporary order.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">1. <em>Substantive dating relationship. </em>General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 3, provides a range of protections and remedies for those \u201cperson[s] suffering from abuse from an adult or minor family or household member. . . .\u201d Included within the definition of \u201cfamily or household members\u201d are those individuals who are or have been engaged in a \u201csubstantive dating or engagement relationship.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The defendant maintains that the plaintiff failed to show the existence of a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d between him and the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, and that, consequently, the abuse prevention order against him was improperly issued and extended. The defendant further asks this court to clarify the meaning of \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. Because the statute enumerates four factors to be considered in determining the existence of a \u201csubstantive dating relationship,\u201d there is sufficient language in the statute to enable judges to make informed and consistent determinations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We need not add to this language by interpretation. We believe that the Legislature drafted the statute with purposeful flexibility in its definitions, and we acknowledge that intent by declining the invitation to add elements to the Legislature\u2019s definition. The existence of a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d is to be determined on a case-by-case basis applying the factors set forth in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e) </em>(l)-(4), while keeping in mind the statute\u2019s protective purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The Legislature enacted G. L. c. 209A in 1978 to address the problem of domestic violence. St. 1978, c. 447, \u00a7 2. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>434 Mass. 331, 332 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 344 (1990) (legislative purpose of G. L. c. 209A is to provide \u201ca statutory mechanism by which victims of family or household abuse can enlist the aid of the State to prevent further abuse\u201d). Since its inception, G. L. c. 209A has protected victims exclusively from abuse by \u201cfamily or household members.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3. However, the Legislature has consistently broadened the definition of \u201cfamily or household member,\u201d and consequently expanded the scope of G. L. c. 209A\u2019s coverage. In 1978, the statute defined \u201c[family or household member\u201d as a \u201chousehold member, a spouse, former spouse or their minor children or blood relative.\u201d St. 1978, c. 447, \u00a7 2. In 1986, the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d was expanded to include a \u201cformer household member\u201d and a \u201cperson who, though unrelated by blood or marriage, is a parent of the plaintiff\u2019s minor child.\u201d St. 1986, c. 310, \u00a7 15. In 1990, the Legislature once again amended the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d to its present form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> St. 1990, c. 403, \u00a7 2. General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 1, now defines \u201c[fjamily or household members\u201d as \u201cpersons who: (a) are or were married to one another; (b) are or were residing together in the same household; (c) are or were related by blood or marriage; (d) having [sic] a child in common regardless of whether they have ever married or lived together; or (e) <em>are or have been in a substantive dating or engagement </em>relationship...\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Rather than establishing a rigid test to be applied to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>relationships, the statute directs courts to \u201cadjudge[]\u201d the existence of substantive dating relationships by considering four factors: \u201c(1) the length of time of the relationship; (2) the type of relationship; (3) the frequency of interaction between the parties; and (4) if the relationship has been terminated by either person, the length of time elapsed since the termination of the relationship.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e) </em>(l)-(4). The Legislature thus anticipated that the existence or absence of a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d would be determined on a case-by-case basis. It is not our role to impose additional constraints on the interpretive instructions provided by the Legislature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>438 Mass. 274, 278 (2002) (declining to further limit phrase \u201clikely\u201d in G. L. c. 123A, and reasoning \u201c[i]f the Legislature had intended to restrict \u2018likely\u2019 to a usage less broad than its commonly understood meaning, the Legislature would have done so\u201d). See also <em>Sorgman </em>v. <em>Sorgman, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 416, 418 (2000) (declining to imply limiting factors to plain statutory language of G. L. c. 209A). Had the Legislature intended to further limit the scope of \u201csubstantive dating or engagement relationship,\u201d it would have included any such limitation in the text of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">This court has had only one prior opportunity to consider the meaning of \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d within G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e). </em>See <em>Brossard </em>v. <em>West Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>417 Mass. 183, 185 (1994) (person may be in more than one \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d at any given time). In acknowledging the possibility of simultaneous \u201csubstantive dating relationships,\u201d we recognized the need for flexibility in applying the statute. Also instructive is our analysis in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 333-334, in which we broadly interpreted \u201crelated by blood,\u201d as set forth in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 (c). In <em>Turner, </em>we recognized the changing nature of the concept of \u201cfamily,\u201d as well as the Legislature\u2019s clear intent to extend protections to victims who experience violence beyond the context of the traditional \u201cfamily.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 334-336. The Legislature intended to encompass a variety of relationships within G. L. c. 209A. It would not accord with this intent to restrict the statute beyond its terms in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">While the four statutory factors enumerated in G. L. c. 209A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u00a7 1 <em>(e) </em>(l)-(4), are the primary guidance for courts when making case-specific determinations about the existence of a \u201csubstantive dating relationship,\u201d courts should also consider the underlying purpose of G. L. c. 209A. See <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934) (statutory language is to be \u201cinterpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished\u201d). See also <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 333, quoting <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985). The Legislature intended to address violence stemming from relationships which may not be considered traditional \u201cfamily or household\u201d associations. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 334, quoting C.P. Kindregan, Jr. &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 57.5 (2d ed. 1996). The judicial guidelines on abuse prevention thus properly instruct courts to \u201cgive broad meaning to the term \u2018substantive dating relationship\u2019 to assure that the protective purposes of the statute are achieved.\u201d Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Prevention Proceedings \u00a7 3:02 commentary (Dec. 2000) (hereinafter, \u201cJudicial Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">On the other hand, G. L. c. 209A is denominated a \u201cdomestic relations\u201d statute within the General Laws. See Part II, Title III of the General Laws, entitled \u201cDomestic Relations\u201d (including, inter alia, marriage, divorce, and child custody statutes). The Legislature did not intend the statute to apply to acquaintance or stranger violence, nor did it intend to cover the myriad of relationships that exist or even to all those which might be considered \u201cdating\u201d relationships. See <em>Brossard </em>v. <em>West Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 185 (\u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d existed where facts revealed \u201csubstantially more than a few casual dates\u201d). The statutory language clearly requires something more \u2014 a <em>\u201csubstantive </em>dating or engagement relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Dating is inherently personal and idiosyncratic, and relationships exist in endless variety. It would be unproductive to place a numerical quota on the number of \u201cdates\u201d that constitute a \u201csubstantive dating relationship,\u201d just as it would be inap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>propriate to mandate a minimum duration for a relationship to fall within G. L. c. 209A. Furthermore, any attempt by this court to elaborate on the meaning of \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d by adding adjectives to an already well-designed statutory definition would be counterproductive. Such an effort might spawn additional litigation and result in unnecessary intrusions by courts into the precise nature of parties\u2019 interactions. See Judicial Guidelines \u00a7 1:01 commentary (\u201cany attempt to explore the nature of the underlying relationship between the parties can inappropriately shift the focus of the proceedings away from the issue of protection. Such a shift of focus can weaken the plaintiff\u2019s resolve to seek protection. . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the parties were engaged in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. See <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. 592, 596, 597 (1995) (\u201cThe burden is on the complainant to establish facts justifying the issuance and continuance of an abuse prevention order,\u201d and \u201cplaintiff must make a case for relief by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d) See also Judicial Guidelines \u00a7 1:02 commentary par. (D). Here, the plaintiff failed to sustain her burden. During the hearing on the question of continuing the temporary order, the plaintiff testified that the defendant had \u201cbeen over to the house and he ha[d] taken [the daughter] to the movies.\u201d When asked about the nature of the relationship, the mother testified that she was \u201creally not sure. They did, you know, go out.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s uncertainty related only to the then-existing state of the dating relationship, not its past existence. Even so, the judge\u2019s finding of a past \u201cboyfriend/ girlfriend\u201d relationship is not supported by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and the relationship between the parties does not meet the statutory standard of a \u201csubstantive dating relationship.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel also contends that the judge properly made a credibility assessment of the plaintiff, who was the sole witness at the hearing, that this court should not disturb. See <em>Adoption of Larry, </em>434 Mass. 456, 462 (2001) (deferring to judge\u2019s assessment of witness credibility). See also <em>Matter of Antonelli, </em>429 Mass. 644, 648 (1999). We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>contest the judge\u2019s assessment of the plaintiff\u2019s credibility in the present case, but rather his misapplication of the standards set forth in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>438 Mass. 274, 276 (2002) (\u201cwe will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact. We do, however, scrutinize without deference the propriety of the legal criteria employed by the trial judge and the manner in which those criteria were applied to the facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The judge committed an error of law in relying on improper factors as the basis for his finding that the parties were engaged in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship.\u201d General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 1 (e) (l)-(4), directs judges to consider four factors. The judge in this case ignored these factors and instead improperly relied upon judicially constructed factors, including \u201cthe fact that a criminal matter [szc] has issued,\u201d and \u201cthe age of the alleged victim.\u201d According to the judge, the determination was based \u201cprimarily\u201d on the fact that a criminal case was pending. There was no testimony as to the length of time of the relationship or the frequency of the parties\u2019 interactions, as required by G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e) </em>(1), (3). The plaintiff contends that the judge properly exercised his broad discretion in according weight to these nonstatutory factors. While judicial discretion and flexibility are appropriate in applying the statutory definition of \u201csubstantive dating relationship,\u201d they do not relieve a court of its obligation to apply the legislative criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Although the plaintiff asserts that the judge could draw an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, this alone does not cure the defects in the judge\u2019s analysis. \u201cAn inference adverse to a defendant may be properly drawn. . . from his or her failure to testify in a civil matter such as this, even if criminal proceedings are pending .... However, inference cannot alone meet the plaintiff\u2019s burden. . . . [A] defendant\u2019s failure to testify cannot be used to justify the issuance of an abuse prevention order until a case is presented on other evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, supra </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Since there is insufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d between the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, the abuse prevention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>order is vacated, and this case could be disposed of without further discussion. However, given the importance and merit of the defendant\u2019s due process claim, which both parties briefed, we choose to address it below.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">2. <em>Due process claim. </em>The defendant on appeal claims that he was improperly denied the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine during the hearing on the question of continuing the temporary order. There is no question that the defendant was denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard. This violated statutory rights given him expressly by G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4; apart from the statute, his constitutional right to due process was denied him.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 4, requires a hearing \u201con the question of continuing the temporary order... no later than ten court business days after such [temporary] orders are entered.\u201d The statute explicitly states: \u201c[t]he court shall give the defendant an opportunity to be heard on the question of continuing the temporary order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court has determined that \u201c[t]he right of the defendant to be heard [in a G. L. c. 209A proceeding] includes his right to testify and to present evidence. A defendant has a general right to cross-examine witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. 592, 597 (1995). See Judicial Guidelines \u00a7 5:01 (\u201ca [G. L.] c. 209A action is an adversarial proceeding in which both parties must be allowed to present evidence\u201d). Furthermore, this court has recognized that G. L. c. 209A proceedings may implicate a defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights. <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, supra </em>at 598 (\u201c[W]hether a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated will depend on the fairness of a particular hearing\u201d). Due process requires that the defendant be given an opportunity to testify and present evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 591 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998), quoting <em>Matter of Kenney, </em>399 Mass. 431, 435 (1987) (\u201c[t]he fundamental requisite of due process is an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 113 (1990) (right to present evidence, call witnesses, and cross-examine adverse witnesses in context of parole revocation hearing); <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>400 Mass. 217, 222 (1987), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>and cases cited (\u201cright of cross-examination [is] a right which has long been recognized in both civil and criminal cases\u201d); Judicial Guidelines \u00a7 1:02 (\u201cThe adjudication of cases by a neutral court is a fundamental element of due process. In [G. L.] c. 209A cases, as in all other court proceedings, the court is responsible for protecting the rights of the accused. . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The record reveals that the defendant was not given any opportunity to present or to cross-examine witnesses. The defendant\u2019s counsel explicitly argued for the right to call witnesses on at least four occasions. The defendant was never permitted to present evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fact that defense counsel was permitted to argue on behalf of his client does not substitute for the opportunity to present evidence through the testimony of witnesses, to cross-examine adverse witnesses, and to have the judge take this testimony and cross-examination into account in making his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The plaintiff next claims that even if the defendant were denied the opportunity to call and cross-examine witnesses, those denials constituted a proper exercise of judicial discretion. While a defendant\u2019s right to present evidence is not absolute, and while a judge may limit cross-examination for \u201cgood cause\u201d in certain situations, see <em>Silvia </em>v. <em>Duarte, </em>421 Mass. 1007, 1008 (1995); <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, supra </em>at 597-598, judicial discretion is not \u201cunlimited,\u201d and \u201ceach side must be given a meaningful opportunity to challenge each other\u2019s evidence.\u201d <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, supra </em>at 598 n.5. Proceedings held pursuant to G. L. c. 209A are no different than any other adversarial hearings in that each party has a right to present evidence, and the moving party must satisfy the burden of proof and subject its witnesses to cross-examination. See <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, supra </em>at 597 (\u201cThe practice in civil actions ... is to permit cross-examination . . .); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 113 (right to present evidence, call witnesses, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>cross-examine adverse witnesses). Cross-examination may be limited or denied in certain instances, <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, supra </em>at 598 n.5, such as to avoid harassment or intimidation of witnesses, confusion, delay, or other abuses of the proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>431 Mass. 535, 540 (in criminal context, \u201creasonable limits may be placed on cross-examination \u2018based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019s safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant\u2019 \u201d [citation omitted]); Judicial Guidelines \u00a7 5:01 (\u201cthe judge should not permit. . . cross-examination to be used for harassment or discovery purposes\u201d). Absent these circumstances, a defendant in a G. L. c. 209A proceeding, as in any case, must be given the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Here, there was no showing by the plaintiff of any of the grounds enumerated above that would justify a limitation on these rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, the issue whether to limit cross-examination was never reached by the judge because he allowed no cross-examination at all. The judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant the opportunity to present testimonial evidence and cross-examine the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">One final error of law by the judge in this case requires discussion. The judge improperly determined that the defendant\u2019s right to present evidence at an upcoming criminal hearing would sufficiently protect the defendant\u2019s due process rights. The judge stated, \u201cif we have a [G. L. c. 209A protective order] . . . and there is no pending criminal matters pending [szc], then that\u2019s a much different issue. In other words, we give both parties a full right to have a hearing and witnesses .... But if there\u2019s a criminal matter pending, then that\u2019s a different matter altogether.\u201d A defendant\u2019s right to present evidence at a G. L. c. 209A hearing is unrelated to his rights at a pending criminal proceeding. The right to be heard in one forum does not affect the right to be heard in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Although \u201c[a]buse prevention order proceedings were intended by the Legislature to be as expeditious and informal as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>reasonably possible,\u201d <em>Zullo </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>423 Mass. 679, 681 (1996), citing <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, supra </em>at 598, the proceedings may not violate the due process rights of defendants in an attempt to accommodate plaintiffs. \u201c[T]he issue of family violence has become the focus of legitimate and increasing public concern. However, that concern must not be permitted to affect or diminish the court\u2019s responsibility to remain neutral, to protect the rights of the accused in each case, and to address each case individually on its own merits.\u201d Judicial Guidelines \u00a7 1:02 commentary. Just as we must guard against the potential that G. L. c. 209A proceedings may be used to harass and intimidate victims of domestic abuse, so too must we resist a culture of summarily issuing and extending these orders. Such a culture would ignore the legislative intent behind G. L. c. 209A and undermine a basic pillar of our judicial tradition \u2014 that all parties be given a fair and equal opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the abuse prevention order against the defendant is vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The plaintiff also filed a motion to strike portions of the defendant\u2019s brief for failure to comply with Mass. R. A. R 16 (e), as amended, 378 Mass. 940 (1979). We deny the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Our holding does not rest on any contested language in the brief, and we see nothing in the brief that is confidential or otherwise prejudicial to the plaintiff. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadal-Ginard, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 13 (1997) (motion to strike portions of appellate brief denied where passages in question neither confused panel of Appeals Court nor prejudiced panel against defendant).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The plaintiff does not assert the existence of an \u201cengagement relationship,\u201d and there is no evidence in the record to suggest such a relationship ever existed between the parties. We therefore confine our analysis to whether there was a \u201csubstantive dating relationship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In 1996, the Legislature made a grammatical correction to the definition that is immaterial to our analysis. St. 1996, c. 450, \u00a7 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\">During one such request, defense counsel stated: \u201cI would like an opportunity to exercise my client\u2019s rights to cross-examine [the plaintiff]. . . and I would like to present additional evidence in terms of witnesses which I believe according to the rules is my right and my client\u2019s right to. . . due process.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel further stated that his witnesses would show that the daughter and the defendant were not engaged in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d and that the alleged assault did not occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The plaintiff made bald assertions that the defendant intended to harass witnesses and create confusion in the proceedings, but these claims are unsupported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
