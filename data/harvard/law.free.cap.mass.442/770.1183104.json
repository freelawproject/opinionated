L. c. 272, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed, arguing (1) insufficient evidence of alarm or shock on the part of persons viewing his actions; (2) insufficient evidence that he exposed himself openly; and (3) prejudicial error in the judge\u2019s failure to instruct on the prior inconsistent statements of a witness. In an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court reversed, based solely on the lack of a prior inconsistent statement instruction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 1119 (2004). We granted the defendant\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Commonwealth\u2019s applications for further appellate review and also reverse, but on a ground different than that of the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><em>Facts. </em>In considering a question of the sufficiency of the evidence, we summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). Peter,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thirteen years of age at time of trial (June 5, 2002), and John, ten years of age at time of trial, were playing in the driveway of the house of John\u2019s grandmother on the morning of November 10, 2001. Peter heard a knock coming from a window of the house across the street, although he did not actually see anyone knocking. That house was owned by the defendant\u2019s mother. When Peter looked toward the sound, he could see a hand in the window \u201cwaving [him] to come over.\u201d He ignored it and continued playing. Peter heard a sound \u201clike keys jingling\u201d and went over to investigate. He stood in the driveway of the house next to the defendant\u2019s residence, about twenty feet from the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Peter could see a man masturbating through the window, although he could not identify him because he could only see the man\u2019s \u201cprivate area\u201d and stomach. Peter called to John, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>who joined him and saw someone stroking his \u201cprivate area,\u201d masturbating. The boys \u201cboth looked at each other, and. . . started to giggle\u201d and talk. Both described their laughter as a result of nervousness. Peter was \u201coffended\u201d by what he saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The grandmother, who had been raking leaves in her yard, called to the boys, asking what they were doing, but they did not respond. She called them over, and they crossed the street back toward her. They were both \u201cexcited.\u201d Neither would initially explain the cause of their giggling, but on further questioning, they told her that a man was masturbating in the window and described his actions with \u201chand gestures.\u201d The grandmother told them that this was not a laughing matter, and telephoned the police. Meanwhile, the boys observed the defendant move past a window, naked, and recognized him. They were familiar with him because John\u2019s mother cleaned the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house. A police officer arrived and, after conversing with the defendant, placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The defendant testified that he had been naked that morning because he had been waiting to take a shower. He explained that the water in the upstairs shower would not heat up; he attributed the lack of hot water to his belief that the heat was not on upstairs. He turned the heat on, and while he was waiting, he played, still without any clothes on, with his mother\u2019s dogs in the living room. He denied seeing the boys outside his window, beckoning them with his hand, or masturbating that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motions for the entry of a required finding of not guilty submitted at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence. In reviewing the denial of motions for a required finding of not guilty, \u201cwe must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether any rational jury could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruci, </em>409 Mass. 94, 96 (1991) citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 676-677.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The five elements of the offense of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior appear in Instruction 5.42 of the Model <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, does not itself define \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,\u201d these five elements were generated by our case law. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 396 (1984) (defendant\u2019s act must be committed \u201cin such a way as to produce alarm or shock\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 271-272 (1983) (holding that case law had made clear that masturbating in car on public road was sufficiently \u201copen\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catlin, </em>1 Mass. 8, 10 (1804) (conviction cannot be upheld for behavior between two consenting adults in private residence as it is not \u201copen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The judge instructed the jury in accordance with the Model Instructions. The defendant contends that there was insufficient proof that the boys were \u201cin fact alarmed or shocked,\u201d the fifth element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Even when we view the facts most favorably to the Commonwealth, they do not warrant a finding that either of the boys was actually \u201calarmed or shocked.\u201d The prosecutor conceded at trial that he did not \u201cput any shock in the behavior.\u201d We take this statement to mean that the Commonwealth was not contend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ing that the boys were shocked by what they saw. Nor was there any evidence of alarm. Both boys stated that they were laughing because they were \u201cnervous,\u201d not alarmed. They only left the window after two calls from the grandmother. She described them as \u201cexcited,\u201d but did not suggest that they were \u201calarmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Being \u201cexcited\u201d or \u201cnervous\u201d may sometimes be unpleasant, but it does not connote the serious negative emotional experience required by the statute. Peter\u2019s strongest statement of his feelings was that he was \u201coffended,\u201d but being offended is not the equivalent of undergoing \u201calarm or shock.\u201d That the exposure be \u201coffensive to one or more persons\u201d is an element required for indecent exposure, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396, but an open and gross lewdness charge requires more. Indeed, the presence of \u201calarm or shock\u201d is what distinguishes the open and gross offense from the indecent exposure offense. <em>Id. </em>at 396-397. Open and gross lewdness is a felony punishable by up to three years in State prison, while indecent exposure is a misdemeanor carrying a sentence of up to six months in a jail or house of correction. Compare G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, with G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 1. It is logical that there are elements of proof applicable to the felony that are not required for the misdemeanor, and our holding is consistent with that. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. 492, 495-496 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396-397 (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, impermissibly overlaps with indecent exposure statute because requirement \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s act must be committed in such a way as to produce alarm or shock\u201d indicates that \u201c\u00a7 16 requires proof of an element not required for indecent exposure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Mere nervousness and offense has never been held sufficient to warrant a finding that the viewer was \u201cin fact alarmed or shocked.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53 (1880) (girl \u201cfled in fright\u201d to neighbor\u2019s house); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy G., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 273 (2001) (observer told defendant he was \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and stated she felt \u201cupset,\u201d \u201cangry,\u201d and \u201csad\u201d due to exposure, and was \u201ctoo in shock\u201d to tell another person about it immediately); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poillucci, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 303-304 (1999) (girl who witnessed exposure testified that she felt \u201cvery uncomfortable and nervous\u201d and immediately alerted her parents that defendant was \u201cweird\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 901 (1996) (observer stated he felt \u201cdisgust\u201d at encounter and moved at once to contact police and identify perpetrators). In all these cases, the observer suffered significant negative emotions as a result of the exposure; thus his or her reaction could justifiably be deemed alarm or shock. Nervous giggling is not an equivalent, and the boys\u2019 reactions are insufficient to meet the fifth element of the open and gross lewdness charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Because the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that the boys were \u201calarmed or shocked,\u201d the judgment of the District Court on the open and gross lewdness charge must be reversed, and the case remanded with instructions that a judgment of acquittal enter on this count of the complaint. Consideration of other issues is unnecessary to the decision. However, given the importance of the other issues briefed by both parties, we choose to address them below.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">2. <em>\u201cTender years\u201d instruction. </em>In addition to instructing the jury on the five elements required for a conviction of open and gross lewdness, the judge gave a \u201ctender years\u201d supplemental instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Instruction 5.42 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court. The \u201ctender years\u201d instruction apparently derives from the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number><em>supra </em>at 53, where the term \u201ctender years\u201d was used in summarizing what the court held was sufficient evidence to support a verdict of guilt. However, that reference cannot be read as eliminating the fifth element (that the viewer actually experience alarm or shock as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions). To the contrary, the court specifically referenced the fact that the child who saw the exposure \u201cfled in fright to a neighboring house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The \u201ctender years\u201d passage from <em>Wardell </em>has been repeated in some of our more recent cases, but not in a context that suggests elimination or modification of the fifth element of the offense. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 498 n.11; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396. Although both of these cases involved situations in which defendants exposed themselves to persons of \u201ctender years,\u201d as is often the situation in prosecutions under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 116 (1980), neither case suggested that that factor eliminated the necessity of establishing all five elements. In the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, supra, </em>we referred to the \u201ctender years\u201d language of <em>Wardell, </em>but only to support the proposition that \u201c[cjonvictions under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, have usually concerned exposure in front of children.\u201d The <em>Quinn </em>case also reaffirmed that conviction requires proof of the fourth and fifth elements. \u201cConviction of \u2018open and gross lewdness,\u2019 G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16,. . . requires the Commonwealth to prove, among other elements, intention, manner (done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock), and impact (does in fact alarm or shock).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496. The <em>Fitta </em>case, cited by the Commonwealth, is not to the contrary. It too repeats the above quoted <em>Wardell </em>language, but does not state that this language eliminates any of the five elements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra. </em>The \u201ctender years\u201d instruction is at best confusing, as it suggests that it is unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>prove one of the elements where children are involved. Even when, as in the present case, it is sandwiched between two statements requiring proof of five elements, it is a misleading formulation of the law and should be avoided in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We do not suggest that the age of the viewer is necessarily irrelevant to the offense. Rather, we take this occasion to clarify that it is potentially relevant to the fourth element (done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock), but not to the fifth element (does in fact alarm or shock). The jury\u2019s assessment whether the manner in which the act was done was such as to produce alarm or shock may take into account the entirety of the surrounding circumstances, including the young age of the person viewing the defendant\u2019s conduct. When the victim is a child, there is arguably a greater risk of harm due to the child\u2019s immaturity, lack of experience, natural tendency to fantasize, and presumed ignorance of sexual matters. Where appropriate, counsel may argue this point, but no instruction to that effect should be given. The fifth element requires that the viewer in fact suffer alarm or shock, and the mere youth of the viewer does not relieve the Commonwealth from proving that alarm or shock actually resulted from the defendant\u2019s conduct. The present \u201ctender years\u201d Supplemental Instruction 5.42 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court, which suggests that the age of the observer may obviate the need to establish the fifth element of the offense of open and gross lewdness, should not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">3. <em>Definition of </em>\u201crecklessly.\u201d In his instructions, the judge defined the third element as \u201cthat the defendant did so openly. That is: either he intended public exposure or he recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of public exposure . . . .\u2019\u2019He never defined \u201crecklessly,\u201d despite an objection by defense counsel and a request for further definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">When a term such as \u201crecklessly\u201d is used in jury instructions, it should be defined. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>421 Mass. 400, 411 (1995) (\u201cjudge should explain the meaning of technical terms where that meaning is obscure and there is a possibility of confusion\u201d). Here there is the possibility that the jury would not realize that recklessness requires more than mere negligence or a showing that someone \u201cmight\u201d see the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 187-188 (1987). A definition would have avoided this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">4. <em>Prior inconsistent statement instruction. </em>Peter, who testified at trial that he saw a hand beckoning him over, did not mention the hand in a statement he made to the police at the time of the incident. The responding police officer testified that he did not believe Peter told him anything about the hand. This testimony called for an instruction on prior inconsistent statements, yet, despite defense counsel\u2019s objection, the judge refused to give such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\u201cThe failure to give a requested instruction on the use of prior inconsistent statements in assessing the credibility of a witness is error if there is evidence that a witness made prior inconsistent statements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 71 (1995), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 119-120 (1984). Failure to mention something in an earlier statement is inconsistent with a later statement of fact \u201cwhen it would have been natural to include the fact in the initial statement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the District Court on the open and gross lewdness charge is reversed, the verdict set aside, and the case remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal on this count of the complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The defendant was also charged with indecent exposure in violation of G.

He requested that we address the sufficiency of the evidence; reversal on this ground would preclude retrial. See, e.g., <em>Neverson </em>v. Commonwealth, 406 Mass. 174, 175 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\">We refer to both children by pseudonyms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Instruction 5.42 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (1988) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201cIn order to.prove the defendant guilty of this offense, the Commonwealth must prove five things beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201cFirst: That the defendant exposed his (her) genitals) (buttocks) (or) (female breasts) to one or more persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">\u201cSecond: That the defendant did so intentionally;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">\u201cThird: That the defendant did so \u2018openly,\u2019 that is, either he (she) intended public exposure, or he (she) recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of public exposure, to others who might be offended by such conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">\u201cFourth: That the defendant\u2019s act was done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">\u201cFifth: That one or more persons were in fact alarmed or shocked by the defendant\u2019s thus exposing himself (herself).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">This court has cited this instruction with approval most recently in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. 492, 501-502 (2003).
