We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review to consider whether a Superior Court judge erred where, after a bench trial, she held that the insurer must indemnify the vendor. Because we conclude that the vendor\u2019s endorsement at issue here covers claims for a vendor\u2019s own negligence when the manufacturer\u2019s product causes bodily injury, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural Background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We present the relevant facts as found by the judge, supplementing them as necessary, and reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues. The relevant facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">KCS Industries, Inc., manufactured a large interactive Game Boy display unit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (unit) for Nintendo of America, Inc. (Nintendo), which sold the unit to Lechmere, Inc. (Lechmere), in August, 1993. The unit was shipped to Lechmere in three cartons, requiring Lechmere to assemble it in the store. At some point before August, 1994, Lechmere assembled the unit on the floor of its Cambridge store. On August 2, 1994, Tony Makrigiannis, who was then five years old, was injured on the premises of the Lechmere store when the unit fell on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In 1997, the plaintiffs filed suit against Nintendo and Team Marketing, Inc.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging negligent installation, maintenance, and inspection, as well as negligent failure to provide adequate warnings for operators. The plaintiffs later amended their complaint to add Lechmere as a defendant, alleging negligent ownership, inspection, maintenance, or installation resulting in a dangerous and unsafe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">At the time of the 1994 accident, Nintendo had a policy of li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ability insurance with Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance Company, Ltd. (Sumitomo). The policy included a vendor\u2019s broad form endorsement covering \u201c[a]ll vendors authorized by the Named Insured,\u201d which included Lechmere. Pursuant to the vendor\u2019s endorsement, Lechmere demanded defense and indemnification from Sumitomo. Sumitomo refused on the basis that the endorsement did not extend coverage to Lechmere for the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Lechmere then commenced a third-party action against Sumitomo seeking a judgment declaring that Sumitomo owed Lechmere a defense and indemnification under the vendor\u2019s endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">On Sumitomo\u2019s motion, the trial judge bifurcated the tort and third-party actions for the purposes of trial. A jury heard the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Nintendo and Lechmere in March, 2002. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the judge directed a verdict in favor of Nintendo on the claims of negligent design and manufacture of the unit. The remaining claims went to the jury, which found that Lechmere was one hundred per cent negligent and that its negligence was the proximate cause of the minor plaintiff\u2019s injuries. After a bench trial of the third-party action, the judge ruled that Sumitomo owed Lechmere a defense and indemnification with respect to the underlying action because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims fell within the scope of the vendor\u2019s endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Sumitomo appealed, arguing that the judge erred in ordering it to indemnify Lechmere under the vendor\u2019s endorsement because Lechmere failed to establish that it was entitled to coverage under the policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, Sumitomo argues that the judge\u2019s findings of facts supporting her conclusion were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>We accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact in a bench trial unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 620 (1992), and cases cited. \u201cOn the other hand, to ensure that the ultimate findings and conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>are consistent with the law, we scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts. Thus, the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of appellate review does not protect findings of fact or conclusions based on incorrect legal standards.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">2. <em>Vendor\u2019s endorsement. </em>The relevant portions of Sumitomo\u2019s broad form insurance policy are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cIt is agreed that the \u2018Persons Insured\u2019 provision is amended to include any person or organization designated below (herein referred to as \u2018vendor\u2019) as an insured, but only with respect to the distribution or sale in the regular course of the vendor\u2019s business of the Named Insured\u2019s products designated below subject to the following additional provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">\u201c1. The insurance with respect to the vendor does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201c(b) bodily injury or property damage arising out of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">\u201c(i) any physical or chemical change in the form of the product intentionally made by the vendor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">\u201c(iii) demonstration, installation, servicing or repair operations, <em>except such operations performed at the vendor\u2019s premises </em>in connection with the sale of the product\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">Under the policy, Lechmere was the named vendor and Nintendo was the named insured. The insured products were listed as \u201cAmusement machine including Home Video Games, coin-operated [szc] video games, playing cards and all other products which are manufactured, assembled &amp;/or distributed by the Named Insured(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">The policy fails to define the terms \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201csale.\u201d \u201cDistribution\u201d can be defined as \u201cthe marketing or merchandising of commodities.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 660 (1993). \u201cSale\u201d can be defined as the \u201copportunity of selling or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>being sold,\u201d and \u201csales\u201d as \u201coperations and activities involved in promoting and selling goods or services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2003. The policy defines \u201cproducts\u201d as \u201cgoods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the Named Insured or by other trading under his name, including any container thereof.\u201d Thus, \u201cproduct\u201d appears to include those items used for marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The record reveals that the unit was displayed in the Lech-mere store to stimulate sales of Nintendo\u2019s Game Boy products. Sumitomo points to the fact that the unit itself was not for resale to the general public, but rather was solely for promotional purposes. This, however, is irrelevant, as Sumitomo admits the unit was for promotional purposes and thus part of the operations and activities involved in promoting and selling Nintendo\u2019s goods and services. Further, the minor plaintiff was injured when the top portion of the unit fell on top of him as he was attempting to use it. As such, the unit was a \u201cproduct\u201d under the terms of the endorsement and covered by the policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">If Sumitomo did not intend to cover display products, it could have excluded all \u201cdemonstrations\u201d including those performed at the vendor\u2019s premises in connection with the sale of the product.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although an exclusion cannot create coverage, the language of the exclusion reinforces our interpretation that products on display are covered under the vendor\u2019s endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Sumitomo relies heavily on the ruling in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>Shop Cos., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 521 (1996), and cases from other jurisdictions to argue that a vendor\u2019s endorsement does not indemnify a vendor for independent acts of negligence because the purpose of the policy is to protect a vendor in products liability suits. However, Sumitomo\u2019s reliance on the <em>Mitchell </em>case is misplaced. Unlike in the present case, where the minor plaintiff was injured by Nintendo\u2019s product, in the <em>Mitchell </em>case there was no connection between the products (bakery goods) and the plaintiffs injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 524. There, a bakery employee was injured on a supermarket\u2019s loading dock while delivering bread to the supermarket. <em>Id. </em>at 521. As to one reason that the vendor\u2019s endorsement did not apply, the Appeals Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cAlthough Mitchell was injured in the course of delivering a Continental product to Stop &amp; Shop, his injuries cannot be said to have been caused by the product or to ' have arisen in \u2018the distribution or sale in the regular course of the vendor\u2019s [i.e. Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s] business of Continental Baking Companies\u2019 products . . . .\u2019 Rather, they arose from the distribution in the regular course of Continental\u2019s business of its products to a vendor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 524. In this case, regardless of Lechmere\u2019s negligence, the minor plaintiffs injuries were caused by Nintendo\u2019s product \u2014 it was Nintendo\u2019s product that fell on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">As for the out-of-State cases on which Sumitomo relies, some are not persuasive as applied to the facts of this case. See <em>Dominick\u2019s Finer Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>163 Ill. App. 3d 149, 150-152 (1987) (denying coverage where bottling company employee was injured when he slipped and fell on loading dock while delivering bottling company products to restaurant; facts nearly identical to those in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., supra); American White Cross Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>202 N.J. Super. 372, 378-381 (1985) (denying coverage under vendor\u2019s endorsement because of specific exclusion precluding coverage where products were labeled or relabeled by vendor). In fact, in other, subsequent cases, the same courts found coverage under a vendor\u2019s endorsement where there was a nexus between the named insured\u2019s product and the injury. See <em>Sportman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Daisy Mfg. Co., </em>268 Ill. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>App. 3d 974, 976-978 (1994) (coverage provided where vendor negligently sold named insured\u2019s BB pellets to minor, who sustained eye injury when he shot pellets from BB gun); <em>Pep Boys </em>v. <em>Cigna Indem. Ins. Co., </em>300 N.J. Super. 245, 249-255 (1997) (coverage provided where vendor negligently sold named insured\u2019s freon to minor, who died after inhaling it).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, the <em>Pep Boys </em>court noted that its \u201cextensive analysis in the <em>American </em>opinion of the role of the endorsement was dictum [as t]he only issue was whether the exclusions applied.\u201d <em>Pep Boys </em>v. <em>Cigna Indem. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The endorsement does not limit coverage to claims of product defects. Nor does it exclude coverage when injury results from a vendor\u2019s negligence. Had Sumitomo intended to exclude coverage whenever a claim arose solely out of a vendor\u2019s negligence, it could have expressly stated such an exclusion. See <em>Trustees of Tufts Univ. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass 844, 848-849 (1993), and cases cited. We also reject Sumitomo\u2019s argument that product manufacturers have no reason to insure vendors for anything other than actual product defects. To the contrary, product manufacturers have sound reason for insuring the vendor for the vendor\u2019s own negligence as well as for actual product defects, as such broad coverage removes any incentive for the vendor to \u201cpoint the finger\u201d at the manufacturer when claims arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Even assuming that the endorsement is susceptible to Sumitomo\u2019s interpretation, \u201cwhere \u2018there are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849, quoting <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990). In construing this endorsement, it is also appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ate \u201cto consider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990). We conclude that a reasonable vendor, reading this endorsement\u2019s language, would expect coverage in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">3. <em>Judge\u2019s findings. </em>Sumitomo argues that the judge made a series of erroneous findings to support her conclusion that the minor plaintiff was injured by the unit itself and that Lechmere had not altered it. Pointing to the judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[i]n this case, there are no allegations that Lechmere altered the [unit] in any way whatsoever,\u201d Sumitomo argues that the record unequivocally establishes that Lechmere altered the unit when Lechmere unpacked and assembled it in the store. This argument is without merit, as Sumitomo\u2019s own witness admitted that assembly was required before the unit could be utilized. Moreover, a finding that mere assembly of a product amounts to \u201calteration\u201d of that product would preclude coverage even if the vendor was not negligent and there was a product defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Next, Sumitomo argues that the judge\u2019s original finding that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s injury is not alleged to have been caused by a dangerous condition in the store\u201d is not supported by the record. On Sumitomo\u2019s motion, the judge revised her finding to state that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s injury is alleged to have been caused by Lechmere\u2019s creating a dangerous and unsafe condition for customers in the Lechmere store.\u201d Contrary to Sumitomo\u2019s argument, the revised finding can still support the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe injury was caused by the [unit] itself.\u201d Even assuming the jury found that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by Lechmere\u2019s creating a dangerous and unsafe condition,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the dangerous and unsafe condition was the unit itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the vendor\u2019s endorsement at issue in this case covers the vendor\u2019s own negligence and that the manufacturer\u2019s insurer must indemnify the negligent vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The unit was seventy-two inches high, thirty-six inches wide, and eighteen inches deep; weighed 218 pounds; and consisted of a display pedestal, a twenty-inch JVC television monitor, and a Game Boy interactive demovision display, which housed the software.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Team Marketing, Inc., was dismissed from the case on the allowance of its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\">During the course of the appeal, the duty to defend issue was settled between Sumitomo and Lechmere. Accordingly, it is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by Owen Gallagher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">A number of other jurisdictions have found coverage under the vendor\u2019s endorsement where customers are injured by display products. See Atlantic Mut. Cos. vs. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., U.S. Dist. Ct. No. 02-2241-KHV, slip op. at 5-8 (D. Kan. Jan. 27, 2003) (vendor negligently failed to secure storm door display frame and customer was injured); <em>Home Depot, U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>241 F. Supp. 2d 702, 706-708 (E.D. Tex. 2003), aff\u2019d by unpublished opinion, 85 Fed. Appx. 988 (5th Cir. 2004) (customer injured where rug display rack used for promotional purposes fell); <em>KMart Corp. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>88 F. Supp. 2d 767, 771-775 (E.D. Mich. 2000) (vendor negligently assembled patio furniture for floor display and customer was injured). But see <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>651 So. 2d 806, 807-808 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1995) (coverage denied because demonstration model, which was full size replica of storage unit, was not for sale in normal course of business and, thus, did not constitute product).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The limited exclusion in the policy in this case does not preclude coverage because the exclusion for demonstration operations excepts \u201csuch operations performed at the vendor\u2019s premises in connection with the sale of the product,\u201d and the unit was displayed to stimulate sales of Game Boy products at Lechmere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">AIthough the courts in both cases focused on the language of the endorsement, namely that an insured includes vendors \u201cbut only with respect to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 <em>arising out of </em>[the named insured\u2019s] products . . . which are distributed or sold in the regular course of the vendor\u2019s business\u201d (emphasis supplied), see <em>Sportmart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Daisy Mfg. Co., </em>268 Ill. App. 3d 974, 977 (1994); <em>Pep Boys </em>v. <em>Cigna Indem. Ins. Co., </em>300 N.J. Super. 245, 248 (1997), we do not find the lack of the \u201carising out of\u201d language in this case to be decisive. Without determining whether the \u201cbut only with respect to\u201d language is as broad as \u201carising out of,\u201d we conclude that whatever \u201cwith respect to\u201d means, it certainly includes demonstrations of the named insured\u2019s product on the vendor\u2019s premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">This is unknown, as the jury merely stated that Lechmere was negligent but did not explain in what way it was negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
