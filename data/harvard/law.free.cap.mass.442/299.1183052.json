The defendant was indicted on a charge of being an accessory before the fact to felony murder based on his participation in the planning of the robbery, and he was subsequently convicted by a jury of that charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An important part of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against the defendant was the testimony of two witnesses given pursuant to written cooperation agreements. On appeal, the defendant argues that an incriminating statement made to police at the police station was the result of an unlawful entry into his home and, thus, was inadmissible \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d The defendant also argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s promises of leniency to the cooperating witnesses rendered their testimony unreliable and, thus, the testimony should have been excluded. We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments. We also discern no reason to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, either to reduce the verdict or to order other relief. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The evidence presented by the Commonwealth permitted the jury to find the following facts, which we set forth in some detail. In July of 1999, the defendant, then forty-one years of age, lived with his girlfriend, Yolanda Goyco, and their young daughter in a rented apartment in Holyoke. The defendant\u2019s nineteen year old son, Peter, Jr. (also known as Pedro), was visiting from his home in Puerto Rico. The defendant was not employed and collected Social Security benefits. The defendant needed money because his family was about to be evicted for nonpayment of rent. The defendant spent a substantial amount of time with two friends, Brayan Madera, who was eighteen years of age, and Joseph Gonzalez, who was seventeen. Much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>of this time was spent at Madera\u2019s home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant and Madera sold drugs from there, and Gonzalez testified that he smoked marijuana there. Madera kept a black pellet, or BB, gun at his home, as well as a .22 caliber handgun that the defendant had sold to Gonzalez earlier that summer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Goyco had been employed for approximately one year as a supervisor and cashier at Ocean State Job Lot, one of a chain of outlet stores, located in the K-Mart Plaza in Holyoke. The defendant and Goyco knew that every evening after the store closed, the store\u2019s assistant manager, Luis Torres, drove to the Fleet Bank on Northampton Street in Holyoke to deposit that day\u2019s receipts. He usually left the store between 9:30 and 10 p.m. Store policy dictated that a minimum of two employees were required to make the nightly deposits, and, on Wednesday evenings, it usually fell to Goyco to accompany Torres to the Fleet Bank. When she did so, she often would travel with the defendant in his blue Ford Escort automobile, following Torres, who drove alone in his own vehicle. The defendant and Goyco would watch to ensure Torres\u2019s safety as he made the bank deposit, and then drive away.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">On Wednesday, July 14, 1999, after observing Torres make a routine bank deposit, the defendant joined Gonzalez, Madera, and his son at Madera\u2019s home. The defendant, who was high on drugs, announced that he had a \u201cgood ass plan.\u201d He told the others that Torres made deposits at the Fleet Bank on Northampton Street every evening, and that it would be \u201creal easy\u201d to rob him by just pointing a gun at him to scare him. According to the defendant, Torres was easily frightened and would not chase them.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The next afternoon, the defendant, his son, Gonzalez, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Madera again gathered at Madera\u2019s home. The defendant asked Gonzalez whether he wanted to participate with Madera in the robbery of Torres. The defendant suggested that it could be done with one person watching whichever store employee accompanied Torres, while the other robbed Torres of the money. Madera displayed his BB gun, and Gonzalez agreed to help. The defendant, Madera, and Pedro Cruz then drove to the K-Mart Plaza, where the defendant identified a white Honda in the parking lot as belonging to Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On Friday, July 16, the defendant and his son arrived together at Madera\u2019s home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant announced that this was the night the robbery would take place because there would be a lot of money to deposit on Friday. He cautioned Gonzalez and Madera to \u201cput fear in\u201d Torres. The defendant instructed Gonzalez, who was wearing light colored clothes, to go home and change into darker clothes because he \u201cst[u]ck out.\u201d Gonzalez complied and returned with a backpack in which to put his dark clothes after the robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Gonzalez returned, Madera was wearing dark jeans and a \u201cDesert Storm\u201d hat. The defendant watched as Madera gave Gonzalez the BB gun and kept the .22 caliber handgun for his own use. The defendant gave Gonzalez his pager and told Gonzalez and Madera that he would signal with \u201call fives\u201d when Torres left the K-Mart Plaza parking lot on his way to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The defendant then drove Madera and Gonzalez past the bank, and the defendant pointed out a house on Lynwood Street where he would be waiting for them after the robbery. On the way back to the bank, the defendant reminded Madera and Gonzalez to make sure that Torres was scared when they pulled out their guns. Madera and Gonzalez then got out of the defendant\u2019s car and hid behind a tree. Gonzalez, armed with the BB gun, had a bandana covering his face. Madera, armed with the .22 caliber handgun, was also masked.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>As the defendant watched from the parking lot, Torres left the store that night carrying a bag containing that day\u2019s store receipts. He was accompanied by another employee of Ocean State Job Lot, Michael Sullivan. The defendant sent the prearranged pager signal to Gonzalez and Madera and, a few minutes later, drove by the bank and honked his horn to signal that Torres was on his way. Torres\u2019s white Honda automobile soon pulled up to the bank and parked. As Torres walked toward the night deposit box, Gonzalez and Madera ran up behind him, masks on and guns waving. Gonzalez pointed his gun at Torres and grabbed the deposit bag. Madera pointed his gun at Sullivan, still in the Honda. Madera and Gonzalez then fled on foot. Torres got back into the Honda and pursued them, honking his horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">When Madera and Gonzalez arrived at the designated meeting place, the defendant was not there. The two men separated. Torres chose to follow Madera (who was smaller than Gonzalez) and, leaving his vehicle, jumped a fence and ran into a backyard. Sullivan, in pursuit just behind Torres, heard two shots. Torres died minutes later from a gunshot wound to the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">On July 21, Gonzalez arrived at the Holyoke police station, accompanied by his parents. He gave a statement to police officers admitting his own participation in the robbery and naming the defendant as a participant involved in the planning of the robbery. As a result of Gonzalez\u2019s statement, three detectives received instructions to locate the defendant. They proceeded to his address in order to interview him. Before they did so, at least one of them was informed that the defendant was known to have some suicidal tendencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">When the officers arrived at the defendant\u2019s apartment shortly after 3:30 p.m., they found a note to Goyco taped to the front door indicating that the defendant had gone to a hospital. All of the shades were drawn, and an air conditioner on the second floor was running. The officers knocked loudly on the front and back doors for about five minutes. When there was no response from within, one officer telephoned the nearest hospital and learned that the defendant was not registered there. Another officer spoke with neighbors who told him that they had not seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the defendant all day. One officer noticed a blue automobile parked in front of the defendant\u2019s address, and he confirmed that the vehicle was, in fact, registered to the defendant. The officers eventually gained entry into the defendant\u2019s home when a maintenance worker at the housing complex agreed to use his pass key to unlock the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Finding no one on the first floor, the detectives (who were in plain clothes) went upstairs and approached the closed door of a room from which they heard the humming of the air conditioner. They opened the door and saw a man and a young child who appeared to be asleep on a mattress on the floor. Because the man\u2019s hands were hidden under a pillow, and there was a possibility that he could be armed, two of the officers drew their guns. One officer moved the pillow aside, and, observing that the man was not armed, both officers bolstered their guns. The man awoke, acknowledged that he was Peter Cruz, and agreed to accompany the officers to the police station to answer some questions. The defendant was not handcuffed nor was he under arrest. He appeared calm and alert and asked only that the police find someone to care for the child, whom the defendant identified as his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The officers were unsuccessful in locating a caretaker for the defendant\u2019s daughter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the way to the police station, the officers purchased a \u201cHappy Meal\u201d for the child and a soda for the defendant at a local McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Once at the station, arrangements were made for a family member or friend to come for the child. The defendant, meanwhile, sat with his daughter while she watched television and ate her meal. There were no officers in the room with them, and the defendant was not questioned until after the child had left the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">At about 5:10 p.m., the defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and of his right to use the telephone. The defendant then gave a statement (his first) to police, in which he denied any participation in the robbery. When he had completed making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the statement, he was told that police had some more questions for him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant agreed to wait at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Approximately one and one-half hours later, the defendant received Miranda warnings for the second time that night.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant was advised that Gonzalez had implicated the defendant in the robbery<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that records from the defendant\u2019s pager would demonstrate its use as a signal device. The defendant then told the police officers that he was involved in the robbery, but that he did not intend that anyone get hurt. He agreed to give a second statement, this time admitting his participation in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">At trial, Gonzalez described in detail the defendant\u2019s role in the planning of the robbery. With respect to the murder weapon, Gonzalez testified that the defendant \u201cknew we had the .22 caliber that he gave me.\u201d He also testified to the following events after the robbery, and Torres\u2019s murder, in connection with the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime. According to Gonzalez, the bank deposit bag contained approximately $6,000 in cash and some checks. He and Madera divided the money equally between them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On Sunday, Gonzalez had a chance encounter with the defendant and his son at a convenience store. The defendant told Gonzalez that he \u201cbelieved\u201d Gonzalez had some money for him. The defendant stated (in Gonzalez\u2019s words) that \u201che [the defendant] [was] the one that came up with the plan and that it was his idea; that he\u2019s the one that suggested the scheme, so he felt he should get some money.\u201d Gonzalez told him \u201cno because he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Although the defendant explained that he had been arrested while waiting for Gonzalez and Madera to complete the robbery, Gonzalez testified, \u201cI knew that he was lying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Pedro Cruz testified at trial against his father. He described his own role in the robbery as that of a bystander, who, while playing video games, heard only portions of conversations in which the defendant, Gonzalez, and Madera planned the robbery.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> According to Pedro Cruz, his father wanted to rob Torres himself, but needed help from Gonzalez and Madera because he had a bad back. He testified that, before leaving Madera\u2019s home on the night of the robbery, the three men \u201cslapped hands\u201d and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The defendant, testifying on his own behalf, portrayed a very different picture of the events. He testified that the plan to rob Torres originated with Madera, Gonzalez, and a third person, Tony Gonzalez,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who was a member of a gang and \u201cdangerous.\u201d The defendant further testified that he at first refused to participate in the armed robbery, and eventually agreed only because Gonzalez, Madera, and Tony threatened him and his family. According to the defendant, he was afraid that the three men were going to hurt his family, or even shoot him, if he refused to participate. We now turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">1. The defendant moved to suppress \u201cany statements and all other evidence, whether obtained directly or indirectly as a result\u201d of the warrantless entry by police officers into his home. A judge in the Superior Court (a different judge from the judge who presided at trial) conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion. The motion judge\u2019s findings essentially mirror the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at trial, set forth above, with respect to the officers\u2019 entry into the defendant\u2019s home and the subsequent questioning of the defendant at the police station. The motion judge\u2019s determinations that (1) the purpose of the police in going to the defendant\u2019s home was to locate the defendant and to determine his willingness to talk about the robbery and murder; (2) their entry into the defendant\u2019s home was motivated by the intent to uncover incriminating evidence; and (3) the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>stances did not satisfy the exigency exception to the warrant requirement, are well supported. The judge reasoned, however, that, once the defendant arrived at the police station, the illegal entry notwithstanding, the behavior of the police toward the defendant comported with constitutional requirements. The judge concluded that the police did not exploit their illegal entry to obtain an incriminating statement, but that the administration of Miranda warnings, not once but twice; the passage of four hours between the illegal entry and the defendant\u2019s incriminating statement; the manner of interrogation; and the intervening confrontation of the defendant with the fact that Gonzalez had implicated him in the robbery, which occurred after the defendant made an exculpatory statement, but before he made his self-incriminating statement, \u201ccombined to attenuate the illegality of the [police] entry and purged the defendant\u2019s self-incriminating statement of the primary taint.\u201d We agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion and add two observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">a. The judge correctly decided that the situation facing the police did not justify their entry into the defendant\u2019s home. Although the officers had some knowledge bearing on the fact that the defendant could have been at risk of suicide, it is plain that the officers went to the defendant\u2019s home to question him and not to ensure his safety. The Commonwealth does not now challenge the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe police officers did not have a good faith belief that the defendant was in imminent danger of death or serious injury.\u201d The police officers plainly crossed permissible constitutional bounds when they gained entry into the defendant\u2019s home, entered the defendant\u2019s bedroom, and drew their weapons, as the defendant and his young daughter slept. Entry into the defendant\u2019s home in this manner, without an arrest or a search warrant and in the absence of exigent circumstances, violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 576 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 96 (1997). It does not follow, however, that statements made by the defendant at the police station should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">b. The motion judge did not have the benefit of <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>434 Mass. 370, 377 (2001), which was decided one month after he issued his written memorandum and order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, in which we adopted, under art. 14, principles stated in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>495 U.S. 14 (1990), that \u201cwhere the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, the [Fourth Amendment\u2019s] exclusionary rule does not bar [the admission] of a statement made by the defendant outside of his home, even though the statement is taken after an arrest made in the home in violation of [his rights].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. The facts of this case differ slightly from those in <em>Marquez, </em>because the defendant was not arrested at his home, as was the defendant in <em>Marquez. </em>There is no question, however, that our holding in <em>Marquez, </em>which renders admissible statements made at a police station where a defendant has been taken after an illegal arrest, also includes statements made at a police station by a defendant in this defendant\u2019s circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We repeat, essentially, what was said in <em>Marquez: </em>\u201cupholding otherwise valid statements given by defendants at the police station after ... an invalid [entry], will not cause the police to ignore the <em>Payton </em>rule [prohibiting police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect\u2019s home in order to make a routine felony arrest, see <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, supra]. </em>The penalty for an unlawful [entry] in[to] a defendant\u2019s dwelling is the suppression of anything seized at the time of the [entry], either from the defendant or in the dwelling, and any statements made at the time of the [entry].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquez, supra </em>at 378. A statement made at the station may still be suppressed under a fruit of the poisonous tree analysis, of course, where a connection exists between unlawfully seized evidence or an unlawfully obtained statement, and the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>made at the station. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, 392 </em>Mass. 892, 902 (1984). There was no such connection in this case. The defendant concedes that he received, and understood, his Miranda warnings. The motion properly was denied.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">2. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, to exclude the testimony of Gonzalez and Pedro Cruz, both of whom testified pursuant to cooperation agreements, on the ground that their testimony was procured by the Commonwealth in violation of the witness intimidation statute, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge who ruled on the motion to suppress properly denied the motion without a hearing. The legislative purpose of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, is to protect witnesses from being intimidated or harassed so that they do not become reluctant to give truthful evidence in investigatory or judicial proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgoole, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 87, 90 (2000) (recognizing larger statutory purpose to prevent interference with administration of justice). An essential element of the crime is the offer of a bribe or the use of intimidation, force, or the threat of force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>434 Mass. 155, 157-158 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belle Isle, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 226, 229 (1998). Here, as in essentially all such cooperation agreements, the witness has a valid privilege not to testify under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Offers of leniency, or of a particular resolution of the witness\u2019s own potential criminal culpability, are made to encourage the witness to waive the privilege and to testify at trial. The Commonwealth expects \u2014 and cooperation agreements often explicitly state \u2014 that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>witness will give truthful testimony. Such agreements do not \u201cinterfere\u201d with a witness, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, nor do they run afoul of any of the statute\u2019s underlying purposes. The defendant cites no authority for his proposition that the Commonwealth violated the statute, and, to the extent that he still raises the issue, the claim merits no further discussion. See <em>McCone </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>393 Mass. 231, 236 (1984), citing Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The defendant also claims that the testimony of Gonzalez and Pedro Cruz should have been excluded because promises of consideration by the Commonwealth in return for their cooperation rendered it \u201cirretrievably unreliable.\u201d We disagree. This court has recognized that \u201ctestimony pursuant to a plea [or cooperation] agreement, founded on a promise of truthful cooperation, and the . . . agreement itself are admissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 261 (1989). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>436 Mass. 488, 499-502 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. 91, 95-99 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meuse, </em>423 Mass. 831, 832 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>410 Mass. 521, 524-525 (1991). In the <em>Ciampa </em>decision, we set forth guidelines to be used when a witness testifies pursuant to an agreement with the Commonwealth, in order to minimize the risk that the jury will believe the witness because the Commonwealth, in effect, appears to have guaranteed the truth of the witness\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, supra </em>at 264-266. These guidelines were followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The nature of the challenged testimony was made known to the jury from the outset of trial. In his opening statement, the prosecutor explained that they would hear testimony from Gonzalez and Pedro Cruz pursuant to cooperation agreements with the Commonwealth. The prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Gonzalez during direct examination elicited the fact that Gonzalez had been charged with armed robbery and murder for his participation in the crime, and that Gonzalez had agreed with the Commonwealth to provide evidence against the defendant with the understanding that his cooperation would be taken into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>consideration when the charges against him were resolved.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 264. During cross-examination, the defendant persistently challenged Gonzalez\u2019s credibility and elicited from him his expectation that he likely would be allowed to plead to a reduced charge, or receive a more lenient sentence, because he had agreed to testify against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The questioning of Pedro Cruz proceeded along similar lines. On cross-examination, the defendant elicited Pedro Cruz\u2019s agreement that he repeatedly had denied any knowledge of his father\u2019s involvement in the robbery, and had altered his story only after he entered into the cooperation agreement with the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There was no hint of improper vouching. See <em>id. </em>at 265. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrera, supra </em>at 501; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 233 (1997). Finally, the judge issued a cautionary instruction, as required by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, supra </em>at 266, in his final charge. He told the jury that they should \u201cstudy the testimony of each of these two witnesses with particular care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The jury\u2019s attention clearly was focused on the possibility of bias. The credibility of Gonzalez and Pedro Cruz was a key issue at trial, but the defendant aggressively explored inconsistencies in their testimony and thereby did all he could to weaken the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case in the jury\u2019s eyes. In his closing statement, the defendant argued forcefully to the jury that Gonzalez and Pedro Cruz should not be believed because they had been given a \u201cgreat deal\u201d by the Commonwealth. \u201cThe issue of credibility raised by such inconsistencies \u2018is a question for the jury to decide.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>395 Mass. 336, 353 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 589 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>3. Although the defendant was not tried on an indictment charging murder in the first degree, or convicted of murder in the first degree, the consequences of his convictions are the same. The \u201cpractical effect of [G. L. c. 274, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3] is to hold the criminal actor who participates in a felony hable as a principal without regard to whether the felony is completed or committed by another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. 853, 858 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>358 Mass. 672, 680 (1971). The defendant thus is entitled to plenary review under the standard set by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, in which we examine the appellate record to determine whether there were any errors on the part of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge, that were likely to lead to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>432 Mass. 353, 354 n.1 (2000); <em>Patrick P. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 186, 193 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. An<em>giulo, </em>415 Mass. 502, 509-510 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We conclude that there is no ground on which to order a new trial or to reduce the level of his guilt. The defendant\u2019s presence at the murder scene was not a fact necessary to his conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moure, </em>428 Mass. 313, 317-318 (1998). The jury obviously believed the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence establishing that the defendant masterminded the plan to rob Torres that led to the fatal shooting. The fact that this evidence included testimony procured pursuant to cooperation agreements with the Commonwealth and that was, in part, contradictory, provides no basis for \u00a7 33E relief. Nor is the knowledge that others who carried out the plan may have received lesser sentences for their involvement a permissible basis on which to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>435 Mass. 509, 525-526 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>430 Mass. 252, 259 n.6 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 275 (1995). The defendant received a fair trial and the jury\u2019s verdict is consistent with the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The defendant also was convicted by the same jury on an indictment charging him with being an accessory before the fact to armed robbery while masked. Because the facts supporting this conviction supplied the underlying basis for the murder conviction, the judge properly recognized the duplicative nature of the two offenses and dismissed the conviction of the lesser charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 398 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>420 Mass. 95, 113-114 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that Brayan Madera, who had a history of being placed in foster homes, was staying, in July, 1999, in the owners\u2019 apartment of a two-family house. For simplicity, this opinion will refer to it as Madera\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Pedro Cruz testified that he had delivered the handgun, on behalf of his father, to Gonzalez in an envelope. Gonzalez testified that the defendant personally had given him the handgun, together with fifty bullets in a medicine bottle. Gonzalez subsequently gave the handgun to Madera to keep because, he testified, if his parents had discovered it at his home, he \u201cwould have got into trouble.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The defendant\u2019s cousin was caring for his daughter; he had told Goyco that he was going to New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The backpack, later recovered and turned over to police investigators, also contained Gonzalez\u2019s season pass to a local amusement park, where Gonzalez had visited, with his family, earlier in the day. It was the season pass that led police officers investigating the murder to Gonzalez, and, eventually, to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The officers stopped at the home of one of the defendant\u2019s friends, whom the defendant suggested could watch the child, but no one responded to an officer\u2019s knock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">At some point in the course of making his first statement, or immediately thereafter, the defendant indicated to police officers that he was diabetic and needed to take insulin at 7 p.m. He immediately was assured that this would be arranged, and the defendant, in fact, did take his insulin at the prescribed time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">At 10:30 p.m., the defendant also was advised of, and waived, his right to a prompt arraignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The defendant might have known that Gonzalez was at the police station that night, because, as he was escorted to the men\u2019s room, the defendant passed by an open door of the room where Gonzalez was being interviewed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Gonzalez admitted that he spent a substantial portion of his $3,000 share on clothes and jewelry at the Holyoke Mall that weekend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">When questioned during cross-examination regarding his failure to be truthful in his original statements to police officers, Pedro Cruz stated, \u201cphysically and mentally I didn\u2019t consider myself to be part of that group.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Pedro Cruz testified to the presence of a man named Tony at Madera\u2019s home while the plans for the robbery were being discussed, but did not implicate him as an active participant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The motion judge found that the defendant\u2019s consent to accompany the officers to the station was not freely given, but was the result of the police officers\u2019 exploiting their illegal entry, and, thus, invalid. The defendant, on the other hand, conceded, first in his original statement made to police officers and, again, in his testimony at trial, that he voluntarily agreed to go with the officers to the police station for questioning. We need not resolve the issue of the propriety of the defendant\u2019s presence at the police station. Because, as stated above, the principles expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>434 Mass. 370, 377 (2001), are controlling, the challenged statements are admissible regardless whether the defendant\u2019s presence at the police station was coerced or an act of his own free will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, on its face, included both statements that he gave to the police. The judge\u2019s memorandum addressed only the second. Both statements were admitted in evidence at trial. No objection was raised at trial, nor does the defendant now claim error in the admission of his first statement, in which he stated he \u201caccepted to come down to the police station\u201d and in which, by his own testimony, he lied in denying any knowledge of the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">General Laws c. 268, \u00a7 13B, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cWhoever, directly or indirectly, willfully endeavors by . . . intimidation, force or express or implied threats of force to influence, impede, obstruct, delay or otherwise interfere with . . . any person furnishing information to a criminal investigator relating to a violation of a criminal statute . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The trial transcript indicates that the prosecutor sought to introduce a copy of the written cooperation agreement between Gonzalez and the Commonwealth, but the judge sustained an objection to this evidence. The agreement subsequently was marked for purposes of identification only and was not before the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The written cooperation agreement between Pedro Cruz and the Commonwealth was marked for purposes of identification but was never offered in evidence. The record shows that each written agreement was in the form of a letter addressed to the respective attorney of Gonzalez or Pedro Cruz, on the letterhead of the office of the district attorney, and signed by an assistant district attorney, the witness, and his attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYq\">(concurring, with whom Marshall, C.J., joins). Recognizing that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>434 Mass. 370, 377 (2001), is the law, I continue to disagree with the holding in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 379 (Cowin, J., dissenting). I concur in the result reached by the court because the motion to suppress was rightly denied on another ground. The evidence was not obtained by \u201cexploitation of [the primary] illegality [but] instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963), quoting Maguire, Evidence of Guilt 221 (1959). The motion judge correctly concluded that the confession was the product of the defendant\u2019s free will based on a consideration of the relevant factors set forth in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 602-604 (1975), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 258 (1982), including (1) the giving of Miranda warnings, (2) the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, (3) the presence of intervening circumstances, and (4) the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. The statement was thus sufficiently attenuated from the illegal act to be \u201cpurged of the primary taint,\u201d see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>396 Mass. 455, 459 (1985), and was therefore independently admissible.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
