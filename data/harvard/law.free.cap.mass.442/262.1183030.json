We conclude that the motion judge correctly suppressed the confession itself, but that statements made prior to specific acts of coercive police conduct were voluntary, and can be admitted in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">1. <em>Background. </em>Rui Novo stands indicted for murder in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>first degree, stemming from the death of Joshua Santos, the two year old son of Novo\u2019s girl friend, Melissa Santos. Novo and Santos brought Joshua to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in New Bedford on April 1, 2003, where he later died. Joshua\u2019s subsequent autopsy revealed severe bruising and internal injuries, and that his death was a homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On April 3, 2003, State police Detective William Serpa contacted Santos and Novo and asked them to come to the police station for an interview concerning Joshua\u2019s death; Novo and Santos agreed, and Serpa drove Novo to the New Bedford police station, while other officers took Santos to the State police detective unit in New Bedford. Serpa and Officer Christopher Cotter of the New Bedford police interviewed Novo, and the entire interview was recorded on videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">At the beginning of the interview, Serpa read Novo the Miranda warnings from a New Bedford police department waiver of rights form. After reading each right, Serpa asked Novo if he understood, and in each instance Novo responded, \u201cYes.\u201d When Serpa described the rights as \u201cMiranda rights,\u201d Novo nodded, indicating his familiarity with the term. One of the rights given was as follows: \u201c[I]f you decide to answer any questions now, with or without an attorney, you still have the right to stop the questioning at any time for the purpose of consulting an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Novo agreed to answer the officers\u2019 questions and, after providing background information, gave a detailed account of his activities from the afternoon of Monday, March 31, 2003, through his arrival at the hospital on Tuesday, April 1, 2003. Novo made clear that Joshua had been with him and Santos exclusively at all times. Although Joshua did not appear ill during the day Monday, he complained of being tired and went to bed at 6 p.m. Monday evening. When Novo checked on Joshua around 8 p.m., he found Joshua lying in his bed in a puddle of vomit. Novo bathed Joshua, Santos cleaned up the vomit, and Joshua was put back to bed. At approximately 7:45 a.m. the following morning, Novo found Joshua watching television in the living room, and there were puddles of vomit on the coffee table and carpet. Joshua vomited several more times during the day, once when Santos tried to give him a vitamin milkshake, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>and several more times in various rooms in Novo\u2019s apartment. Novo and Santos then brought Joshua to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">At this point in the interview, the officers left the room for several minutes. When they returned, Serpa showed Novo photographs of Joshua\u2019s body and questioned him about the source of the numerous bruises that were evident. Novo stated that he had seen bruises on Joshua before but believed them to be from rough play. Serpa then informed Novo that Joshua had undergone an autopsy, and that the cause of death was \u201cmassive, massive injuries from beatings.\u201d Novo repeatedly stated that he never beat Joshua, and Serpa responded by stating that this was Novo\u2019s \u201conly opportunity\u201d to explain the bruises and that Novo could not \u201chelp [him] self any other time but right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Serpa then used a number of techniques in an attempt to convince Novo to admit that he caused Joshua\u2019s bruises. First, he falsely told Novo that Santos was \u201cgiving a statement right now\u201d and \u201ctalking about all sorts of abuse,\u201d falsely stated that the medical examiner had taken fingerprints from the bruises and that the officers had \u201cdone the measurements\u201d on Novo\u2019s fingerprints and \u201c[i]t\u2019s you,\u201d and expressed empathy as a parent for the frustration of dealing with a vomiting child. Novo continued, however, to deny that he was responsible for Joshua\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Then Serpa focused on the effect that Novo\u2019s failure to confess would have on a subsequent criminal prosecution, telling him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t give us a reason [for hitting Joshua], Roy,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] if you don\u2019t give us a reason right now why you did this, a jury\u2019s never going to hear a reason.\u201d This \u201cnow-or-never\u201d theme \u2014 that if Novo did not offer a reason for hitting Joshua to Serpa, he would be unable to offer a reason to a jury later \u2014 continued through the remainder of the interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Finally, several minutes later, Serpa explained that a convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tian of murder in the first degree carried a life sentence, and stated, \u201cYou don\u2019t give yourself a reason why this happened, Roy, you\u2019re going first-degree murder. You\u2019re going life in prison without parole.\u201d This theme \u2014 that, unless Novo offered an explanation, he would be charged with murder in the first degree \u2014 also reappeared throughout the remainder of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">More than two hours into the interview, Novo stated that he \u201csuppose[d]\u201d that he caused the injuries to Joshua. Shortly thereafter, he admitted causing them, and was placed under arrest and charged with Joshua\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Novo moved to suppress all of his statements, and, after a hearing at which Serpa testified and the videotape was played, a Superior Court judge granted the motion. The Commonwealth sought leave to proceed with an interlocutory appeal, and a single justice of this court allowed the interlocutory appeal and transferred the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>Typically, \u201c[i]n reviewing whether a statement was made voluntarily, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact unless not warranted by the evidence,\u201d and the \u201cjudge\u2019s ultimate findings, while open for review, are afforded \u2018substantial deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 145, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). In this case, however, the judge\u2019s findings are based almost exclusively on the videotape of Novo\u2019s confession, and \u201cwe are in the same position as the [motion] judge in viewing the videotape.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>420 Mass. 569, 578 n.7 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We have consistently held that lower court findings based on documentary evidence available to an appellate court are not entitled to deference. \u201cA judge who has seen and heard the witnesses is in a better position to determine their credibility than is a court which is confined to the printed record. The situation is different in regard to findings made upon written evidence. In that respect this court stands in the same position as did the trial judge, and reaches its own conclusion unaffected by the findings made by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Kyes, </em>304 Mass. 56, 57 (1939). This principle applies whenever the evidence before the trial court is reduced to a tangible form, and is therefore available to the appellate court in the same form as it was reviewed by the trial court. For example, neither findings based on transcripts of deposition testimony, see <em>Guempel </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 845, 848 (1981), nor findings concerning the \u201ccontent and significance\u201d of photographs, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. 708, 714 n.15 (2002), are entitled to deference. Therefore, we will \u201ctake an independent view\u201d of recorded confessions and make judgments with respect to their contents without deference to the fact finder, who \u201cis in no better position to evaluate the[ir] content and significance.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">b. <em>Voluntariness in the totality of the circumstances. </em>\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>test for voluntariness of a confession is \u2018whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, the will of the defendant was overborne to the extent that the statement was not the result of a free and voluntary act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 395, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 663 (1995). \u201cThe Commonwealth . . . bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that, in the totality of the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s statements were made voluntarily.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>432 Mass. 82, 85 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u201cA statement is voluntary if it is \u2018the product of a rational intellect and a free will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>403 Mass. 575, 581 (1988). In evaluating the voluntariness of a statement, we consider a number of factors \u201cincluding promises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence and emotional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or the police), and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986). Additionally, the \u201cuse of false information by police during an interrogation is deceptive and is a relevant factor indicating a possibility that the defendant\u2019s statements were made involuntarily.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, supra </em>at 664. With these factors in mind, we turn to the specifics of Novo\u2019s interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Although the officers used a variety of interrogation techniques, one that emerged approximately ninety minutes into the interview was that this would be Novo\u2019s \u201conly opportunity\u201d to offer an explanation for why he hit Joshua. Once introduced, this now-or-never theme persisted up to and through Novo\u2019s confession. Soon after it was introduced, Serpa explicitly linked it to Novo\u2019s rights to testify and to present a defense when he told Novo, \u201cIf you don\u2019t give us a reason, Roy, if you don\u2019t give us a reason right now why you did this, a jury\u2019s never go<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ing to hear a reason.\u201d Thereafter, Serpa repeatedly conveyed the message that, unless Novo offered a reason for injuring Joshua during the interview, he would not be able to offer any reason to a jury at a subsequent criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Serpa\u2019s statements were plainly untrue. Regardless of whether Novo offered an explanation to the officers, he would be entitled to present a defense to the jury. Far from a privilege contingent on making a statement to interrogators, \u201c[t]he right to testify on one\u2019s own behalf in a criminal case is fundamental.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 335 (2000). See art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution (\u201cAnd every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be favorable to him; to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by himself, or his counsel, at his election\u201d). Nevertheless, the officers persisted, suggesting over and over again that Novo\u2019s right to tell his side of the story to a jury was conditioned on his revealing it to them during the interview: e.g., \u201cIf you don\u2019t give us a reason ... a jury\u2019s never going to hear a reason\u201d; \u201cIf you don\u2019t give us the reason ... a jury\u2019s never going to hear your side of the story\u201d; \u201cif you don\u2019t, Roy, they\u2019re not going to hear it\u201d; \u201cGive your version of the story now, or they\u2019re not going to understand what happened\u201d; \u201cSo if you can\u2019t explain what happened, [the autopsy pictures are] all they\u2019re going to show.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Commonwealth justifies these statements as explanations by the officers that the videotape recorded interview would be the defendant\u2019s last opportunity to explain <em>to them, </em>not to the jury, what had happened. Such a characterization is belied by the officers\u2019 plain language. The officers explicitly referred to the jury throughout the latter part of the interview, and continually reinforced the notion that the interview was Novo\u2019s only opportunity to tell his story to <em>anyone.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The misrepresentation of Novo\u2019s right to defend himself at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>trial, repeated incessantly, is a particularly egregious intrusion on rights that art. 12 declares to be fundamental.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is different in degree from false statements regarding the strength or existence of incriminating evidence, which we have criticized, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>377 Mass. 319, 328 n.8 (1979), but not always found to be determinative of voluntariness, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 671 (1995). It is conduct that casts substantial doubt on the voluntariness of a subsequent confession and on the integrity of the interrogation process leading up to it. This doubt would be extremely difficult for the Commonwealth to overcome in any case, and it has not done so here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Because we conclude that the repeated misrepresentation of Novo\u2019s trial rights irretrievably tainted his confession, we need not determine whether any implied assurance of leniency made to Novo crossed the line we set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>or whether misrepresentations regarding the type and strength of the evidence against him were themselves sufficiently egregious as to cast serious doubt on the confession\u2019s voluntariness. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 674; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, supra </em>at 664. The confession was therefore properly suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">c. <em>Scope of exclusion. </em>The motion judge did not specifically address whether any other part of the statement made by Novo during his videotape recorded interview might be admissible. A judge reviewing a recording of a complete interrogation may be in a position to make a more precise judgment concerning the scope of the excluded statement than could be made if the judge needed to rely solely on testimony to piece together its contents. Specifically, the judge may be able to determine with some precision the point at which the defendant\u2019s statements ceased to be voluntary, and, consequently, render a more finely calibrated ruling regarding the admissibility of some of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Here, the introduction of the \u201cnow-or-never\u201d theme linked to Novo\u2019s right to testify came more than ninety minutes into the interview.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Up to that point, Novo continued to deny culpability in Joshua\u2019s death, but did provide some information concerning his ostensible care of Joshua during the final day of his life and articulated the view that bruises on Joshua were the product of rough play. We conclude that until Serpa told Novo, \u201ca jury\u2019s never going to hear a reason,\u201d Novo\u2019s statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Because statements made by Novo before this point were voluntary, we must assess whether there is any other bar to their admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">i. <em>Statements about Novo\u2019s Miranda rights. </em>As the motion judge correctly concluded, Serpa \u201cmisstated the defendant\u2019s Miranda rights when he said, \u2018if you decide to answer any questions now, with or without an attorney, you still have the right to stop the questioning at any time for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>consulting an attorney.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWe do not require that the defendant be informed of his right to terminate questioning, a so-called \u2018fifth\u2019 Miranda warning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 688 n.11 (2001), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>426 Mass. 76, 81 (1997). Nonetheless, the \u201cdetails of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings,\u201d are relevant in determining whether a confession is voluntary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986). Put another way, although a police officer is not <em>required </em>to give the fifth Miranda warning, if the officer gives the warning and gets it wrong, the incorrect statement of rights may affect the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Commonwealth contends that the advice as given was entirely correct. Novo could terminate questioning \u201cfor the purpose of consulting an attorney\u201d \u2014 and he could also terminate questioning for any other purpose. While the Commonwealth may be right as a technical matter of grammar and syntax, an ordinary person who hears the statement, \u201cyou still have the right to stop the questioning at any time for the purpose of consulting an attorney\u201d would not interpret it to mean that he can terminate questioning for any reason. Rather, the statement plainly implies that the <em>only </em>reason that a defendant may terminate questioning is to speak to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Nevertheless, we conclude that the misstatement of Novo\u2019s fifth Miranda right likely had no effect on the voluntariness of his subsequent statement. The misstated warning came at the beginning of the interview, and Novo\u2019s demeanor as he mechanically acknowledged each warning indicates that he was fully aware of his Miranda rights from other encounters with the police and was not hstening carefully to the language of the warnings. It is unlikely that the isolated misstatement materially affected his decision to speak to the officers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">ii. <em>Failure to inform Novo of his right to use the telephone. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The motion judge concluded that the officers inadvertently failed to inform Novo of his right to use the telephone pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">\u201cThe police official in charge of the station or other place of detention having a telephone wherein a person is held in custody, shall permit the use of the telephone, at the expense of the arrested person, for the purpose of allowing the arrested person to communicate with his family or friends, or to arrange for release on bail, or to engage the services of an attorney. Any such person shall be informed forthwith upon his arrival at such station or place of detention, of his right to so use the telephone, and such use shall be permitted within one hour thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">As we have recently reaffirmed, \u00a7 33A only requires a police official to inform a person of the right to use the telephone after that person has been formally arrested. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>441 Mass. 358, 374 (2004). Here, Novo was not formally arrested until after the interview. There was no violation of \u00a7 33A that would affect the voluntariness or admissibility of Novo\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In sum, the videotape clearly indicates that Novo heard and waived his Miranda rights, and that he made no attempt to assert his right to remain silent at any earlier point in the interview.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the portion of Novo\u2019s statement made prior to Serpa\u2019s introduction of the \u201cnow-or-never\u201d theme was made voluntarily after a valid waiver of Novo\u2019s Miranda rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That portion of his statement should not have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, the motion judge\u2019s order is modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>fled to suppress only those statements made after Detective Serpa stated, \u201ca jury\u2019s never going to hear a reason,\u201d and, as so modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Novo informed the officers that he goes by both \u201cRui\u201d and \u201cRoy,\u201d and Serpa and Cotter referred to Novo as \u201cRoy\u201d throughout the interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Serpa and Cotter echoed the now-or-never theme eighteen additional times over the course of the remainder of the interview, twelve of which explicitly made reference to the jury never hearing Novo\u2019s story unless he told it to the officers: \u201cIf you don\u2019t give us the reason why this happened, Roy, a jury\u2019s never going to hear your side of the story, and all they\u2019re going to see are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>these [autopsy] pictures\u201d; \u201cthis is your one opportunity to help yourself out\u201d; \u201cThis is your one opportunity, Roy\u201d; \u201cThis is your one opportunity, Roy, to explain what happened\u201d; \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re not going to have any way of explaining what happened.

That testimony focused primarily on events leading up to the videotape recorded interview and on the information known to police at the time of the interview. When asked about the specifics of the interview itself, Serpa explicitly deferred to the videotape. Our review of those parts of the motion judge\u2019s findings based on Serpa\u2019s testimony is constrained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>normal, deferential standard of review: We will not overturn such subsidiary findings unless we determine that they are \u201cnot warranted by the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">At one point, Serpa implied (correctly) that Novo would be permitted to testify, even if he does not confess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cAll they\u2019re going to see is this damage.

You\u2019re never going to be able to tell your side of the story. <em>And if you do, </em>they\u2019re going to say it\u2019s bullshit, because you\u2019ve had all this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>time and now you come forward. They\u2019re going to say, \u2018Why the hell didn\u2019t he say it then?\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">This one statement, however, does not mitigate the over-all effect of the officers\u2019 repeated claims that Novo would not be permitted to tell his story to the jury unless he told it to them during the interview. A person in Novo\u2019s position would certainly take the officers\u2019 statements to mean that he would not be permitted to tell the jury anything that he is not prepared to admit during the interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\">This is not to say that any interrogation technique in which officers stress that the interview is the defendant\u2019s only opportunity to speak <em>to the police </em>is invalid. The officers in this case might have properly (and truthfully) told Novo, \u201cThis is your only chance to talk to us,\u201d or, \u201cThis is your only opportunity to tell your story to us so that we can help you.\u201d It is the repeated use of misinformation concerning a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to testify that rendered the interrogation in this case improperly coercive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The Commonwealth contends that Novo\u2019s \u201cextensive familiarity with the criminal justice system, having been previously arraigned on twenty-six charges,\u201d offsets the effect of the officers\u2019 statements concerning his right to testify. This claim is belied by Novo\u2019s statements and behavior during the interview. Although Serpa unambiguously told Novo that he was going to be arrested, Novo was nonetheless surprised to learn that he would have to go to court after confessing: \u201cBut I have to go to court? . . . Why?\u201d Novo\u2019s lack of understanding about this fundamental aspect of criminal procedure \u2014 that an accused must appear in court \u2014 demonstrates that, despite Novo\u2019s experiences in the criminal justice system, he could not be expected, in the face of the officers\u2019 now-or-never theme, to understand that he had a constitutional right to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Before making his first statement about the jury, Serpa did state several times that the interview was Novo\u2019s \u201conly opportunity\u201d to help himself. In the context of the interrogation, this claim plainly indicated that this was Novo\u2019s only opportunity to justify his actions to police. Novo\u2019s right to testify was only implicated after Serpa first mentioned the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Serpa\u2019s misstatement of the so-called \u201cfifth\u201d Miranda right does not render Novo\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights invalid, because \u201c[w]e do not require that the defendant be informed of his right to terminate questioning, a so-called \u2018fifth\u2019 Miranda warning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 688 n.11 (2001), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>426 Mass. 76, 81 (1997). As we have discussed, the misstatement is relevant only for its impact on the voluntariness of Novo\u2019s confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Several times after Serpa introduced the \u201cnow-or-never\u201d theme, Novo asked the officers to arrest him. The motion judge concluded that, in the circumstances, \u201cthese statements did not constitute a proper exercise of the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent.\u201d We need not reach this issue, because all of Novo\u2019s requests to be arrested came <em>after </em>Serpa improperly introduced the \u201cnow-or-never\u201d theme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Specifically, all of Novo\u2019s statements are admissible up through and including, \u201cI did not touch that kid,\u201d approximately one hour and thirty-five minutes into his recorded interview. All of Novo\u2019s subsequent statements, which occur after Serpa\u2019s statement, \u201cIf you don\u2019t give us a reason, Roy, if you don\u2019t give us a reason right now why you did this, a jury\u2019s never going to hear a reason,\u201d should be suppressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
