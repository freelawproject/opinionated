The case involves a challenge under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution to an amendment to the sex offender act, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q (act), that requires the board to publish on the Internet \u201csex offender information,\u201d relating only to level three sex offenders. See St. 2003, c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 11-14 (Internet legislation). We affirm the order of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The background of the case is as follows. Each plaintiff, after an evidentiary hearing before the board, was designated by the board as a level three sex offender,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was required to register as such with the board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C, 178E, 178K, 178L. On May 13, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a verified complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting, as far as relevant here, the board from \u201cposting [the] plaintiffs\u2019 sex offender registration information on any internet website.\u201d The lawsuit was prompted by the Governor\u2019s announcement on April 2; 2003, that, beginning on May 15, 2003, the board would post level three sex offender registration information on an Internet website maintained by the board. A Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction enjoining the board from \u201cposting offender-specific registration information on the Internet.\u201d The judge concluded that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits because the act had not authorized <em>Internet </em>posting or dissemination of sex offender registration information.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Subsequently, in June, 2003, the Governor filed the proposed Internet legislation. 2003 House Doc. No. 3885. The Internet legislation was enacted as emergency legislation, and took effect, on November 26, 2003. See St. 2003, c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 11-14. Section 5 of St. 2003, c. 140, the primary section of the Internet legislation, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding sections 178C to 178P, inclusive, or any other general or special law to the contrary and in addition to any responsibility otherwise imposed upon the board, the board shall make the sex offender information contained in the sex offender registry, delineated below in subsections (i) to (viii), inclusive, available for inspection by the general public in the form of a comprehensive database published on the internet, known as the \u2018sex offender internet database\u2019; provided, however, that no registration data relating to a sex offender given a level 1 or level 2 designation by the board under section 178K shall be published in the sex offender internet database but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>may be disseminated by the board as otherwise permitted by said sections 178C to 178P, inclusive; and provided further, that the board shall keep confidential and shall not publish in the sex offender internet database any information relating to requests for registration data under sections 1781 and 178J:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">\u201c(i) the name of the sex offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201c(ii) the offender\u2019s home address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201c(in) the offender\u2019s work address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">\u201c(iv) the offense for which the offender was convicted or adjudicated and the date of the conviction or adjudication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201c(v) the sex offender\u2019s age, sex, race, height, weight, eye and hair color;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">\u201c(vi) a photograph of the sex offender, if available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">\u201c(vii) whether the sex offender has been designated a sexually violent predator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">\u201c(viii) whether the offender is in compliance with the registration obligations of sections 178C to 178P, inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">\u201cAll information provided to the general public through the sex offender internet database shall include a warning regarding the criminal penalties for use of sex offender registry information to commit a crime or to engage in illegal discrimination or harassment of an offender and the punishment for threatening to commit a crime under section 4 of chapter 275. The sex offender internet database shall be updated regularly, based on information available to the board and shall be open to searches by the public at any time without charge or subscription. The board shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement, update and maintain such a sex offender internet database, to ensure the accuracy, integrity and security of information contained therein, to ensure the prompt and complete removal of registration data for persons whose duty to register has terminated or expired under section 178G, 178L or 178M or any other law and to protect against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>inaccurate, improper or inadvertent publication of registration data on the internet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Users of the proposed website established by the board may search (at no charge) for registration information about level three sex offenders by last name; by town, city, zip code, or county where the level three sex offender resides or works; or by a specific category, namely level three sex offenders who are not in compliance with their registration obligations. The board posts the following paragraphs on the website\u2019s \u201cUser Acknowledgment and Acceptance\u201d page, requiring users of the site to \u201cagree\u201d to the text of the third paragraph before being able to search for information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cINFORMATION SHALL <em>NOT </em>BE USED TO COMMIT A CRIME OR TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENTS OF AN OFFENDER.

If a level three sex offender is not in compliance with his or her registration obligations, the \u201cLevel 3 Sex Offender \u2014 Detail Flyer\u201d page will display \u201cOFFENDER IS IN VIOLATION\u201d in the address portion of the page.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The level three sex offender registration information contained on the website comes from level three sex offenders, who provide the information to police officers when they register at local police departments. See \u00a7 178F V2; 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.30 (2004). Police officers enter the information in a computer terminal connected to the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS), which transmits the information through CJIS directly into the board\u2019s sex offender registry computer database. Both the police and the board are required to update the board\u2019s sex offender registry computer database when certain registration information changes (e.g., a sex offender provides a new address or a sex offender\u2019s obligation to register expires). Based on the Internet legislation, the board, on January 12, 2004 (after it had promulgated policies and regulations required by St. 2003, c. 140, \u00a7 5) moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction. A different Superior Court judge allowed the motion and also allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a stay to seek review of her order.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">1. In determining whether the preliminary injunction was properly dissolved, we review \u201cwhether the judge abused her discretion, which includes considering whether she applied proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 2), </em>425 Mass. 217, 219 (1997) <em>(Doe [No. </em>2]), citing <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 615 (1980). As in <em>Doe (No. 2), supra, </em>this case presents a question of law on a limited factual record that does not implicate credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>2. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 143 (1997), we concluded that the plaintiff, a level one sex offender, had \u201csufficient liberty and privacy interests constitutionally protected by art. 12 that he is entitled to procedural due process before he may be required to register [as a sex offender under the act] and before information may properly be publicly disclosed about him.\u201d A combination of circumstances led us to draw this conclusion, namely \u201c(1) the requirement that [the sex offender] register with local police; (2) the disclosure of accumulated personal information on request; (3) the possible harm to his earning capacity; (4) the harm to his reputation; and most important, (5) the statutory branding of him as a public danger, a sex offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144. We have been, and are, aware of the range of potential adverse consequences to level three sex offenders who are required to register with the board. That there may be additional adverse consequences to the plaintiffs resulting from <em>Internet </em>dissemination of their sex offender registration information<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not increase the State due process protection due to them. The judge correctly concluded that the plaintiffs have received the process that was due through notice and a fair hearing prior to their designations as level three sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>offenders as required by the act and case law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and prior to any registration information being made available for dissemination.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The plaintiffs also argue that publication of their sex offender registration information over the Internet (on the board\u2019s website) violates art. 12 because \u201c[w]orld-wide internet dissemination is not \u2018carefully calibrated\u2019 to serv[e] a public safety interest\u201d and is overly broad because publication is not targeted to reach persons supposedly threatened by them. The plaintiffs are faced with the rule that the Internet legislation is presumed to be constitutional, and that to defeat the presumption, they must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute does not bear a \u201creasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective.\u201d <em>Rushworth </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>413 Mass. 265, 270 (1992). See <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>416 Mass. 698, 703 (1993). The plaintiffs have not satisfied this heavy burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Any crime is an offense against the public as well as a violation of the victim\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>120 Mass. 403, 407 (1876). Sexual crimes are particularly odious in nature and damaging in their consequences. Level three sex offenders are the most dangerous of all sex offenders, having been adjudged at a high risk of reoffense. Level three sex offenders are not prohibited from leaving their residences or places of employment, and are not restricted in traveling in and outside of the Commonwealth, with the result that their potential future victims may be anywhere. In view of these facts, the Legislature\u2019s choice of Internet dissemination of only level three sex offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>registration information bears a real and substantial relation to protecting the public health and safety by notifying the public about dangerous offenders who live and work in the Commonwealth, and who are not necessarily residing or working in a potential victim\u2019s neighborhood or community. See <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>307 Mass. 408, 418 (1940). Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, widespread public access of level three sex offender information is an \u201capt fit\u201d to contemporary life. Such a sex offender can be in Pittsfield today, Springfield tomorrow, Boston the day after, and elsewhere the next day. Offenders may themselves use the Internet to establish contact with future victims. In addition to the mobility of level three sex offenders, potential victims, including children, do not always stay in their home communities. Internet dissemination of level three sex offender information effectively allows the communication of information to help protect victims and others in a practical way.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The Internet legislation serves another important public safety goal, notifying the public of those level three sex offenders who are in violation of their registration requirement so that they may be apprehended. See St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 1. Limited <em>community-only </em>dissemination of level three sex offender registration information reduces the likelihood of apprehending such offenders because they may be living outside of their home communities. Without Internet dissemination, the efficacy of this aspect of the act could be compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Although worldwide access of level three sex offender registration information may be possible, the board\u2019s website serves to confine its reach by means of its clear and specific warnings on improper use and required acknowledgment that any user is requesting the information for his or her own protection or for the protection of a child or another person for whom he or she has responsibility, care, or custody, and believes that he or she is likely to encounter an offender. In concluding that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act, which makes certain sex offender information open to the public by way of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Internet,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is not punitive, the United States Supreme Court described Internet notification as a \u201cpassive\u201d notification system. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 105 (2003). The Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">\u201cAn individual seeking the information must take the initial step of going to the Department of Public Safety\u2019s Web site, proceed to the sex offender registry, and then look up the desired information. The process is more analogous to a visit to an official archive of criminal records than it is to a scheme forcing an offender to appear in public with some visible badge of past criminality. The Internet makes the document search more efficient, cost effective, and convenient for Alaska\u2019s citizenry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 99. These comments apply to the board\u2019s website.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Finally, as other courts have observed, the farther removed an individual is from Massachusetts geographically, the less likely it is that that person would consult the Internet to obtain information from the board\u2019s website. See <em>Femedeer </em>v. <em>Haun, </em>227 F.3d 1244, 1253 (10th Cir. 2000) (explaining, in rejecting claim that Utah\u2019s sex offender Internet notification imposed consequences on offenders that were excessive in relation to public safety benefits, that \u201cthe dangers resulting from widespread availability are negated by the decreasing likelihood that the information will actually be obtained\u201d). \u201c[A]s a practi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>cal matter, the <em>actual </em>audience for the information is essentially self-defining and self-limiting: The information will be obtained by people who choose to seek it. Bluntly, although the information could, in the abstract, be available to millions of people, the vast majority of those who will take the time and effort to obtain the information will be those who fall within the statute\u2019s remedial ambit, particularly including parents or others responsible for young children who might come into contact with the offender.\u201d <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Board of Parole &amp; Post-Prison Supervision, </em>181 Or. App. 565, 577-578 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">To sum up: each individual is guaranteed by art. 12 a significant measure of privacy free from governmental invasion (or intrusion by others) and an equally significant right of liberty. But, our Constitution also protects the right of our citizens as a whole, and the right of each individual, to be safe and secure from criminal and predatory acts of others. We do not five in a utopian society. By reason of the necessities of the situation, the registration information of level three sex offenders, lawfully determined to pose a high risk of danger to others, may be posted on the Internet to protect society, and in authorizing the posting, with careful safeguards, the Legislature has acted reasonably to promote a proper public objective. For the reasons stated, the judge correctly determined that the plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits and, on that ground, did not abuse her discretion in dissolving the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">3. The order dissolving the preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\">A level three sex offender is a designation given to a \u201c[s]ex offender,\u201d as defined in G.

See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 1781. Such requests must identify an individual \u201cby name, date of birth or sufficient personal identifying characteristics,\u201d and must be made by persons eighteen years of age or older who state that he or she \u201cis requesting sex offender registry information for his own protection or for the protection of a child under the age of 18 or another person for whom the requesting person has responsibility, care or custody.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The statement \u201cIndividuals are <em>not </em>wanted by police\u201d was removed from the website because the statement would not be applicable to offenders who are in violation of their registration requirements, and because an offender may otherwise be wanted by the police for reasons unknown to the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The adverse consequences resulting to the plaintiffs to date have come from neighbors and from incidents in the communities in which they live and work. These consequences flow from the sex offender registration information dissemination provisions that already exist in the act. See \u00a7\u00a7 1781, 178J, 178K (2) (c). Such consequences cannot be said to be exacerbated by Internet dissemination when the information available on the Internet is already accessible, or is actively disseminated, under the above cited provisions of the act. Any consequences resulting from any method of dissemination of registration information are the result of the level three sex offender\u2019s crimes. Concerning adverse consequences resulting from dissemination to those who would not otherwise be eligible to the information under \u00a7\u00a7 1781 and 1781, or pursuant to \u00a7 178K (2) (c), the plaintiffs offer only speculation regarding possible adverse consequences, such as possible terrorism from an expansive \u201cpool of potential vigilantes\u201d in nearby municipalities, possible solicitation by pomographers, possible solicitation by other sex offenders, and the possible creation of unauthorized rogue websites. That other individuals may misuse registration information does not render the dissemination of that information unconstitutional. As is the case under \u00a7\u00a7 1781 and 178J, all persons using the board\u2019s website will receive a warning regarding the criminal penalties for misusing the information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 146 (1997) (holding that the plaintiff \u201cis entitled to a hearing and a determination as to whether he must register under the act and, if so, whether sex offender information concerning him should be available on request\u201d).
