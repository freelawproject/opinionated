The plaintiff offered to surrender his policy on February 19, 1909, and demanded payment of $1,800, and alleges that his equitable proportion of the equation fund as provided in the policy amounted to $1,800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">The case is somewhat complicated by reason of the nature of the provisions of the policy, and is not made more easy of comprehension by the fact that we have four affidavits of defense. The policy does not promise the plaintiff $1,800 on February 19, 1909, but only an \u201cequitable proportion of the equation fund,\u201d and the only mention of $1,800 is a statement that this equitable proportion, estimated according to the-tabulated experience of thirty American offices, would amount to that sum. Plaintiff alleges that his equitable proportion of the equation fund is $1,800, and the defendant says that it is not, but is only $426.60. The plaintiff claims that this indicates a deficiency in the equation fund, which under a condition of the policy should have been made good by a pro rata assessment upon the members of the association, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to which the defendant replies that the deficiency referred to in the policy for which an assessment is to be made would occur only when the equation fund would be insufficient to equalize the increasing cost due to advancing age, or if the proportion of such fund properly belonging to such policy shall at any time not equal the difference between the present worth of the future payments and the sum insured, and that this contingency has not occurred, but that the equation fund during the probable life of the insured was always sufficient for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\">If this be true and it is a matter of fact, the affidavit of defense would appear to be sufficient to prevent judgment. The rule is, therefore, discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was order discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-6\"><em>M. H. Stevenson, </em>with him <em>Wm. C. Boyd, </em>for appellant.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap3H\">The defendant expressly <em>agreed </em>that if the policy be legally surrendered on February 19, 1909, \u201c said member shall receive as a cash disability benefit an equitable proportion of the equation fund\u201d estimated at 11,800. Condition seven provides that any deficiency in this fund shall be made good by assessments, payable \u201cwithin thirty days from the date of notice of same.\u201d Defendant admits that it has been drawing from this fund continuously to pay death losses on other risks. No notice of this fact was given to plaintiff; no assessments were called to \u201cmake good the deficiencies.\u201d These withdrawals from the equation fund were practically secret assessments against plaintiff. The company claims that these secret assessments may now \u201cbe charged against the policy and deducted therefrom when it becomes a claim.\u201d This not allowable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-7\">L. <em>K. Porter, </em>with him <em>S. G. Porter, Frank H. Kennedy </em>and <em>F. H. Calkins, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbR\">Defendant was under no obligation to make any assessment during the continuance of plaintiff\u2019s policy, because there was no deficiency in the equation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>fund for which an assessment could be levied under the terms of said policy.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7h\">January 3, 1910:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-3\">Defendant was under no obligation to notify plaintiff that the estimated cash surrender value of the policy would not be realized, and the failure of defendant to maintain an equation fund sufficient to realize such estimate was not violative of the terms of plaintiff\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">The apportionment of the equation fund made by defendant was equitable: Uhlman v. Insurance Co., 109 N. Y. 421 (17 N. E. Repr. 363).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b525-5\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The judgment is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Shafer discharging the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
