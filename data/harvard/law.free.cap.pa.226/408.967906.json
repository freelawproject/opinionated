In such a case it is error not to permit the plaintiff to lay a foundation for affirmative proof of negligence by the testimony of witnesses who examined the building five months after the accident, as to the manner in which the bracket had been fastened, where it has been shown that the conditions at the place where the bracket had been fastened remained the same during the five months.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b440-9\">Argued Oct. 25, 1909.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acp\">Appeal, No. 149, Oct.

It assumes that there ought to have been some fastenings there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">The Court: That is a proper assumption in one respect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-10\">Mr. Brennen: I am asking how it was fastened and what it was fastened with, if anything.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-11\">Mr. Shaw: That is what he says he does not know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-12\">Objection sustained. Exception to plaintiff. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-13\">Daniel F. Crawford was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-14\">\u201cQ. Without stating how it was fastened, state why you say you are able to tell how it was fastened, from having examined this place five months after the bracket fell down? A. In all things pertaining to building, I have gained considerable knowledge from tearing down old places, remodelling old fronts and making them new. They all have signs showing how it was constructed. In that way we know how to take our bearings. They generally leave some mark to work by. In that way I know what to expect when I start to tear out or build up.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-15\">Mr. Brennen: \u201cQ. In other words, every building is built on a design, all designs leading into the same result? A. Yes, sir, we can tell what is an ornament that holds something\u2014 what is an ornament that was put there to hold something. They all show you how they were put on and how we are to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>them off. </em>Q. And does it show, also, how they were held in place? A. Yes, sir, I have taken similiar fronts to this out, and replaced them with modern fronts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">The Court: \u201c Q. Are you able to state from what you saw positively how that was fastened, or are you simply able to give an opinion how it was fastened? A. To give an opinion how it was fastened.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">Objection sustained, and exception noted to plaintiff. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anh3\">Mr. Crawford: \u201cQ. I understood you to say yesterday that you had frequently seen this building and this front? A. Yes, sir. Q. And I now ask you if you can state, as a matter of fact, how that cornice or bracket was held on the front of that building? A. I can answer. Q. How was it held?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-7\">Objected to by counsel for defense, as the witness did not see the bracket or cornice until five months after the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-8\">\u201cQ. Did you see it before this accident? A. I saw the building before this accident. Q. Well, the front of the building? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-9\">The Court: The witness has testified that his first examination was five months afterwards, although he had seen it frequently before, but he never made any examination until five months after the accident. We will sustain the objection and note an exception to the plaintiff. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-10\">Mr. Crawford: \u201cQ. From your examination of that building in November after this accident, could you not as well tell how that bracket was attached to that frame and held in place as if you had seen it half an hour afterwards? A. Yes, sir. Q. Or prior to its falling out? A. I could tell the manner and mode of construction and what they depended on to hold it there, by looking at it, because I know the way they do it. Q. How was this one done? Was it done in the same way that others of that kind are? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-11\">Objected to by counsel for defense, as the same question. Objection sustained. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-12\">F. J. Osterling, an architect, was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-13\">\u201cQ. When you worked on the building, did you also look at the bracket when you were fixing the building up? A. Yes, sir, looked at it in a general way. Q. Mr. Osterling, your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>office was close by this building, was it' not, for a number of years? A. Yes, sir, I had an office in the building adjoining this one at one time. Q. And from that will you state whether or not you had any knowledge from the fact that your office was close by, and that you have remodelled this very front, and your examination of it at that time, can you say how that bracket was held at that time? Can you tell, that is the question.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">Mr. Shaw: I have no objection to the witness saying whether he can express an opinion or not, but I object, as incompetent and irrelevant, to the witness basing his opinion upon an examination made five or six months after the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">The Court: He can answer yes or no to that question. Just answer it yes or no, or with any qualifications you may wish; but do not state your opinion until we come up to that question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-7\">\u201cA. Yes, I can.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-8\">Mr. Brennen: \u201cQ.

While sitting close to this building and near the adjoining one \u2014 No. 600 \u2014 an ornamental bracket from that building fell and struck him, and this suit is for the recovery of damages for the injuries sustained, due, as is alleged, to the failure of the appellee to \u2019have the bracket prop.erly and safely fastened to the building. The learned trial judge properly refused to sustain the contention that the fall of the bracket was in itself evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">There was no negligence in having the bracket for ornamental use on the front of the house, and its mere fall raised no presumption that it would not have fallen except for the negligence of the owner of the property in not having it safely attached to the building. The rule res ipsa loquitur is not in the case, and affirmative proof by the appellant of the appellee\u2019s negligence was essential to a recovery. Such proof might have been submitted, but by the exclusion of the offers which are the subjects of the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>assignments of error the appellant was not permitted to lay a foundation for the support of his charge of negligence. John P. Brennen, assistant superintendent of the bureau of building inspection for the city of Pittsburg, examined the front of the building about five months after the bracket fell. He testified that he had passed the building almost daily from the time the accident occurred up to the day he made the examination and there was no change whatever at the point from which the bracket fell. Pie was then asked whether when he examined the building he found there had been anything to hold up the bracket and fasten it to the building, but was not permitted to answer. D. F. Crawford, a contractor and builder, who also examined the building about the same time as Brennen, testified that he could see the way in which the bracket had been attached, but when asked to tell how, his answer was excluded. F. J. Osterling, an architect, and third witness, who had examined the building was asked whether, from his examination of it, he could say how the bracket had been held, but he, too, was not permitted to answer. .The reason given for not permitting these three witnesses to answer was that their examination of the building had been made five months after the accident, but the court evidently overlooked the testimony of Brennen that he had passed the property almost daily from June until December and that there had been no change in the front of it at the point where the bracket had been attached. In addition to this, though called after the foregoing three witnesses, Samuel W. Black, the appellee\u2019s agent in charge of the building, stated that from' June to December there had been no change in the front of the building at the point stated. Under this state of facts Brennen, Crawford and Osterling were qualified to tell the jury how the bracket had been attached, and this would have been the first particular in the proofs required from the plaintiff to establish his allegation of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">After having shown how the bracket had been attached, it would have been competent for the appellant, if able to do so, to submit proof that the way in which it had been attached and maintained was improper and unsafe, rendering it liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>to fall at any time, and that the owner of the building so knew, or ought to have so known. He might not have been able to come up to this measure of proof, but it was his right to have the opportunity to do so, if he could, and that right was taken away from him when he was not allowed to take the first step towards it. The third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth assignments of error are sustained and the judgment is. reversed with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
