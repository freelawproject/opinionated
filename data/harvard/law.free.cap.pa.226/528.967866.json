The court out of wMch the latter execution issues may stay the execution so as to allow the sale to be made under the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court; but it is not required to do so. Whether it shall or shall not, rests entirely within the discretion of the court, having regard to the circumstances of the case. If it be made to appear that a stay will be without prejudice to the judgment creditor, and that other interests will likely be advantaged by a sale made through the orphans\u2019 court, a stay should be granted; if otherwise, there could be no occasion for interference. In any event the court having control of the execution cannot be expected to act of its own motion. The parties in interest, creditors or distributees, who tMnk that they will be advantaged by a sale other than by the sheriff, may so represent to the court, and ask that the execution be stayed: Hammett\u2019s App., 83 Pa. 392. But if they remain silent and allow the execution to proceed to a sale, their opportunity to require an orphans\u2019 court sale is irrevocably lost. A sheriff\u2019s vendee under such sale acquires as good a title in every respect as would a vendee had the property been sold under an order of the orphans\u2019 court. This is but another way of saying the power of sale in the orphans\u2019 court is not exclusive. \u201cIf it be supposed that no sale by execution can ever be made on a judgment against an estate, after the death of the ancestor, it is a mistake. It can be always made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>if there be no application to prevent it, and the title will be good:\u201d Gamble v. Woods, 53 Pa. 158. The case calls for no further discussion. The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
