The plaintiff appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his appeal. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-186 (f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>and 17a-597 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the board\u2019s order transferring him to a maximum security hospital was not appealable. The plaintiff also claims that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an order transferring an acquittee<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to a maximum security facility is a final decision in a contested case and, therefore, is appealable to the Superior Court. We disagree and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history relevant to the issues in this appeal. On November 9,1984, the plaintiff was acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect of the charges of two counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> two counts of threatening in the second degree in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-62,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and one count of carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-206.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, on March 22,1985, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiff was placed under the jurisdiction of the board for a period not to exceed twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>five years. In March, 2000, the board transferred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>plaintiff from Whiting Forensic Institute (Whiting), a maximum security mental health facility, to the less restrictive setting of Dutcher Service at Connecticut Valley Hospital (Dutcher). On November 16, 2001, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-585,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which requires the board to review the status of acquittees; see footnote 5 of this opinion; at least once every two years, the board conducted a hearing to review the plaintiffs status. Section 17a-585 also requires the board,, at the status hearing, to \u201cmake a finding and act pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 17a-584,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which requires the board: (1) to discharge the acquittee from the custody of the board; (2) to conditionally release the acquittee; or (3) to continue the acquittee\u2019s confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The board issued a memorandum of decision, determining that the plaintiff was mentally ill and required continued confinement. The board further determined that the plaintiff \u201cpotentially [is] so violent and non-compliant with treatment that he currently poses a risk to the staff and patients of [Dutcher] and requires immediate transfer to maximum security.\u201d Thereafter, the board denied the plaintiffs application for reconsideration of its decision. On January 8, 2002, the plaintiff filed an administrative appeal in the Superior Court appealing from the decision of the board transferring him to a maximum security facility. The board then moved to dismiss the appeal, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because \u00a7 17a-597 did not allow an appeal from its transfer decision. The trial court granted the board\u2019s motion to dismiss concluding that the board\u2019s decision regarding the <em>level </em>of confinement was not encompassed within the meaning of \u201cconfinement\u201d as that term is defined in the statutes and, therefore, was not appealable. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the appeal and rendered judgment in favor of the board. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 17a-597 does not allow him to appeal from the board\u2019s decision transferring him to a maximum security facility. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that General Statutes \u00a7 17a-599,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the provision requiring the board to make a further determination as to whether to place an acquittee in a maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>security facility, cannot be viewed in isolation from its context within the entire statutory scheme. Rather, the plaintiff argues, once the board determines, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-584 (3) that a person is mentally ill and should be confined, \u00a7 17a-599 requires the board to make a \u201cfurther determination\u201d as to whether the acquittee should be placed in a maximum security facility. The plaintiff claims that this \u201cfurther determination\u201d made pursuant to \u00a7 17a-599 is also an appealable order as an extension of the confinement decision made pursuant to \u00a7 17a-584 (3). Accordingly, the plaintiff claims, the placement of an acquittee in a maximum security facility is an appealable decision pursuant to \u00a7 17a-597. The board claims in response that, pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 17a-597, a decision of the board transferring an acquittee to a maximum security facility, made pursuant to \u00a7 17a-599, is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. The standard of review of a motion to dismiss is . . . well established. In ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a maimer most favorable to the pleader. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brookridge District Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 607, 610-11, 793 A.2d 215 (2002). Accordingly, \u201c[b]ecause [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Moreover, \u201c[t]here is no absolute right of appeal to the courts from a decision of an administrative agency. . . . The [Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.] grants the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Superior Court jurisdiction over appeals of agency appeals only in certain limited and well delineated circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>224 Conn. 693, 699-700, 620 A.2d 780 (1993); see also <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4, 675 A.2d 845 (1996) (\u201c[i]t is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We begin our analysis of the plaintiffs claim by examining the language of the statutory scheme at issue. Judicial review of an administrative decision generally is governed by \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA, which provides that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies . . . and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court . . . .\u201d Section 4-186, however, carves out exemptions to \u00a7 4-183 (a). Specifically, \u00a7 4-186 (f) provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of section 4-183 shall apply to the [board] in the manner described in section 17a-597 . . . . \u201d Accordingly, appeals from the decisions of the board are governed by \u00a7 17a-597 (a), which provides that \u201c[a]ny order of the board entered pursuant to subdivision (2) or (3) of section 17a-584 . . . may be appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to section 4-183.\u201d Section 17a-584 requires the board, at any hearing considering the discharge, conditional release, or confinement of an acquittee, to make a finding as to the mental condition of the acquittee and: (1) to recommend that the acquittee be discharged; (2) to order the acquittee conditionally released; or (3) to order the person confined in a hospital for persons with psychiatric disabilities. See footnote 11 of this opinion. Finally, \u00a7 17a-599 provides that \u201c[a]t any time the court or the board deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>mines that the acquittee is a person who should be confined, it shall make a further determination of whether the acquittee is so violent as to require confinement under conditions of maximum security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">With this statutory scheme in mind, we conclude that there is no administrative appeal from the decision of the board transferring the plaintiff to a maximum security facility. First, we note that the language of \u00a7 17a-597 (a), the provision delineating the right to appeal a decision of the board to the Superior Court, is clear and unequivocal. Section 17a-597 (a) limits the right to appeal to \u201c[a]ny order of the board <em>entered pursuant to subdivision (2) or (3) of section 17a-584 </em>or pursuant to section 17a-587 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Both parties agree, however, that the decision of the board in the present case, transferring the plaintiff to Whiting, was made pursuant to \u00a7 17a-599, which is not enumerated as an appealable decision in \u00a7 17a-597. Second, \u201c[w]e have stated that [ujnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended [a] list to be exclusive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. Garcia, 263 Conn. 22, 33-34, 818 A.2d 37 (2003); see also <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 40, 664 A.2d 719 (1995) (list of available remedies for antitrust violations exclusive). As there is no evidence to the contrary, either in the language of the statute or in the relevant legislative history,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>those board decisions set forth in \u00a7 17a-597 as appeal-able to the Superior Court are intended to be exclusive. Accordingly, the board\u2019s decision in the present case was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The plaintiff claims, however, that we should not read \u00a7 17a-599 in isolation from other parts of the statutory scheme, but rather, as an extension of \u00a7 17a-584 (3). Specifically, the plaintiff claims that once the board determines, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-584 (3), that a person is mentally ill and should be confined, \u00a7 17a-599 requires the board to make a \u201cfurther determination\u201d as to whether the acquittee should be placed in a maximum security facility. The plaintiff claims that, because these two sections are interconnected, and the legislature is presumed to have created a harmonious body of law, the further determination that an acquittee should be placed in a maximum security facility also is appealable as an extension of the confinement decision made pursuant to \u00a7 17a-584 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Although it is correct that the legislature is presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law, this tenet of statutory construction requires us to read statutes together only \u201cwhen they <em>relate to the same subject matter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 187-88, 640 A.2d 601 (1994). In the present case, \u00a7 17a-599 requires the board to make a further determination of where to place the acquittee when the board has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>determined that the acquittee requires confinement. As the trial court noted, however, the <em>level </em>of confinement, namely, maximum security, is not the same subject matter as the determination of whether the acquittee requires confinement because he is mentally ill. In our view, it was logical for the legislature to provide for a right to appeal from a confinement decision but not from the decision as to the appropriat\u00e9 placement of the acquittee. Thus, the placement of the acquittee, in a maximum security mental health facility or in a facility like Dutcher, requires knowledgeable decisions based upon, inter alia, the appropriateness and type of treatment the acquittee requires and the potential for risk of harm to the staff and other acquittees. These decisions are best left to the professional discretion of the board, whose mandate is the protection of the general public. See 28 S. Proc., Pt. 15, 1985 Sess., pp. 4912-13, remarks of Senator Richard Johnston (\u201c[t]he major provisions of this act, are that the [board] would assume full jurisdiction of the acquittee, and make . . . <em>full decisions </em>regarding confinement, conditional release, and recommendations to the Superior Court for discharge\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Moreover, the plaintiffs claim that the order is appealable is predicated on his contention that the board\u2019s decision regarding whether the acquittee should be confined to a maximum security facility must occur at the same time as when it conducts the status hearing. Section 17a-599, however, is silent as to when that particular decision must be made. Indeed, \u00a7 17a-599, to the contrary, provides that <em>at any time after </em>a person has been determined to require confinement, the court or the board shall make a \u201cfurther determination\u201d as to whether the acquittee should be placed in a maximum security mental health facility. Additionally, the board\u2019s regulations provide that the board may transfer involuntarily an acquittee from a nonmaximum security facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>to a maximum security facility, even in the absence of an order of the court or the board, when \u201cthe continued presence of the acquittee in a nonmaximum security setting poses <em>an </em>immediate threat to the safety or well-being of any person.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-581-56 (a). Thus, the decision placing the plaintiff in a maximum security facility could have occurred at any time after the board determined that he required confinement. The fact that the decision in the present case occurred as a result of the status hearing, therefore, is irrelevant. Thus, the decision made by the board in the present case transferring the plaintiff to a maximum security facility was not one of the orders of the board set forth in \u00a7 17a-597 as appealable to the Superior Court. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-11\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-186 (f) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe provisions of section 4-183 shall apply to the Psychiatric Security Review Board in the manner described in section 17a-597 . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-597 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny order of the board entered pursuant to subdivision (2) or (3) of section 17a-584 or pursuant to section 17a-587 may be appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to section 4-183. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">See footnote 11 of this opinion for the relevant text of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-584.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court as provided in this section. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b790-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (1) provides: \u201c \u2018Acquittee\u2019 means any person found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect pursuant to section 53a-13</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b790-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and: (1) His intent is to compel a third person (A) to pay or deliver money or property as ransom or (B) to engage in other particular conduct or to refrain from engaging in particular conduct; or (2) he restrains the person abducted with intent to (A) inflict physical injury upon him or violate or abuse him sexually; or (B) accomplish or advance the commission of a felony; or (C) terrorize him or a third person; or (D) interfere with the performance of a government function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">Although \u00a7 53a-92 has been amended since 1984, the date of the plaintiffs acquittal, the amendments are not relevant to this appeal.

Specifically, the plaintiff relies on the remarks of Howard Zonana, a physician, and, at that time, an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at Yale University, who stated: \u201c[T]he only other problem with the [bjoard ... is that this [bjoard leaves open always the question of appeals back to the Superior Court. ... I think the concern . . . here is would the [bjoard let people lo[o]se too soon and can we go back to the judge to review that. That\u2019s all well and good except if the State\u2019s Attorney can go back to the judge and any time a [bjoard makes a decision, it\u2019s also possible for the [defendant ... to go back to the [cjourt and if all this turns out to be is running back to the [cjourt every time you get an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>decision one way or the other, I think you undermine the function of the [bjoard.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5, 1985 Sess., p. 1514. Although it is unclear from his testimony, Zonana likely was referring to the appeal provisions of what is now codified as \u00a7 17a-597, giving the acquittee a right to appeal decisions of the board conditionally releasing an acquittee or confining the acquittee, as well as decisions regarding temporary leave of the acquittee. Because, as discussed earlier in this opinion, \u00a7 17a-597 does not include the board\u2019s decision transferring the acquittee to a maximum security facility, reliance on Zonana\u2019s testimony is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\"> The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider his appeal because the board\u2019s order, transferring him to a maximum security facility, was not a final decision in a contested case, pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 4-183 (a). The plaintiff, however, is not entitled to review under \u00a7 4-183 (a) because, as we previously noted, \u00a7 4-186 (f) confines judicial review of board decisions to those decisions described in \u00a7 17a-597. Having concluded that \u00a7 17a-597 does not grant the trial court jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the board\u2019s decision in the present case, we need not reach the issue of whether the order transferring the plaintiff to a maximum security facility was a final decision in a contested case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
