We reject the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In May, 1987, the victim, then a three and one-half year old female, lived in an apartment with her mother, her older sister, her sister\u2019s young daughter,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the defendant. The defendant, who was the boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother, had resided in the apartment since January, 1987. The victim, whose biological father had passed away when she was seven months old, called the defendant, \u201cDaddy.\u201d Between January, 1987, and May, 1987, no man other than the defendant resided in the apartment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, the victim\u2019s mother occasionally left the victim home alone with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Within a few weeks after the defendant had moved into the apartment, the victim began to behave in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>manner that was troubling and unfamiliar to those around her. In particular, within a few weeks after the defendant began living with the victim and her mother, the victim started to exhibit sexual behavior inappropriate for a child her age. The victim\u2019s mother noticed that the victim often placed her hands down her pants. When the victim\u2019s mother bathed the victim, the victim would \u201cgyrate\u201d while in the bathtub. The victim\u2019s sister also noticed that the victim repeatedly touched her genital area. On more than one occasion, the victim\u2019s sister observed the victim lying face down on her bed making \u201cup and down\u201d motions with her body. Both the victim\u2019s mother and sister noticed that, during this time, the victim\u2019s vaginal area was irritated, red and swollen. They also noticed that the victim was very withdrawn, quiet and nervous. Although the victim had been toilet trained before the defendant began living in the apartment, she thereafter began urinating in her bed at night. The victim had begun to suck her thumb so frequently that her thumbnail eventually fell off. Neither the victim\u2019s mother nor the victim\u2019s sister ever had seen the victim act in this manner before.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Employees at the day care center that the victim attended also began to notice that the victim had been behaving strangely. They observed that the victim was extremely withdrawn and often had her hand in her pants. When employees at the day care center would rub the victim\u2019s stomach or back to help her relax during nap time, the victim would become \u201cvery sensually aroused.\u201d In addition, the victim cried after urinating.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On or about May 12,1987, Ida Yelding, a social worker employed by the day care center, noticed that the victim had her hands in her pants while she was moving her hips in an unusual manner. In Yelding\u2019s view, it was as if the victim was approaching some sort of sexual climax. Yelding, who had worked at the day care center for more than thirteen years, never before had witnessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>conduct of this kind by a child. Concerned about the victim\u2019s behavior, Yelding approached the victim and asked her what was wrong. The victim responded, \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Yelding immediately reported this incident to Carolyn Miranda, the director of child care programs at the day care center. Miranda thereupon went to the victim\u2019s classroom, where she observed that the victim was visibly upset. After speaking with Yelding and the victim, Miranda, who, in light of the circumstances, suspected that the victim had been sexually abused, filed a report that same day with the state department of children and youth services (department), what is now the department of children and families. In that report, Miranda revealed, inter alia, that the victim had stated to the teacher that \u201c \u2018Daddy\u2019 touched her.\u201d Miranda subsequently contacted the victim\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Thereafter, the victim\u2019s mother asked the victim what was wrong. The victim responded that \u201cDaddy\u201d had \u201churt her.\u201d The victim further indicated that the incident had occurred some time during the first two weeks of May, 1987. When the victim\u2019s mother confronted the defendant with this information, he denied that he ever had sexually abused the victim. Nevertheless, the victim\u2019s mother told the defendant that she intended to notify the police, and, soon thereafter, the defendant, without explanation, vacated the apartment and left the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">On or about May 21,1987, the victim\u2019s mother brought the victim to William Currao, a pediatrician. Currao performed a physical examination of the victim, including an examination of her genital area. That examination revealed various injuries uncommon for a girl of the victim\u2019s age, all of which were consistent with digital or penile penetration of the victim\u2019s vagina. In particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>lar, Currao found that the victim\u2019s labia majora<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were red and irritated and that her hymen had been tom.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">On May 27,1987, the victim and her mother met with Detective Lawrence Betterini of the New Britain police department. During an interview at the police station, the victim revealed to Betterini that the defendant had touched her vagina with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Betterini attempted to contact the defendant to speak with him about the allegations of sexual abuse. In particular, Betterini spoke with several of the defendant\u2019s family members and tried to contact the defendant at various addresses but was unable to locate him. On June 4, 1987, Betterini obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant. Continued efforts by the police to locate the defendant were unsuccessful. The defendant finally was apprehended by state police in Vermont on September 13, 1997, and, thereafter, was extradited to this state. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injuiy to a child. The defendant\u2019s sole claim of evidentiaiy insufficiency rests on his contention that the state failed to establish that the defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim. Specifically, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s evidence was inadequate to establish sexual intercourse<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the state did not prove the element of penetration. We disagree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In support of its charge that the defendant had sexually assaulted the victim, the state adduced the testimony of several witnesses,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> including Miranda, the day care center supervisor. Miranda testified that, as a day care center supervisor, she was statutorily obligated to report to the department all suspected cases of sexual abuse. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-38a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Miranda testified that, in light of the victim\u2019s overtly sexual behavior and the victim\u2019s statements to Yelding and Miranda connecting \u201cDaddy\u201d to that conduct, Miranda submitted a written report to the department. That report, which was introduced as a full exhibit at trial, provided in relevant part: \u201cChild has hands in pants more often than not . . . says its hurts and has cried after urination. When asked what was wrong when crying, she told [t]eacher \u2018Daddy\u2019 touched her. . . . [Yelding] also talked to child about touching incident [and] child began to shake while talking to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The state also presented the testimony of Detective Betterini, who had interviewed the victim during his investigation of the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse. According to Betterini, the victim told him that \u201cDaddy touched her buggy\u201d and that \u201cDaddy touched [her] with his buggy . . . .\u201d Betterini further testified that the victim\u2019s mother stated to him that the victim had told her that \u201c[D]addy hurt me\u201d and that \u201cDaddy put his buggy into my buggy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In addition, Betterini presented the victim with anatomically correct drawings of a preschool age female <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>and an adult male, and asked her to identify various body parts on the drawings, such as the eyes, nose and mouth. After the victim successfully had identified those body parts, Betterini asked her to circle the areas on the drawings to which she was referring when she used the term \u201cbuggy.\u201d On the drawing of the female child, the victim circled the vagina. On the drawing of the adult male, the victim circled the penis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Betterini further testified that, although the victim did not specifically identify the defendant as \u201cDaddy,\u201d she did state that \u201cDaddy\u201d was the person who was living with her mother. Moreover, both the victim\u2019s mother and sister testified that, at the time, the victim referred to the defendant as \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The state also presented the testimony of Currao, the victim\u2019s pediatrician. After being qualified as an expert in pediatrics, Currao testified that his examination of the victim in May, 1987, had revealed redness and irritation of the victim\u2019s labia majora, the external portion of the female genitals. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Currao\u2019s internal examination of the victim also revealed a tear in her hymen. According to Currao, this type of injury is uncommon for a girl of the victim\u2019s age and indicates penetration of an invasive nature. Currao also testified that the victim\u2019s injury was consistent with digital or penile penetration and opined that \u201cthere was a good chance of there being sexual abuse.\u201d With the foregoing evidentiary background in mind, we turn next to the legal principles governing our review of the defendant\u2019s claim of evidentiary insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the juiy reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\u201cThis does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . because this court has held that a juiy\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\u201c[A]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>254 Conn. 561, 575-76, 757 A.2d 1125 (2000). \u201cFurthermore, [i]n [our] process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>As we have indicated, the defendant\u2019s claim of evidentiary insufficiency is predicated on his assertion that the state failed to prove penetration and, consequently, failed to prove that the defendant engaged in vaginal sexual intercourse with the victim. It is true, as the defendant contends, that, in the absence of penetration, vaginal sexual intercourse cannot have occurred for purposes of our Penal Code. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-65 (2);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>256 Conn. 517, 532-33, 535 &amp; n.25, 779 A.2d 702 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>252 Conn. 795, 803-806, 750 A.2d 1037 (2000). Nevertheless, because the statutory provisions that prohibit forcible and nonconsensual sexual intercourse were designed to \u201cpunish the fact, not the degree, of penetration\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 805; the \u201cleast penetration of the body\u201d is sufficient to satisfy the penetration element of this state\u2019s sexual assault statutes. Id. Accordingly, we recently have concluded that the penetration element of those statutes is satisfied by the penetration of the labia majora because penetration of the labia majora constitutes penetration of the body. Id., 805-806, 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the penetration element of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) and 53a-71 (a), the sexual assault statutes under which the defendant had been charged. The jury heard testimony that: (1) in May, 1987, the victim was behaving strangely and in a maimer suggestive of sexual abuse; (2) the victim repeatedly complained that \u201cDaddy touched her buggy,\u201d \u201cused [his] buggy to touch her,\u201d \u201cput his buggy into [her] buggy\u201d and \u201churt\u201d her;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the victim used the term \u201cbuggy\u201d to refer to genitalia; and (4) the victim referred to the defendant as \u201cDaddy.\u201d The evidence also established that the victim\u2019s labia majora were red and irritated, and that her hymen had been tom, which, according to expert testimony, likely was the result of digital or penile penetration and indicative of sexual abuse. Based on the foregoing evidence, we conclude that the state satisfied its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim as that term is defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (2). Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim of evidentiary insufficiency fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The defendant next contends that the admission of certain hearsay evidence under the residual exception to the hearsay rale violated his sixth amendment<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> right to confront his accusers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant challenges the admissibility of testimony: (1) of three witnesses regarding statements made to them by the victim; and (2) of one of those witnesses regarding statements made to him by the victim\u2019s mother. We conclude that the admission of the hearsay evidence consisting of the victim\u2019s statements did not violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. Although we conclude that the trial court improperly permitted the state\u2019s attorney to introduce the hearsay statements of the victim\u2019s mother, we also conclude that the admission of those statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of this hearsay evidence entitles him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. At trial, the victim testified on direct examination that she lacked any specific memory of the period from January, 1987, to May, 1987.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On the basis of this testimony, the trial court found<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that the victim lacked any recollection of that time frame and, therefore, concluded that the victim was unavailable to testify.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The state\u2019s attorney thereafter sought to elicit certain testimony from Yelding, the victim\u2019s mother and Detective Betterini about certain statements that the victim had made to them in May, 1987. The defendant objected to the testimony of each of the three witnesses regarding the victim\u2019s statements on the ground that the victim\u2019s statements did not fall within an exception to the hearsay rule. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objections and allowed the state\u2019s attorney to introduce the victim\u2019s statements through the testimony of the witnesses under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court also allowed Betterini to testify about certain statements that the victim\u2019s mother had made to him during his investigation of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>victim. Any additional facts that are necessary to the resolution of each of the defendant\u2019s separate challenges to the testimony of Yelding, the victim\u2019s mother and Betterini will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Before analyzing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, we first summarize the applicable law. An out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>261 Conn. 336, 355, 803 A.2d 267 (2002). As a general rule, such hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. E.g., id. A hearsay statement that does not fall within one of the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule nevertheless may be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule provided that the proponent\u2019s use of the statement is reasonably necessary<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the statement itself is \u201csupported by equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness and reliability that are essential to other evidence admitted under traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-9;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 809, 709 A.2d 522 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Beyond these general evidentiary principles, the state\u2019s use of hearsay evidence against an accused in a criminal trial is limited by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. In defining the specific limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>of the confrontation clause, the United States Supreme Court consistently has held that the confrontation clause does not erect a per se bar to the admission of hearsay statements against criminal defendants. E.g., <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 813, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990); see also id., 814 (\u201c[w]hile a literal interpretation of the Confrontation Clause could bar the use of any out-of-court statements when the declarant is unavailable, [the] Court has rejected that view as unintended and too extreme\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). At the same time, \u201c[although . . . hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values, [the court has] also been careful not to equate the Confrontation Clause\u2019s prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. . . . The Confrontation Clause, in other words, bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">For purposes of the confrontation clause, \u201chearsay statements are admissible if (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify, and (2) the statement bears adequate indicia of reliability. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, [100 S. Ct. 2531], 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980) .... A statement is presumptively reliable if it falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> [Id.] A hearsay exception is firmly rooted if it rest[s] upon such solid foundations that admission of virtually any evidence within [it] comports with the substance of constitutional protection. Id. Evidence admitted under such an exception thus is presumed to be so trustworthy that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability. <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>[supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>497 U.S. 821]. Evidence that does not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, however, is inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>[supra, 66].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 158-59, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The issue presented, therefore, is whether the challenged evidence bears sufficient particularized guarantees of trustworthiness such that its admission comports with the sixth amendment. Our resolution of that issue is guided by <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 497 U.S. 805, in which the United States Supreme Court addressed the limitations that the confrontation clause places on the admission of evidence under residual exception to the hearsay rule in the context of a prosecution for the sexual abuse of a child. See generally id., 818-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">In <em>Wright, </em>the defendant, Laura Lee Wright, and her codefendant, Robert Giles, were charged with certain crimes in connection with their sexual abuse of two young girls, namely, Wright\u2019s five and one-half year old daughter (older victim), and Wright\u2019s and Giles\u2019 two and one-half year old daughter (younger victim). Id., 808-809. The charges stemmed from the older victim\u2019s allegations that Giles had engaged in sexual intercourse with both victims while Wright held them down and covered their mouths. Id., 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">After determining that the younger victim was unavailable as a witness based on her inability to communicate with the jury, the Idaho District Court (district court) permitted a physician, who was called by the prosecutor, to testify regarding certain statements concerning the alleged abuse that the younger victim had made to him during a medical examination after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>abuse had occurred. See id., 809-11. The physician testified that he had asked the younger victim, \u201cDoes daddy touch you with his pee-pee?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 810. According to the physician\u2019s testimony, the younger victim responded affirmatively. Id., 811. The physician also asked, \u201cDo you touch his pee-pee?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 810. The younger victim initially did not respond to this question. Id., 811. According to the physician, however, the child subsequently volunteered that, \u201c[d]addy does do this with me, but he does it a lot more with my sister [the older victim] than with me.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In concluding that the younger victim\u2019s statements were sufficiently trustworthy to justify their admission under Idaho\u2019s residual exception to the hearsay rule;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Idaho R. Evid. 803 (24); the district court relied on the following factors: (1) there was no evidence to suggest that the younger victim had a motive to fabricate; (2) the nature of the younger victim\u2019s statements suggested that she possessed a knowledge of sex that was unusual for someone her age; (3) physical evidence corroborated the younger victim\u2019s statements; (4) the older victim corroborated the younger victim\u2019s identification of the abusers; and (5) Wright had the opportunity to commit the crime. See <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 497 U.S. 825-26. Wright ultimately was convicted.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Id., 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Wright appealed but only with respect to her conviction for conduct involving the younger victim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>116 Idaho 382, 383, 775 P.2d 1224 (1989). On appeal, the Supreme Court of Idaho concluded that, in light of the fact that the physician\u2019s medical examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tion and interview of the younger victim was not recorded on videotape; id., 385; and because the physician had a \u201cpreconceived idea of what the [younger victim] should be disclosing\u201d and had used \u201cblatantly leading questions\u201d; id.; the younger victim\u2019s statements lacked sufficient indicia of reliability such that their admission into evidence violated the dictates of the confrontation clause. Id. Inasmuch as Idaho\u2019s use of the younger victim\u2019s statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the Idaho Supreme Court reversed in part the judgment of conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. See id., 389. The United States Supreme Court subsequently granted Idaho\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Idaho </em>v. Wright, 493 U.S. 1041, 110 S. Ct. 833, 107 L. Ed. 2d 829 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In reviewing Idaho\u2019s claim that the Idaho Supreme Court improperly had reversed in part the judgment of conviction, the United States Supreme Court noted, first, that the younger victim\u2019s statements were not presumptively reliable because the exception to the hearsay rule under which they had been admitted, i.e., the residual exception, is not a firmly rooted hearsay exception for purposes of the confrontation clause.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 497 U.S. 817. The court explained that \u201c[a]dmission under a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfies the constitutional requirement of reliability because of the weight accorded longstanding judicial and legislative experience in assessing the trustworthi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ness of certain types of out-of-court statements.\u201d Id. The court further explained that \u201c[United States Supreme Court] precedents have recognized that statements admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception are so trustworthy [in light of the circumstances under which they are made] that adversarial testing would add little to their reliability.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 820-21. \u201cThe residual hearsay exception, by contrast, accommodates ad hoc instances in which statements not otherwise falling within a recognized hearsay exception might nevertheless be sufficiently rehable to be admissible at trial. . . . Hearsay statements admitted under the residual exception, almost by definition, therefore do not share the same tradition of reliability that supports the admissibility of statements under a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The court then addressed the issue of whether the admission of the younger victim\u2019s statements against Wright was not precluded by the confrontation clause because those statements possessed sufficient particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Id., 818-26. In deciding that issue, the court clarified that a statement \u201cpossessing particularized guarantees of trustworthiness must be at least as reliable as evidence admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d; id., 821; and, consequently, a statement \u201cadmitted under the former requirement must similarly be so trustworthy [in view of the circumstances under which the statement is made such] that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court concluded, therefore, that \u201cthe particularized guarantees of trustworthiness required for admission under the Confrontation Clause must ... be drawn from the totality of circumstances that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) Id., 820. The court made it clear that evidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement may not be considered in evaluating the statement\u2019s reliability. Id., 822. \u201cTo [pass muster] under the Confrontation Clause, hearsay evidence used to convict a defendant must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence at trial.\u201d Id. As the court explained, \u201cthe use of corroborating evidence to support a hearsay statement\u2019s particularized guarantees of trustworthiness would permit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial, a result [that is] at odds with the requirement that hearsay evidence admitted under the Confrontation Clause be so trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The court identified a \u201cnumber of factors [that] . . . properly relate to whether hearsay statements made by a child witness in [a] child sexual abuse [case] are reliable.\u201d Id., 821. The list of factors identified by the court included: (1) the degree of spontaneity inherent in the making of the statements; (2) consistent repetition by the declarant; (3) the declarant\u2019s mental state; (4) use of terminology not within the average ken of a child of similar age; and (5) the existence of a motive to fabricate or lack thereof. Id., 821-22. The court emphasized that the \u201cunifying principle\u201d underlying the enumerated factors is that they \u201crelate to whether the child declarant was particularly likely to be telling the truth when the statement was made.\u201d Id., 822. The court further noted, however, that the list of factors it had identified was not exclusive, that it was not endorsing any particular \u201cmechanical test for determining particularized guarantees of trustworthiness under the [Confrontation] Clause\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>id.; and that \u201ccourts have considerable leeway in their consideration of appropriate factors.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Applying these principles, the United States Supreme Court held that the Idaho Supreme Court correctly had concluded that the admission of the child\u2019s statements violated Wright\u2019s confrontation clause rights. Id., 828. The court first rejected the district court\u2019s reliance on corroborative evidence because such evidence was \u201cirrelevant to a showing of the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness necessary for [the] admission of hearsay statements under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 826. Although the district court also had relied in part on appropriate factors, namely, that the younger victim had no apparent motive to lie and that the statements demonstrated knowledge that was unusual for a child of her age, the court nevertheless concluded that the suggestive maimer in which the physician had conducted the interview so undermined the reliability of the statements that their admission did not satisfy the requirements of the confrontation clause. Id. Although the court \u201creject[ed] the apparently dispositive weight placed by [the Idaho Supreme] [C]ourt on the lack of procedural safeguards at the interview\u201d; id., 818; the court nevertheless concluded that, in view of the totality of the circumstances, the statements that the younger victim had made to the physician lacked the reliability demanded by the confrontation clause. See id., 826-27. The court, therefore, affirmed the judgment of the Idaho Supreme Court, thereby upholding that court\u2019s partial reversal of Wright\u2019s conviction. Id., 827. Guided by the principles enunciated in <em>Wright, </em>we now turn to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims in the present case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The defendant first challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling allowing Yelding to testily regarding a statement that the victim had made to her. As we noted previously, Yelding testified that she had observed the victim acting in a manner \u201cinappropriate\u201d for a child her age. When the state\u2019s attorney asked Yelding to explain what she meant by \u201cinappropriate,\u201d Yelding testified that the victim was lying on a cot with \u201cher hands in her pants . . . [and] her tongue out of her mouth, and [that] she was moving her lower part of her body and breathing hard . . . .\u201d According to Yelding, the victim appeared to be attaining \u201csome kind of a sexual climax or something . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Outside the presence of the jury, the state\u2019s attorney indicated that he intended to offer a statement that the victim had made to Yelding. In -connection with the offer of proof regarding that statement, Yelding testified that, after witnessing the victim\u2019s unusual behavior, she approached the victim and asked her \u201cwhat was wrong.\u201d According to Yelding, the victim responded, \u201cDaddy.\u201d The defendant objected to the testimony on the ground that it contained inadmissible hearsay. The state\u2019s attorney claimed that the victim\u2019s statement was admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The trial court then made the following findings: \u201cWith respect to [Yelding], the court finds that she is a reliable witness, that the statements that she heard were heard during the course of her employment at the day care center, that the statement, \u2018Daddy,\u2019 was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>spontaneous statement by the three to four year old victim at the time so that there was no indicia of unreliability in that there was no motive for the victim to falsify or he at the time.\u201d On the basis of these findings, the trial court allowed the state\u2019s attorney to introduce the victim\u2019s statement through Yelding\u2019s testimony under the residual hearsay exception. Thereafter, Yelding testified in the presence of the jury that, after observing the victim\u2019s unusual behavior, she asked the victim what was wrong, and the victim answered, \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The defendant claims that the victim\u2019s out-of-court statement lacked particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and, consequently, its admission violated his rights under the confrontation clause. In connection with this claim, the defendant underscores the fact that, contrary to the dictates of <em>Wright, </em>the trial court relied on corroborative evidence unrelated to the statement itself, namely, Yelding\u2019s credibility. Although we agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly considered Yelding\u2019s credibility in evaluating the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s statement, we nevertheless conclude that the statement bore sufficient indicia of reliability to withstand scrutiny under the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">As we have indicated, the trial court\u2019s reliance on Yelding\u2019s credibility as a witness was irrelevant to a determination of the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s statement itself. Although the jury necessarily was required to evaluate Yelding\u2019s credibility in determining whether the victim actually <em>made </em>the statement, Yelding\u2019s veracity simply has no bearing on the reliability of the <em>victim\u2019s statement to her. </em>Thus, to the extent that the trial court relied on Yelding\u2019s credibility in concluding that the victim\u2019s statement possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, that reliance was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>A review of the circumstances under which the victim made the statement to Yelding nevertheless persuades us that the statement was sufficiently reliable to withstand scrutiny under the confrontation clause. First, the record is devoid of any evidence to suggest that the victim had a motive to fabricate or otherwise falsely implicate the defendant. Nor was the victim\u2019s statement self-serving in any way. Indeed, the victim\u2019s young age \u201csubstantially lessen[s] the degree of skepticism with which we view [her] motives, and mitigates in favor of the trustworthiness and admissibility of her declarations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>NB, </em>59 F.3d 771, 777 (8th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Furthermore, we agree with the trial court that the victim\u2019s statement was spontaneous, another one of the factors explicitly endorsed by the court in <em>Wright </em>as indicative of trustworthiness. See <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 497 U.S. 821-22. A primary consideration in ascertaining the spontaneity of a statement by a child victim of sexual abuse is whether \u201cthere is evidence of prior interrogation, prompting, or manipulation by adults\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 826-27; such that one cannot confidently characterize the response as the product of the child\u2019s own perception or experience. In the present case, the victim\u2019s statement implicating \u201cDaddy\u201d was made in response to a wholly neutral question, namely, \u201cwhat was wrong.\u201d The victim\u2019s unprompted and unrehearsed answer fits squarely into the category of spontaneous statements identified in <em>Wright </em>as indicative of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In addition, the victim\u2019s mental state when she made the statement provides further indication of the statement\u2019s reliability. Yelding testified that immediately before she asked the victim what was wrong, the victim was behaving in a manner very unusual for a child her age, as if she were reaching \u201csome kind of sexual climax . . . .\u201d Thus, when Yelding asked the victim what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>wrong', the victim appeared to be reacting to some highly stressful or disturbing experience. In light of this strong circumstantial evidence of the victim\u2019s distressed mental state, it is highly unlikely that the victim was capable of intentionally concocting a story falsely implicating the defendant.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The defendant contends that because extrinsic or independent evidence was necessary to establish a link between the defendant and the victim\u2019s reference to \u201cDaddy,\u201d the admission of the statement violated the proscription announced in <em>Wright </em>against the use of such evidence to corroborate the trustworthiness of the declarant\u2019s statement. The defendant\u2019s argument, however, reflects a misperception of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wright </em>regarding the use of corroborative evidence in determining the reliability of the out-of-court statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\"><em>Wright </em>bars the use of independent corroborative evidence to support astatement\u2019s particularized guarantees of trustworthiness because reliance on such evidence gives rise to an undue risk that presumptively unreliable hearsay evidence will be admitted not on the basis of its inherent reliability but, rather, \u201cby bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 823. Under <em>Wright, </em>therefore, evidence not directly related to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement cannot be used to substantiate the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. See id., 822-23. <em>Wright, </em>however, does not prohibit the use of such evidence to explain the meaning or import of an <em>otherwise reliable </em>hearsay statement. In other words, the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>state\u2019s attorney adduced testimony from Yelding<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that was fully subject to cross-examination and in which Yelding explained the victim\u2019s reference to \u201cDaddy\u201d does not detract from the determination, predicated on the totality of the circumstances under which the statement was made, that the victim was particularly likely to have been telling the truth when she made the statement.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Consequently, we conclude that the trial court properly allowed the state\u2019s attorney to introduce the victim\u2019s statement through Yelding and that such a ruling, under the circumstances of the present case, did not violate the defendant\u2019s confrontation clause rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The defendant next contends that his rights under the confrontation clause were violated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the victim\u2019s mother to testily as to certain statements that the victim had made to her. Although we agree with the defendant that a portion of the mother\u2019s testimony should have been excluded, we nevertheless conclude that the improper admission of any hearsay evidence in this respect was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">On direct examination, the victim\u2019s mother testified that, in late May, 1987, she received a telephone call from Miranda, the day care center supervisor. When the state\u2019s attorney asked the victim\u2019s mother what Miranda had told her, the defendant objected on hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>say grounds. The trial court excused the jury so that the state\u2019s attorney could make an offer of proof regarding the testimony that it sought to elicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The victim\u2019s mother then testified that Miranda had informed her that the victim was \u201cgyrating . . . was withdrawn . . . [and] . . . complained about her private area.\u201d The victim\u2019s mother further testified that, sometime after receiving that telephone call from Miranda, she asked the victim what had happened. According to the victim\u2019s mother, the victim responded that \u201cher Daddy hurt her in the private area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The state\u2019s attorney then sought to introduce the statement that the victim had made to her mother under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. The state\u2019s attorney argued, inter alia, that the victim\u2019s statement was \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d in light of the circumstances under which it was made. In addition, the state\u2019s attorney contended that the victim, by virtue of her actions and statements, exhibited a sexual knowledge unusual for someone her age. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court ruled that the state\u2019s attorney could introduce the victim\u2019s statement through the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother, reasoning that \u201c[t]he statements [that the victim] made to her mother about what happened to her and the identity of the perpetrator of the acts upon her are necessary in this case, and . . . this is the exceptional case [in which the residual exception to the hearsay rule] should apply and will apply .... This event happened . . . approximately thirteen years ago. . . . [Furthermore, the court finds that the statements are reliable. The statements that [the victim\u2019s mother] . . . would testify to are similar [to] statements that ha[ve] already been testified to by earlier] witnesses. The statements that were mentioned were not self-serving. The court finds that they are reliable and trustworthy in the totality of the record as it stands now . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Thereafter, the victim\u2019s mother testified, in the presence of the juiy, that, after she had spoken with Miranda about the victim\u2019s behavior at the day care center, she spoke to the victim, who told her that \u201cDaddy hurt her.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney then asked the victim\u2019s mother whether the victim had told her when the incident in question occurred. According to the victim\u2019s mother, although the victim did not state exactly when her daddy had hurt her, the victim did indicate that the incident had occurred \u201c[s]ome time in May, about May 1st until the 17th.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney also asked the victim\u2019s mother whether the victim ever told her where the incident had occurred. Although the answer that the victim\u2019s mother gave reasonably may be characterized as unresponsive to the specific question posed,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> she did indicate that the defendant was left alone with the victim on Sunday evenings when she went dancing, suggesting that the alleged incident may have occurred during this time. Thereafter, however, the victim\u2019s mother testified that she could not recall what the victim had told her regarding where the alleged incident had taken place.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The defendant challenges the admission of each of the victim\u2019s statements through the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother on the ground that those statements lacked the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness necessary to withstand scrutiny under the confrontation clause. We review each statement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">With respect to the victim\u2019s statement that \u201cDaddy hurt her,\u201d that statement and the circumstances under which it was made are identical in all material respects to the victim\u2019s statement to Yelding and the circumstances under which that statement was made. See part IIA of this opinion. Both statements, which were consistent with one another, were made by a very young child with no apparent motive to lie in response to neutral inquiries from different questioners. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s challenge to the admission of the victim\u2019s statement that \u201cDaddy hurt her\u201d for the same reasons that we rejected his challenge to the admission of the victim\u2019s statement to Yelding.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly permitted the victim\u2019s mother to testify that she had been told by the victim that the sexual assault occurred \u201c[s]ome time in May, about May 1st until the 17th.\u201d The defendant asserts that the victim\u2019s statement should not have been admitted because it is \u201cunrealistic\u201d to presume that a three and one-half year old child \u201cwould state that [the sexual assault] occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>within a specific time span . . . .\u201d We conclude that the victim\u2019s statement lacked adequate indicia of reliability to satisfy constitutional requirements. The challenged statement exhibits an ability to comprehend and to express concepts of time beyond that of a three and one-half year old child. Indeed, we cannot be certain about whether the statement was the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s characterization of what the victim told her regarding when the assault had occurred or whether the statement simply reflected the mother\u2019s own belief as to when the assault likely had occurred. In either event, the statement cannot reasonably be attributed to the declarant, and, therefore, its admission transcended the limits that the confrontation clause places on the admissibility of hearsay evidence at a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Nevertheless, we conclude that admission of the statement was harmless. As with other constitutional violations that are subject to harmless error analysis, the state has the burden of demonstrating that a confrontation clause violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>257 Conn. 842, 859, 779 A.2d 723 (2001). \u201cWhether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 174, 777 A.2d 604 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Upon consideration of these factors, we are convinced that there is no reasonable possibility that the defendant was harmed by the admission of the victim\u2019s statement regarding the approximate time period during which the assault occurred. First, the state\u2019s substitute information charged the defendant with having sexually assaulted the victim on or about a date between January 1, 1987, and May 31, 1987. Consequently, the state was not required to prove that the defendant committed the offense during the first two weeks of May, 1987, and, therefore, the challenged testimony was not particularly important to the state\u2019s case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>214 Conn. 657, 667, 574 A.2d 164 (1990) (when \u201ctime is not of the essence or [the] gist of the offense, the precise time at which it is charged to have been committed is not material\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Indeed, inasmuch as the defendant had resided with the victim and her mother for approximately four to five months before the abuse was discovered, the issue of whether that abuse occurred in May, 1987, or in the preceding weeks or even months, had no bearing on the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Second, the evidence that the victim had been sexually abused was overwhelming: (1) family members and day care personnel observed the victim acting in a strange manner, one that suggested that the victim had been subject to sexual abuse; (2) the victim\u2019s external genitalia were red, irritated and swollen, and her hymen had been tom; (3) Currao, the pediatrician, testified that the victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with digital or penile penetration, and that sexual abuse likely was the cause of those injuries; and (4) the victim expressly told her mother and Detective Betterini that \u201cDaddy\u201d had touched her and had hurt her in her genital area. Indeed, during closing arguments, defense counsel acknowledged that the state had proven sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>in stating: \u201c[T]here\u2019s no doubt that [the victim] was sexually abused. The question is by who[m].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Finally, the victim, who referred to the defendant as \u201cDaddy,\u201d repeatedly and consistently identified him as the person who had sexually abused her. Indeed, the defendant does not claim that the victim was referring to someone other than the defendant when she used the term \u201cDaddy.\u201d Under the circumstances, therefore, the improper admission of the victim\u2019s statement regarding the approximate time frame during which the sexual abuse occurred was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The defendant next contends that the trial court improperly allowed the victim\u2019s mother to testify that the sexual assault occurred while she was out dancing and the victim was home alone with the defendant. The specific colloquy at issue; see footnote 31 of this opinion; hardly is a model of clarity. Indeed, the mother\u2019s initial answer to the question of the state\u2019s attorney about whether the victim had told her where the assault occurred was not truly responsive. The victim\u2019s mother testified that the victim \u201cwas left alone with him. My mother-in-law and I go to Polish dancing every Sunday.\u201d Moreover, when the state\u2019s attorney thereafter repeated the question, the victim\u2019s mother testified that she did not remember what the victim had said. In light of the mother\u2019s difficulty in expressing herself during her testimony; see footnote 32 of this opinion; and in light of her testimony that she did not remember what the victim had said, it appears that the mother\u2019s initial response reflected her own belief as to the timing and location of the assault. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the jury undoubtedly recognized that the three and one-half year old victim could not have expressed herself in such terms. Construed as the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s own observation, the testimony did not include a hearsay component inasmuch as the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>mother was testifying as to her firsthand knowledge regarding the defendant\u2019s opportunity to assault the victim. Such testimony was relevant to establish the defendant\u2019s opportunity to commit the offense. We believe, therefore, that thejurymosthkely viewed the challenged testimony as reflecting the personal belief of the victim\u2019s mother as to the timing and location of the assault, namely, on a Sunday evening at the home of the victim when the victim\u2019s mother and her mother-in-law were out dancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">To the extent that the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother could be viewed as incorporating the victim\u2019s statement regarding the timing and location of the assault, however, we agree with the defendant that the victim\u2019s statement is inherently untrustworthy because it is entirely implausible that the three and one-half year old victim could express herself in the manner attributed to her. Nevertheless, in the unlikely event that the jury construed the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother as incorporating the victim\u2019s out-of-court statement regarding the timing and location of the assault, we conclude that the admission of that hearsay statement was harmless. As we previously have indicated, the timing of the assault was not a material component in the state\u2019s case. Moreover, the evidence that the victim had been sexually abused was overwhelming, and the victim consistently identified the defendant as the peipetrator. Finally, the victim\u2019s mother ultimately indicated that she could not remember what the victim had said, if anything, as to the timing and location of the assault. Thus, even if the jury had understood the challenged testimony as incorporating the victim\u2019s statement, its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly allowed Detective Betterini to testify about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>certain statements that the victim had made to him because those statements lacked sufficient indicia of reliability. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Betterini testified that, as part of his investigation, he interviewed the victim and the victim\u2019s mother. According to Betterini, the victim told him that \u201cher [D]addy touched her buggy\u201d and that \u201cher [D]addy had touched her with his buggy . . . .\u201d Betterini also testified that he showed the victim anatomically correct diagrams of an adult male and preschool age female, and that the victim used the term \u201cbuggy\u201d to identify the male and female genitalia in the diagrams. Finally, Betterini testified that the victim identified \u201c[t]he man who was living with [her] mother\u201d as \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Betterini testified extensively regarding the circumstances surrounding his interview of the victim. In particular, he indicated that he spoke to the victim, whom he described as bright but shy, in the presence of her mother. Betterini also indicated that, whenever the victim wanted to take a break, he allowed her to do so, and that he tried to make her feel comfortable and to minimize the stress of the situation. In addition, Betterini testified that he did not ask leading questions or otherwise influence the victim\u2019s responses in any way. Betterini further noted that the victim maintained the same version of the events throughout the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">We conclude that the trial court properly allowed Betterini to testify regarding the statements that the victim made to him for essentially the same reasons that we have approved the court\u2019s rulings with respect to the admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements to Yelding and certain of her statements to the victim\u2019s mother. The victim\u2019s statements to Betterini were consistent with those previous statements to Yelding and the victim\u2019s mother. Furthermore, the record reveals that Bet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>terini posed neutral questions to the victim, who was neither pressured to cooperate with Betterini nor prompted to implicate the defendant. Finally, the victim had no motive to he either about the fact that she had been sexually abused or about the identity of her assailant.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Because these factors are strong indicators that the victim\u2019s responses to Betterini were trustworthy, we are satisfied that the admission of those statements comported with the dictates of the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly allowed Betterini to testify as to certain statements that the victim\u2019s mother had made to him during his interview of the victim. We agree with the defendant but conclude that the admission of the challenged testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Betterini testified that during his interview with the victim, the victim\u2019s mother stated that the victim had told her that \u201c[D]addy hurt me,\u201d and that \u201cDaddy put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>his buggy into my buggy. \u201d The defendant objected to this testimony on the ground that it was inadmissible hear say within hearsay. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and allowed the state\u2019s attorney to introduce those statements through the testimony of Betterini under the residual exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\u2018 \u2018Hearsay within hearsay is admissible only if each part of the combined statements is independently admissible under a hearsay exception.\u201d Conn. CodeEvid. \u00a7 8-7; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 802, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998) (\u201c[w]hen a statement is offered that contains hearsay within hearsay, each level of hearsay must itself be supported by an exception to the hearsay rule in order for that level of hearsay to be admissible\u201d). Betterini\u2019s testimony about what the victim\u2019s mother told him regarding what the victim had told her is hearsay within hearsay. In the absence of a showing by the state that both levels of hearsay possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, the statements of the victim\u2019s mother regarding what the victim had told her were not admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule and, consequently, could not endure scrutiny under the confrontation clause. We conclude that the state has failed to demonstrate the existence of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that would support the admissibility of the statements of the victim\u2019s mother to Betterini under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. Thus, the trial court improperly allowed Betterini to testify as to the statements of the victim\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">We also conclude, however, that the improper admission of those statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The statements of the victim\u2019s mother were probative of whether the victim had been sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>abused and the identity of the abuser. With respect to the first issue, the evidence of sexual abuse was overwhelming; indeed, the defendant did not seriously dispute that fact. See part II B of this opinion. With respect to the issue of identity, the testimony of Yelding, the victim\u2019s mother and Betterini established that the victim, herself, repeatedly had identified the defendant as her assailant. In addition, Miranda\u2019s report stated that the victim had identified \u201cDaddy\u201d as the person who had \u201ctouched her\u201d inappropriately.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, Betterini\u2019s testimony as to what the victim\u2019s mother had told him about the victim\u2019s statements to her merely was cumulative in relation to other properly admitted\u2014and highly probative\u2014evidence that directly linked the defendant to the sexual assault. Consequently, we conclude that the improper admission of the statements of the victim\u2019s mother through Betterini\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The defendant also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the state\u2019s attorney to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged prior sexual assault of another child for the purpose of establishing (1) a common plan or scheme, and (2) identity. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the state\u2019s attorney to introduce that prior misconduct evidence to prove a common plan or scheme. Although we agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly allowed the state\u2019s attorney to introduce that evidence for the purpose of establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>identity, we conclude that its admission for that purpose was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessaiy to our determination of this issue. Outside the presence of the jury, the state\u2019s attorney informed the court that, for purposes of establishing (1) a common plan or scheme, and (2) the identity of the perpetrator, he intended to elicit testimony from the defendant\u2019s biological daughter that she, like the victim, had been sexually assaulted by the defendant as a young girl. The defendant objected, and the state\u2019s attorney made an offer of proof regarding the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In support of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s claim concerning the admissibility of that testimony, the defendant\u2019s daughter testified that, in August, 1986, on or about her ninth birthday, the defendant picked her up in preparation for a trip to Ohio that she and the defendant were taking. The defendant\u2019s daughter testified that, before departing for Ohio, the defendant took her to his apartment where he touched her \u201cbreast area and lower area\u201d and inserted his finger into her vagina. The defendant\u2019s daughter testified further that, on the trip to Ohio, the defendant again molested her. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s daughter testified that while they were stopped at a truck stop en route to Ohio, the defendant \u201cput it in me. He didn\u2019t penetrate me, buthe did enter it into me.\u201d When the state\u2019s attorney inquired whether there was \u201cat least partial penile penetration,\u201d the defendant\u2019s daughter responded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The state\u2019s attorney contended that the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual assault of his daughter was sufficiently similar to the defendant\u2019s sexual assault of the victim that the state was entitled to use that evidence of a similar, uncharged criminal act for the purpose of establishing the defendant\u2019s identity as the perpetrator of the assault of the victim and also for the puipose of establishing the defendant\u2019s common plan or scheme to abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>young girls sexually. The defendant objected to the admission of the prior misconduct evidence, claiming that any similarities between the charged and uncharged assaults were insufficient to warrant the admission of the proffered evidence under either theory. The defendant alternatively claimed that the prior misconduct evidence should have been excluded because it was more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, concluding that \u201c[t]here [were] sufficient similarities in both cases to justify admitting the evidence for the purpose of showing identity and common scheme or plan.\u201d The trial court found that the following similarities supported its conclusion: (1) both victims were young girls; (2) the defendant had a relationship with both of the victims\u2019 mothers; (3) the defendant was not married to either victim\u2019s mother; (4) the defendant purportedly had engaged in similar conduct with the victims, namely, vaginal penetration; (5) the defendant had access to the victims because of a familial-type relationship with both of them; and (6) the alleged sexual assault of the defendant\u2019s daughter occurred between five and nine months before the sexual assault of the victim for which the defendant was criminally charged. The court also concluded that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Following the court\u2019s ruling, the jury was recalled and the defendant\u2019s daughter thereupon repeated the testimony that she had given during her voir dire examination. After she had completed her direct examination testimony and before cross-examination, the trial court, sua sponte, gave the jury a cautionary instruction in which it directed the jury to consider the testimony, if at all, only in regard to the issues of identity and common plan or scheme.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In its final instructions to the jury at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the conclusion of the case, the trial court reiterated the limited purpose for which the testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter could be considered.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\u201cWe begin our review of the trial court\u2019s action by noting that [a]s a general rule, evidence of prior misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crime of which he is accused. ... Nor can such evidence be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>260 Conn. 649, 684, 800 A.2d 1160 (2002); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (a). Evidence of prior misconduct may be admitted, however, when the evidence is offered for a purpose other than to prove the defendant\u2019s bad character or criminal tendencies. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (b). Exceptions to the general rule precluding the use of prior misconduct evidence have been recognized in cases in which the evidence is offered to prove, among other things, intent, identity, motive, malice or a common plan or scheme. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>209 Conn. 458, 464-65, 551 A.2d 1231 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>76 Conn. App. 410, 415, 819 A.2d 871 (2003); see also Conn.

First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of [the prior misconduct] evidence must outweigh [its] prejudicial effect .... Because of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only whe[n] abuse of discretion is manifest or whe[n] an injustice appears to have been done. ... On review by this court, therefore, eveiy reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Nunes, supra, 260 Conn. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\u201cThe first prong of the test requires the trial court to determine if an exception applies to the evidence sought to be admitted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 61, 644 A.2d 887 (1994). In the present case, the trial court permitted the state\u2019s attorney to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual assault of his daughter to prove: (1) a common scheme or plan on the part of the defendant to abuse young girls sexually; and (2) the identity of the perpetrator of the sexual abuse alleged in the present case. The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the admission of this evidence under either exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly permitted the state\u2019s attorney to elicit the prior misconduct evidence to show a common plan or scheme on the part of the defendant. \u201cWhen evidence of [prior uncharged misconduct] is offered to show a common [plan or scheme], the marks which the . . . charged [and uncharged] offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>of the other. ... In order to assess the defendant\u2019s claim, we must examine the [prior uncharged misconduct] evidence and compare it to the charged offense. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u201cTo guide this analysis, we have held that [e]vidence of prior sex offenses committed with persons other than the prosecuting witness is admissible to show a common design or plan whe[n] the prior offenses (1) are not too remote in time; (2) are similar to the offense charged; and (3) are committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness. . . . We are more liberal in admitting evidence of other criminal acts to show a common scheme or pattern in [trials of] sex related crimes than [in trials of] other crimes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 791-92, 785 A.2d 573 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the state\u2019s attorney to elicit the testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter for the purpose of establishing a common plan or scheme. First, the incident involving the defendant\u2019s daughter occurred approximately eight to nine months before the defendant\u2019s sexual assault of the victim. Thus, the prior uncharged offense was not remote in time in relation to the charged offense. Cf., e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 62 (despite seven year hiatus between prior misconduct and charged offense, trial court did not abuse discretion in concluding that misconduct evidence \u201cwas sufficiently recent to have probative value\u201d). Second, there are many similarities between the defendant\u2019s alleged abuse of his daughter and his abuse of the victim. In each case, the defendant: (1) sexually abused a young girl; (2) had a close relationship with the girl\u2019s mother, but was not married to her; (3) had access to the victim of the abuse because of his familial or familial-type relationship with her; (4) had ample opportunity to be alone with each victim; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>and (5) engaged in assaultive behavior consisting of digital or penile penetration of the vagina. Although the age difference between the victim and the defendant\u2019s daughter was approximately five years, both were young, prepubescent girls, and the defendant occupied a paternal role in their lives. In light of these similarities between the charged and uncharged misconduct, and giving appropriate deference to the ruling of the trial court, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter was probative of a common plan or scheme of behavior toward young girls. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 789-92 (defendant exhibited common scheme of behavior when both victims were related to one another and to defendant, and sexual misconduct occurred at same location); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 62-63 (defendant engaged in common plan or scheme because all three victims were young girls, defendant maintained close relationship with victims\u2019 families and defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of each victim bore certain similarities); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 173-74, 471 A.2d 949 (1984) (defendant exhibited common scheme of behavior inasmuch as two victims were similar in age, and defendant had consumed alcohol before using knife to force each victim to engage in oral sex and then vaginal intercourse); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>172 Conn. 140, 146-47, 374 A.2d 150 (1976) (trial court reasonably found common plan or scheme when defendant schoolteacher used position of authority to obtain or seek sexual favors from two female students in return for favorable academic evaluations).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Having determined that the evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of the defendant\u2019s daughter was relevant and material, we now must address the issue of whether the evidence nevertheless should have been excluded because it was unduly preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>dicial. As we have indicated, \u201c[tjhe primary responsibility for conducting the balancing test to determine whether the evidence is more probative than prejudicial rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 793. In the present case, the state\u2019s attorney presented a lengthy offer of proof, and the trial court entertained argument from both parties. Following the offer of proof and argument of counsel, the trial court expressly found that the probative value of the prior misconduct evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. In light of the marked similarities between the charged and uncharged misconduct, the probative value of the latter was significant in regard to the issue of common plan or scheme. Moreover, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the evidence was not admitted to prove the defendant\u2019s bad character or criminal tendencies. See footnotes 36 and 37 of this opinion. Thus, although the prior misconduct evidence undoubtedly gave rise to some prejudice, we cannot say that its prejudicial effect was so great as to outweigh its probative force. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state\u2019s attorney to introduce the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct to establish a common plan or scheme.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the state\u2019s attorney to introduce the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct to establish the defendant\u2019s identity as the perpetrator of the sexual assault alleged in the present case. \u201cThe first threshold for the use of evidence of other crimes or misconduct on the issue of identity is that the methods used be sufficiently unique to warrant a reasonable inference that the person who performed one misdeed also did the other. . . . [I]n proffering [prior misconduct] evidence [t]o prove other like crimes by the accused so nearly identical in method as to earmark them as the handiwork of the accused . . . much more is demanded than the mere repeated commission of crimes of the same class, such as repeated burglaries or thefts. The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 163, 665 A.2d 63 (1995). \u201cThere should [be no] significant differences in the context and modus operandi of the crimes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 100, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991). \u201cIn order to determine if this threshold criterion for admissibility has been met, we must examine the proffered evidence and compare it to the charged offenses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In comparing the proffered misconduct evidence and the crimes with which the defendant was charged, \u201c[t]he fact that some of the similarities between the offenses were legal or relatively common occurrences when standing alone does not . . . negate the uniqueness of the offenses when viewed as a whole. It is the distinctive combination of actions which forms the signature or modus operandi of the crime . . . and it is this criminal logo which justifies the inference that the individual who committed the first offense also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>committed the second.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 164. In other words, \u201c[t]he process of construing an inference of [ijdentity . . . usually [consists of] adding together a number of circumstances, each of which by itself might be a feature of many objects, but all of which together make it more probable that they coexist in a single object only. Each additional circumstance reduces the chances of there being more than one object so associated. The process thus corresponds accurately to the general principle of relevancy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In the present case, the shared similarities between the charged and uncharged misconduct, though substantial, are not so \u201cunusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u201d Id., 163. In contrast to the comprehensive testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter regarding the sexual assault that she allegedly experienced at the hands of the defendant, a similarly detailed account of the defendant\u2019s sexual assault of the victim could not be obtained in light of the victim\u2019s tender age. The absence of such details renders the evidence insufficient \u201cto narrow the circle of possible suspects significantly.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 354, 446 A.2d 382 (1982). We simply cannot say, therefore, that the two sexual assaults, although similar, shared such unique or distinctive characteristics as to warrant a finding that they effectively bore the signature of the same person. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the state\u2019s attorney to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct for the purpose of establishing that the defendant was the perpetrator of the sexual assault in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Our conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the prior misconduct evidence to establish identity, however, does not end our inquiry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>We also must determine whether the impropriety was harmful. \u201cWhen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. As we recently have noted, we have not been fully consistent in our articulation of the standard for establishing harm. . . . One line of cases states that the defendant must establish that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result. . . . A second line of cases indicates that the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>258 Conn. 79, 94-95, 779 A.2d 112 (2001). For purposes of the present case, we need not choose between the two formulations or decide whether there is any functional difference between them because we conclude that the defendant has not satisfied his burden of proving harm under either formulation of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">As we previously have explained; see part III A of this opinion; the trial court properly allowed the state\u2019s attorney to introduce the prior misconduct evidence to prove a common plan or scheme. Thus, that evidence was properly before the jury, albeit under a different exception to the general rule against the admission of prior misconduct evidence. Moreover, because the defendant never seriously disputed that the victim had been sexually assaulted, the only contested issue in the case was whether the defendant was the person who had committed the assault. Thus, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct, which tended to establish a common plan or scheme, was relevant to establish that the defendant, and not someone else, had perpetrated the assault of the victim. In essence, therefore, the prior misconduct evidence was admitted under the common plan or scheme exception to establish circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>stantially the identity of the perpetrator. In such circumstances, and in light of the trial court\u2019s instructions emphasizing that the prior misconduct evidence was not to be considered for the purpose of determining whether the defendant had a propensity to commit the crimes with which he had been charged, we conclude that the improper admission of that prior misconduct evidence to prove identity was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">As we have explained in part III A and B of this opinion, the same prior misconduct evidence that was admissible to establish a common plan or scheme was inadmissible to prove identity. We take this opportunity to explain this apparent incongruity in our application of those two exceptions to the general rule barring the use of prior misconduct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">This very issue was identified and addressed by Judge (now Justice) Borden in <em>State </em>v. <em>Murrell, </em>7 Conn. App. 75, 507 A.2d 1033 (1986). As he explained for the Appellate Court in <em>Murrell. </em>\u201cWhere evidence of prior misconduct is sufficiently similar to the facts and circumstances of the charged offense to be admissible for the purpose of proving that the same individual committed both crimes, i.e., to be admissible under the identity exception, then there is some likelihood that the evidence is also relevant and admissible for the purpose of proving a common scheme or system of criminal activity. . . . Where, however, that evidence is not sufficiently similar to the charged offense to be admissible for the purpose of proving identity, but is offered into evidence in the state\u2019s case-in-chief for the purpose of proving a common scheme, then the similarity factor alone logically cannot be determinative, particularly where . . . identity is the principal element in dispute. This conclusion follows from the observation that evidence of a common scheme also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>tends to prove identity. ... To conclude otherwise would necessitate our adoption of the inherently contradictory position that the same evidence, which is not sufficiently similar to the charged misconduct to be admissible for the purpose of proving identity, may nevertheless be sufficiently similar for the purpose of proving a common scheme or system of criminal activity, and, therefore, admissible under that theory to prove the principal factual element of the charged crimes in dispute, namely, identity.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 88-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">This \u201cinherently contradictory position\u201d is most likely to arise in sexual assault or abuse cases inasmuch as this court has adopted a more liberal standard in such cases for the admission of prior misconduct evidence under the common plan or scheme exception even when the misconduct evidence is admitted under that exception for the purpose of establishing circumstantially the identity of the perpetrator. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 56, 62-63; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 147. This less restrictive approach, which we first articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>supra, 145-47, and which generally is followed by a majority of states; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Donoho, </em>204 Ill. 2d 159, 175-76, 788 N.E.2d 707 (2003) (listing states with liberal approach to admissibility of prior misconduct evidence in sex crime cases); is supported by two primary considerations, one of which is particularly relevant in child molestation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">First, in sex crime cases generally, and in child molestation cases in particular, the offense often is committed surreptitiously, in the absence of any neutral witnesses. Consequently, courts allow prosecutorial authorities greater latitude in using prior misconduct evidence to bolster the credibility of the complaining witness and to aid in the obvious difficulty of proof. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 883 (10th Cir. 1998); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Covert, </em>249 Cal. App. 2d 81, 88, 57 Cal. Rptr. 220 (1967); <em>People </em>v. <em>Donoho, </em>supra, 204 Ill. 2d 177-78; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 472, 441 N.E.2d 248 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>161 Vt. 327, 331, 640 A.2d 13 (1993); <em>Daniel v. State, </em>923 P.2d 728, 735 (Wyo. 1996). Second, because of the unusuaUy aberrant and pathological nature of the crime of ch\u00fcd molestation, prior acts of sim\u00fcar misconduct, as opposed to other types of misconduct, are deemed to be highly probative because they tend to estabhsh a necessary motive or explanation for an otherwise inexplicably horrible crime; see, e.g., <em>Ward </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Ark. 878, 883, 370 S.W.2d 425 (1963); <em>Acuna </em>v. <em>State, </em>332 Md. 65, 75, 629 A.2d 1233 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>supra, 331; see also 140 Cong. Rec. 24, 799 (1994), remarks of Senator Robert Dole in support of adoption of rules 413 through 415 of the Federal Rules of Evidence<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> (\u201c[i]n child molestation cases, for example, a history of sirmlar acts tends to be exceptionaHy probative because it shows an unusual disposition of the defendant\u2014a sexual or sado-sexuai interest in ch\u00fcdren\u2014that simply does not exist in ordinary people\u201d); and assist the jury in assessing the probability that a defendant has been falsely accused of such shocking behavior.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>supra, 332-33; see also 137 Cong. Rec. 6033 (1991) (United States Department of Justice summary of \u00a7 801 of proposed Comprehensive Violent Crime Control Act of 1991, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>incorporated proposed rules 413 through 415 of Federal Rules of Evidence) (\u201c[i]t is inherently improbable that a person whose prior acts show that he is in fact a rapist or child molester would have the bad luck to be later hit with a false accusation of committing the same type of crime or that a person would fortuitously be subject to multiple false accusations by a number of different victims\u201d).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">We have not been asked to reconsider our less restrictive approach to the admissibility of prior misconduct evidence in sex crime cases and, therefore, have no reason to revisit the soundness of the reasons underlying our law in this area. We emphasize, however, that our approach does not vest trial courts with carte blanche to allow the state to introduce any prior sexual misconduct evidence against an accused in sex crime cases. Rather, trial courts first must carefully determine whether the prior misconduct evidence sought to be admitted is being offered for a purpose other than to establish the defendant\u2019s bad character or criminal tendencies and whether that evidence falls within an exception to the general rule barring admissibility. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5 (a) and (b); see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 791-92. Courts then must scrupulously evaluate whether the probative value of such evidence outweighs the prejudicial effect that invariably flows from its admission. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>George B., </em>supra, 793-94; see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a74-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The defendant finally claims that his federal and state constitutional rights to a trial by an impartial jury were violated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s failure to poll the jurors regarding: (1) their possible exposure to media coverage of the trial; and (2) possible juror impropriety based on certain statements made by a juror who ultimately was excused. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, we review the governing legal principles. \u201cJury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. . . . [T]he right to a jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. . . . The modem jury is regarded as an institution in our justice system that determines the case solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given [it] in the adversary arena after proper instructions on the law by the court. ... To ensure that the jury will decide the case free from external influences that might interfere with the exercise of deliberate and unbiased judgment [we previously have held, pursuant to our supervisory authority over the administration of justice, that] a trial court is required to conduct a preliminary inquiry, on the record, whenever it is presented with information tending to indicate the possibility of juror misconduct or partiality.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 295-96, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">\u201cTh[e] form and scope [of that preliminary inquiry] may vary from a preliminary inquiry of counsel, at one end of the spectrum, to a full evidentiary hearing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>other end of the spectrum, and, of course, all points in between. Whether a preliminary inquiry of counsel, or some other limited form of proceeding, will lead to further, more extensive, proceedings will depend on what is disclosed during the initial limited proceedings and on the exercise of the trial court\u2019s sound discretion with respect thereto.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 526, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995). \u201cWe previously have instructed that the trial court should consider the following factors in exercising its discretion as to the form and scope of a preliminary inquiry into allegations of jurfor] misconduct: (1) the criminal defendant\u2019s substantial interest in his constitutional right to a trial before an impartial jury; (2) the risk of deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial before an impartial jury, which will vary with the seriousness and the credibility of the allegations of jurfor] misconduct; and (3) the state\u2019s interests of, inter alia, jurfor] impartiality, protecting jurors\u2019 privacy and maintaining public confidence in the jury system. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\u201cAny assessment of the form and scope of the inquiry that a trial court must undertake when it is presented with allegations of jurfor] [bias or] misconduct will necessarily be fact specific. No one factor is determinative as to the proper form and scope of a proceeding. It is the trial court that must, in the exercise of its discretion, weigh the relevant factors and determine the proper balance between them. . . . Consequently, the trial court has wide latitude in fashioning the proper response to allegations of juror bias. . . . We [therefore] have limited our role, on appeal, to a consideration of whether the trial court\u2019s review of alleged jurfor] misconduct can fairly be characterized as an abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 296-97. We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The defendant first contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to poll the jurors to determine whether they were aware of certain media coverage of the trial. The defendant\u2019s claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. On September 6, 2000, after the completion of jury selection but before the jury had been sworn,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the defendant informed the court that two newspaper articles regarding the case had been published on August 26, 2000, one in The Herald, which is based in New Britain, and the other in The Bristol Press. The defendant characterized these articles as \u201chav[ing] some detail in [them] that\u2019s rather disturbing.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The defendant requested that the trial court \u201cpoll the jury to see if they\u2019ve read anything in any local newspaper or anything about th[e] case and just warn them not to.\u201d The defendant, however, made no request that the court make any specific inquiry into whether any juror or jurors had read either of the two articles, and did not indicate that he had any reason to believe that any juror actually had seen one or both of the two articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request, noting that the jurors previously had been instructed to avoid media coverage of the case and that there was no indication that the jurors had disregarded those instructions. The court further observed that the two articles identified by the defendant were brief and \u201cnot notorious or anything.\u201d The court also observed that, during the voir dire of prospective jurors, counsel had inquired of those prospective jurors whether they had had any exposure to the case, and each such venireperson had answered in the negative. Finally, after noting that, \u201cbringing these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>things to light [sometimes] is more harmful than letting [them] be,\u201d the court indicated that it was open to the possibility of taking further action in the event that the defendant presented \u201cspecific information\u201d in support of his request to have the court poll the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We conclude that the facts that the defendant presented to the court simply did not \u201cindicate the possibility of juror misconduct or partiality\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 296; so as to trigger a duty on the part of the court to conduct even a preliminary inquiry. Id. The defendant presented no evidence that any juror had read or discussed either of the two brief articles. Rather, the defendant now contends that the mere existence of the articles required the court to poll the jury. We reject this contention in light of the fact that the court previously had instructed the jurors, as they each had been selected to serve on the jury in the defendant\u2019s case, to avoid exposure to any media accounts of the case. In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we presume that the jurors followed the court\u2019s instructions. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>252 Conn. 318, 331, 746 A.2d 761 (2000). Under the circumstances, therefore, including the extremely limited media coverage of the case, we conclude that the trial court was under no obligation to poll the jury or otherwise to take any further action regarding the matter.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The defendant also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to poll the jurors concem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ing possible juror misconduct following the dismissal of one of the jurors. We also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Certain additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. On September 8, 2000, after the trial had commenced, the court informed counsel, outside the presence of the jury, that one of the jurors had made a comment to a judicial marshal. Specifically, the court advised counsel that the juror had inquired as to whether the defendant was related to the chief of police of the Cheshire police department, and that, if so, the juror had a \u201creal problem with that.\u201d The court further noted that the juror also had made some \u201coff-color\u201d remarks. In addition, the state\u2019s attorney informed the court that he personally had overheard some of those remarks while present in the courtroom. In light of the juror\u2019s statements, the trial court informed counsel that it was going to excuse the juror. Both the state\u2019s attorney and defense counsel stated that they had no objections to the court\u2019s decision, and the court thereafter excused the juror. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court, sua sponte, should have polled the jury, upon excusal of that juror, to ascertain whether any of the other jurors had heard the excused juror\u2019s comments, and, if so, whether those comments had prejudiced any juror against the defendant.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Applying the relevant factors to the defendant\u2019s claim, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to poll the jury on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the comments of the excused juror. First, the private interest at stake, namely, the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury, contemplates that the trial court will consider the defendant\u2019s requests as they relate to the possible misconduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 295. In the present case, defense counsel, after being fully apprised of the juror\u2019s statements, agreed with the trial court that dismissal of the juror was the proper remedy and sought nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The second relevant factor, namely, the risk of deprivation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial before an impartial jury, depends in large measure on the \u201cseriousness and . . . credibility of the allegations of jar [or] misconduct.\u201d Id., 296. In the present case, there is no basis for concluding that the statements at issue were prejudicial to the defendant. With respect to the juror\u2019s comment about the chief of police of the Cheshire police department, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant is, in fact, related to that person. Indeed, it is unclear whether the excused juror would have treated the defendant favorably or unfavorably in light of the existence of such a relationship. Moreover, the trial court expressly noted that the comment was made to a judicial marshal only, and the record is devoid of any indication that the excused juror conveyed that remark to any of the other jurors. Finally, on at least two separate occasions before the juror was excused, the trial court had instructed the jurors not to speak with each other regar ding the case. We must presume that the jurors followed the corut\u2019s instructions in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 331. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest that the defendant suffered any prejudice by virtue of the excused juror\u2019s comments or \u201coff-color\u201d remarks. The record simply contains no indication that those statements were directed at the defendant or otherwise were prejudicial to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Finally, with respect to the final factor, namely, the state\u2019s interests in juror impartiality, protecting jurors\u2019 privacy or maintaining public confidence in the jury system; see <em>State </em>v. Mukhtaar, supra, 253 Conn. 296; we see no reason to conclude that these considerations obligated the court to poll the jury on the basis of the excused juror\u2019s comments. In view of the highly speculative nature of the defendant\u2019s claim and the absence of any demonstrable prejudice, the aforementioned considerations provide no appreciable support for the defendant\u2019s claim. For the foregoing reasons, we are persuaded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the juror without taking any additional remedial action.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C. J., and BORDEN and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b700-8\">KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIc\">dissenting. In the present case, the majority concludes that, although the testimony of the defendant\u2019s biological daughter regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct against her improperly was admitted under the identity exception to the rule prohibiting the admission of prior misconduct evidence, the testimony properly was admitted under the common scheme exception because, in both the incident involving the defendant\u2019s daughter and the incident involving the victim in the present case, the defendant allegedly had: (1) sexually abused a young girl (victim); (2) maintained a close relationship with the victim\u2019s mother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>but was not married to her; (3) had access to the victim because of his relationship with her; (4) had ample opportunity to be alone with the victim; and (5) committed the assault on the victim by digital or penile penetration. The majority reasons that the prior misconduct evidence properly was admitted under the common plan or scheme exception because, although not <em>so </em>similar as to constitute a \u201csignature\u201d; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, 235 </em>Conn. 145, 163, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); there are similarities between the offenses and the victims and the prior offense was not too remote in time to the charged offense. I reject this rationale because it reflects a further departure from the well established criteria for invoking the common scheme exception to which this court, until recently, has adhered. See C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 4.19.9. Sexual assault is a brutal and emotionally damaging crime, especially when the victim is a minor. This fact does not, however, justify the adoption of special rules of evidence or the relaxation of well established standards in derogation of a defendant\u2019s rights whenever the state seeks to introduce evidence of prior sexual misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, I would conclude that, applying our well established criteria, which I set forth herein, the trial court in the present case improperly admitted the testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter under the common scheme or plan exception. I would further conclude that the admission of this evidence was not harmless. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 172, 471 A.2d 949 (1984), this court discussed, in detail, the requirements for the common scheme exception to the general rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>prohibiting prior misconduct evidence: \u201cWhen evidence of other offenses is offered to show a common plan or design the marks which the uncharged and the charged offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one he must be guilty of the other. ... It is apparent that the indicated inference does not arise, however, from the mere fact that the charged and uncharged offenses share certain marks of similarity, for it may be that the marks in question are of such common occurrence that they are shared not only by the charged crime and [the] defendant\u2019s prior offenses, but also by numerous other crimes committed by persons other than [the] defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Additionally, even when the alleged conduct perpetrated against one victim was more similar and therefore shared more in \u201ccommon\u201d with the alleged conduct for which the defendant has been charged, the evidence also must be probative that these acts were connected as part of an overall plan. See <em>State v. Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 135, 486 A.2d 637 (1985) (\u201cevidence of other arsons, vandalism and false insurance claims [properly] admitted as probative of a common scheme to defraud insurance companies . . . that included the intentional destruction of property, by arson or vandalism, for profit, and the pressing of false claims for vandalism, theft and lost rents\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Murrell, </em>7 Conn. App. 75, 90, 507 A.2d 1033 (1986) (noting absence of evidence, which, in combination with uncharged misconduct evidence, would \u201ccreate the inference that these incidents were, in fact, parts of an overall plan, scheme or design\u201d). The misconduct evidence can \u201conly be connected to the charged crimes by showing a high degree of similarity in the modus operandi of their commission.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>supra, 135. As part of a continuing system of criminal activity, by design, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>will be a substantial number of factors that serve to connect the offense for which the defendant is on trial and the misconduct evidence the state seeks to introduce. Id. Thus, to be admissible, the uncharged act of misconduct must be \u201cso intertwined with the crime charged as to indicate that they are separate components of a general plan.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dothard, </em>666 F.2d 498, 504 (11th Cir. 1982); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>194 Conn. 623, 626, 484 A.2d 448 (1984) (\u201cIt is well settled that evidence of similar but unconnected crimes is generally not admissible to prove a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt. Such evidence can show no more than the defendant\u2019s bad character or an abstract disposition to commit a crime; it provides no proof of guilt of the specific offense in question.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In the recent past, however, this court, specifically in the context of sexual assault cases, has relaxed the requirements of the common scheme exception to the point that, as the majority\u2019s opinion in the present case essentially concedes, the exception has swallowed the rule precluding the admission of such misconduct evidence. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 80, 644 A.2d 887 (1994), I dissented, expressing my concerns in this regard. Much of what I stated therein has equal application to the present case and bears repeating. I noted therein that Professor Edward Imwinkelried of the University of California at Davis, who, in his treatise on this issue, divides the case law that has developed under the common plan exception into two categories: \u201ctrue plan\u201d cases, which he finds consistent with the prescribed exception; and \u201cspurious plan\u201d cases, which he rejects. Id., 82 <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting). In his most recent treatise, Imwinkelried explains that, \u201c[i]n a true plan case, the courts hold that the prosecutor may prove any uncharged crime by the defendant which shows that the defendant in fact and in mind formed a plan including the charged and uncharged crimes as stages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>in the plan\u2019s execution. . . . [B]oth crimes must be inspired by the same impulse or purpose. Both crimes must be steps toward the accomplishment of the same final goal. They are different stages of the plan. It is not enough for the prosecution to show that the defendant had a plan including crimes similar to the charged <em>crime; </em>the prosecution must show that the plan included the specific crime the defendant is now charged with.\u201d 1 E. Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence (Rev. Ed. 1999) \u00a7 3:22, pp. 117-19. Moreover, mere similarity between the crimes, standing alone, does not establish the existence of a true plan under another authoritative treatise. There must be a permissive inference that both crimes were related to an overall scheme in the defendant\u2019s mind. See 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 190, pp. 800-801 (to fall within common plan exception, \u201c[e]ach crime should be an integral part of an over-arching plan explicitly conceived and executed by the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Imwinkelried is critical, however, of spurious plan cases, in which \u201c[the] courts are quite liberal in admitting uncharged misconduct .... If the proponent can show a series of similar acts, these courts admit the evidence on the theory that a pattern or systematic course of conduct is sufficient to establish apian. Similarity or likeness between the crimes suffices. In effect, these courts convert the doctrine into aplan-to-commita-series-of-similar-crimes theory. ... In reality, these courts are arguably permitting the proponent to introduce propensity evidence in violation of the prohibition [against the admission of misconduct evidence]. Proof of a number of similar [crimes] may be probative of the defendant\u2019s status as a professional criminal .... However, if . . . there is no inference of a true plan in the defendant\u2019s mind, the proponent is offering the evidence on a forbidden theory of logical relevance. It is immaterial that there are many instances of similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>acts by the defendant; the large number of the acts increases the acts\u2019 probative value on the issue of the defendant\u2019s propensity, but standing alone the number of acts and similarities cannot change the propensity quality of the probative value. . . . The courts are illicitly allowing the proponent to prove the defendant\u2019s character, disposition, or propensity.\u201d 1 E. Imwinkelried, supra, \u00a7 3:24, pp. 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">As I noted in my dissent in <em>Kulmac, </em>\u201cappellate courts have relied on Professor Imwinkelried\u2019s cogent analysis to reverse trial court decisions admitting prior misconduct evidence in sexual assault cases. <em>Ali </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 A.2d 306 (D.C. 1987), is precisely on point. In <em>Ali, </em>the victim claimed that the defendant, who had been her mother\u2019s boyfriend, had molested her over a two year period starting when she was thirteen. The victim testified that the defendant had touched her breasts, and had engaged in vaginal and anal intercourse with her. Id., 308. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed the government to introduce evidence under the common scheme or plan exception that on a few occasions, the defendant had touched the breasts of the victim\u2019s younger sister. Id., 309.

That is precisely the \u2018propensity\u2019 inference forbidden by [the rule against admitting uncharged misconduct evidence].\u2019 Id., 311.

First, the similarities on which the majority relies \u201care of such common occurrence that they are shared not only by the charged crime and [the] defendant\u2019s prior [alleged offense], but also by numerous other crimes committed by persons other than [the] defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 172. Indeed, even when viewed together, these similarities are not in any way distinctive. Four of the five similarities\u2014the ages of the victims,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s close relationship with the victims, their mothers or their families generally, his access to the <em>victims\u2014because </em>of those relationships\u2014and the opportunity to be alone with the victims\u2014again, because of those relationships^\u2014are of such \u201ccommon occurrence\u201d that they generally apply to pedophiles. See American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed. 1994) \u00a7 302.2, pp. 527-28. The fifth \u201csimilarity\u201d\u2014the types of sexual activities alleged by the victims\u2014is not really a similarity at all. In the present case, both the victim and the defendant\u2019s daughter accused the defendant of digital or penile penetration. Again, these activities, regrettably, are common to pedophiles generally; see id.; and, therefore, do not create the necessary \u201c \u2018distinctive combination\u2019 \u201d of actions that forms the modus operandi of the crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 164. Indeed, the trial court here found only that the prior misconduct evidence was \u201csufficiently similar\u201d to justify its admission based on certain generic factors that are common to a class of sexual offenses. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murrell, </em>supra, 7 Conn. App. 81 (\u201claw requires not only a high degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of similarity between the events and circumstances of the past and present incidents, it imposes the additional requirement that those common features be \u2018sufficiently unique\u2019 ... to warrant the desired inference\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Moreover, there is absolutely no evidence that there existed \u201ca true plan in the defendant\u2019s mind\u201d; <em>Ali </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 520 A.2d 312; that included the alleged assaults on his daughter and the victim as stages in its execution. Indeed, the majority does not claim that the charged and uncharged acts of misconduct in this case were connected by a true plan in the defendant\u2019s mind. \u201c[T]he only connection they claim between the charged and uncharged acts is the defendant\u2019s desire to sexually abuse young girls. Such a desire does not amount to a plan: \u2018Characterizing a plan in terms of a general bad motive may be probative of an accused\u2019s <em>status </em>as a bad person, but if there is no inference of a specific plan in the accused\u2019s mind which interconnects the uncharged and charged acts, then the other crimes evidence is offered for nothing other than the accused\u2019s propensity to commit a series of similar but discrete bad acts.\u2019 . . . [Id., 311]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>880 F.2d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir. 1989) (to be admissible, a prior act of misconduct \u2018must establish a motive to commit the crime charged, not simply a propensity to engage in criminal activity\u2019).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 86 <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting). By failing to apply the second prong of the common plan or scheme exception, the majority permits the admission of minimally similar evidence through the back door of that exception when it would not be permitted through the front door of the identity exception. I would conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly determined that the testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter satisfied the common plan or scheme exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Because I would conclude that the trial court improperly determined that both the identity and common scheme exception applied, I next would reach the question of the harmfulness of the impropriety.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe standard for determining whether a nonconstitutional error is harmless is [whether] ... it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>235 Conn. 711, 721-22, 670 A.2d 261 (1996). The burden to prove harmfulness is borne by the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>256 Conn. 854, 892, 776 A.2d 1091 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">It essentially is undisputed that the determinative issue at trial in the present case was the identity of the victim\u2019s assailant. The victim, although sixteen at the time of trial, was three years old when the abuse was discovered. Because she had no memory of the abuse, neither she, nor any other witness, could provide specific details of the alleged assault. In fact, the jury heard only from third party witnesses to whom the victim had made statements that, because of her tender years, lacked detail. By contrast, however, the defendant\u2019s daughter provided a precise account of what the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>dant allegedly had done to her. This evidence undoubtedly posed a serious risk that the jury would engraft those details onto the victim\u2019s general allegations, details which the victim herself had been unable to provide. Moreover, this evidence clearly would tend to lead the jury in the present case to conclude that the defendant had a distinct propensity to assault young girls and that, therefore, he must have been the person responsible for the victim\u2019s injuries. This result is exactly what the general rule barring misconduct evidence is designed to avoid. Under these circumstances, therefore, I would conclude that the defendant has established the requisite harmfulness to require reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical ipjury to such person or a third person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">All references in this opinion to \u00a7 53a-70 are to the 1987 revision unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-12\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is (1) under sixteen years of age . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">All references in this opinion to \u00a7 53a-71 are to the 1987 revision unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-14\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be iiyured, or its morals likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">All references in this opinion to \u00a7 53-21 are to the 1987 revision unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> The trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of thirty years imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\"> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b644-11\"> The victim\u2019s sister was twenty-one years old at the time and her daughter was four years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b644-12\"> The victim\u2019s nineteen year old brother occasionally spent the night at the apartment when he was not at his girlfriend\u2019s house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\"> The labia majora are folds of skin that form part of the boundaries of the opening of the vagina and constitute part of the external genitalia in females.

Id., 821.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\"> For the same reasons, we reject the defendant\u2019s challenge to Betterini\u2019s testimony that the victim\u2019s mother told him that the alleged incident had occurred on \u201cMay 17,1997, when she left for a period of time to go out to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>dancing.\u201d Evenifweassume that Betterini\u2019stestimonyinthis regard contained inadmissible hearsay, the admission of that testimony also was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\"> The defendant contends that, because Betterini did not interview the victim until approximately two weeks after the victim had made the initial statements to day care center personnel, there was ample time for the victim\u2019s mother to have influenced the victim\u2019s perception regarding the abuse. In support of his contention, the defendant refers to the fact that the victim\u2019s statements became more specific or detailed with the passage of time. For example, the defendant notes that the victim\u2019s initial statements to her mother were in the nature of \u201c[D]addy hurt [me],\u201d whereas the statements that the victim made to Betterini were more specific as to what \u201cDaddy\u201d had done to her. Although the victim\u2019s statements to Betterini may be characterized as somewhat more detailed than some of the victim\u2019s earlier statements, there simply is no evidence to suggest that that greater specificity was the product of any coaching or prompting on the part of the victim\u2019s mother. Nor were the victim\u2019s statements, considered in their entirety, inconsistent in any way. Indeed, the victim repeatedly and consistently identified \u201cDaddy\u201d as the person who had harmed her. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the victim\u2019s statements to Betterini were unreliable merely because they were more specific than statements that the victim previously had made regarding the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\"> The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly allowed Betterini to testify as to a statement that the victim\u2019s mother had made to him regarding the victim\u2019s identification of \u201cDaddy\u201d as the defendant. We conclude that this testimony also constitutes inadmissible hearsay within hearsay. For reasons that we have explained and hereafter explain in this opinion, however, we also conclude that the admission of Betterini\u2019s testimony in this regard was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> The defendant does not claim that the trial court improperly allowed the state\u2019s attorney to introduce this report into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> The defendant contends that Betterini\u2019s testimony that the victim\u2019s \u201cmother knew Daddy as [the defendant]\u201d was inadmissible hearsay. We need not determine whether this testimony contained hearsay or, if so, whether it was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule because it was merely cumulative of the trial testimony of the victim\u2019s mother, in which she identified the defendant as \u201cDaddy,\u201d as well as other admissible evidence identifying the defendantas \u201cDaddy.\u201d Consequently, evenifwe were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to assume that Betterini\u2019s testimony had incorporated inadmissible hearsay, the admission of that testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\"> Immediately after the defendant\u2019s daughter had completed her direct examination testimony, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cI want to caution you about the evidence which you just heard from this witness . . . concerning the sexual assaults allegedly committed upon her by the defendant. I permitted you to hear that evidence for a limited purpose. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>evidence offered by the state of prior acts of misconduct of the defendant is not being admitted to prove the bad character of the defendant or his tendency to commit criminal acts. That is, the evidence is not to be used by you as evidence that the defendant had a propensity to commit the crimes with which he is charged in this case, or since he did things, if he did them, as [the defendant\u2019s daughter] claims, that he must have committed the crimes alleged in this case. Such evidence is being admitted solely to show or establish a plan or scheme in the commission of criminal acts or the identity of the person who committed the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\u201cNow, remember, the information charges this defendant with acts supposedly committed upon [the victim]. He is not charged in this case with having done anything to [his daughter] .... I permitted you to hear this evidence about what [the defendant\u2019s daughter] claims because of the claimed similarities between what [the defendant\u2019s daughter] testified about and what . . . [Yelding, Miranda and the victim\u2019s mother] testified about what [the victim] told them about what happened to her and who did it.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">\u201cThe issue of the similarities is an issue for you to determine, and if you determine that the similarities axe strong enough to be like a signature or fingerprint, you may use that in determining whether or not you believe that what the witnesses I just mentioned of [the victim\u2019s] account of what happened is true. On the other hand, if you, the jury, determine that the similarities are not strong enough, then you should completely disregard [the defendant\u2019s daughter\u2019s] testimony, and it should have no influence on your consideration of this case. I will talk to you further about the limited use, if any, of [the defendant\u2019s daughter\u2019s] testimony when I give you my final instructions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\"> In its final instructions to the jury at the conclusion of the case, the trial court stated: \u201cNow, in this case, you heard testimony from a witness . . . the defendant\u2019s daughter, wherein she testified about certain sexual acts committed on her by the defendant. This evidence offered by the state of prior acts of misconduct of the defendant was not admitted to prove the bad character of the defendant or his tendency to commit criminal acts. Such evidence is being admitted solely to show or establish a plan or scheme in the commission of criminal acts charged in the information or the identity of the person who committed the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">\u201cNow, evidence from [the defendant\u2019s daughter] cannot be used by you to show that the defendant had a propensity to commit a crime or since he had committed those acts on [his daughter], he must have done what is alleged in this case. That testimony from [the defendant\u2019s daughter] may be used by you but only for a limited puipose or not at all. That evidence was offered by the state to show that there are similarities between the conduct on [the victim] and the conduct on [the defendant\u2019s daughter] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>indicate that this was a unique way or technique or like [a] signature, like [a] fingerprint, of the way this defendant did these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\u201cIt is up to you to determine whether or not you believe [the] testimony of [the defendant\u2019s daughter] and/or the testimony of [Yelding, Miranda, the victim\u2019s mother] or Detective Betterini about what [the victim] told them and whether or not there is sufficient similarity in what supposedly was done with each of these girls, to draw conclusions that help you determine whether or not the defendant did these things to [the victim].</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">\u201cThis is entirely up to you. If you find there is not sufficient similarity here, then forget [the defendant\u2019s daughter\u2019s] testimony, but if you think there is sufficient similarity and believe it, then you may use it to determine whether or not these things were done to [the victim]. It is up to you and you alone to determine whether or not there are sufficient similarities that it becomes of some assistance to you in determining whether or not these things were done as alleged on [the victim].</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">\u201cAgain, youmay notconsider such evidence as establishing apredisposition onthepartofthe defendant to commit any of the crimes charge d or to demonstrate a criminal propensity. You may consider such evidence if you believe it and further find [that] it logically, rationally and conclusively supports the issues for which it is being offered by the state but only as it may bear here on the issues which I have just discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">\u201cOn the other hand, if you do not believe such evidence, or even if you do, if you find that it does not logically, rationally and conclusively support the issues for which it is being offered by the state, namely, to show a common scheme or plan or identity of the perpetrator of the crimes charged, then you may not consider that testimony for any purpose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\"><em> </em>According to the dissent, the test that we apply to determine the admissibility of prior sexual misconduct evidence for the purpose of establishing a common plan or scheme is insufficient to assure that the prior misconduct evidence is not merely evidence of a \u201cpattern or systematic course of conduct,\u201d but, rather, evidence of a \u201ctrue\u201d plan or scheme such that the charged and uncharged conduct are \u201crelated to an overall scheme in the defendant\u2019s mind.\u201d In other words, the dissent asserts that the test established by this court for the admission of common plan or scheme evidence in sexual assault cases is predicated on \u201cthe theory that a pattern or systematic course of conduct is sufficient to establish a plan,\u201d and that such conduct, in fact, is inadequate to prove a common plan or scheme. The defendant, however, did not raise this claim, and, therefore, we do not address it. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Luurtsema, </em>262 Conn. 179, 204, 804 A.2d 223 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> Rule 413 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) In a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Rule 414 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) In a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of child molestation, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of another offense or offenses of child molestation is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> We note that both of these reasons are fully applicable to the present case, which involves the defendant\u2019s sexual assault of a child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\"> Although the rationale for the less restrictive approach to the admissibility of prior sexual misconduct evidence in sex crime cases has not escaped criticism; see, e.g., 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed. 1999) \u00a7 190, pp. 669-70; it remains persuasive in many quarters, including the United States Congress, which adopted rules 413 through 415 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, \u00a7 320935, 108 Stat. 1796, 2135-37 (1994). In addition, Alaska, Arizona, California, Illinois and Texas have adopted similar provisions in their respective state evidence codes. See Alaska R. Evid. 404 (b) (2) and (3); Ariz. R. Evid. 404 (c); Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 1108 (Deering Sup. 2002); 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-7.3 (West 2002); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 38.37 (Vernon Sup. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> See Practice Book \u00a7 42-14 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\"> The defendant provided the court with copies of the two articles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\"> Indeed, even if we were to conclude that the trial court was obligated to conduct a preliminary hearing, the court properly discharged that responsibility. The court inquired of both parties regarding the matter, entertained argument of counsel and reviewed the two newspaper articles. In view of the facts presented to the court, the procedure followed by the court fully satisfied the requirement of a preliminary hearing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 526.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> We note that the defendant did not request that the trial court poll the jury with respect to the effect of the comments of the excused juror on the other jurors. Nevertheless, a trial court is obligated to undertake a preliminary inquiry anytime that it is presented with information indicating a reasonable possibility of juror misconduct or impropriety. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 296; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 526. Accordingly, the defendant is not precluded from raising his claim on appeal. The defendant\u2019s failure to make such a request when the juror was excused, however, suggests that, at the time of trial, he did not believe that polling the jury was necessary under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> We note, however, that, for example, the trial court reasonably might have queried the excused juror to determine whether he had spoken to any of the other members of the jury about the case in violation of the trial court\u2019s instructions. Although we do not suggest that such an inquiry was necessary in the present case, we encourage trial courts to consider this approach when confronted with circumstances such as those presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> Indeed, I would suggest that creating exceptions to sound rules well ensconced in our jurisprudence based on the nature of the offense in question is reminiscent of other creatures of our common law that we have abandoned or abridged. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 303, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (scope of constancy of accusation held broader than necessary and limited accordingly).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> Nor are the ages of the victims of the charged and the uncharged offenses in the present case\u2014three and nine years old\u2014so similar as to be unique.

App. 81; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 62-63 (similarity when three girls ranging in age from nine to eleven years old alleged misconduct by defendant).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> For the same reasons that I conclude herein that the trial court decision admitting the evidence was not harmless, I also would conclude that, whatever relevance the evidence may have had, its prejudicial effect far outweighed its probative value and, accordingly, that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>260 Conn. 372, 397 n.13, 796 A.2d 1191 (2002), we recognized that this court previously had \u201cnoted, without resolving, that there appear to be two standards of review for establishing the existence of harmful error. One line of cases states that the defendant must establish that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result. ... A second line of cases indicates that the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>258 Conn. 79, 95, 779 A.2d 112 (2001). Because I would conclude that the evidence admitted in this case constitutes harmful error under either standard, I need not reach the question of the dual standards.
