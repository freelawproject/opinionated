Gordon, executor of the estate of Edwin Mak,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> jointly appeal from the judgment of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and Gordon\u2019s cross claim in this action for indemnification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-141d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that they should be indemnified by the state for a judgment rendered in their favor in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Mak, the former high sheriff for Fairfield County. The trial court granted the motions to dismiss filed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>state defendants; see footnote 1 of this opinion; based on lack of standing and the bar of sovereign immunity. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cOn March 31,1999, in consolidated cases brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut found in favor of [Ann] St. George and [Louis] Lewis and against Mak on St. George and Lewis\u2019 claims that Mak violated their rights under the first amendment to the United States constitution by taking adverse employment action against them in retaliation for their union organizing activities. [Anthony Slez, Jr.] and [Kevin] Boyle represented St. George and Lewis in their suit against Mak. The office of the attorney general . . . initially represented Mak in the case but later withdrew pursuant to \u00a7 5-141d (b). On February 15, 2000, judgment was entered in the [federal] case for [St. George and Lewis] in the amount of $301,696.47, which amount included attorney\u2019s fees, costs and prejudgment interest. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a claim against Mak\u2019s estate, which claim was allowed by the executor, Gordon, in the amount of $301,696.47. The estate, however, is without funds to satisfy the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. On September 8, 2000, the plaintiffs, together with Gordon, made a demand for payment on the judgment upon [Wyman] pursuant to \u00a7 5-141d (a) and General Statutes \u00a7 3-112, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>demand has not been paid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs commenced this action thereafter on December 14, 2000. On February 26, 2001, Gordon filed a cross claim against the [state defendants], in which he also seeks a declaratory judgment as to whether the estate of Mak, through Gordon as executor, is entitled to indemnification [for] the federal court judgment against Mak.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u201cOn May 15, 2001, the [state defendants] filed these motions to dismiss both the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and Gordon\u2019s cross claim. The [state] defendants [moved] to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the grounds that (1) the plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims; (2) their claims are barred by the principles of sovereign immunity; and (3) they have failed to pursue remedies under General Statutes \u00a7 4-141<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> et seq. The [state] defendants [moved] to dismiss Gordon\u2019s cross claim on the ground of sovereign immunity as well as on the ground that he failed to pursue remedies under \u00a7 4-141 et seq.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The trial court granted both motions to dismiss. First, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek indemnification under \u00a7 5-141d because the statute does not provide any rights for creditors of a state employee. Next, the trial court concluded that Gordon\u2019s cross claim was barred by sovereign immunity. This appeal by the plaintiffs and Gordon followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiffs and Gordon contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>lacked standing and that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the cross claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court improperly concluded that they lacked standing to bring this action for indemnification under \u00a7 5-141d and General Statutes \u00a7 3-112.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that standing is not one of the five permitted grounds for which an action may be dismissed under Practice Book \u00a7 10-31, and, further, that \u00a7 5-141d, by necessary implication, gives the plaintiffs standing to make a claim for indemnification. The state defendants counter that a motion to dismiss is proper when a party lacks standing and that the plaintiffs here lacked standing because any right to indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 5-141d is vested in the state employee himself or herself, and not in the creditors of that state employee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the state defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review that governs our analysis of this issue. The issue of standing implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss. Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (a). \u201c[I]t is the burden of the party who seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor . . . clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>261 Conn. 198, 210, 802 A.2d 74 (2002); <em>Steeneck </em>v. <em>University of </em>Bridgeport, 235 Conn. 572, 579, 668 A.2d 688 (1995). Because a determination regarding the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction raises a question of law, our review is plenary. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>247 Conn. 407, 410, 722 A.2d 271 (1999); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>246 Conn. 652, 660, 717 A.2d 706 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that lack of standing cannot be raised by a motion to dismiss is clearly without merit. Pursuant to the rules of practice, a motion to dismiss is the appropriate motion for raising a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Practice Book \u00a7 10-31 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A] motion to dismiss shall be used to assert (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter . . . .\u201d Because a lack of standing deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court properly entertained the state defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\u201cThis court has had many opportunities to determine what constitutes standing. Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gay &amp; Lesbian Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>236 Conn. 453, 466, 673 A.2d 484 (1996); accord <em>Presidential Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>231 Conn. 500, 504, 652 A.2d 489 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In order to determine whether a party has standing to make a claim under a statute, a court must determine the interests and the parties that the statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>designed to protect. See <em>Steeneck </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 579. \u201cEssentially the standing question in such cases is whether the . . . statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiffs position a right to judicial relief.\u201d <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975). The plaintiff must be within the zone of interests protected by the statute. <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>235 Conn. 334, 345, 663 A.2d 1011 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The fact that the plaintiffs in the present case seek only declaratory relief does not reheve them of the obligation to establish standing in order to maintain an action in the court. See <em>Steeneck </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 578-79. \u201cIt is a basic principle of our law . . . that the plaintiffs must have standing in order for a court to have jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In the present case, we must determine whether the plaintiffs, as judgment creditors of a state employee, are within the zone of interests protected by \u00a7 5-141d. That statute provides in relevant part: \u201cThe state shall . . . indemnify any state officer or employee . . . from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment ... if the officer, employee or member is found to have been acting in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-141d (a). The language expressly vests any right provided by \u00a7 5-141d in the state officer or employee against whom the claim is made or suit is brought. In this case, the statutory rights were vested in Mak as the high sheriff, and now are vested in Gordon in his representative capacity of Mak\u2019s estate. We previously stated in our opinion in <em>Hunte </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>238 Conn. 146, 153, 680 A.2d 1231 (1996), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>that the \u201cmanifest policy motivating [\u00a7 5-141d is] the protection of state employees from liability for negligent acts that occur in the course of employment.\u201d Section 5-141d makes no mention of indemnifying third parties or third party creditors of state officers or employees. The plaintiffs are not within the zone of interests that \u00a7 5-141d expressly protects. Furthermore, we are not aware of any authority, legislative history or any other evidence, nor have the plaintiffs provided us with any, that demonstrates that the legislature intended to allow a third party creditor to make an indemnification claim pursuant to \u00a7 5-141d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs lack standing to make a claim against the state for indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 5-141d. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed the complaint in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">We next turn to Gordon\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly concluded that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred his cross claim against the state defendants. Gordon asserts that his claim for indemnification against the state is not barred by sovereign immunity because \u00a7 5-141d authorizes suit against the state by necessary implication. Although \u00a7 5-141d does not authorize suit expressly, Gordon claims that the ability to bring suit against the state must be implied, because \u00a7 5-141d otherwise would be without effect. The state defendants counter that \u00a7 5-141d waives the state\u2019s immunity from liability, but does not waive the state\u2019s immunity from suit, and the plaintiffs\u2019 only recourse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>therefore, is to file a claim with the claims commissioner. We agree with the state defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u201c[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss. . . . <em>Antinerella </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 479, 489, 642 A.2d 699 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>263 Conn. 74, 80-81, 818 A.2d 758 (2003). We previously recited the standard of review for a claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction in part I of this opinion, and therefore, we begin our plenary review of Gordon\u2019s cross claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We employ additional rules of statutory construction with regard to a statute that is claimed to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. \u201c[BJecause the state has permitted itself to be sued in certain circumstances, this court has recognized the well established principle that statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity should be strictly construed. . . . Where there is any doubt about their meaning or intent they are given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity. . . . Further, this court has stated that the state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued without its consent is not to be diminished by statute, unless a clear intention to that effect on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>legislature is disclosed . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Sovereign immunity is comprised of two concepts, immunity from liability and immunity from suit. \u201cIn <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>[144 Conn. 282, 285-86, 130 A.2d 293 (1957)], this court recognized the distinction between immunity from suit and immunity from liability. There is, of course, a distinction between sovereign immunity from suit and sovereign immunity from liability. Legislative waiver of a state\u2019s suit immunity merely establishes a remedy by which a claimant may enforce a valid claim against the state and subjects the state to the jurisdiction of the court. By waiving its immunity from liability, however, the state concedes responsibility for wrongs attributable to it and accepts liability in favor of a claimant. <em>Greenfield Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of State Highways, </em>402 Mich. 172, 193, 261 N.W.2d 718 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u201cThe court in <em>Bergner </em>concluded that a statute that explicitly waived immunity from suit should be construed as implicitly waiving immunity from liability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>because, otherwise, the waiver of suit would be meaningless. <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 144 Conn. 287. . . . This court reasoned that [i]t would be utterly useless and meaningless to permit a suit which could not end otherwise than in a judgment for the defendant. [Id.] Thus, the court concluded that the waiver of immunity from suit impliedly included a waiver of immunity from liability. See id., 288. We did not address, however, whether in the reverse situation\u2014when there is an explicit waiver of immunity from liability but not a waiver of immunity from suit\u2014a waiver of immunity from suit should be implied.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 79-80. In <em>Martinez, </em>we recently concluded that an explicit waiver of immunity from liability did not implicitly include a waiver of immunity from suit. Id., 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Our conclusion in the present case is controlled by our ruling in <em>Martinez, </em>wherein we concluded that an analogous statute that provided for indemnification of state police officers and others, General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a, constituted a waiver of immunity from liability, but not a waiver of immunity from suit. Id., 83.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore determined that the plaintiffs indemnity claim could be satisfied only by the filing of a claim with the claims commissioner, and not by filing suit. Id., 84-85. The same result applies in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Section 5-141d (a) contains no express waiver of immunity from suit. Section 5-141d (a) provides in rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>vaxit part: \u201cThe state shall save harmless and indemnify any state officer or employee . . . from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of his alleged negligence or alleged deprivation of any person\u2019s civil rights or other act or omission resulting in damage or injury, if the officer, employee or member is found to have been acting in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment and such act or omission is found not to have been wanton, reckless or malicious.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Additionally, unlike many other statutes, \u00a7 5-141d makes no reference to allowing a suit against the state. \u201cA review of analogous statutes demonstrates that when the legislature has intended to waive immunity from suit in other contexts, it clearly has expressed such an intent through explicit language in the text of the statute. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (a) (authorizing those who have entered into public works contract with state to \u2018bring an action against the state\u2019); General Statutes \u00a7 12-369 (stating that \u2018[ajctions may be brought against the state\u2019 for puipose of quieting title to property); General Statutes \u00a7 12-572 (f) (allowing off-track betting facility operators with contracts with state to \u2018bring an action against the state\u2019 to settle any disputed claims under contract); General Statutes \u00a7 52-556 (granting \u2018right of action against the state\u2019 to recover damages for any injury to person or property caused by a state employee negligently operating state owned motor vehicle).\u201d <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Moreover, there is no legislative history concerning \u00a7 5-141d indicating that the legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>waive immunity from suit. Section 5-141d, originating as Senate Bill No. 737, was debated in the labor committee, on the floor of the House of Representatives, and on the floor of the Senate. See, e.g., Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1, 1983 Sess., pp. 270-72; 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21, 1983 Sess., pp. 7491-7501; 26 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1983 Sess., pp. 2840-43. None of these discussions suggested that the legislature intended to authorize a waiver of immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Finally, the legislature was aware of the statutes concerning the claims commissioner when it enacted \u00a7 5-141d. General Statutes \u00a7 4-142<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> provides that all claims against the state should proceed through the claims commissioner unless suit is authorized expressly by law. \u201c[T]he legislature is presumed to have acted with knowledge of existing statutes and with an intent to create one consistent body of laws.\u201d <em>Zachs </em>v. Groppo, 207 Conn. 683, 696, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988). \u201cThe legislature thus presumably enact[s] [sovereign immunity statutes] with knowledge of our statutes requiring any person with a claim against the state to file such claim with the state claims commissioner . . . .\u201d <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 84. Furthermore, \u201c[t]his court previously has acknowledged that we find no authority, and we know of none, standing for the proposition that recourse to the claims commissioner is an inadequate remedy as a matter of law. We reject the implied assertion that the claims commissioner would not resolve fairly a dispute against the state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We conclude, as we did in <em>Martinez, </em>that \u00a7 5-141d does not waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court correctly dismissed Gordon\u2019s cross claim against the state defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Gordon claims, however, that General Statutes \u00a7 52-29,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 17-55<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and 17-56,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> impliedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>waive sovereign immunity. We disagree. Practice Book provisions cannot waive sovereign immunity, because only the legislature can authorize such a waiver. See <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 82.

The defendants are: Gordon, as executor of the estate of Mak, who died on November 20, 1999, after the federal action had been initiated; Nancy Wyman, the state comptroller; and Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general.

We do not address this conclusion because we have determined that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that Gordon\u2019s cross claim is barred by sovereign immunity because \u00a7 5-141d does not permit suit against the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> This court has recognized two other exceptions to sovereign immunity involving declaratory judgments, when: (1) a declaratory judgment is requested based on a substantial claim that the state or one of its officers violated a plaintiffs constitutional rights; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 31, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987); and (2) a declaratory judgment is sought based on a substantial allegation of wrongful conduct to promote an illegal purpose in excess of an officer\u2019s statutory authority. <em>Antinerella, </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 479, 497, 642 A.2d 699 (1994). The plaintiffs and Gordon claim that these exceptions to sovereign immunity apply in the present case. This action seeking a declaratory judgment is really tantamount, however, to an action for damages. The complaint requests that the trial court declare that the estate of Mak is entitled to indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 5-141d (a) and order Wyman, the comptroller, to settle the demand from Gordon for indemnification. Because the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that establishes that Mak\u2019s estate is entitled to indemnification and an order to Wyman to authorize payment, we construe the plaintiffs claim as one for monetary damages. The declaratory judgment exceptions therefore are not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> The General Assembly recently amended \u00a7 53-39a, effective June 3,2003, adding a sentence at the end of the existing statute.

I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 5-141d does not abrogate sovereign immunity so as to permit state employees to bring an action in Superior Court against the state for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>indemnification because, although \u00a7 5-141 d provides an express waiver of immunity from liability, it neither expressly nor implicitly waives immunity from suit. In reaching this conclusion, the majority determines that: (1) a waiver of immunity from liability is a concept that is distinct from, and does not confer implicitly, a waiver of immunity from suit; and (2) the legislature intended state employees to file for permission to sue the state with the claims commissioner under General Statutes \u00a7 4-160.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>Inmy view, construing \u00a7 5-141d to be in derogation of sovereign immunity is required in order to give effect to the legislature\u2019s clearly expressed intention to obligate the state to indemnify its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">I begin with the issue of standing; see <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>262 Conn. 480, 485, 815 A.2d 1188 (2003); <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 808, 761 A.2d 705 (2000); specifically, the question of whether the interests of creditors of an insolvent estate of a state employee are within the zone of interests intended to be protected by \u00a7 5-141d. The majority concludes that the right to pursue an indemnification action under \u00a7 5-141d is vested solely in the state employee because there is no express language in the statute or the legislative history to evince the legislature\u2019s intention that the employee\u2019s creditors may pursue such claims. I disagree with this narrow approach to determine the statute\u2019s zone of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\u201cStanding concerns [inter alia] the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is <em>arguably </em>within the zone of interests to be protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Med-Trans of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>242 Conn. 152, 160, 699 A.2d 142 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 113, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 492, 400 A.2d 726 (1978). In <em>Norwich v. Silverberg, </em>200 Conn. 367, 374-75, 511 A.2d 336 (1986), this court considered the purpose behind General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a, an analogous provision to the one in the present case, requiring that municipalities indemnify municipal employees for negligent actions occurring in the scope of employment. Then Chief Justice Peters, writing for the court, explained \u201cthe apparent purpose behind [the statute\u2019s] enactment. The statute is designed to furnish some relief for injustice that would otherwise attend our well-established doctrine of sovereign municipal immunity. . . . Absent such a statute, claimants injured by the misconduct of municipal officers and employees acting in the course of their official duties would be limited to recourse against individual tortfeasors. The legislature might reasonably have concluded that such limited recourse would be unfair <em>both to the injured claimant and to the municipal officer or employee. From the point of view of the claimant, he would be confronted with a defendant who might well lack the resources to provide adequate compensation for the claimant\u2019s injuries. </em>From the point of view of the municipal officer or employee, he would be required to shoulder ultimate liability, as well as the costs of defense, for conduct that was solely beneficial to his municipal employer. To remedy these distortions that the law of sovereign immunity would otherwise impose upon the fair allocation of the risks of accident and other tortious misconduct, the legislature provided for statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>indemnification by municipalities to relieve individual municipal employees and officers of personal liability for injuries they cause, or are alleged to have caused, to third parties on behalf of their municipalities.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In my view, the dual purpose we recognized in <em>Norwich, </em>wherein the relevant statutory language was identical to that in \u00a7 5-141d; compare General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a with General Statutes \u00a7 5-141d; is equally applicable in the present case. Therefore, I would conclude that the plaintiffs, as creditors, are \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Med-Trans of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 160; and, accordingly, have standing to assert their claim for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">I next turn to the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 5-141d does not abrogate sovereign immunity so as to permit suit against the state. I recognize that its conclusion was driven by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>263 Conn. 74, 818 A.2d 758 (2003), in which we concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a waived the state\u2019s immunity from liability for indemnification of state police officers but not immunity from suit. I further recognize the importance of the rule of stare decisis in our judicial system. See generally <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 658-59, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). Nonetheless, we do not adhere rigidly to precedent when a decision is clearly in error and does not further the interests of justice. Id., 659-60; see <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>262 Conn. 312, 328-29, 813 A.2d 1003 (2003). In my view, <em>Martinez </em>is such a case. I believe that the decision warrants further consideration, not because I did not have an opportunity to cast my vote on the question, but, rather, because <em>Martinez, </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>I believe was wrongly decided, was on the forefront of an issue having ramifications for the construction of numerous other statutes conferring rights to individuals and imposing attendant obligations on the state, as in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Accordingly, I turn to the issue of whether \u00a7 5-141d is in derogation of sovereign immunity. In accordance with our general principles of statutory construction, \u201c[this] process . . . involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>247 Conn. 256, 261-62, 721 A.2d 511 (1998). Moreover, \u201c[o]ur analysis is more specifically illuminated by the well settled principle that when the state waives sovereign immunity by statute a party attempting to sue under the legislative exception must come clearly within its provisions, because [statutes in derogation of sovereignty should be strictly construed in favor of the state, so that its sovereignty may be upheld and not narrowed or destroyed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 262. Finally, our analysis, for almost one century, has been guided by the rule that the legislature may waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity \u201cprovided clear intention to that effect is disclosed by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>ECAP Construction Co., </em>250 Conn. 553, 558-59, 737 A.2d 398 (1999); <em>Lacasse </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>214 Conn. 464, 468, 572 A.2d 357 (1990); <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 558, 534 A.2d 888 (1987); <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 228, 464 A.2d 45 (1983); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Conn. 295, 298, 294 A.2d 290 (1972); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 262-63, 196 A.2d 596 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>81 Conn. 9, 11, 69 A. 1028 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The majority concludes, and I agree, that \u00a7 5-141d does not contain language that we typically would consider an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity. Cf. <em>Capers </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>239 Conn. 265, 268 n.4, 273, 684 A.2d 696 (1996) (concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 52-556, which provides that \u201cperson injured . . . shall have a right of action against the state to recover damages for such injury\u201d provides express waiver of sovereign immunity). The majority construes this language, however, solely as a waiver of immunity from liability, but not immunity from suit. It relies on the fact that this court has recognized a distinction between immunity from liability and immunity from suit and reasons that, although a waiver of immunity from suit may imply a waiver of liability, the reverse does not result by necessary implication. In my view, the majority misconstrues the nature of the distinction between immunity from suit and immunity from liability so as to disconnect concepts that are by necessity interrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The distinction that underlies the majority\u2019s opinion was discussed in <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 284-86, 130 A.2d 293 (1957), wherein this corut explained the source and nature of the rule of sovereign immunity: \u201cIt is a well-established rule of the common law that a state cannot be sued without its consent. . . . This rule has its origin in the ancient common law. The king, being the fountainhead of justice, could not be sued in his own courts. . . . However, the king as the source of justice could not well refuse to redress the wrongs done to his subjects. Consequently, a procedure was developed whereby the subject, by bringing a petition to the king and securing his accession, could litigate his claim in the courts. . . . While a petition lay for a wide variety of actions, mostly proprietary in nature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>it did not lie for torts because of the hoary maxim \u2018The king can do no wrong.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201cFrom this history we see that there apparently were two principles at the foundation of the proposition that the king, and subsequently the state, could not be sued without consent. One was sovereign immunity from suit and the other was sovereign immunity from liability. . . . The distinction between immunity from suit and immunity from liability appears to have been recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>[supra, 81 Conn. 11], and <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>82 Conn. 392, 394, 73 A. 751 [1909]. The great majority of the courts of other jurisdictions make this same distinction and hold that a statute granting consent to sue the state merely provides a remedy to enforce such liability as the general law recognizes.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Thus, the origin of this distinction is based on the premise that, on occasion, the king would waive his immunity from suit, thereby submitting himself to the jurisdiction of the courts, and that a concomitant waiver of liability would result, but only for those wrongs for which suit was permitted. In modem law, we have explained, \u201cthe state\u2019s waiver of its immunity from liability only arises after a prior determination that it has waived its immunity from suit, and that a waiver of immunity from suit does not necessarily imply a waiver of immunity <em>from aU, aspects of liability </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>253 Conn. 134, 166-67, 749 A.2d 1147 (2000); accord <em>Lacasse </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 469. Consistent with the foregoing principle, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>concluded that a waiver of immunity from liability for damages does not also waive immunity from liability for an award of prejudgment interest; <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 556; or taxation of costs. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>176 Conn. 362, 366, 407 A.2d 987 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 82 Conn. 394. Therefore, although we have recognized a <em>distinction </em>between immunity from suit and immunity from liability, we never have treated them as <em>disconnected </em>concepts such that a waiver of one was not accompanied by a waiver of the other to some extent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 144 Conn. 284, this court was faced with the specific question of whether a legislative enactment specifically granting the plaintiff a right to sue the state merely waived immunity from suit, as the defendant contended, or whether it also waived immunity from liability. The court reasoned that the defendant\u2019s construction rendered the statute \u201cutterly useless and meaningless\u201d because it granted the plaintiff nothing. Id., 287. The court noted that \u201c[i]t is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that courts must presume that legislatures do not intend to enact useless legislation.\u201d Id. It further noted that \u201ca statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>conferring a privilege or a right carries with it by implication everything necessary to ensure the realization of that privilege or to establish that right in order to make it effectual and complete.\u201d Id., 288. Accordingly, the court looked beyond the \u201cliteral meaning of the words used in [the statute] to its history, to the language used in all its parts, and to its purpose and policy,\u201d concluding that the statute by necessary implication also waived immunity from liability and therefore abrogated sovereign immunity. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Therefore, consistent with our approach in <em>Bergner, </em>the question before us is whether \u00a7 5-141d, when viewed in light of the statutory language, its legislative history and the policy that the statute was intended to effectuate, indicates the legislature\u2019s intent to abrogate sovereign immunity. As with any issue of statutory construction, we begin with the language of the statute. Section 5-141d (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe state <em>shall save harmless and indemnify </em>any state officer or employee . . . from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim ... by reason of his alleged negligence or alleged deprivation of any person\u2019s civil rights ... if the officer . . . [or] employee ... is found to have been acting in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment and such act or omission is found not to have been wanton, reckless or malicious.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In construing this language, we are not writing on a blank slate. In <em>Hunte </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>238 Conn. 146, 147-48, 680 A.2d 1231 (1996), this court, sitting en banc, considered whether foster parents were employees within the meaning of \u00a7 5-141d. The court unanimously proceeded from the premise that \u201c[\u00a7] 5-141d [is] in derogation of sovereign immunity and therefore must be strictly construed.\u201d Id., 152; see id., 168 <em>(Callahan, J., </em>dissenting). Because a conclusion to the contrary would have deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction; <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>supra, 263 Conn. 80-81; <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 99, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996); this determination was essential to the holding in <em>Hunte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Hunte </em>is consistent with our subsequent construction, in <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>260 Conn. 167, 173, 793 A.2d 1076 (2002), of essentially identical language contained in another statute. In <em>Vibert, </em>this court examined General Statutes \u00a7 10-235 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cEach board of education <em>shall protect and save harmless . . . </em>any teacher . . . and the State Board of Education . . . <em>shall protect and save harmless </em>any . . . teacher or other [public school] employee . . . from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence ... or any other acts . . . resulting in any injury, which acts are not wanton, reckless or malicious, provided such teacher . . . was acting in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of employment . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 171-72. The court concluded that the \u201c \u2018protect and save harmless\u2019 language [is] indicative of a legislative intent to impose a <em>duty </em>of indemnification. . . . Thus, the \u2018protect and save harmless\u2019 language of \u00a7 10-235 (b) <em>clearly mandates </em>that a board of education indemnify a teacher for conduct falling within the purview of that subsection.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 173. Therefore, in accordance with <em>Hunte </em>and <em>Vibert, </em>the legislature\u2019s use of mandatory language in \u00a7 5-141d evinced its clear intention that indemnification not be discretionary. See <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>State, </em>261 Conn. 533, 540, 804 A.2d 801 (2002) (distinguishing mandatory from directory language); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>257 Conn. 258, 284-85, 777 A.2d 645 (2001) (same). The <em>only </em>way to give that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>effect to the statute is to construe it to be in derogation of sovereign immunity so as to permit employees to enforce that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Nevertheless, the majority in the present case concludes that its construction does not render \u00a7 5-141d meaningless because employees have recourse to seek indemnification by filing a claim with the claims commissioner. There are two substantive flaws with this conclusion. First, it runs counter to the mandatory language that the legislature adopted because the claims commissioner has discretion whether to grant permission to sue the state; see footnote 2 of this dissenting opinion; or to award specified damages. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-158.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, because the right to indemnification under \u00a7 5-141d is predicated on certain factual findings\u2014that the employee was acting in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment and that the act was not wanton, reckless or malicious\u2014the claims commissioner has broad latitude in making this decision. <em>See A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 207, 579 A.2d 69 (1990) (scope of employment typically question of fact); <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 327, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987) (same). In construing \u00a7 5-141d, the question before us is not, as the majority supposes, whether the commissioner will or will not be fair in exercising that discretion. The question is whether, by employing mandatory language, the legislature intended that state employees be <em>guaranteed </em>a right to indemnification so that they could proceed with the business of the state unhampered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>by concerns as to whether they would incur personal liability for negligent acts. If so, resort to the claims commissioner clearly would not effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Second, the majority\u2019s interpretation renders \u00a7 5-141d nothing more than a policy directive by the legislature\u2014 advising the claims commissioner under what circumstances to authorize such claims and providing notice to employees that they may assert such claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 am unaware of any other instance in which this court has construed a legislative enactment that expressly mandates a duty to have <em>no force of law. </em>This court generally eschews an interpretation that renders a statute a legal nullity. See, e.g., <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 532, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002); <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>245 Conn. 66, 75, 712 A.2d 938 (1998); <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 191, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). Indeed, had the legislature intended to issue what is tantamount to a policy directive, it was unnecessary to enact \u00a7 5-141d. A state employee, like any other person, may file a claim with the claims commissioner, who may approve immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>payment of claims under $7500; General Statutes \u00a7 4-158 (a); or grant permission to sue the state for damages above that amount \u201con any claim which, in his opinion, presents an issue of law or fact under which the state, were it a private person, could be liable.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a). Therefore, even prior to the enactment of \u00a7 5-141d, the claims commissioner could permit a state employee to sue the state for claims seeking damages above a certain amount if the facts were such that a private employer could have been held liable under a common-law indemnification action. See 2 Restatement (Second), Agency \u00a7\u00a7 438 through 440 (1958). Moreover, the legislature\u2019s policy in this regard had been set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 4-165, which was enacted in 1959, prior to the 1983 enactment of \u00a7 5-141d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See Public Acts 1983, No. 83-464, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (amending existing \u00a7 4-165 to conform with language in newly enacted \u00a7 5-141d). Section 4-165, which prescribes the terms under which statutory immunity may be available, prescribes the same factual predicates as those set forth in \u00a7 5-141d.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The legislative history, although sparse, also supports the conclusion that the legislature did not intend, when enacting \u00a7 5-141d, that state employees enforce their right to indemnification by filing a claim with the claims commissioner under chapter 53 of the General Statutes. Testimony given in committee hearings and remarks made during legislative debates on Senate Bill No. 737, which eventually was enacted as \u00a7 5-141d, indicate that the bill was intended to provide a mechanism that previously did not exist in order to ensure indemnification protection. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1,1983 Sess., pp. 270-71; 26 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1983 Sess., p. 2843; 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21,1983 Sess., p. 7498.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the legislative history makes no reference to bringing indemnification claims before the claims commissioner. Although we generally do not infer legislative intent from silence; <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>263 Conn. 22, 34-35, 818 A.2d 37 (2003); the legislature\u2019s expressed intent to create a new mechanism, coupled with its silence as to the claims commissioner, indicates that it did not intend for state employees to be required to resort to filing a claim with the claims commissioner, as any private individual would. Moreover, during committee hearings, Sandra Biloon, the director of personnel and labor relations and the deputy commissioner of administrative services explained that the \u201c[b]ill [was] intended to provide . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>comparability with similar legislation for teachers and administrators in higher education.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 271. As previously noted, we have construed \u00a7 10-235, the provision indemnifying teachers, as imposing a mandatory duty. See <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 173-74. This court has, in the past, construed statutes as abrogating sovereign immunity when consistent with furthering a legislative intent to afford a right to a class of individuals or to encompass substantive rights not expressly conferred by abrogation. See <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 268-71 (where state waived immunity under General Statutes \u00a7 52-556, permitting wrongful death claim, legislative history indicated state not immune from allocation of damages under General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h despite no waiver of immunity therein); <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 556-61, 569 A.2d 518 (1990) (rejecting contention that, by failing to provide express waiver of sovereign immunity, legislature intended for patients in state mental hospitals to bring claims to claims commissioner); <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 558 (\u201cnecessary implication of the purposes sought to be served by the enactment of the patients\u2019 bill of rights that the legislature intended to provide a direct cause of action against the state and thus to waive its sovereign immunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In sum, we are left with an imperfect choice when construing the language in \u00a7 5-141d. The statute does not include language that we typically would construe as an express waiver of sovereign immunity. It does, however, affirmatively impose on the state a duty to indemnify its employees when they are sued by third persons in their individual capacity for negligent acts. We can apply a mechanistic, formal approach that would render the indemnification provision \u201cutterly useless and meaningless\u201d; <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 144 Conn. 287; or we can \u201clook beyond the literal meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of the words used\u201d; id., 288; to further the statute\u2019s purpose of ensuring that state employees may conduct the state\u2019s business without concern about incurring personal liability for mere negligence. In my view, the latter is the correct approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-141d provides: \u201c(a) The state shall save harmless and indemnify any state officer or employee, as defined in section 4-141, and any member of the Public Defender Services Commission from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of his alleged negligence or alleged deprivation of any person\u2019s civil rights or other act or omission resulting in damage or injury, if the officer, employee or member is found to have been acting in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment and such act or omission is found not to have been wanton, reckless or malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u201c(b) The state, through the Attorney General, shall provide for the defense of any such state officer, employee or member in any civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any alleged act, omission or deprivation which occurred or is alleged to have occurred while the officer, employee or member was acting in the discharge of his duties or in the scope of liis employment, except that the state shall not be required to provide for such a defense whenever the Attorney General, based on his investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case, determines that it would be inappropriate to do so and he so notifies the officer, employee or member in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\u201c(c) Legal fees and costs incurred as a result of the retention by any such officer, employee or member of an attorney to defend his interests in any such civil action or proceeding shall be borne by the state only in those cases where (1) the Attorney General has stated in writing to the officer, employee or member, pursuant to subsection (b), that the state will not provide an attorney to defend the interests of the officer, employee or member, and (2) the officer, employee or member is thereafter found to have acted in the dischar ge of his duties or in the scope of his employment, and not to have acted wantonly, recklessly or maliciously.

This approach is a necessary corollary to the difference between the state\u2019s sovereign immunity and a municipality\u2019s governmental immunity. \u201cA suit against a municipality is not a suit against a sovereign.
