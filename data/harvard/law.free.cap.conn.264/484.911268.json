On April 6, 2001, following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of one count of public indecency in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-186 (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and acquitted of two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 8, 2001, the trial court sentenced the defendant, in accordance with the verdict, to six months imprisonment, execution suspended, and two years probation that included special conditions. The defendant was required, inter alia: to admit himself voluntarily to a residential treatment program at the Connecticut Valley Hospital for eight months; to avoid any contact with residents of the Gray Lodge, a residential treatment center and shelter for troubled adolescent females in Hartford; to submit to psychological and substance abuse evaluation and treatment; and to submit to random urinalysis. Thereafter, on June 6, 2001, the trial court made a factual finding that the victims of the offense for which the defendant had been convicted were minors and advised the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the mandatory requirement, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 54-250 (2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 54-251, that he register as a sex offender for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The defendant thereafter appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, challenging the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to make the factual finding and to advise the defendant of the registration requirement several weeks after judgment had entered and after execution of the judgment had begun. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We conclude that the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction when, pursuant to \u00a7 54-251, it found that the victims of the defendant\u2019s offense were minors and advised the defendant that he was required to register as a sex offender. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On June 10, 2000, the victims, two female residents of Gray Lodge, respectively thirteen and fourteen years old, were socializing inside the lounge area of the facility when they noticed a shabbily dressed black male with an unkempt Afro hair style enter the facility\u2019s private rear yard. The man, dressed in dirty khaki pants and a red shirt, walked near an adjacent abandoned building, dropped his pants and began to masturbate in full view of the victims and other residents. They were able to see the man through the rear window in the lounge, which was large and nearly wall-length. The residents notified several staff members of the facility who rushed to the lounge, where they also witnessed the man masturbating. One staff member telephoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the police and provided a description of the intruder. After approximately five minutes, the man pulled up his pants and exited the Gray Lodge yard. Moments later, he emerged from the grounds of the buildings adjacent to Gray Lodge and began to walk away from the facility, at which time the police arrived and detained him for identification by three staff members who had observed him from the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">At trial, the three staff members identified the defendant as the man they had observed in the Gray Lodge rear yard. Although the victims testified, the state never asked them to identify the defendant at trial. The defendant claimed to have been a victim of misidentification. Additionally, he claimed that there had been no evidence as to whether the victims\u2019 morals actually had been impaired by the alleged conduct. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the one count of public indecency and not guilty on the two counts of risk of injury to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Following the judgment of conviction of public indecency and the imposition of sentence, the trial court, sua sponte, convened a hearing to address the sex offender registry requirements of \u00a7 54-251. The defendant objected, claiming that the court lacked jurisdiction to make the requisite factual finding. Specifically, he claimed that, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. Luzietti, 230 Conn. 427, 646 A.2d 85 (1994),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court could not open or vacate the judgment. The trial court rejected that claim, made the factual finding that, at the time of the offense, the victims were under the age of eighteen and advised the defendant of the mandatory registration requirement for a ten year period. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to make the factual finding necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>trigger his registration as a sex offender because he already had begun to serve his sentence. Specifically, he contends that the registration requirement was a <em>punitive sanction </em>\u201cconstitutfing] a substantive change in the judgment,\u201d and that, in the absence of an express legislative grant of continuing jurisdiction, once he had begun serving his sentence, the court no longer could make the factual finding that subjected him to the sex offender registration requirements pursuant to \u00a7 54-251. The state responds that the trial court did not open or correct the defendant\u2019s sentence; it merely effectuated the regulatory purpose of Megan\u2019s Law. In other words, the state contends that the defendant\u2019s <em>sentence </em>was not affected by the trial court\u2019s determination that he must comply with the statute. It notes that Megan\u2019s Law is neither a sentence enhancement statute, nor a statute prescribing a sentencing factor. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>69 Conn. App. 516, 530, 794 A.2d 1123, cert. granted, 261 Conn. 914, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002). The state further asserts that the registration requirement in this case was not intended as a punitive measure; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 90-95, 770 A.2d 908 (2001); but, rather, was a regulatory requirement over which the trial court had no discretion. Therefore, according to the state, the court\u2019s imposition of the requirement was ministerial in nature and had no effect on the defendant\u2019s sentence. We agree with the state. We conclude that the registration requirement of Megan\u2019s Law, rather than being a part of the criminal judgment of conviction, is, instead, a separate regulatory incident of that judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court did not lose jurisdiction to implement that regulatory incident after the defendant began to serve the sentence under that criminal judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>We begin with a brief discussion\u2014first, of the pertinent reporting statutes, and second, of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to impose them in the context of this case. As we noted previously, \u00a7 54-251 (a) is one provision of Megan\u2019s Law, which is codified in chapter 969 of the General Statutes, the intent of which \u201cwas to alert the public by identifying potential sexual offender recidivists when necessary for public safety.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 522; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 90-91. \u201cThe seriousness of the harm that sex offenders\u2019 actions cause to society and the perception, supported by some data, that such offenders have a greater probability of recidivism than other offenders have recently combined to prompt the enactment of numerous laws across the country directed specifically toward persons convicted of crimes involving sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Pataki, </em>120 F.3d 1263, 1266 (2d Cir. 1997). Chapter 969, entitled \u201cRegistration of Sexual Offenders\u201d; General statutes \u00a7 54-250 et seq.; is such an enactment. Prior to the enactment of Megan\u2019s Law, the law imposed a registration requirement only on specified sex offenders who were convicted on or after January 1, 1995. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-102r. The law was broadened in 1997 to include <em>all </em>convicted sex offenders. See Public Acts 1997, No. 97-183, \u00a7 1; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1997 Sess., pp. 1230-31, testimony of Senators Kevin B. Sullivan and George C. Jepsen. The current statutory scheme imposes registration requirements based on four classifications: (1) the victims are minors or the sexual offenses are nonviolent; General Statutes \u00a7 54-251; (2) the sexual offenses are violent; General Statutes \u00a7 54-252; (3) the sexual offense was committed in another jurisdiction; General Statutes \u00a7 54-253; or (4) a felony was committed for a sexual purpose. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-254. Only under the last classification is the trial court given discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>whether to impose the registration requirement. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-254 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Because the defendant claims that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make the factual finding that triggered the sex offender registration requirement after he had begun execution of his sentence, we next address the issue of jurisdiction. \u201cThe Superior Court is a constitutional court of general jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 305-306, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992) [on appeal after remand, 228 Conn. 487, 636 A.2d 840 (1994)]. In the absence of statutory or constitutional provisions, the limits of its jurisdiction are delineated by the common law. <em>Cichy </em>v. <em>Kostyk, </em>143 Conn. 688, 690, 125 A.2d 483 (1956). It is well established that under the common law a trial court has the discretionary power to modify or vacate a criminal judgment before the sentence has been executed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 426-28, 545 A.2d 559 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 123, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pallotti, </em>119 Conn. 70, 74, 174 A. 74 (1934); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>71 Conn. 457, 460-61, 42 A. 640 (1899).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 431-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u201cThe jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates when the sentence is put into effect, and that court may no longer take any action <em>affecting the sentence </em>unless it has been expressly authorized to act.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>75 Conn. App. 423, 429, 816 A.2d 635 (2003); see <em>State v. Walzer, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 424-25. The legislature has granted the trial courts continuing jurisdiction to act on their judgments after the commencement of sentence under a limited number of circumstances. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-29 through 53a-34 (permitting trial court to modify terms of probation after sentence imposed); General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 (granting jurisdiction to trial court to hear petition for new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>after execution of original sentence commenced); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 (allowing trial court to modify sentences of less than three years provided hearing held and good cause shown).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">With this background in mind, we turn to the present case. It is undisputed that public indecency, as prescribed by \u00a7 53a-186, is an offense that, if committed against a victim under eighteen years of age, is subject to the sex offender reporting requirements of \u00a7 54-251. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-250 (2) (B). Indeed, the registration requirement is mandatory for any defendant who satisfies that statutory criteria. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 54-251 with General Statutes \u00a7 54-254. The issue on appeal, therefore, is whether the trial court acted without jurisdiction in making the necessary finding and articulating the registration requirements weeks after the defendant had commenced service of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We begin and end with the question of whether the requirement of registration in this case was punitive or penal in nature, or whether it was merely a regulatory requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not write on a clean slate in addressing this question. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 94, this court determined that Megan\u2019s Law is a nonpunitive statutory scheme. In reaching that conclusion, we relied extensively on the analysis by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Pataki, </em>supra, 120 F.3d 1274-75, in which that court applied a two part test in deciding whether the New York version of Megan\u2019s Law was penal in nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 92-94. In <em>Pataki, </em>under the first part of the test, the court examined whether the legislature had intended the statute to be criminal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>civil, in other words, \u201cpunitive in law.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Pataki, </em>supra, 1276-78. Under the second part of the test, the <em>Pataki </em>court considered whether, even if not punitive in law, the statute was nevertheless \u201cpunitive in fact,\u201d that is, whether the statute was so punitive in fact that it could not be seen as civil in nature. Id., 1278-84. Applying this two part test to our Megan\u2019s Law, we expressly decided in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 92-94, that the registration requirement at issue in the present case was not punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Despite having decided that issue, recent federal court decisions underscoring the vitality of that conclusion warrant further discussion. One such case of particular significance involving Connecticut\u2019s version of Megan\u2019s Law was issued shortly before our decision in <em>Kelly </em>and began in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut with a claim for, inter alia, injunctive relief by defendants who claimed that Megan\u2019s Law violated the due process clause and the ex post facto clause of the federal constitution. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>132 F. Sup. 2d 57 (D. Conn.), aff'd sub nom. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety ex rel. Lee, </em>271 F.3d 38 (2d Cir. 2001), rev\u2019d sub nom. <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 123 S. Ct. 1160, 155 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2003). The District Court determined that our statutory scheme violated the due process clause, but did not violate the ex post facto clause. Id., 59. In deciding that the statutory scheme did not violate the ex post facto clause, the court applied the two part <em>Pataki </em>test, concluding that \u201cthere is nothing in the text [of the Connecticut law] that suggests the legislature sought to punish sex offenders rather than protect public safety.\u201d Id., 67. In comparing our version of Megan\u2019s Law to the New York version, which the Second Circuit previously had found nonpunitive in <em>Pataki, </em>the District Court concluded that the \u201cdifferences, taken separately or cumulatively and viewed in light of the [Connecticut] legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>and the structural features indicating a regulatory purpose, do not demonstrate that the legislature acted with punitive intent\u201d in adopting the law. Id., 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">With respect to the second part of the <em>Pataki </em>test\u2014 whether, although regulatory in intent, the registry law is <em>punitive in </em>fact\u2014the District Court determined that only \u201cthe clearest proof\u2019 would suffice to override the stated intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. Id. In making the punitive in fact determination, the District Court concluded that, although the registration requirement applies to behavior that is already a crime, and there is a perception of \u201cexcessiveness\u201d because the information is disseminated via the Internet, these factors, either alone or in conjunction, do not establish by the \u201cclearest evidence\u201d that the law is punitive in fact. Id., 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment enjoining the state from disseminating sex offender registry information on due process grounds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Dept. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>of Public Safety ex rel. Lee, </em>271 F.3d 38, 61 (2d Cir. 2001). Although the court did not decide whether the statutory scheme similarly violated the ex post facto clause, it nevertheless expressly cited with approval the District Court\u2019s reasoning with respect to the first part of the <em>Patalci </em>test. Id., 60.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The decision by the Second Circuit upholding the injunction against enforcing our version of Megan\u2019s Law thereafter was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, focusing solely on the due process question, reversed the Second Circuit\u2019s decision and concluded that due process does not require giving the defendant the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the state\u2019s statutory scheme\u2014in that case, specifically, that the defendant is not currently dangerous. <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 8-9, 123 S. Ct. 1160, 155 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>That same day, the Supreme Court also issued its decision in a case challenging the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that had enjoined Alaska from enforcing that state\u2019s version of Megan\u2019s Law. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 123 S. Ct. 1140, 155 L. Ed. 2d 164 (2003). In reversing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision on ex post facto grounds, the Supreme Court applied reasoning that closely resembled that which the federal District Court had applied in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra, 132 F. Sup. 2d 57, in concluding that Connecticut\u2019s version of Megan\u2019s Law is nonpunitive. Specifically, the Supreme Court examined the extensive registration and notification requirements under Alaska\u2019s law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> considered those requirements under a number of factors,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>concluded that the defendants had not demonstrated that the effects of the law negated the intent to create what was otherwise a civil, nonpunitive regime. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 92-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">With this background in mind, we turn to, and reject, the defendant\u2019s claim in the present case that the trial court lost jurisdiction over the matter by failing to make the factual finding that activated the registration requirement at the time of sentencing. Although the defendant conceded at oral argument before this court that <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 538 U.S. 84, and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety ex rel. Lee, </em>supra, 271 F.3d 38, govern his due process claim; see footnote 8 of this opinion; he does not acknowledge that those cases also are dispositive of his jurisdictional claim, despite the fact that the jurisdictional claim is predicated <em>entirely </em>on the punitive characterization of the registry requirements that those cases reject. Because these regulatory requirements are ministerial, the trial court did not have to revisit the sentence in order to inform the defendant of his obligations. Indeed, making the factual finding and informing the defendant of these requirements pursuant to \u00a7 54-251 did not necessitate any modification, opening or correction of the sentence. In short, the defendant\u2019s sentence was not affected by the trial court\u2019s factual finding and advisement that he must comply with the statute. Rather, the court merely was effectuating the regulatory purpose of Megan\u2019s Law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>As the Appellate Court noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 529, \u201c[i]n this case, we are not dealing with a sentencing factor or a sentencing enhancement, but with a finding to be made after conviction that has no effect until after a defendant\u2019s sentence has been served.\u201d Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 54-250 (2) (B); see footnote 4 of this opinion; the trial court retains jurisdiction, even after judgment is rendered, with respect to making the necessary finding to trigger the registration requirement as part of its implementation of this regulatory incident of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-251 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who has been convicted or found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor or a nonviolent sexual offense, and is released into the community on or after October 1, 1998, shall, within three days following such release, and whether or not such person\u2019s place of residence is in this state, register such person\u2019s name, identifying factors, criminal history record and residence address with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Commissioner of Public Safely, on such forms and in such locations as the commissioner shall direct, and shall maintain such registration for ten years except that any person who has one or more prior convictions of any such offense or who is convicted of a violation of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-70 shall maintain such registration for life. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-186 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of public indecency when he performs any of the following acts in a public place: (1) An act of sexual intercourse as defined in subdivision (2) of section 53a-65; or (2) a lewd exposure of the body with intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desire of the person; or (3) a lewd fondling or caress of the body of another person.

Ed. 2d 164 (2003), and <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 123 S. Ct. 1160, 155 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2003), control our resolution of this issue. Because, as we explain subsequently in this opinion, in <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 8-9, the United States Supreme Court held that due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the state\u2019s statutory scheme\u2014in specific, that the defendant is not currently dangerous\u2014no hearing on that issue was required in the present case. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">With regard to his assertion that the age of the victims was a material factor and that the trial court was required to hold a hearing before making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the factual finding necessary to trigger the reporting requirements, we similarly reject that claim under the facts of this case. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the present case triggered \u00a7 54-251 turned on the crime for which the defendant had been convicted, specifically, public indecency in violation of \u00a7 53a-186, and the fact that the defendant\u2019s act had been committed in the presence of a minor. That the victims in this case were minors was undisputed. Moreover, in addition to the victims\u2019 own testimony as to their ages, other facts are indicative of the victims status as minors\u2014both victims testified that they were residents of Gray Lodge, a facility for troubled <em>adolescent </em>females, and a guardian ad litem had been appointed for the victims. Based on all of these undisputed facts, it is not surprising that the defendant did not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that the victims were minors. Finally, even were we to assume that the trial court was required to hold a hearing before making the factual finding that triggered the reporting requirements pursuant to \u00a7 54-251, because the iqjury to the defendant\u2019s reputation constituted a deprivation of a liberty interest; see <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 576, 95 S. Ct. 729, 42 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1975); under the facts of this case, the defendant had the opportunity to contest the trial court\u2019s factual finding at the time the trial court advised him of the reporting requirements, but chose not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> The Second Circuit Court of Appeals expressly did not decide whether, because of the undifferentiated nature of Connecticut\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law, the statutory scheme as written is punitive in fact under an ex post facto analysis. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety ex rel.
