The dispositive issue on appeal is the respondent\u2019s claim that the court improperly denied her motion to cite in the department of mental retardation as a necessary party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying the respondent\u2019s motion, and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The record reveals the foUowing facts and procedural history. The respondent is mentally handicapped, and has been receiving services from the department of mental retardation since 1991. The respondent gave birth to Devon on September 10, 2001, at Yale-New Haven Hospital. At the time of Devon\u2019s birth, the respondent was homeless<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and had been working with the department of mental retardation to secure housing for herself and her child, but those efforts had been unsuccessful. Due to her situation, employees of the Yale-New Haven Hospital Women\u2019s Center questioned the respondent\u2019s ability to care for Devon and contacted the petitioner. On September 13, 2001, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-129 (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the petitioner filed a neglect petition and an application for temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>custody in the Superior Court, Juvenile Matters, claiming that the respondent was incapable of providing care and a home for Devon. The application was granted ex parte by the court, <em>Esposito, J., </em>and, on September 21, 2001, a hearing was held on the matter, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the hearing, the court appointed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>attorney and a guardian ad litem for the respondent, ordered a competency examination, and, by agreement of the parties, sustained the order for temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">After rejecting an initial competency evaluation as unsatisfactory, the court held a competency hearing on April 11, 2002. At that time, Charles Dike, a physician and forensic psychiatric fellow at Yale University who had examined the respondent, testified that the respondent was not competent to stand trial, but that he could not render an opinion as to whether she was restorable to competency. Thereafter, the court found that the respondent was incompetent, but restorable,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ordered her attorney and guardian to take the steps that they thought were necessary to restore her to competency. Additionally, the court set a date for a trial on the neglect petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Shortly before the commencement of trial, the respondent filed a motion for a continuance, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 35-2 (b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and a motion to cite in the department of mental retardation as a necessary party, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 9-18.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, the respondent contended that a continuance was necessary so that the petitioner could hire appropriate professionals to restore the respondent to competency. She also asserted that it would not be possible for the court to issue meaningful specific steps to facilitate reunification with her child, as required under General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-129 (j), as amended by Public Acts 2001, No. 01-142, \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> without the joinder of the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ment of mental retardation as a party. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">At trial, the court heard testimony from Reginald Hayes, the respondent\u2019s social worker from the department of mental retardation, who testified that the respondent was unable to earn a living or function on her own. Hayes also testified that the respondent required an assisted living environment, and that the department was attempting to procure such a facility for her, but thus far had been unsuccessful. He further testified that the department had been working to procure vocational training for the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Megan Pace and Mark Terreri, two social workers employed by the petitioner who had worked with the respondent, testified as to the services that the petitioner could offer the respondent. Pace testified that the petitioner could make housing referrals, but did not in this case \u201cbecause [the department of mental retardation] was already involved in the case.\u201d Pace also indicated that the petitioner had not offered the respondent an opportunity to participate in parenting classes. Pace stated that the respondent was involved in the \u2019R Kids program, which provides certain parenting services, but that she did not ask \u2019R Kids to provide the respondent with any parenting classes, and was unaware if \u2019R Kids could assist the respondent in her parenting. Terreri testified that, although \u2019R Kids offers parenting classes, he was unaware if the respondent had been involved in those classes. Terreri had, however, contacted the department of mental retardation about parenting classes, and \u201c[it was] going to look into an appropriate class for [the respondent].\u201d Terreri indicated that he did not know if the department had been successful in arranging those classes for the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>At the conclusion of all the testimony, the court adjudicated Devon as \u201cuncared for due to homeless [ness],\u201d and committed him to the care of the petitioner. The court also issued specific steps to the respondent, with the caveat that there was no guarantee that compliance with all of the steps would ensure Devon\u2019s return to her. Specifically, the respondent was required to: (1) work with and attend all meetings with the petitioner; (2) inform the petitioner of any changes in her contact information, such as her address and telephone number; (3) attend parental and individual counseling; (4) continue to work with the department of mental retardation; and (5) continue working with the \u2019R Kids program. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The respondent claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied her motion to cite in the department of mental retardation as a necessary party. The petitioner responds that the department is not a necessary party, because it does not have an interest in the neglect proceeding. Moreover, it asserts that under \u00a7 46b-129 (b), for an order of temporary custody, the court is required only to issue specific steps to the petitioner and the parents. Put another way, the petitioner maintains that, because the department of mental retardation is not the responsible agency under the statute, and the statute does not require that department\u2019s involvement in the specific steps, the trial court properly denied the respondent\u2019s motion to cite in the department as a necessary party. We disagree with the petitioner\u2019s unduly narrow view of the basis for citing in a necessary party under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">\u201cNecessary parties . . . are those [p]ersons having an interest in the controversy, and who ought to be made parties, in order that the court may act on that rule which requires it to decide on, and finally determine the entire controversy, and do complete justice, by adjusting all the rights involved in it. . . . [B]ut if their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>interests are separable from those of the parties before the court, so that the court can proceed to a decree, and do complete and final justice, without affecting other persons not before the court, the latter are not indispensable parties.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 225-26 n.10, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1997). \u201cA party is deemed necessary if its presence is absolutely required in order to assure a fair and equitable trial. . . . <em>Biro </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>214 Conn. 1, 6, 570 A.2d 182 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caswell Cove Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford Partners, Inc., </em>58 Conn.

Accordingly, \u201c[o]ur review ... is confined to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion. . . . Judicial discretion [however] ... is always legal discretion, exercised according to the recognized principles of equity. . . . While its exercise will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal to this court, reversal is required where the abuse is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Veterans Memorial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Medical Center, </em>262 Conn. 730, 742-43, 818 A.2d 731 (2003). \u201cIn essence, the trial judge\u2019s discretion should be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sturman </em>v. <em>Socha, </em>191 Conn. 1, 7, 463 A.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Applying these principles, and with particular attention to \u00a7 46b-129, which requires reasonable efforts be made to reunite a parent and his or her child, we conclude that the department of mental retardation is a necessary party in the present case. Specifically, subsection (b) of the statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]pon issuance of an ex parte order, the court shall provide to <em>the commissioner [of children andfamilies] </em>and the parent or guardian <em>specific steps necessary for each to take to address the ex parte order for the parent or guardian to retain or regain custody of the child or youth.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-129 (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Additionally, the statute provides that after a hearing on the order of temporary custody, the court \u201cshall order specific steps <em>the commissioner </em>and the parent or guardian <em>shall take for the parent or guardian to regain or to retain custody of the child or youth </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d). Furthermore, these goals remain paramount, even following an adjudication that a child is uncared for. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>other words, the petitioner, through the specific steps issued by the court, is statutorily obligated to help the parent, if possible, regain custody of her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The present case, however, provides an unusual complication to the petitioner\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligation\u2014the respondent is mentally retarded. Additionally, she is homeless. These facts obviously weighed heavily in the petitioner\u2019s decision to file its petition for custody. Therefore, it is evident that securing suitable housing and support services are essential if the respondent ever is to regain custody of her child. Indeed, although it is unclear from the record what valuable services the petitioner can offer to the respondent, it is evident that residential placement\u2014which would solve the respondent\u2019s homelessness\u2014as well as coordination of services, such as parenting classes, best can be provided by the department of mental retardation. Unlike that department, the petitioner is not charged statutorily with providing services to mentally retarded persons, nor is it equipped to provide such services.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Compare General Statutes \u00a7 17a-3<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>210 (a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 17a-217 (a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">It is clear, therefore, that the petitioner statutorily is obligated to effectuate the respondent\u2019s reunification with her child, and, in order to accomplish that obligation, the petitioner needs to address the respondent\u2019s homelessness and other needs in light of her mental disability. Under these circumstances, it is evident that the coordination of efforts between the petitioner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the department of mental retardation is essential to this goal. Indeed, Terreii testified that he was in contact with the department \u201con a regular basis ... to keep apprised of what was going on.\u201d Therefore, the department is a necessary party because the trial court cannot \u201cproceed to a decree, and do complete and final justice\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 225-26 n.10; without its joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u201cThe requirement of reunification efforts provides additional substantive protection for any parent who contests a termination action, <em>and places a concomitant burden on the state to take appropriate measures designed to secure reunification of parent and child.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 696, 741 A.2d 873 (1999). This requirement is based on the well settled notion that \u201c[t]he right of a parent to raise his or her children [is] recognized as a basic constitutional right. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972); <em>Lehrer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>214 Conn. 232, 236, 571 A.2d 691 (1990). Accordingly, it has been held that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution applies when a state seeks to terminate the relationship between parent and child. <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981).\u201d <em>In re Alexander V., </em>223 Conn. 557, 560, 613 A.2d 780 (1992). Although the present appeal does not concern a termination proceeding, we note that specific steps are considered to be \u201cfair warning\u201d to a parent of the potential termination of parental rights in subsequent proceedings. <em>In re Jeffrey C., </em>64 Conn. App. 55, 62, 779 A.2d 765 (2001), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 261 Conn. 189, 802 A.2d 772 (2002). Indeed, the failure to comply with specific steps ordered by the court typically weighs heavily in a termination proceeding. Therefore, in the present case, the appropriate measure would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>have been to add the department of mental retardation\u2014the agency that best can ensure the respondent\u2019s compliance with the specific steps addressed to her retardation and homelessness\u2014as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Nevertheless, the petitioner contends that there is no need to join the department of mental retardation as a necessary party, as that department and the respondent already are working together to fashion appropriate services for the respondent. Specifically, the petitioner points to the specific step ordering that the respondent <em>continue </em>to work with the department, and therefore contends that the department properly was not added as a party. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Ordering the <em>respondent </em>to continue to work with the department of mental retardation does not ensure that that department will provide her with the necessary services to help her regain custody of her child.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order does not provide for the department to undertake a certain plan of action. Indeed, because the department of mental retardation is not a party to the proceeding, the court <em>cannot </em>order it to provide such services. See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>181 Conn. 367, 373-74, 435 A.2d 996 (1980) (\u201cThis court has no jurisdiction over persons who have not been made parties to the action before it. Any judgment rendered in this action . . . would not be binding as to them.\u201d); see also <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 1662, </em>212 Conn. 368, 373, 561 A.2d 1388 (1989) (\u201ccourt cannot render a judgment enforceable against a nonparty\u201d). This deficiency is problematic, if not devastating, to the respondent in light of the fact that the services she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>needs most are provided by the department of mental retardation, and the evidence presented at trial indicates that that department has done little to secure or provide those services. By adding the department as a party, the trial court would have the authority that it otherwise lacks to compel that department and the petitioner to work together, something that is not possible with the the department\u2019s current nonparty status.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">By adding the department of mental retardation as a party, the court can make a final determination on the entire controversy, consistent with \u201cequity and good conscience.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Barrow, </em>58 U.S. (17 How.) 130, 139, 15 L. Ed. 158 (1855). \u201cThe necessary parties rules originated in equity and expressed the principle that a court of equity, once it undertook a case, would not do justice \u2018by halves\u2019 but would seek to clean up the whole controversy.\u201d F. James &amp; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1985) \u00a7 10.11, pp. 531-32. Because under the facts of this case, the department of mental retardation\u2019s joinder is \u201cabsolutely required in order to assure a fair and equitable\u201d result; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Biro </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 6; the trial court abused its discretion in denying the respondent\u2019s motion to cite in that department as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-14\"> Although the petition for neglect named both biological parents as respondents, only the respondent mother is involved in this appeal. References herein to the respondent are to the mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-15\"> The respondent appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> The respondent also claimed in her brief to this court that the trial court improperly denied her motion to stay the trial after the court had found her to be incompetent. At oral argument, however, the respondent withdrew this claim, and, therefore, we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Additionally, the respondent claims that the trial court improperly issued specific steps for the respondent to follow for facilitating the return of her child without considering her disability as required under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq. Because we reverse the decision of the trial court, we also need not address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\"> At one time the respondent had lived with her grandmother, who is an alcoholic, but was told by her grandmother that she could no longer stay with her because the respondent was not named as a tenant on the grandmother\u2019s apartment lease. The respondent also had stayed with her mother, who also is mentally retarded and under the care of the department of mental retardation. The respondent, however, was not on her mother\u2019s lease either, and the department\u2019s policies prohibit persons not named on the lease from staying in program housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b596-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-129 (a) provides: \u201cAny selectman, town manager, or town, city, or borough welfare department, any probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>officer, or the Commissioner of Social Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or any child-caring institution or agency approved by the Commissioner of Children and Families, a child or his representative or attorney or a foster parent of a child, having information that a child or youth is neglected, uncared-for or dependent, may file with the Superior Court which has venue over such matter a verified petition plainly stating such facts as bring the child or youth within the jurisdiction of the court as neglected, uncared-for, or dependent, within the meaning of section 46b-120, the name, date of birth, sex, and residence of the child or youth, the name and residence of his parents or guardian, and praying for appropriate action by the court in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMj\">with whom VERTEFEUILLE and ZARELLA, Js., join, dissenting. The majority concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion of the respondent, Tammy M., to cite in the department of mental retardation as a necessary party to this neglect proceeding. I disagree. I would conclude that the trial court has no jurisdiction over the department of mental retardation because the respondent has not exhausted her administrative remedies. I would also conclude that, even in the absence of that bar to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, the department of mental retardation had no legal interest or obligation in the proceeding and, therefore, is neither a necessary nor an appropriate party. I also believe that the majority\u2019s decision will greatly complicate and prolong neglect proceedings, ultimately to the detriment of the very persons whom the majority intends to protect. I address each of these conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">First, and most fundamentally, even if it were assumed that the department of mental retardation is failing to meet its statutory obligations to the respondent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the respondent has provided no authority for the proposition that the trial court has jurisdiction over the department of mental retardation when the respondent has not exhausted the administrative procedures provided by statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-210 (d);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>culminating, if necessary, in an administrative appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. I do not believe that the trial court can bypass these procedures for determining the respective rights and obligations of the department of mental retardation and its clients and confer on itself jurisdiction over the department of mental retardation simply by pronouncing that that department\u2019s presence in a neglect proceeding might facilitate the goal of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Second, even in the absence of this jurisdictional bar, I do not believe that the department of mental retardation has any legal interest or obligation to the respondent in this neglect proceeding, and I would, therefore, conclude that the department of mental retardation is not a necessary, or even an appropriate, party. As a preliminary matter, I note that Practice Book \u00a7 9-18, concerning the addition of parties, does not use the phrase \u201cnecessary party,\u201d and the use of the phrase in cases applying that section has resulted in some confusion in our case law. See W. Horton &amp; K. Knox, 1 Connecticut Practice Series: Practice Book Annotated (4th Ed. 1998) \u00a7 9-18, authors\u2019 comments, p. 311.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>agree, however, that a party whose presence \u201cis absolutely required\u201d; <em>Caswell Cove Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford Partners, Inc., </em>58 Conn. App. 217, 224, 753 A.2d 361, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 922, 759 A.2d 1023 (2000); for the court to render a judgment is an indispensable party and that, as used by the parties in this case, the word \u201cnecessary\u201d is synonymous with \u201cindispensable. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">To determine whether the department of mental retardation is a necessary party in the case, we must review the relevant statutes governing neglect proceedings. General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-129 (j), as amended by Public Acts 2001, No. 01-142, \u00a7 6, provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court shall order specific steps which the parent must take to facilitate the return of the child or youth to the custody of such parent. . . .\u201d In the words of the respondent, these specific steps \u201care a road map ... by which [the petitioner, the department of children and families] and the courts measure a parent\u2019s progress toward reunification.\u201d Other subsections of the statute provide that the court may also order the petitioner to take specific steps to return custody of the child to the parent. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 46b-129 (b) and (d). These provisions are designed to ensure that department takes \u201cappropriate measures ... to secure reunification of parent and child\u201d; <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 696, 741 A.2d 873 (1999); so that the parent\u2019s fundamental right to family integrity is not violated. Thus, the \u201cspecific steps\u201d provisions of \u00a7 46b-129 have two purposes: first, to instruct the parent on the specific conduct in which he or she must engage in order to satisfy the petitioner and the trial court that he or she is a fit parent and, second, to ensure that the petitioner does what it reasonably can to facilitate, rather than to impede, reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The majority has pointed to no provision under the relevant statutes, however, imposing on the department of mental retardation, or, indeed, on anyone other than the respondent and the petitioner, any legal obligation to take steps to reunify the respondent and her son after the neglect finding. Nor is there any allegation that the department of mental retardation has an independent statutory obligation to the respondent, or even the ability, to take steps to ensure that she regains custody of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Nevertheless, the majority concludes that the department of mental retardation is a necessary party because \u201cit is evident that residential placement\u2014which would solve the respondent\u2019s homelessness\u2014as well as coordination of services, such as parenting classes, best can be provided by the department of mental retardation\u201d; and \u201ccoordination of efforts between the petitioner and the department of mental retardation is essential to [the] goal\u201d of reunification. This conclusion apparently derives from the majority\u2019s belief that the petitioner\u2019s suggestion that \u201cit is up to the <em>respondent </em>to take certain initiatives is Kafkaesque.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) I disagree. Although, as the majority points out, the respondent is mentally incompetent, it is also the case that the Probate Court has appointed an attorney, Americo Carchia, as the conservator of her person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the trial court appointed an attorney to represent the respondent in the neglect proceedings. In my view, the respondent, aided by Carchia and her attorney, has the sole responsibility to comply with the specific steps ordered by the trial court, including continuing to work with the department of mental retardation. As I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>indicated, the respondent has not pointed to any statutory obligation of the department of mental retardation to force the respondent to work with it to regain custody of her son, or, in the absence of such an obligation, to any source of the trial court\u2019s authority to issue such an order. Even if it is assumed that the exhaustion doctrine does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over the department of mental retardation, it would have jurisdiction only to order that department to comply with its statutory mandate. The record does not establish, however, that it was not already doing so. Because I believe that the department of mental retardation\u2019s \u201cinterests are separable from those of the parties before the court, so that the court can proceed to a decree, and do complete and final justice, without affecting [the department of mental retardation]\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 225-26 n.10, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997); I would conclude that the department of mental retardation is neither a necessary nor an appropriate party.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Moreover, if, as the respondent argues, she is incapable, even with the assistance of her attorney and personal conservator, of continuing to work with the department of mental retardation in the absence of a court order to the department of mental retardation to ensure that she does so, I fail to see, as a practical matter, how the respondent could demonstrate progress in her parenting skills justifying reunification with her son. I also have questions about the temporal duration of a court order to the department of mental retardation. If the respondent and her son ultimately are reunified, will the trial court have continuing jurisdiction to issue orders to the department of mental retardation to ensure that the respondent retains custody of her son and properly cares for him? Is such an obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>tion within the department of mental retardation\u2019s statutory mandate? Did the legislature contemplate that the trial court would take on this supervisory role in neglect proceedings? Is such a role consistent with the court\u2019s ultimate responsibility to determine whether the respondent has shown herself to be a fit parent justifying reunification with her son? The majority does not address, much less answer, these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Finally, I note that, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, any number of persons and entities\u2014such as the department of correction, the probation department, police departments, schools, teachers, counselors, physicians, grandparents, in short, anyone whose participation could facilitate reunification of parent and child\u2014must be treated as necessary parties to a neglect proceeding. Indeed, the majority in the present case has \u201cstrongly suggested]\u201d that, on remand, the conservator of the respondent\u2019s estate, as well as the department of mental retardation, be made a party to this action. In my view, it is the prospect of a proceeding requiring the presence of all of these parties that is Kafkaesque. I believe that the majority\u2019s decision to provide procedural protections that never were contemplated by the legislature will have the unintended effect of greatly and unnecessarily complicating and prolonging the proceedings, to the ultimate detriment of the very parties the majority seeks to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">I would conclude that the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the department of mental retardation was barred by the exhaustion doctrine. I would also conclude that, even in the absence of that jurisdictional bar, the department of mental retardation\u2019s presence was not \u201cabsolutely required in order to assure a fair and equitable trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caswell Cove Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford Partners, Inc., </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 224. Indeed, I would conclude that the department of mental retardation is not even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>a proper party to this proceeding. I also note that, although the neglect proceeding had been pending for over seven months at the time, the respondent did not file her motion to cite in until one week before trial. This court previously has recognized that it is within the discretion of the trial court to deny a request to join a party where, under all of the circumstances of the case, the request was not timely. <em>Washington Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>241 Conn. 734, 744, 699 A.2d 73 (1997). Because I would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the respondent\u2019s motion to cite in the department of mental retardation as a party defendant, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> In her motion to cite in the department of mental retardation, the respondent alleged that the petitioner, the department of children and families, and the department of mental retardation \u201chave neglected and refused to coordinate their efforts in a consistent manner so as to provide a package of services to the respondent that are consistent with her needs.\u201d She did not, however, refer to the specific statutory provision imposing such an obligation on the department of mental retardation in the context of a neglect proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-210 (d) provides: \u201cThe parent, guardian, conservator or other legal representative of a person, or the person himself or herself, may request a hearing for any final determination by the department which denies such person eligibility for programs and services of the department.
