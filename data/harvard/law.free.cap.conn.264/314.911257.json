The named plaintiff, Julio Cardenas,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeals<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court denying him offer of judgment interest. The plaintiff claims that, by first apportioning the damages between himself and his employer, A.S. Enterprises, Inc. (A.S. Enterprises), and, thereby, using his net recovery as the basis of the comparison with his pretrial offer of judgment, the trial court improperly denied him offer of judgment interest. We agree with the plaintiff and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court denying the plaintiff offer of judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The plaintiff brought this action against the defendants, Anthony J. Mixcus and Mary Mixcus, seeking damages for personal injuries that he allegedly had suffered from a fall at their home. Because the fall occurred during the course of his employment, the plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from A.S. Enterprises, including lost wages and medical expenses. A.S. Enterprises intervened in the action pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), seeking recovery of the amount that it had paid out to the plaintiff. Before trial, the plaintiff had filed an offer of judgment in the amount of $99,500.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants did not accept the offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>within thirty days and, therefore, it was considered rejected under \u00a7 52-192a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Following a jury trial, a verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $104,805.\u00ae Thereafter, the plaintiff and A.S. Enterprises agreed that $17,000 represented full and final satisfaction of A.S. Enterprises\u2019 claim in the case. The defendants moved for apportionment pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) and Practice Book \u00a7 17-1,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the plaintiff objected to the defendants\u2019 motion, asserting his right to offer of judgment interest based on the total amount of the verdict. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for apportionment and, accordingly, apportioned the award in the following amounts: $87,805 to the plaintiff; and $17,000 to A.S. Enterprises. On the basis of the court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs ultimate recovery, after apportionment, was less than the offer of judgment for $99,500, the trial court denied the plaintiffs request for interest pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (b). This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The plaintiff claims that, when an employer intervenes in an action pursuant to \u00a7 31-293, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>must, in making the comparison required by \u00a7 52-192a, compare the offer of judgment with the jury verdict and not with the postapportionment award to the plaintiff. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Because this presents a question of statutory interpretation, our review is plenary. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>260 Conn. 399, 402, 796 A.2d 1187 (2002). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>[231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994)]. In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>[258 Conn. 733, 741, 785 A.2d 197 (2001)]. Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We first examine the statutory language at issue. Section 52-192a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAfter trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff <em>has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain stated in the plaintiff\u2019s \u2018offer of judgment\u2019, </em>the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The question presented is whether, in the present case, the emphasized language means the amount awarded by the jury, or the amount ultimately apportioned to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-293. The language of the statute is susceptible of either meaning. Furthermore, neither the legislative history accompanying the original enactment of \u00a7 52-192a nor the legislative history accompanying subsequent amendments to the statute address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The purposes of, and the policy concerns underlying, \u00a7 52-192a, however, strongly support the conclusion that, under the particular circumstances of the present case, the amount of the offer of judgment should be compared with the juiy verdict rather than with the amount of the award due the plaintiff after apportion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ment. \u201cOur courts have consistently held that prejudgment interest is to be awarded by the trial court when a valid offer of judgment is filed by the plaintiff, the offer is rejected by the defendant, and the plaintiff ultimately recovers an amount greater than the offer of judgment after trial. . . . Moreover, an award of interest under \u00a7 52-192a is mandatory, and the application of \u00a7 52-192a does not depend on an analysis of the underlying circumstances of the case or a determination of the facts. . . . The statute is admittedly punitive in nature. ... It is the punitive aspect of the statute that effectuates the underlying purpose of the statute and provides the impetus to settle cases.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Accettullo </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>256 Conn. 667, 672, 775 A.2d 943 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The puipose of \u00a7 52-192a \u201cis to encourage pretrial settlements and, consequently, to conserve judicial resources. . . . [T]he strong public policy favoring the pretrial resolution of disputes ... is substantially furthered by encouraging defendants to accept reasonable offers of judgment. . . . Section 52-192a encourages fair and reasonable compromise between litigants by penalizing a party that fails to accept a reasonable offer of settlement. ... In other words, interest awarded under \u00a7 52-192a is solely related to a defendant\u2019s rejection of an advantageous offer to settle before trial and his subsequent waste of judicial resources. ... Of course, the partial settlement of a case does little for the conservation of our limited judicial resources. Accordingly, the ultimate goal in a multiparty lawsuit is the fair and reasonable settlement of the case on a global basis.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 742-43, 687 A.2d 506 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">These policy concerns demonstrate that \u00a7 52-192a is designed to create the incentive in the plaintiff to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>pose a reasonable offer of judgment, and in the defendant to accept such an offer. This set of incentives necessarily requires both parties to assess, in advance, how the ultimate fact finder, namely, the jury, would be likely to view the case, and to reach a settlement accordingly. That process of assessment would be skewed, however, if the parties were also required to factor in the apportionment of workers\u2019 compensation payments, which are not disclosed to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Moreover, to base the comparison on the postapportionment amount would create two different systems of assessment: one, for cases in which the plaintiff was not an employee when he or she was injured; and a second, for cases like the present, when the plaintiff was an injured employee. We see nothing in either the language or purposes of \u00a7 52-192a to justify such a dual system.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In addition, the statute\u2019s policy of encouraging pretrial settlements would be thwarted if we were to interpret \u00a7 52-192a as authorizing the denial of offer of judgment interest when the amount of damages recovered subsequent to apportionment pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 is less than the amount of the offer of judgment. Under such a rule, the incentive in the plaintiff would be to tender an offer of judgment lower than the expected preapportionment recovery, subtracting the amount that the employer would be entitled to recover pursuant to \u00a7 31-293. Subsequently, if a defendant were to accept such an offer, the plaintiffs employer would still have the option to exercise its lien rights against such a settlement under \u00a7 31-293, resulting in a lower total recovery for the plaintiff. Therefore, a plaintiff would have a significantly reduced incentive to tender a reasonable offer of judgment to a defendant in a case in which an employer would have a right to recovery under \u00a7 31-293. \u201c[W]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . [and] we read each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, 583-84, 726 A.2d 502 (1999). Accordingly, we adopt the construction of \u00a7 52-192a that is consistent with its purposes, namely, that the relevant figure for determining whether to award interest under \u00a7 52-192a is the amount of the jury verdict, not the amount of the postapportionment judgment rendered pursuant to \u00a7 31-293.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The defendants argue that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Civiello </em>v. <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp., </em>208 Conn. 82, 544 A.2d 158 (1988), stands for the proposition that the court may not look to the jury verdict in determining whether to award offer of judgment interest. <em>Civiello, </em>however, is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Civiello, </em>the plaintiffs brought an action against multiple defendants. Id., 83 n.l. Before trial, two of the defendants settled with the plaintiffs for $36,000. Id. In arriving at its verdict of $153,522 against the remaining defendant, however, the jury was unaware of the prior settlement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 88. The trial court ordered a remittitur of $36,000 in order to avoid unjustly enriching the plaintiffs. Id., 89. The plaintiffs appealed from the denial of interest on their offer of judgment. Id., 84. One of the issues on appeal was \u201cwhether a plaintiff who has obtained a jury verdict for an amount in excess of his offer of judgment, when that verdict later is properly reduced by the trial court to a sum less than that offer, is entitled to interest pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (b) for having \u2018recovered an amount equal to or greater than\u2019 his offer of judgment.\u201d Id., 84-85. Under the facts of <em>Civiello, </em>we held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to offer of judgment interest. Id., 85. We reasoned that, \u201c[w]here a jury verdict is properly deemed excessive and accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ingly reduced by a remittitur when judgment is rendered, the statute could not have been intended to impose the interest penalty upon a defendant for failing to accept an offer of judgment exceeding the upper limit of reasonable compensation as determined by the court.\u201d Id., 91. Under such circumstances, \u201cto make the amount of the jury verdict rather than the judgment thereon the criterion for determining whether a plaintiff has recovered more than his offer of judgment would create a disparity between court and jury trials inconsistent with the legislative intention that \u00a7 52-192a (b) apply to both in the same manner.\u201d Id., 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In ordering the remittitur, the trial court in <em>Civiello </em>had acted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a, which provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the court at the conclusion of the trial concludes that the verdict is excessive as a matter of law, it shall order a remittitur . . . .\u201d The ordering of a remittitur pursuant to \u00a7 52-216a, then, occurs only when the court has made a determination that the verdict does not accurately reflect the actual damages suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In the present case, however, there is no question that the verdict actually reflected full and fair compensation for the damages suffered. Here, the sole reason for the difference between the amount of the verdict and the amount of the judgment subsequently rendered upon the verdict was the involvement of \u00a7 31-293. Therefore, the policy concerns underlying <em>Civiello </em>are not present in this case. Construing \u00a7 52-192a (b) to apply to preapportionment damages in cases proceeding under \u00a7 31-293 will not lead to different results in court trials and jury trials. In contrast to cases in which a trial court orders a remittitur, a postverdict apportionment pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 has no effect on the amount of damages paid by the defendants in a case. Instead, \u00a7 31-293 merely affects the number of plaintiffs who must share in the total recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The defendants further contend that certain language in \u00a7 31-293 suggests that offer of judgment interest may not be awarded in this case. Specifically, they point to the language of \u00a7 31-293 (a) providing that \u201c[n]o compromise with the person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him.\u201d The defendants argue that, because A.S. Enterprises did not participate in the offer of judgment, it was not bound by that offer. Therefore, the defendants contend that, even if they had accepted the plaintiffs offer of judgment, A.S. Enterprises nevertheless would have been able to continue the litigation against them, causing the defendants to pay more than the actual damages of the case, and the plaintiff to obtain a double recovery, which is contrary to one of the primary purposes of \u00a7 31-293. The defendants\u2019 argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The defendants concede in their brief that, under \u00a7 31-293, an employer\u2019s claim takes precedence over that of the injured employee. If the plaintiffs offer of judgment had resulted in any settlement of the claim, A.S. Enterprises would have received reimbursement for its expenses before the plaintiff received any money. Therefore, the hypothetical situation presented by the defendants presumes that A.S. Enterprises would act contrary to its own interests, ignoring money readily available through an existing lien, pursuant to \u00a7 31-293, on any settlement, in favor of costly, continued litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Similarly, the only hypothetical situation in which the employer would have any further right on which to proceed against the defendants would be if the plaintiff had made an offer of judgment in an amount less than his employer\u2019s lien rights. In that situation, if the defendants were to accept the offer, they would, theoretically, remain exposed to a continuing claim by the employer in an amount equal to the difference between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the hen rights and the offer of judgment. That scenario, however, is merely a theoretical possibility, not a realistic one. In such a situation, there would be absolutely no incentive for the plaintiff to make such an offer of judgment, because its acceptance would leave him with nothing. We do not presume that a plaintiff would make such an irrational decision, contrary to his own interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In cases in which \u201cmore than one [statutory provision] is involved, we presume that the legislature intended [those provisions] to be read together to create a harmonious body of law . . . and we construe the [provisions], if possible, to avoid conflict between them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, 257 </em>Conn. 632, 651, 778 A.2d 121 (2001). Contrary to the defendants\u2019 argument, our interpretation of \u00a7 52-192a does not conflict with the two primary purposes of \u00a7 31-293, namely, to ensure that an employer is reimbursed for its expenses and to prevent an injured employee from obtaining a double recovery. See <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 576, 590 A.2d 914 (1991). Because \u00a7 31-293 provides that the claim of the employer \u201ctake[s] precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery,\u201d there is no real danger of either of these purposes being thwarted by the calculation of offer of judgment interest prior to apportionment. The award of offer of judgment interest does not constitute a double recovery, nor does it interfere with an employer\u2019s recovery. The only effect of an award of offer of judgment interest is to hold a defendant accountable for rejecting reasonable settlement offers, which <em>is </em>consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 52-192a. Therefore, our intepretation of \u00a7 52-192a (b) avoids conflict between the two statutes, while furthering the policy reasons underlying \u00a7 52-192a.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The judgment is reversed with respect to the trial court\u2019s denial of offer of judgment interest pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u00a7 52-192a (b), and the case is remanded to that court with direction to award interest thereunder; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-15\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a) allows an employer to intervene in an action brought by an employee against a third party tortfeasor, providing in relevant part: \u201c[A]ny employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund, having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of this chapter may bring an action against such person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. ...
