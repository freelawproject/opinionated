L. 158, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>which provides that cities, and other local governing bodies, in making public improvements, shall \u201chave the power to require of the contractor or contractors, employed in and about said improvements, <em>an additional </em>bond, with sufficient surety or sureties, providing for the payment of all labor and material entering into the said improvements,\u201d and that those furnishing such labor and material shall have the right to sue <em>\u201cupon said bond, </em>upon proof of said contractor\u2019s failure to pay for said labor or material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">We cannot agree with either of the above contentions, nor with some of the numerous subordinate positions taken by the use-plaintiff; and as to others, which may be sound in principle, we fail to see their relevancy to this case. Speaking broadly we feel, after considering, all these matters, that the documents relied on by appellant, \u2014 being, of course, the only evidence before us,\u2014 show that he has no rights thereunder; the authorities cited by him concern facts differing in essential particulars from those here presented and do not govern the instant controversy. We shall discuss in this opinion, such matters only as are requisite to the determination of the points involved in the two general contentions already mentioned, for they are all we deem essential to a decision on the facts at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">It is provided in the bond that the contract shall be part thereof; the first of these instruments is plainly intended to secure to the City of Erie the proper performance of the second and at no place in either is language found giving any person other than the obligee a right of action. While the obligation here sued on was executed since the date of the Act of 1917, supra, the acceptance of the bond by the city evidently was not intended as an exercise of the latter\u2019s power under that statute; in this and other respects, the case before us is much like Lancaster v. Frescoln, 192 Pa. 452, 456, and 203 Pa. 640, 643. There, as here, \u201cthe bond was given by a contractor to a city and recited that the contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>should perform Ms work, pay Ms laborers and for the material used.\u201d The action, like the present one, was brought in the name of the city to the use of parties who furnished materials, and the defense was made by the surety \u201cin its own interest only,\u201d the first ground of defense being that \u201cthe bond imposed on it, the surety, no liability to the use-plaintiffs.\u201d Lancaster v. Frescoln arose prior to the Act of 1917, but so far as the presence on the statute books of that act figures as a circumstance in the case at bar, it finds a parallel in the Lancaster Case, where a \u201cgeneral ordinance of the city,\u201d like the Act of 1917, provided for the giving, by contractors, of \u201cadditional bonds\u201d to the municipality \u201cfor the use of any persons who may be aggrieved by the contractor\u2019s failure to pay for work done or materials furnished.\u201d In deciding in favor of the surety, we said: \u201cThe special ordinance, authorizing the [improvement], required the contractor to enter security for the faithful performance of the contract......This bond was not given under [the terms of the general] ordinance; it is <em>not an additional bond, </em>and it is not for the use of third parties. It was given under the special ordinance, and its conditions correspond with the stipulations of the contract. In an action against a surety the obligation of a bond cannot be. extended beyond the plain import of the words used. This bond is given to the City of Lancaster, and primarily for its benefit; it is the only party entitled to sue, and no recovery can be had except in its right.\u201d When the matter was again before us, in 203 Pa. 640, 644, 645, we adopted the opinion of the court below, per curiam, wherein the case against the appellant is well put in the following question and answer: \u201cSuppose......the contractor......failed to pay [for] labor and materials [and] the aggregate of both claims more than equaled the amount of the bond, could......[the] laborers and materialmen ......[exhaust the security for their own benefit] ......to the peril of the city, in case of default by the contractor in fulfilling the terms of his contract? Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>no circumstances could the surety be called on for more than the amount of [the] bond......[and] it is obvious that the purpose of the city, both in spirit and letter, was only to protect its own rights.....; the bond...... [is] for the benefit of the city......alone and not for the use of the materialmen and laborers, except as the city [might see] fit to use it for that purpose [in its own right].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">All the above-quoted words fit the present facts; and the case from which they are taken and this one are sufficiently alike in essential particulars to hold that the first rules the second. As said in the somewhat similar case of Board of Education v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., 252 Pa. 505, \u201cthe bond of defendant does not appear to have been given for the benefit......of any person other than the [obligee]......; [plaintiff] is a stranger to the bond, and therefore has no right of action on it......The case is squarely ruled [in principle] by ......First Methodist Episcopal Church v. Isenberg, 246 Pa. 221.\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">In Bowditch v. Gourley, 24 Pa. Superior Ct. 342, 344, cited by appellant, the bond sued on was given under the terms of a general ordinance entitled \u201cAn ordinance for the protection of......persons furnishing materials and labor......for any......city work,\u201d which, as said by this court in Phila. v. McLinden, 205 Pa. 172, 176, expressly \u201cauthorized such persons to bring suit in the name of the city for their benefit against a defaulting contractor and his surety.\u201d The same situation was also present in Phila. v. Stewart, 195 Pa. 309, and 198 Pa. 422; Phila. v. Nichols Co., 214 Pa. 265; Phila. v. Neill, 206 Pa. 333 and 211 Pa. 353, 355, 361; and in Phila. v. Wiggins, 227 Pa. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-19\">In Com. v. National Surety Co., 253 Pa. 5, 7-8, 10, the bond explicitly provided that suit might be brought thereon by every person having a claim for labor and materials furnished the contractor; and it was held that the obligation came fairly within the act authorizing its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u2022execution; see also Robertson Co. v. Globe Indemnity Co., 268 Pa. 309, and 77 Pa. Superior Ct. 422, 424. In tbe present case, however, the ordinance which gave rise to the bond simply requires \u201csecurity satisfactory to the city council for the due performance of [the contractor\u2019s] proposal,\u201d and there is nothing said in the ordinance, or in the bond itself, as to parties other than the obligee having any rights thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The contract, which as before stated is written into the bond, provides: \u201cAnd it is further agreed and understood that the said party of the first part shall pay all workmen employed on said work, and for all material used in said work, from time to time as estimates on said work are paid by the City of Erie, and also that if said party of the first part shall fail to pay for all material used in said work, or fail to pay the men employed thereon, it shall be lawful for the City of Erie to do so for the said first party, and deduct the amount so paid from any funds due or to become due said contractor; or if an amount sufficient for the purpose is not or will not be due said contractor, the City of Erie, at its option, may pay all such claims and recover the amount so paid from the party of the first part, and that the contractor\u2019s sureties shall be expressly holden therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">When the ordinance, contract, and bond are all considered, it is quite plain that the latter instrument, so far as it mentions payment by the contractors for labor and materials, simply expresses the intention of the parties that the bond shall stand back of the provisions of the contract quoted by us in the paragraph last above, in order to guarantee the city against loss should it, on the default of the contractor, make payments in accord with the terms there expressed (Lancaster v. Frescoln, 203 Pa. 640, 643, 644, 645) ; the bond was not in any sense intended to create or acknowledge a direct obligation to laborers and materialmen. The court below, therefore, was right in holding that.\u201cthe case at bar does not fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>within any of the exceptions to the well-settled rule of the common law, that one not a party to an obligation cannot maintain an action thereon\u201d; and, as already shown, no facts which \u201cgive him the right to use the name of the obligee\u201d are averred in appellant\u2019s statement of claim; this we held to be essential in Board of Education v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co., 252 Pa. 505, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">Other jurisdictions may entertain a view different from that shown by the decisions in this state, but the Pennsylvania view is not without support elsewhere: Donnelly on the Law of Public Contracts, section 336 and note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The judgment for defendant is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
