Amare, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, has petitioned for review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), in which he asserted that he feared persecution based on political opinion and membership in a particular social group, the Oromo tribe. The BIA\u2019s decision was based primarily on its affirmance of the IJ\u2019s finding that Amare\u2019s testimony was not credible. We review the BIA\u2019s decision and consider the IJ\u2019s decision only to the extent that it influenced the BIA. <em>Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 863 (5th Cir.2009). The agency\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to reach a contrary conclusion. <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">To qualify for asylum, Amare bore the burden of proving that he is a refugee, that is, that he has been persecuted or has a well founded fear of persecution. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). He had to prove that his membership in the Oromo tribe or his political opinions were or will be at least one central reason for the alleged or feared persecution. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). To prove his eligibility for withholding of removal, Amare had to prove that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom will be threatened because of his membership in the Oromo tribe or because of his political opinions. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). For relief under the CAT, Amare was required to prove that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he is removed to Ethiopia. <em>Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 350 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe Convention Against Torture requires \u2018a public official\u2019 or \u2018person acting in a public capacity\u2019 to \u2018inflict,\u2019 \u2018acquiesce,\u2019 or \u2018give consent\u2019 to the torture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Amare was required to establish in the agency proceedings that his testimony was credible, persuasive, and sufficiently specific. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 537 (5th Cir.2009) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii)). An applicant\u2019s credibility is not presumed, and the trier of fact may consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and \u201call relevant factors\u201d in making a credibility determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Dayo v. Holder, </em>687 F.3d 653, 657 (5th Cir.2012). Thus, \u201can IJ may rely on any inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.... \u201d <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538 (quoting <em>Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008)) (internal quotation marks omitted). An alien may be required to submit evidence corroborating even credible testimony if the evidence is reasonably available. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(i)(B)(ii), 1231(b)(3)(C), 1229a(c)(4)(B). We will defer \u201cto an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538 (quoting <em>Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167) (internal quotation mark omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Amare argues in conclusory fashion that his testimony and supporting documents satisfied the standards for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s determination that Amare\u2019s testimony was not credible because it was uncorroborated, vague, insufficiently detailed, and implausible. Amare has not shown that the record compels a different conclusion. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518; <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538. There was substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>dence supporting the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. \u201cAn applicant who has failed to establish the less stringent \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard of proof required for asylum relief is necessarily also unable to establish an entitlement to withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Dayo, </em>687 F.3d at 658-59 (quoting <em>Anim v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 243, 253 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cWithout credible evidence, the BIA had no basis upon which to grant asylum or withhold deportation.\u201d). \u201c[B]ecause the same lack of evidence means that [Amare] cannot show he will be tortured, he is not entitled to relief under the CAT.\u201d <em>Dayo, </em>687 F.3d at 659; <em>see also Tamara-Gomez, </em>447 F.3d at 350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.
