Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">Saavedra first challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level adjustment for his role pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines, which also resulted in the denial of a safety valve adjustment. Saavedra contends that the enhancement is inapplicable because the person he allegedly directed was a confidential source (CS). Alternatively, he argues that the district court erred by concluding that he was the person heard speaking in a recorded telephone conversation with the CS.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">Although Saavedra objected to the enhancement on the second ground he raises here, he did not do so on the first ground. Thus, we review that argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.1994). The Government concedes that the CS cannot be a participant for purposes of a \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement. Nevertheless, we conclude that any plain error there may have been did not affect Saavedra\u2019s substantial rights. Saavedra did not dispute the pre-sentence report\u2019s factual determination that he directed another coconspirator, who was unidentified, to deliver a drug-laden van along with $1,200 to the CS. As those facts would support the enhancement, Saavedra cannot show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the outcome would have been different. <em>See United States v. Marquez, </em>685 F.3d 501, 510 (5th Cir.2012). We need not reach Saavedra\u2019s alternative argument regarding the district court\u2019s findings with respect to the recorded telephone call. Given the determination regarding Saavedra\u2019s role, it follows that the court did not reversibly err by denying him a safety valve reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Cl.l(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-24\">Saavedra also contends that the factual basis is insufficient to support his plea because it did not establish that he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the drug type and quantity. As Saavedra concedes, his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>586 F.3d 303, 307-09 (5th Cir.2009). He raises it solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
