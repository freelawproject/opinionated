The BIA determined that Abraham was subject to removal because he was previously convicted of violating \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(C) of the Texas Penal Code, which is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Abraham argues that the immigration judge relied upon improper documentary evidence of his state-court conviction in making this determination. Because the BIA did not rely on the immigration judge\u2019s decision in determining that Abraham was convicted of violating \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(C), our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Enriquez-Gutierrez v. Holder, </em>612 F.3d 400, 407 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-23\">Although Congress specifically stated \u201cin 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) that no court has jurisdiction to review deportation orders for aliens who are removable because they were convicted of aggravated felonies,\u201d this court has \u201cjurisdiction to review jurisdictional facts,\u201d such as \u201c[w]hether an offense [is] an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[W]hether an offense constitutes an aggravated felony is a purely legal question, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c \u2018Any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)). An aggravated felony is defined as, inter alia, \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). In Abraham\u2019s case, the BIA correctly applied the modified categorical approach to determine under which part of \u00a7 22.011 of the Texas Penal Code Abraham had been convicted and correctly concluded that Abraham\u2019s conviction qualified as a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor pursuant to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). <em>See Rodriguez, </em>705 F.3d at 210-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Contrary to Abraham\u2019s assertion, the Government did in fact submit the indictment as proof of his prior conviction. The indictment charged Abraham with intentionally and knowingly causing the sexual organ of a child \u201cto contact and penetrate the mouth of said defendant.\u201d The BIA correctly relied upon the indictment to determine which subsection of the Texas sexual assault statute was at issue in Abraham\u2019s offense. <em>See id. </em>The BIA also relied upon Abraham\u2019s judicial confession. Both Abraham and the presiding judge signed the judicial confession, which is a sufficiently reliable record for consideration when characterizing a prior guilty-plea offense. <em>See id. </em>at 211; <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 481 (5th Cir.2008). The BIA\u2019s reliance on the indictment and judicial confession was thus proper, <em>see Rodriguez, </em>705 F.3d at 210-16, and those documents demonstrate, as the BIA concluded, that Abraham pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(C), which provides that a person commits an offense if the person intentionally or knowingly \u201ccauses the sexual organ of a child to contact or penetrate the mouth, anus, or sexual organ of another person, including the actor.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(C). Abraham\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s use of documentary evidence therefore lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Abraham does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination. that a conviction under \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(C) qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor pursuant to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) or that as such he is removable pursuant to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). He has therefore abandoned any challenge that he may have to this determination. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Abraham has also abandoned by failing to brief a challenge to the BIA\u2019s determinations that he was not eligible for relief from removal and that his claim regarding lack of counsel did not warrant relief. <em>See Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d at 446-47; <em>see also Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Finally, Abraham asserts a due process violation which appears to be based on a misunderstanding about which documents are in the administrative record and support the determination that he was convicted of violating \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(C). \u201c[Ijmmigration judges must conduct deportation hearings in accord with due process standards of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Bouchikhi v. Holder, </em>676 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cWe review a claim of a due process violation de novo. To prevail, however, the alien must show substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). In this case the BIA relied on the indictment and the judicial confession which demonstrate that Abraham violated \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(C). Thus Abraham cannot show substantial prejudice on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In light of the foregoing, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
