Miller argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that the district court failed to consider the fact that he committed the offense while under duress and that his motives were benign.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">The district court must correctly calculate the guidelines range and make an individualized assessment based on the facts of the case in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u2019s goals. \u00a7 3553(a). Appellate courts typically review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the sentence is procedurally sound, the appellate court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>The instant appeal does not involve the procedural reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-22\">Miller\u2019s 18-month sentence was within the advisory guidelines range and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>carries a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). Contrary to Miller\u2019s assertions, the sentencing hearing reflects that the district court took into account the circumstances surrounding Miller\u2019s commission of the drug offense but concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate in light of the drug quantity and Miller\u2019s heedless actions. Miller\u2019s general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
