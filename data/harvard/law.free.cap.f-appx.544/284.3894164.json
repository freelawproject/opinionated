Reyes argues that the district court failed to provide adequate reasons for making a variance six months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>above the top of the sentencing guidelines range. He complains that the district court failed to give consideration to his altruistic reasons for entering the United States and gave too much weight to his past misdemeanor offenses and his informal removals from the country that had occurred fourteen years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Because Reyes did not specifically object in the district court to the district court\u2019s failure to articulate adequate reasons for the sentence, review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009). In imposing a sentence six months above the guidelines range, the district court considered the arguments of the parties, Reyes\u2019s criminal conduct and history, the need for deterrence, and the protection of the public. The record reflects that the district court gave fact-specific reasons for the variance, which included consideration of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and that it did not give undue significance to any irrelevant factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Reyes has not demonstrated that the district court failed to articulate adequate reasons for the sentence and, thus, he has failed to show procedural error, plain or otherwise, that rendered his sentence unreasonable. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Insofar as Reyes objected in the district court to the reasonableness of the sentence, he has not shown that the variance reflected an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court, and thus, he has not demonstrated that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Reyes also challenges the f\u00edne imposed, arguing that it is substantively unreasonable because the district court ignored the statement in the presentence report (PSR) reflecting his inability to pay a fine based on his then-current financial status. He contends that the district court was required to make specific findings to support the f\u00edne, and he also complains about paying a portion of the fine out of his prison wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">This court reviews the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s sentence, including a f\u00edne, for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 338-39, 340 n. 8 (5th Cir.2011). Reyes did not object to the district court\u2019s consideration of his future earning capacity in imposing the f\u00edne, and thus, that argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The Guidelines state that \u201c[t]he court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a). If the district court adopts the PSR but does not rely on the recommendation concerning the payment of a f\u00edne, it is required to make specific findings with respect to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay a fine. <em>United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The district court\u2019s ruling was not contrary to the PSR\u2019s recommendation based on Reyes\u2019s then-current financial status because the district court imposed the fine based on Reyes\u2019s future ability to pay the fine. Furthermore, although not required to do so, the district court provided specific reasons for its determination that Reyes had the future ability to pay the fine. It pointed out that Reyes had prior work experience and would be only 35 years old when his sentence was completed and that he had reported no physical or mental problems precluding his employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Reyes has not disputed these facts. The district court\u2019s determination that Reyes had the future ability to pay the fine was plausible based on the record and does not reflect an abuse of discretion or a clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414-15 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. The district court was also entitled to order Reyes to have a portion of any income earned in prison attributed to the payment of the fine. <em>See. United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 351-52 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming the imposition of a fine in part on the defendant\u2019s ability to pay installments from his prison wages). The fact that the fine may impose a financial burden upon him is not grounds to vacate the fine. <em>See United States v. Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d 719, 723 (5th Cir.1991). The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the fine. The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
