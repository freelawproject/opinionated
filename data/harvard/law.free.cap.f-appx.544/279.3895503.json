By moving to proceed IFP, he is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Ladd argues that the district court did not follow the proper procedure in analyzing his \u00a7 3582 motion, but his brief does not address the merits of the motion for clarification or the motion for recusal. He fails to address the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith, or the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, his challenge to the certification decision is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Ladd has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n.24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
