Wilson, </em>77 F.3d 105, 108-09 (5th Cir.1996). Wilson contends that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d 942 (2008), and that the district court erred in refusing to permit him to challenge his convictions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the Savings Clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Wilson bears the burden of showing, inter alia, that his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-22\">Wilson\u2019s money laundering convictions were for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(B)(i). <em>Wilson, </em>77 F.3d at 108. To obtain a conviction, the Government had to prove \u201cthat Wilson (1) conducted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>attempted to conduct a financial transaction, (2) which the defendant knew involved the proceeds of unlawful activity, and (B) with the intent to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of unlawful activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To satisfy the concealment requirement there must be proof that the purpose of the transaction was to conceal or disguise a listed attribute. <em>Cuellar, </em>553 U.S. at 566-57, 128 S.Ct. 1994; <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>553 F.3d 768, 787 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">This court\u2019s analysis of Wilson\u2019s three financial transactions on direct appeal was consistent with <em>Cuellar, </em>in that it focused on the reasons why the transactions were conducted rather than how they were conducted. <em>See </em>553 U.S. at 566, 128 S.Ct. 1994. The evidence supported a conclusion that Wilson\u2019s actions violated the statute because he acted with the purpose of hiding the fact that the money he used was derived from his drug trafficking activities. <em>See Wilson, </em>77 F.3d at 109 (distinguishing <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>929 F.2d 1466, 1470-73 (10th Cir.1991), and quoting <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Rodriguez, </em>966 F.2d 918, 925 (5th Cir.1992)). His actions were designed to make it more difficult for the Government to trace and demonstrate the nature of the funds. <em>See Brown, </em>553 F.3d at 787. Wilson has not shown that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of <em>Cuellar. See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. The judgment is AFFIRMED. Wilson\u2019s motion for leave to file a reply brief out of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
