He raises two issues on appeal: whether the district court erred in (1) imposing a 16-level sentence enhancement based on his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation, and (2) refusing to adjust downward his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">Because he did not preserve those issues, our review is for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To prevail, Hernandez-Salazar must demonstrate a legal error that is clear or obvious and affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If he makes that showing, we have discretion to remedy the error \u2014 \u201cdiscretion which ought to be exercised only if the error \u2018seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-24\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Guidelines increases a defendant\u2019s offense level by 16 levels if he was previously removed following a conviction for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d an enumerated \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) cmt. n. 1 (B)(iii) (2012). The indictment, a Shepard-approved document, clarifies that appellant was convicted of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code: knowingly and intentionally entering a habitation, without the effective consent of the owner, with the intent to commit theft. <em>United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 341, 344-45 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that courts may look to certain adjudicative records, including the charging document, to determine whether a prior offense qualifies as a crime of violence). Because we have held that burglary of a habitation under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) fits within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the generic definition of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d and correspondingly qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), we discern no plain error. <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412-13 (5th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (citing) <em>United States v. Joslin, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 139, 141-44 (5th Cir.2012). (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In addition, Hernandez-Salazar objects to the government\u2019s policy of declining to move for an additional one-level offense-level reduction when the defendant insists on retaining his right to appeal. As he acknowledges, his claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Hernandez-Salazar has demonstrated no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
