The district court denied Wilcox\u2019s motion because it found that he was not eligible for a reduction in sentence as he was sentenced as a career offender. The parties agree that that the sentencing court found Wilcox to be a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and that his resulting guideline range after application of \u00a7 4B1.1 was 188 to 235 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">On appeal, Wilcox argues that <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), undermined our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), to the point of abrogation by defining the phrase \u201cbased on\u201d more broadly than <em>Moore </em>did, and that, pursuant to <em>Freeman, </em>his sentence was at least in part \u201cbased on\u201d the crack cocaine guidelines, which were used as a starting point for calculating his guideline range, and thus, he was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Wilcox acknowledges that, in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012), we held that <em>Freeman </em>did not undermine <em>Moore, </em>and states that he is raising this issue to preserve it for further review. The government has responded with a \u201cMotion for Summary Affirmance and for Stay of the Briefing Schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">Summary disposition is appropriate either where time is of the essence, such as \u201csituations where important public policy issues are involved or those where rights delayed are rights denied,\u201d or where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where, as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>lous.\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969); <em>see United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (11th Cir.2005) (construing the defendant\u2019s \u201cunconventional\u201d motion as a motion for summary reversal, granting the motion, vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence, and remanding the case for resentencing where the district court had committed plain error by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319. We are bound by the opinion of a prior panel unless the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>overrules that opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has noted, however, that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). The Guidelines explain that the amendment relied upon for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief must lower the \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d which is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Amendment 750 retroactively lowered the sentencing range applicable to crack cocaine offenses by revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750 (2011). Amendment 750 did not make any changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender guideline provision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not under \u00a7 2D1.1 based on his attributed drug quantities. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. In <em>Moore, </em>we held that Amendment 706, which reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses, was inapplicable to the sentences of four defendants who had been sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1 as career offenders. 541 F.3d at 1327-30. The defendants\u2019 sentences were based on the applicable guideline ranges for career offenders, and the defendants\u2019 otherwise applicable base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of those ranges. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">In <em>Freeman, </em>a four-justice plurality of the Supreme Court ruled that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is available to a defendant who entered into a Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement that includes an agreed-upon sentence that is expressly based on a guideline range that has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. In her concurring opinion, Justice Sotomayor stated that sentences imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement are \u201cbased on\u201d the plea agreement itself and not the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2696 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). Nonetheless, where a plea agreement expressly applied a particular guideline range, Justice Sotomayor agreed that the plea agreement was based on that guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2697 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). If that guideline range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the defendant would be eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In <em>Lawson, </em>we held that, after <em>Freeman, Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. We explained that, in <em>Freeman, </em>neither the plurality nor Justice Sotomayor \u201caddressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d as to the issue addressed in <em>Moore </em>regarding the eligibility of career offenders for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on the retroactive lowering of crack cocaine base offense levels. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense, but sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, was still not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Here, the district court properly denied Wilcox\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, as a career offender, Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range. Contrary to his arguments on appeal, Wilcox\u2019s guideline range was \u201cbased on\u201d the career-offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1, not the drug-quantity guidelines in \u00a7 2D1.1 that were affected by Amendment 750. As Wilcox concedes, his argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>abrogated our decision in <em>Moore </em>is explicitly foreclosed by our decision in <em>Lawson. </em>We are bound by our opinion in <em>Lawson </em>because that opinion has not been overruled by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
