Del Campo challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, contending that it is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. As Del Campo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>acknowledges, because he raised no objections to his sentence in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). We presume that a within-guidelines sentence, like Del Campo\u2019s, is reasonable. <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d 209, 214 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">First, Del Campo complains that under the Guidelines, his prior drug conviction was double counted because it increased both his offense level and his criminal history score. We have rejected the argument that this sort of double counting renders a within-guidelines sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). His next contention, that applying the illegal reentry guideline resulted in a guidelines range that was unreasonably high because his offense amounted to merely \u201can international trespass,\u201d too, is insufficient to rebut the presumption that a within-guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Finally, Del Campo asserts that the sentence did not reflect that he lived in the United States for most of his life, his siblings and children are American citizens, and he returned to be with his family. Del Campo\u2019s cultural assimilation does not necessarily entitle him to a below-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Likewise, neither this factor nor his motive for returning renders his sentence unreasonable. The district court rejected the contention that these factors outweighed the other sentencing considerations, specifically that Del Campo\u2019s extensive criminal history showed that he did not respect the laws of the United States. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Given the high degree of deference that we give to the sentencing court, <em>id. </em>at 339, Del Campo\u2019s argument that a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range is unreasonable amounts to a disagreement with the balance among the sentencing factors that the district court struck, but he has not shown that the district court made a clear error in judgment in weighing the factors. <em>See Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
