Fontaine\u2019s complaint was arbitrated pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, and the arbitrator determined that Fontaine had not demonstrated that the defendant\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for his termination was pretex-tual. The district court denied Fontaine\u2019s motion to vacate the award under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(2), rejecting Fontaine\u2019s claim that there was evident partiality on the part of the arbitrator. Fontaine now moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">When, as in this case, a district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant may either pay the filing fee or challenge the court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant must pay the filing fee or, alternatively, we may dismiss the appeal sua sponte under 5th Circuit Rule 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">For the first time on appeal, Fontaine argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to vacate the arbitration award because the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct, <em>see </em>\u00a7 10(a)(3), and had exceeded her authority, <em>see </em>\u00a7 10(a)(4). We will not consider these newly raised issues. <em>See Alford v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 1161, 1163 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Fontaine reiterates his claim that the award should have been vacated under \u00a7 10(a)(2) because the arbitrator was not impartial. He contends that he provided the district court with 66 pages of \u201cirrefutable documented evidence\u201d of the arbitrator\u2019s bias. Fontaine\u2019s evidence, however, related to the merits of his claim, not the arbitrator\u2019s bias. His belief that the weight of his evidence established the arbitrator\u2019s bias fails to satisfy his \u201conerous burden\u201d of demonstrating evident partiality. <em>Householder Group v. Caughran, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 848, 852 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Positive Software Solutions, Inc. v. New Century Mortg. Corp., </em>476 F.3d 278, 281-83 (5th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Because Fontaine has failed to raise a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220, we DENY his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and DISMISS his appeal as frivolous, <em>see Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
