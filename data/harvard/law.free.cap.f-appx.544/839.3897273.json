On appeal, Stone argues that the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment and the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) were incomplete because the ALJ failed to include all of her limitations as set forth by the doctor to whose opinion the ALJ stated he was affording the most weight. Specifically, Stone argues the ALJ failed to include her severe limitations on overhead reaching that the doctor opined she had, as well as her severe limitation as to bending, lifting, carrying, and squatting.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">In Social Security appeals, we review the decision of an ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that Stone challenges the district court\u2019s findings, her arguments are not relevant because we review only the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). We review the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">In determining whether a claimant has proven that she is disabled, the ALJ must complete a five step sequential evaluation process. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). The claimant has the burden to prove that (1) she \u201chas not engaged in substantial gainful activity,\u201d (2) she \u201chas a severe impairment or combination of impairments,\u201d and (3) her \u201cimpairment or combination of impairments meets or equals a listed impairment\u201d such that she is entitled to an automatic finding of disability, or if not, (4) she \u201cis unable to perform her past relevant work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAt the fifth step, the burden shifts to the commissioner to determine if there is other work available in significant numbers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>the national economy that the claimant is able to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the Commissioner demonstrates that there are jobs that the claimant can perform, the claimant must prove that she is unable to perform those jobs to establish disability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">At step four of the evaluation process, the ALJ must determine a claimant\u2019s RFC by considering all relevant medical and other evidence. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 </em>F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2004) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e)). The RFC is an assessment of a claimant\u2019s ability to do work despite his impairment. <em>Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)). In assessing a RFC, the ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). To support a conclusion that the claimant is able to return to her past relevant work, the ALJ must consider all of the duties of the work and evaluate the claimant\u2019s ability to perform them in spite of her impairment. <em>See Lucas v. Sullivan, </em>918 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th Cir.1990). Generally, VE testimony is not necessary to determine whether a claimant can perform her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>at 1573 n. 2. However, the regulations permit the ALJ to consider a VE\u2019s opinion when making this determination. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(b)(2). \u201cIn order for a [VE\u2019s] testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). An ALJ is not required to include findings in a hypothetical question that the ALJ properly rejected as unsupported. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Social security regulations provide guidelines for the ALJ to use when evaluating medical opinion evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527. The ALJ considers many factors when weighing medical evidence, including the examining relationship, the treatment relationship, whether an opinion is well-supported, whether an opinion is consistent with the record, and a doctor\u2019s specialization. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(c). These factors apply to both examining and non-examining doctors. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(e), 416.927(e) A treating physician\u2019s opinion must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) (\u201cGenerally, we give more weight to opinions from your treating sources ...\u201d). The ALJ does not have to defer to the opinion of a physician who conducted a single examination, and who was not a treating physician. <em>See McSwain v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 617, 619 (11th Cir.1987). In the end, the ALJ may reject the opinion of any physician if the evidence supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The regulations define sedentary work as involving \u201clifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools\u201d and only occasional walking and standing. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a). According to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d), the position of social worker is considered \u201csedentary work,\u201d meaning it requires the exertion of up to ten pounds of force occasionally (up to 1/3 of the time), a negligible amount of force frequently (1/3 to 2/3 of the time), and sitting most of the time, but may involve walking or standing for brief periods of time. DOT \u00a7 195.107-030. The DOT explicitly states that it does not require climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, or crawling. <em>Id. </em>It states that reaching is only occasionally required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">At her hearing before the ALJ, Stone testified that she was unable to perform her former job as a social worker because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>of pain in her neck, back, and right arm. Even though she had been on medical disability since 2002, she had hurt her back and neck in 2006 when she was moving and lifting some boxes. Hospital records showed that Stone had been diagnosed with degenerative disease of the cervical spine, and that she had a post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at the levels of the C5-6 and C6-7 vertebrae. Pursuant to a referral from the Florida Division of Disability Determination, Dr. Fathy Saad examined Stone and opined that because of her neck and back condition, Stone should be moderately to severely restricted from carrying, lifting, bending, squatting, or overhead reaching. Dr. Joan Watkins conducted an independent medical exam of Stone and diagnosed Stone with left spastic hemiparesis with dysar-thria. She opined that Stone had limitations on lifting, should never climb, balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, or crawl, and her ability to reach was affected by her impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In formulating Stone\u2019s RFC, the ALJ gave Dr. Saad\u2019s opinion great weight and less weight to Dr. Watkins\u2019s opinion. The ALJ concluded that Stone had the RFC to perform sedentary work with occasional climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling, but without frequent overhead work. At the hearing, the ALJ posed a hypothetical to the VE that recited the RFC almost verbatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">We conclude from the record that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Stone was not disabled. First, the ALJ explicitly accorded the most weight to Dr. Saad\u2019s opinion and gave less weight to Dr. Watkins\u2019s opinion. The ALJ did not err in making this determination because, as found by the ALJ, Dr. Watkins\u2019s opinion was not supported by the record and, because she was not a treating physician, her opinion was not required to be given substantial or considerable weight. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2). Accordingly, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in according Dr. Watkins\u2019s opinion less weight than Dr. Saad\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Stone\u2019s argument that the ALJ failed to include all of her limitations in the RFC and hypothetical question to the VE is without merit. Dr. Watkins opined that Stone should never climb, balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, or crawl, and her ability to reach was affected by her impairment. Because the ALJ correctly determined that this opinion was to be accorded less weight and was not supported by the medical evidence and Stone\u2019s testimony regarding her daily activities, the ALJ was not required to include these limitations in the RFC and hypothetical. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment and hypothetical included all of Dr. Saad\u2019s limitations. Dr. Saad opined that Stone was moderately to severely restricted from carrying, lifting, bending, squatting, and overhead reaching because of her back and neck condition. Dr. Saad did not expound upon the meaning of moderately to severely. While the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment and hypothetical to the VE did not use the same language as Dr. Saad, they both accounted for such limitations. The ALJ explicitly determined that Stone\u2019s RFC was limited to sedentary work, which implicitly took into account Stone\u2019s limitation on carrying and lifting. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a). The ALJ added the limitation of only occasional climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling, and avoiding frequent overhead work, which appears to implicitly take into account Stone\u2019s limitations on bending, squatting, and overhead reaching. When posing the hypothetical, the ALJ recited the RFC almost verbatim to the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Stone offers nothing more than her own opinion that the RFC and hypothetical only accounted for Dr. Saad\u2019s opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>that she was moderately restricted, not severely restricted from certain activities. However, nothing indicates that Dr. Saad\u2019s opinion that Stone was \u201cmoderately to severely restricted\u201d from engaging in certain activities meant that she was definitely severely restricted, or that she should never engage in such activity, as Stone seems to suggest. Alternatively, the ALJ was not required to, and did not, give controlling weight to Dr. Saad\u2019s opinion. Thus, the ALJ was entitled to conclude, despite Dr. Saad\u2019s moderate-to-severe restriction opinion, that the totality of the medical and other evidence, including the evidence of Stone\u2019s daily activities, established that Stone\u2019s limitations noted by Dr. Saad were moderate but not severe. Accordingly, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in determining Stone\u2019s RFC or in posing the hypothetical question to the VE, and the VE\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence that Stone was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
