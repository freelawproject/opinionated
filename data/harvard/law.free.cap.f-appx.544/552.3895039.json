Saman-iego argues that there was no evidence to support the findings in the presentence report (PSR) and adopted by the district court that his role in the offense was that of a manager or supervisor and that at least 50 kilograms of cocaine were attributable to him. He raised objections to these findings in the district court but did not present any rebuttal evidence. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>702 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its decision to apply a guidelines enhancement and review de novo the application and interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Chon, </em>713 F.3d 812, 821 (5th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 9, 2013) (No. 13-50). The district court\u2019s findings as to Samaniego\u2019s role in the offense and the amount of drugs attributable to him are plausible in light of the record as a whole, and there is no clear error. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the three-level increase for Samaniego\u2019s role in the offense, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), or in applying the base offense level applicable to offenses involving at least 50 kilograms of cocaine, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
