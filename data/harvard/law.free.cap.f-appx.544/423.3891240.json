Pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), no court has jurisdiction to review discretionary denials of relief, including decisions denying motions for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(a). <em>See Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006) (invoking jurisdictional bar where adjustment of status was denied as a matter of discretion after the petitioner failed to disclose prior arrest). Further, \u201cwhere a final order of removal is shielded from judicial review by a provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2), so, too, is [the] refusal to reopen that order.\u201d <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-21\">Section 1252(a)\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping provisions are not absolute. <em>Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir.2006). We retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see, e.g., Bokhari v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 357, 359 (5th Cir.2010), (reviewing determination that petitioner\u2019s untimely application made him statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ineligible for adjustment of status). Mu-changa does not contend that the denial of adjustment presents a question of law. Although he purports to raise a claim of the denial of due process, Muchanga\u2019s argument is merely a restatement of his claim that the denial of his motion to reopen was an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we reject this \u201cabuse of discretion claim cloaked in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Hadwani, </em>445 F.3d at 801 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). We also reject Muchanga\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 1252 does not apply, as he relies on former legislation that is not applicable to his case. <em>See Santos v. Reno, </em>228 F.3d 591, 595 (5th Cir.2000). We also lack jurisdiction to consider Muchanga\u2019s claim that his removal will result in extreme hardship to his United States citizen child because Muchanga failed to raise this issue in his appeal to the BIA. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009). The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
