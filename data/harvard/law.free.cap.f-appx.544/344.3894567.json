He was convicted of sex trafficking of children, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and coercion and enticement to engage a person in prostitution or other criminal sexual activity. We affirmed the conviction and vacated the sentence in part because the district court erroneously imposed a two-level multiple count adjustment to Davis\u2019s offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(d)(l). We affirmed the imposition of a five-level adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(l) because Davis engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct with minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\">On appeal from his resentencing, Davis contends solely that the district court erred by imposing the five-level adjustment for engaging in a pattern of prohibited sexual behavior with a minor. He construes this court\u2019s previous opinion as allowing him to offer evidence to rebut the presumption of correctness he alleges is given to presentence reports. Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>affirmed the five-level adjustment in the previous appeal, Davis was barred from relitigating that issue in the district court. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 320-21 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v.
