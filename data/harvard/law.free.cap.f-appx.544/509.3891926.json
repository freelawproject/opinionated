The district court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of eighty-seven months, which was at the low end of his advisory-guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">Lopez Licona first argues that the court erred when it denied him a mitigating-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first examine whether the court committed any procedural errors, <em>id., </em>reviewing the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">The sentence was based solely on Lopez Licona\u2019s importation and transportation of the nineteen kilograms of cocaine involved in the offenses of conviction. If a sentence is based on activity in which a defendant was actually involved, \u00a7 3B1.2 does not require a reduction in the base offense level even though the defendant\u2019s activity in a larger conspiracy may have been minor. <em>United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the court did not clearly err in concluding that Lopez Licona was not entitled to a mitigating-role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">Lopez Licona contends that his sentences are unreasonable because they are greater than necessary to accomplish the goals in \u00a7 3553(a). We review \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">First, we have consistently rejected the argument that a guideline lacking an empirical basis will result in an excessive sentence. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). Second, the record reflects that the court considered the advisory guidelines range of imprisonment, Lopez Licona\u2019s arguments for a more lenient sentence and his statements in allocution, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Lopez Licona has not shown that the court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or to any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence, <em>see United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008), and he has not shown that the court abused its discretion in imposing a within-guidelines sentence, <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
