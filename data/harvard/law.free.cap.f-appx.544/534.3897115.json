In 2010, however, following retroactive Amendment 706 to the Guidelines for cocaine base, the court determined Hughes\u2019 amended Guidelines sentencing range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the sentence was reduced to 262 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">For the motion at issue following retroactive Amendment 750 in 2011, the court determined no further reduction of the sentence was warranted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the amendment did not lower Hughes\u2019 Guidelines sentencing range below that applicable following Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">Hughes contends the court based its recalculation of his Guidelines sentencing range on erroneous drug quantities. Relying on a strained interpretation of the sentencing transcript, he contends the sentencing court held him responsible only for 1.6237 kilograms of cocaine base and no amount of powder cocaine, and any attempt to hold him accountable for the latter would be contrary to that court\u2019s explicit findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-23\">This court reviews a decision regarding \u201cwhether to reduce a sentence pursuant to ... \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion\u201d. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-24\">A two-step analysis applies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). First, the court must determine the \u201c[G]uideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the relevant amendment had been in effect at the time of the initial sentencing\u201d. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 711 (5th Cir.2011); <em>see Dil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>lon, </em>180 S.Ct. at 2691. Second, if defendant is eligible for a sentence modification, then the court must consider the applicable \u00a7 3558(a) sentencing factors to determine whether modification is warranted. <em>Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d at 711-12; <em>see Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Hughes\u2019 attempt to relitigate the facts underlying his original sentence exceeds the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d at 711. Because Amendment 750 did not lower Hughes\u2019 applicable Guidelines sentencing range, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
