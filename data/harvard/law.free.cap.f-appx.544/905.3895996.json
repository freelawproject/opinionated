Delva sought a reduction under Amendment 750 to the Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>tencing Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Delva\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. We have held that defendants, like Delva, whose sentences are based on the mandatory minimum guideline, see United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5Gl.l(b); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), not on the drug quantity tables, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, are ineligible for a reduction of their sentence under Amendment 750. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1074-79 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.2008). Delva also cannot obtain relief under the Fair Sentencing Act. The Act \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission ... [that can] serve as a basis for a ... sentence reduction,\u201d and does not apply to Delva because he was sentenced before the Act became effective on August 3, 2010. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376-78 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Delva\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
