He contends that the district court plainly erred by assessing criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c) for his prior 90-day suspended sentences for driving with a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Since Posadas did not object to the criminal history points in the district court, his claim of error is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Henry, </em>288 F.3d 657, 664 (5th Cir.2002). A defendant may receive one criminal history point for each prior sentence for driving with a suspended license so long as \u201cthe sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l)(A). A totally suspended sentence \u201cshall be counted as a prior sentence under \u00a7 4Al.l(c).\u201d \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Posadas contends that neither of his 90-day suspended sentences constitutes a 30-day \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d as required by the plain language of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l)(A) since each term of imprisonment was totally suspended. For support, he relies on another subsection of \u00a7 4A1.2 that defines a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d and states, \u201cIf part of a sentence of imprisonment was suspended, \u2018sentence of imprisonment\u2019 refers only to the portion that was not suspended.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">We rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Olear-Rivera, </em>318 Fed.Appx. 292, 294 (5th Cir.2009), by holding that any error was not plain because there was no precedent in this circuit that supported the defendant\u2019s argument. There is still no precedent in this circuit that supports this argument. Further, other circuits have reached divergent conclusions. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>506 F.3d 940, 945 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Morton, </em>239 Fed.Appx. 798, 804 (4th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 670-71 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, Posadas cannot demonstrate that the district court committed any plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
