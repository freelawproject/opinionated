The district court dismissed his claims regarding interference with his legal mail as barred pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), but held in the alternative that those claims lacked merit. The district court dismissed his remaining federal claims with prejudice as frivolous and dismissed his state claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-20\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Max-George\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997). On appeal, Max-George fails to address the district court\u2019s determination that his claims of interference with his legal mail were barred by <em>Heck. </em>He has therefore abandoned any such challenge. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-21\">Max-George argues that the district court erred by dismissing his retaliation claim because his statement of facts was sufficient to establish the requisite elements of his claim. He was required to produce either direct evidence of motivation or \u201ca chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.\u201d <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995) (quotation omitted). His statement of facts and other pleadings fail to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">Max-George also contends that the district court erred by dismissing his challenge to the prison grievance procedure for failing to implicate a protected liberty interest. He asserts this claim implicates his constitutional interest in sending and receiving mail. In a case that also involved a prisoner\u2019s challenge to a prison grievance procedure\u2019s failure to remedy problems with his prison mail, this court held that a prisoner \u201cdoes not have a federally protected liberty interest in having ... grievances resolved to his satisfac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 374 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Max-George\u2019s federal claims. It therefore properly dismissed his state law claims. <em>Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., </em>180 F.3d 234, 246 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Max-George\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Max-George is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
