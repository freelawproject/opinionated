Appellant Ronald Benjamin and Appellee Maria Tejedor both claimed to represent Weeks in connection with his settlement. Each argued that he or she deserved the resulting $67,500 in attorney\u2019s fees. The district court adopted a special master\u2019s report and recommendation awarding the fees to Tejedor. We AFFIRM. We also DENY Tejedor\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\n<em>1. Facts and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Gene Weeks suffered a heart attack in March 2004 after taking Vioxx for years. Weeks signed an agreement in September 2005 giving attorney Maria Tejedor the authority to represent him in claims against Merck &amp; Company, the manufacturer of Vioxx. Tejedor proceeded to file a products liability lawsuit against Merck on behalf of Weeks in September 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Tejedor sent Weeks a letter in November 2007 informing him of Merck\u2019s settlement program and \u201cstrongly recommending]\u201d that he participate. Weeks, representing that he had read the settlement information provided by Tejedor, signed an agreement to participate in the program. Weeks then signed in January 2008 a release of all his claims against Vioxx in exchange for his participation in the program. Tejedor signed an accompanying document representing that Weeks \u201chas at all relevant times been represented the undersigned counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Tejedor informed Weeks in a letter dated May 5, 2009 that she had obtained from the Vioxx claims administrator a notice that he was eligible for a settlement award. Tejedor then informed Weeks in a letter dated May 12, 2009 that he had received an award of about $230,000. The letter provided that Weeks would have until May 28, 2009 to appeal the award. It also indicated that the Vioxx claims administrator had reduced the amount of Weeks\u2019 award because of his high cholesterol.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">Weeks informed Tejedor in a signed, three-sentence letter dated May 14, 2009 that \u201cI no longer require your representation in this case.\u201d Weeks continued: \u201cAny actions by your firm concerning my case shall be deemed unauthorized by me. I am currently being represented by another firm.\u201d There were no attachments or enclosures to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">Tejedor nonetheless appealed the amount of the initial award to the Vioxx claims administrator, writing in a letter dated May 20, 2009 that she believed the reduction for high cholesterol was in error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claims administrator agreed, and increased Weeks\u2019 award to $285,000 in a notice dated May 27, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">On April 22, 2009 \u2014 after Weeks had signed the release of his claims, but before Weeks had received his award \u2014 attorney Ronald Benjamin filed a motion to vacate and rescind Weeks\u2019 participation in the settlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Benjamin argued that Weeks\u2019 participation in the settlement was not voluntary, but the result of Tejedor\u2019s \u201crepeatedly cajolpngj him into signing onto the settlement program.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Benjamin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>stated in the motion that he was representing Weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The district court denied the motion to rescind, finding that Weeks voluntarily enrolled in the settlement program, and that his decision to do so was irrevocable. Relevant to this case, the district court found that \u201cMs. Tejedor was Mr. Weeksf] attorney at the time of [his] decision\u201d to sign the release. The court also found, however, that \u201cit is clear that the attorney-client relationship between Mr. Weeks and Ms. Tejedor was terminated on or before May 14, 2009\u201d \u2014 the date of Weeks\u2019 letter informing Tejedor that he \u201cno longer require[d][her] representation.\u201d The court explained that \u201c[i]f Ms. Tejedor feels that she is entitled to fees for the work that she completed on Mr. Weeks[\u2019] case, the appropriate remedy is to assert a lien.\u201d The court declined to impose sanctions on either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Weeks proceeded to accept, through Tejedor, the settlement. After deducting her own costs and attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 twenty-four percent of the settlement, or about $67,500 \u2014 Tejedor sent to Weeks about $185,000. Weeks signed a \u201cclosing statement\u201d in March 2010 confirming that he did not oppose the deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Tejedor put her costs and fees in a trust account, and then filed a lien for the amount with the district court. The district court in March 2010 referred Teje-dor\u2019s claim to a special master appointed to evaluate disputed attorney\u2019s fees and costs related to the Vioxx settlement program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The special master notified the parties that they had to attend an in-person meeting on September 13, 2010. Benjamin did not attend the meeting. The special master also issued a scheduling order requiring the parties to provide certain documents, including an initial memorandum and evidence binder, and to attend an in-person final hearing on October 19, 2010. Benjamin did not provide the requested documents, and did not attend the final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">The special master awarded Tejedor the entire attorney\u2019s fee award. He found that Tejedor represented Weeks during the settlement process, and that her efforts culminated in the settlement award. He also found that \u201c[t]here is no evidence whatsoever that any involvement or effort by Ronald Benjamin assisted in the obtaining of the award for Mr. Weeks.\u201d The special master imposed sanctions on Benjamin, finding a \u201cflagrant abuse and disregard of the judicial process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">The district court, reviewing under Fed. R.CivP. 58(f) the special master\u2019s findings of fact and law <em>de novo, </em>and the procedure used by the special master for abuse of discretion, adopted the special master\u2019s recommendation awarding the attorney\u2019s fees to Tejedor. The district court found that Benjamin\u2019s \u201caccount of the underlying handling of Mr. Weeks\u2019 claim is entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>speculative and not supported by evidence or testimony adduced at the Special Master\u2019s hearing.\u201d However, the district court declined to uphold the special master\u2019s imposition of sanctions, finding that \u201calthough Mr. Benjamin\u2019s conduct was unwarranted and inappropriate, it is sufficient to award the entirety of the disputed lien to Ms. Tejedor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Benjamin appeals the district court\u2019s order, challenging the decision to award attorney\u2019s fees to Tejedor, along with the procedure used by the special master to reach that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>2. Standard, of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">This court reviews an award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion, reviewing factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo. Dearmore v. City of Garland, </em>519 F.3d 517, 520 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\n<em>3. The Attorney\u2019s Fee Award</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The district court did not err in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Tejedor because Tejedor\u2019s work on behalf of Weeks culminated in his settlement award. The representation contract provided that, if Weeks discharged Tejedor for \u201cany reason,\u201d Tejedor would \u201cbe entitled to a fee based on ... any offer of settlement outstanding, or if no offer of settlement is outstanding, a reasonable fee based on the amount of time my attorney(s) spent on my case plus all costs and interest.\u201d Teje-dor informed Weeks that he had received a settlement award in a letter dated May 12, 2009 \u2014 two days before Weeks sent his own letter to Tejedor stating that he \u201cno longer require[d] [her] representation in\u201d the case. To the extent that the proposed settlement award was not an \u201coffer of settlement outstanding,\u201d the $67,500 attorney\u2019s fee award was a \u201creasonable fee\u201d based on the amount of time Tejedor spent on the case. The special master received evidence showing that Tejedor: entered into a written agreement to represent Weeks in his claims against Merck; filed a products liability lawsuit against Merck on his behalf; advised Weeks when he signed a release of his claims; secured Weeks\u2019 eligibility for a settlement award; obtained an increase in the amount of the award; and disbursed the award to Weeks. By contrast, Benjamin\u2019s work on behalf of Weeks \u2014 filing a motion to vacate and rescind Weeks\u2019 participation in the settlement \u2014 focused on opposing settlement efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Benjamin argues that the special master and, correspondingly the district court, erred by failing to consider his motion for summary judgment, other than to deny it in the adopted report and recommendation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also contends that Tejedor\u2019s failure to oppose the motion \u201cshould have resulted in summary judgment being entered in Benjamin\u2019s favor based on the undisputed facts that would properly be admitted and were dispositive.\u201d He maintains that, had the special master considered his motion, there would have been no need for the final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">The scheduling order did not, however, allow for motion practice. The order made clear the parties\u2019 arguments were to be set forth in memorandum submitted with their evidence binders. We cannot say, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>context of multidistrict litigation, that the special master abused his discretion in making procedural decisions to streamline the process for awarding attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(f)(5). To the extent, then, that we consider Benjamin\u2019s argument that Tejedor did not respond to his summary judgment motion, the record shows that Tejedor did in fact respond in a filing titled \u201cResponse to Ronald Benjamin\u2019s Memorandum of Law,\u201d and an accompanying affidavit. Further, to the extent that we consider his argument that there would have been no need for the final hearing, the record is clear that there is a \u201cgenuine dispute as to any material fact,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), as to Benjamin\u2019s claim to the attorney\u2019s fee award for the reasons discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Benjamin also argues that he did not receive sufficient notice that the special master would accept evidence at the October 19 hearing. He observes that the scheduling order specified that \u201call testimony and evidence being submitted must be <em>received by </em>the Special Master <em>no later than September 20, 2010 </em>\u201d and that \u201c[parties will not be allowed to submit any additional evidence or testimony at the hearing.\u201d However, the scheduling order, which made clear that Benjamin\u2019s <em>\u201cpersonal appearance\u201d </em>was <em>\u201cmandatory,\u201d </em>also provided that the special master \u201creserves the right to pose any questions to any of the participants at the hearing.\u201d The transcript of the October 19 hearing is clear that the special master acted within the confines of the order by asking Teje-dor questions. Although Tejedor did testify during the hearing, her statements did not constitute \u201cadditional evidence or testimony\u201d because they merely summarized the contents of her evidence binder, which she had already submitted to the special master, along with her communications with Benjamin related to the hearing. The transcript also is clear that the special master did not, by admitting into evidence orders by the district judge, the scheduling order, communications relating to the scheduling order, and documents required by the scheduling order, admit \u201cadditional evidence\u201d because the documents in question already were before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Benjamin argues in substance that he deserves the attorney\u2019s fee award because Tejedor \u201cabandon[edj\u201d Weeks as a client in January 2009. Specifically, Benjamin contends: that Tejedor told Weeks in a January 7 meeting that she would no longer represent him; that Tejedor sent Weeks a letter dated January 16 stating that \u201cyou have elected to allow us to withdraw as your counsel and you have elected to seek alternative counsel to file your lawsuit\u201d; and that Weeks sent Tejedor an e-mail on January 23 stating \u201cmy new [counsel] recommends that there will be no more actions from your firm on my behalf.\u201d However, Benjamin has not demonstrated that he properly submitted this evidence to the special master. To the extent, then, that we consider his evidence, which was included in exhibits to Benjamin\u2019s motion to vacate or rescind Weeks\u2019 participation in the settlement program, it shows at best that there was uncertainty as to Tejedor\u2019s relationship with Weeks in January 2009. It does not show that his work contributed in any way to Weeks\u2019 settlement award. It also does not rebut the evidence before the special master, discussed above, showing that Tejedor\u2019s efforts \u2014 many of which were undertaken before January 2009 \u2014 culminated in the award. Further, Tejedor presented to the special master evidence showing that she did not withdraw from representing Weeks in January 2009, but instead explained to Weeks that, if he wanted to pursue a tort action against Merck, he would have to obtain a different lawyer. Tejedor also presented evidence that, after receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the settlement award, Weeks told Tejedor that she had \u201cearned [her] fee.\u201d Therefore, we cannot say that the special master\u2019s recommendation to award the attorney\u2019s fees to Tejedor, and the district court\u2019s adoption of this recommendation, was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In sum, the district court did not err in awarding the attorney\u2019s fee award to Teje-dor because her efforts, and not Benjamin\u2019s, culminated in Weeks\u2019 settlement award.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\n<em>Jp. Tejedor\u2019s Motion for Appellate Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u201cIf a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 38. An appeal is frivolous if it \u201cinvolves legal points not arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>749 F.2d 217, 222 (5th Cir.1984); <em>see also Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We deny Tejedor\u2019s motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs because at least some of Benjamin\u2019s arguments are not \u201cfrivolous\u201d under Fed. R.App. P. 38. For example, Benjamin\u2019s evidence showing uncertainty as to the status of Tejedor\u2019s relationship with Weeks, while not persuasive or properly submitted, raises questions about her claim to the attorney\u2019s fee award that are at least \u201carguable on their merits.\u201d <em>See Hagerty, </em>749 F.2d at 222. As the district court observed in declining to impose sanctions on Benjamin, \u201calthough [his] conduct was unwarranted and inappropriate, it is sufficient to award the entirety of the disputed lien to Ms. Tejedor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">In sum, we deny Tejedor\u2019s motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs because at least some of Benjamin\u2019s argument are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">\n<em>5. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Tejedor. We also DENY Tejedor\u2019s motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-10\">.Tejedor explains that she appealed the initial award despite Weeks\u2019 letter because she was still counsel of record, and the deadline to appeal was approaching. She adds that she tried to contact Weeks, but that he did not respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-15\">. Tejedor states that she did not learn about Benjamin\u2019s motions until after the claims administrator sent notice of the final award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-16\">. The record is not clear as to why or when Weeks decided to hire Benjamin. The district court observed: \"While his claim was being reviewed by the Claims Administrator, Mr. Weeks apparently believed that his claim had been conclusively rejected and decided to hire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Ronald Benjamin to represent him instead of Ms. Tejedor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">. After the district court referred the lien to the special master, Benjamin filed in August 2010 a motion for summary judgment with the district court seeking dismissal of Teje-dor's claim for attorney\u2019s fees. The district court, in turn, referred the motion to the special master. Benjamin then filed a motion on October 6, 2010 \u2014 thirteen days before the special master's scheduled final hearing\u2014 to stay or adjourn the hearing pending the summary judgment motion. The district court denied the motion to stay or adjourn on October 14, 2010 \u2014 five days before the hearing \u2014 finding that there was no reason to interfere with the special master's handling of the attorney\u2019s fee dispute. The special master denied Benjamin\u2019s motion for summary judgment in his report and recommendation deciding the dispute on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\">. To the extent that Benjamin frames his appeal as a challenge to the district court\u2019s independent denial of his motion for summary judgment, we \"decline to review the district court\u2019s denial of motions for summary judgment when the case comes to us on the movant's appeal following adverse judgment\u201d after a decision on the merits. <em>Black v.
