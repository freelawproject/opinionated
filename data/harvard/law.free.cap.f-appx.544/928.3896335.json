On December 7, 2010, during his supervised release term, Whittingham was arrested for aggravated battery on an elderly person, a charge of which he was later acquitted in state court. He spent two years in county jail before the commencement of his trial on December 11, 2012. The state court entered a judgment of acquittal on December 12, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-22\">On December 27, 2010, the United States Probation Office filed a petition for a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest based on Whittingham\u2019s violation of the condition of his supervised release that he refrain from violation of the law. After a supervised release violation hearing on March 14, 2013, the district court ruled on April 16, 2013, that the defendant violated his supervised release. The district court sentenced Whittingham to 24 months in federal prison without crediting him for time served in state custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">On appeal, Whittingham argues that the district court erred by refusing to credit him for time served in state custody prior to his acquittal. Whittingham relies on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 (instructing courts on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>how to sentence a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment), and <em>United States v. Descally, </em>254 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2001) (vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence because the district court had failed to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, cmt. n. 2, in order to account for time served in state custody for a related crime). He also briefly mentions 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 as support.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We review a federal sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). In reviewing reasonableness, \u201c[w]e look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). And a prisoner seeking reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) must exhaust administrative remedies before petitioning for judicial review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987, 990 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Whittingham challenges his sentence only for procedural unreasonableness, specifically for the failure to reduce his sentence for time served pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.3. The applicable sentencing guideline, however, is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(b) (\u201cIn the case of a revocation of ... supervised release, the applicable range of imprisonment is that set forth in \u00a7 7B1.4.\u201d). Whittingham\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 5G1.3 is misplaced because it applies to defendants who have undischarged terms of imprisonment, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, and he had no undischarged term of imprisonment. Whittingham\u2019s Grade A violation and his criminal history category of VI give him a 33-41 month range of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. Because the statutory maximum for a supervised release violation is two years where, as here, the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class C felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the term of imprisonment imposed by the district court is appropriate and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">In addition, we dismiss the \u00a7 3585(b) issue for lack of ripeness because Whit-tingham has not exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>Williams, </em>425 F.3d at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
