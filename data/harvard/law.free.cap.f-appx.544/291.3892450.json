The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) issued an oral decision denying relief. The IJ determined that Zhuang was credible but that his interrogation at the hands of the police did not establish past persecution based on his own religious practice. The IJ also determined that although \u201cit is likely that [Zhuang] would be investigated for his activities,\u201d he had not established that it was \u201clikely that he would be persecuted or tortured based on these activities.\u201d The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Zhuang argues that the IJ and BIA erred in denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. We review factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cUnder this standard, reversal is improper unless [the court] decide[s] not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but [also] that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The BIA found that being slapped during the interrogation did not constitute persecution. Zhuang does not challenge the BIA\u2019s recitation of his testimony, but he simply asserts that the BIA reached an incorrect conclusion. Zhuang has not shown that the evidence, which is undisputed in this case, compels a contrary determination. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Because the BIA did not err in finding that there was no past persecution, it is not necessary to address whether the past persecution was based on his religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">The alternative asylum ground, a well-founded fear of persecution, exists when \u201ca reasonable person in the same circumstances would fear persecution if deported.\u201d <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). Only \u201cextreme conduct\u201d may establish persecution. <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 116 (5th Cir.2006). Both the BIA and the IJ noted that Zhuang asserted he feared persecution if he returned to China because the Neighborhood Committee in his hometown wanted him arrested for distributing religious materials that he had brought back from the United States. Arguably, the March 19, 2009 order of the Neighborhood Committee could support a finding of a well-founded fear of future persecution, but it would not compel such a finding. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. Zhuang has not shown that the BIA erred by denying asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">To be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that there is a clear probability that he will be persecuted upon his return to his home country. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cAn applicant who has failed to establish the less stringent \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard of proof required for asylum relief is necessarily also unable to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>an entitlement to withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Dayo v. Holder, </em>687 F.3d 653, 658-59 (5th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). Zhuang has not shown that the BIA erred by denying withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In order to obtain CAT relief, \u201can applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to his home country.\u201d <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344-45 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering ... is intentionally inflicted on a person ... for any reason ... when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). As discussed above, the evidence in the record does not compel a finding that Zhuang, more likely than not, would be tortured if returned to China. Zhuang has not shown that the BIA erred by denying relief under the CAT. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">As part of his main argument, Zhuang contends the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to remand for additional evidence. A motion to remand for the consideration of new evidence is considered to be the same in substance as a motion to reopen removal proceedings and is reviewed under the standards applicable to motions to reopen. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 451-52 (5th Cir.2001). This court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The new evidence consisted of an April 28, 2010, order by the Neighborhood Committee ordering Zhuang to \u201csurrender himself to justice at once for leniency\u201d and that a failure to report would result in severe punishment. This order was identical in substance to the prior order discussed above. The BIA found that the new evidence was redundant and was not likely to change the outcome of the case. Zhuang has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion. <em>See Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Zhuang\u2019s petition for revi\u00e9w is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
