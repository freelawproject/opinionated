In this court, Bryant argues the merits of his claim that the defendants violated his privacy rights under prison policy and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by conducting a body cavity search in the presence of other inmates and several male and female correctional officers. Liberally construed, he additionally contends that the district court improperly made factual determinations relating to the merits of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Bryant has failed to brief any challenge to the reason for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his instant \u00a7 1988 action, namely the court\u2019s finding that his action was du-plicative and thus malicious. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Bryant does not challenge the reason for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action, he has abandoned the only issue before this court. <em>See id.; see also Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). His appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Bryant\u2019s complaint as malicious and our dismissal count as two strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Bryant has previously accrued one strike. <em>See id. </em>at 387; <em>Bryant v. Watts, </em>No. 93-1552, 1993 WL 347037, at *1 (5th Cir. Aug. 13, 1993) (unpublished) (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous). After he filed this appeal, he received two additional strikes. <em>See Bryant v. Kukua, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 849, 850 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Because Bryant has now accumulated five strikes, he is BARRED from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). We caution Bryant that any additional frivolous appeals filed by him will invite the imposition of sanctions. To avoid sanctions, Bryant is further cautioned to review any pending appeals to ensure that they do not raise arguments that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
