In calculating the sentence, the district court concluded that Mohamud was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because he had failed to provide complete and accurate financial information to the probation officer. On appeal, Mohamud argues that he was entitled to an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, given his guilty plea and his admission to the conduct underlying his offense and in light of his explanations for the omissions. The district court did not, and was not required to, accept Moha-mud\u2019s explanation for failing to provide full and accurate financial information. Moha-mud has not established that the denial of the reduction was \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
