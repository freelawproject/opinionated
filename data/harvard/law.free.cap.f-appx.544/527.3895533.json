Preston contends that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence based on conduct for which he was acquitted by the jury. Specifically, he argues that the district court\u2019s use of acquitted conduct violated the Sixth Amendment and dis-served the statutory purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Preston acknowledges that his Sixth Amendment argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997), and that we have held that <em>Watts </em>remains valid after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Nevertheless, he argues that a reevaluation of Booker\u2019s impact on Waiis is necessary in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">A panel of this court may not overrule another panel\u2019s decision without en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary Supreme Court decision. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>were decided prior to <em>Booker. </em>Moreover, we have repeatedly held that Waiis remains valid after <em>Booker, see United States v. Jackson, </em>596 F.3d 236, 243 n. 4 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Farias, </em>469 F.3d 393, 399 (5th Cir.2006), and the Supreme Court has not held otherwise. <em>See Cunningham, </em>549 U.S. at 274-94, 127 S.Ct. 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">To the extent Preston argues that the district court\u2019s consideration of acquitted conduct rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable, his argument is likewise unavailing. The record reflects that the district court considered Preston\u2019s arguments against the use of acquitted conduct, as well as the applicable guidelines range and \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Noting that he was probably \u201csort of a small-time operator,\u201d the district court reasoned that a sentence within the guidelines range was not appropriate. Instead, the district court concluded that a below guidelines sentence of concurrent terms of 120 months of imprisonment on Counts Two and Three adequately and appropriately addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Therefore, Preston has failed to show that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence based on conduct for which he was acquitted by the jury. <em>See Watts, </em>519 U.S. at 157, 117 S.Ct. 633; <em>Farias, </em>469 F.3d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">Preston also contends that the district court clearly erred when it enhanced his base offense level for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because his testimony did not amount to perjury. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>cording to Preston, his testimony that he bought and sold numerous firearms over the years as a hobby, rather than a business, was supported by the evidence and the jury\u2019s verdict on Count One. He also argues that he admitted selling a firearm to a confidential informant (Cl) who claimed to be a convicted felon and, thus, his testimony regarding whether he subjectively believed that the Cl was a convicted felon was not material to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The district court\u2019s determination that the obstruction of justice enhancement was warranted is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 752 (5th Cir.1999). Special Agent Travis Riddle of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives testified that transaction logs found following a search of Preston\u2019s home showed that Preston purchased and sold 200 firearms over the course of 14 years. Forty-one of those firearms were purchased in 2009, and 90 were purchased between January and November of 2010. Based on entries which included the dates and prices of the various transactions, approximately 50% of the firearms were resold within 30 days of their purchase, and Preston made an average profit of 45% from each sale. Preston\u2019s profit during this 14-year period was approximately $3,000. Preston denied that he was buying and selling firearms to make a profit. Instead, he testified that he was doing so as a hobby and that he would use the money he made to buy ammunition and additional firearms. Although Preston\u2019s buying and selling of firearms may not have been as profitable as he would have liked, the record reflects that he was doing so to make a profit and that he testified falsely on this material issue. Further, although Preston admitted that the Cl told him he was a convicted felon, Preston testified that he believed the Cl was \u201cBSing\u201d him because \u201cfrom [his] experience from being in collections and dealing with tow truck companies, [he] didn\u2019t think they could hire felons.\u201d Preston\u2019s testimony on this issue was designed to influence or affect the jury\u2019s verdict on Count Two. <em>See United States v. Como, </em>53 F.3d 87, 90 (5th Cir.1995). Finally, Preston\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the district court\u2019s factual findings on this issue is both inadequately briefed and belied by the record. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Preston\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>See Powers, </em>168 F.3d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
