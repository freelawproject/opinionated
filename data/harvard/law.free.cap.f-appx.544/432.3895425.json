We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\">Reyes contends that the district court erred proeedurally when it assigned him a base offense level of 24 under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00a7 2G1.3(a)(4) on the basis that the prostitution enterprise promoted sexual conduct with a minor prohibited by Texas Penal Code \u00a7 43.05. Reyes contends that \u00a7 2G1.3(a)(4) cannot be applied to a defendant who did not know that a minor was involved in a sex trafficking enterprise. He denies knowing that a minor was among the four females who were involved in the prostitution enterprise that he ran in Texas. According to Reyes, the lower base offense level of 14 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.1(a)(2) should have been applied. Reyes had a category I criminal history. If \u00a7 2Gl.l(a)(2) applies, his guidelines sentencing range is 10 to 16 months; if \u00a7 2G1.3(a)(4) applies, the range is 37 to 46 months. Additionally, Reyes asserts that his sentence was substantively unreasonable as a result of the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Under the bifurcated review process adopted in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we first take up any claim that the district court committed procedural error and, if no such error is found, we next examine the sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010). A district court commits procedural error \u201cif it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230, 238-39 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Whether a district court has misinterpreted the Guidelines and thereby committed an error of law presents an issue that we analyze de novo. <em>United States v. Lyckman, </em>235 F.3d 234, 237 (5th Cir.2000). Whether a district court has made mistaken factual findings or has misapplied the Guidelines to those findings presents an issue that we analyze for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Although the district court found that a minor was involved in Reyes\u2019s prostitution business, the court\u2019s assignment of the \u00a7 2G1.3(a)(4) enhancement was not based on a finding that Reyes knew of that involvement. And although the district court found that Reyes\u2019s assistant had knowledge that a minor was involved, the district court did not assign the \u00a7 2G1.3(a)(4) enhancement on that basis either. The district court stated that the enhancement applied because the Texas statute, which was referenced in the indictment and which made Reyes\u2019s prostitution enterprise \u201cprohibited sexual conduct\u201d did not require that the defendant know that a minor was involved in the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Reyes does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that, by his own admission, a minor was in fact involved in his prostitution business. Thus, Reyes fails to show that the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>See Castillo, </em>430 F.3d at 238-39; <em>Lyckman, </em>235 F.3d at 237. Nor does Reyes refute the district court\u2019s determination that under Texas law knowledge of a minor\u2019s involvement is unnecessary for a conviction for compelling prostitution. Thus, Reyes fails to show that the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was based on legal error. <em>See Castillo, </em>430 F.3d at 238-39; <em>Lyckman, </em>235 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Although he makes a conclusory assertion of substantive unreasonableness, Reyes does not brief the claim. Accordingly, the claim is deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
