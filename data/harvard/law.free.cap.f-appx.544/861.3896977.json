The district court dismissed Anderson\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Anderson had not yet received a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and thus had not exhausted his administrative remedies. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-23\">Federal courts may not review administrative decisions of the SSA except as provided in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1236 (11th Cir.1983); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (\u201cNo findings of fact or decision of the Commissioner of Social Security shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided\u201d). A social security claimant may obtain review under \u00a7 405(g) by filing a civil action in federal district court, but only \u201cafter any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-24\">Thus, to obtain review in federal court under \u00a7 405(g), a social security claimant must have: (1) presented his claim for benefits to the Commissioner; and (2) exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cThis means [the] claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ant must have completed each of the steps of the administrative review process unless exhaustion has been waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The administrative review process includes an initial determination, reconsideration, a hearing before an ALJ, and review by the Appeals Council. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(a)(l)-(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Anderson\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The parties agree that, at the time Anderson filed his complaint, the SSA had denied Anderson\u2019s administrative claim initially and on reconsideration, but had not yet acted on Anderson\u2019s request for an ALJ hearing. In other words, it is undisputed that the ALJ had not yet held a hearing in Anderson\u2019s case, much less issued a decision that the Appeals Council could review. Thus, Anderson had not completed the administrative review process, and there was not a final administrative decision required by \u00a7 405(g). Further, the SSA did not waive exhaustion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Because Anderson had not exhausted his administrative remedies before filing his action, the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-16\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1255 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-8\">. Exhaustion may be excused when the claimant raises only a constitutional issue that is collateral to consideration of the claim and therefore its resolution falls outside the agency's authority. <em>Crayton, </em>120 F.3d at 1222. Anderson, however, did not allege any constitutional claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
