Howard, Texas prisoner # 1397355, moves for appointment of counsel and leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. In his complaint, Howard alleged that the defendants engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to kill him on behalf of the Ku Klux Klan. The parties consented to allow the magistrate judge (MJ) to adjudicate the case, and the MJ dismissed Howard\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) on the ground that it was frivolous and failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The MJ denied Howard\u2019s subsequent motion to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-20\">By moving to proceed IFP here, Howard is challenging the MJ\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). He reiterates his factual allegations of a conspiracy and contends that the MJ erred by improperly making a credibility determination regarding the disputed material facts in his complaint. A court may dismiss a claim as factually frivolous where the facts alleged are \u201cclearly baseless,\u201d such as when the allegations are fanciful, fantastic, or delusional. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Howard\u2019s conclusory brief does not show that the MJ erred in certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See id.; Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-21\">Howard filed a prior civil suit that was dismissed by the district court under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, a decision from which he did not appeal. <em>Howard v. Crenshaw, </em>No. 4:08-CV-3751 (S.D.Tex. Dec. 30, 2008). That prior dismissal counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Based on the MJ\u2019s dismissal of his instant complaint and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous, Howard has accumulated two additional strikes, for a total of three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Ade-pegba, </em>103 F.3d at 388. Thus, Howard may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Additionally, we warn Howard that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and/or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Howard is further warned that he should review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IFP AND APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
