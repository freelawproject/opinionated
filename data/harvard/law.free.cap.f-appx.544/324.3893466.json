In a concise but thorough Order filed June 22, 2012, the district court carefully explained why there is no merit to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons given by the district court. As for Farkas\u2019s claim that removal was improper for want of diversity of citizenship, we agree with defendant that the joinder of the second defendant was fraudulent and in an attempt to defeat diversity in that there was no colorable cause of action against that defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
