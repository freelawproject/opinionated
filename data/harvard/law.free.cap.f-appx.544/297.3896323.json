Granger, Louisiana prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number># 587600, pursued this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 against various defendants, claiming civil-rights violations in connection with his arrest in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and the subsequent state-court criminal proceedings. Adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court dismissed Granger\u2019s complaint as frivolous for: failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; and/or seeking monetary damages against a defendant immune from such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Contesting that dismissal, Granger contends only that the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal, to the extent it was based on immunity, was erroneous because defendants bore the burden of proving their entitlement to an immunity defense. Granger\u2019s contention fails, however, as district courts must <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a prisoner\u2019s <em>in foima pauperis </em>complaint \u201cat any time if the court determines that ... the action ... seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief\u2019. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The remainder of Granger\u2019s brief consists of legal boilerplate and identifies no error in the district court\u2019s dismissing his complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are liberally construed, <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief contentions in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s failure-to-state-a-claim analysis is the same as if Granger had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">This dismissal, plus the district court\u2019s dismissing under \u00a7 1915(e), count as two strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Granger is warned that a third strike under \u00a7 1915(g) will render him unable to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil, action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
