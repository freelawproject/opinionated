This court is now presented with Stephens\u2019s petition for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) upholding the Immigration Judge\u2019s order finding him removable due to his prior conviction for an aggravated felony. Consistent with his position before the BIA, Stephens argues that he is entitled to a waiver of inadmissibility and that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) does not preclude him from seeking such relief because he achieved LPR status after he first entered this country. Under Stephens\u2019s view, his ease is substantially similar to <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 582 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We typically lack jurisdiction to review a decision of the BIA ordering an alien removed due to his prior conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 460-61 (5th Cir.2006). However, we retain jurisdiction to consider legal questions such as the issue whether Stephens is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(h). <em>See Martinez, </em>519 F.3d at 541. We conduct a de novo review of the BIA\u2019s legal determinations, and its factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Carranza-De Salinas v. Holder, </em>700 F.3d 768, 772 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">To the extent that Stephens contends that his case is squarely on point with, and thus controlled by, <em>Martinez, </em>we disagree. In contrast to <em>Martinez, </em>519 F.3d at 536, 543-44, the record in the instant case shows that Stephens obtained LPR status outside of the United States and was admitted to this country as an LPR. This distinction is material and dispositive. Additionally, as explained in <em>Molina-Ramirez v. Holder, </em>362 Fed.Appx. 387, 393 (5th Cir.2010), counsel conceded that Stephens was admitted as an LPR, and \u201cthe BIA may reasonably have concluded that [Stephens] could not satisfy <em>Martinez\u2019s </em>requirements for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver because of [this] concession.\u201d Although nonbinding, <em>Molina-Ramirez </em>is nonetheless \u201chighly persuasive.\u201d <em>See United States v. Pino Gonzalez, </em>636 F.3d 157, 160 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 178, 181 L.Ed.2d 88 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">Further, Stephens does not advance a persuasive argument to show that he is entitled to the relief sought. Rather, he simply cites <em>Martinez </em>and insists that his case should have the same result as that one. This is not enough for Stephens to show that he should receive \u00a7 1182(h) relief. <em>See Opie v. INS, </em>66 F.3d 737, 739 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
