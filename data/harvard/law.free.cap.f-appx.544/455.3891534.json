We hold that it may not, and therefore VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Plaintiff (\u201cCox\u201d) sued defendants in Louisiana State Court, alleging violations of the Louisiana Racketeering Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants removed to federal court. There they moved, among other things, to dismiss Cox\u2019s suit under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The district court found that Cox lacked \u201cstanding\u201d and dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d under Rule 12(b)(1). Cox appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) provide distinct grounds for dismissal of a claim for relief. Rule 12(b)(6) applies when a plaintiff \u201cfail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 12(b)(1) applies to claims over which a federal district court \u201clack[s] ... subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-18\">Cox contends that the district court erred by dismissing <em>with prejudice </em>under Rule 12(b)(1), rather than remanding to the state court. Cox points to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1477(c), which provides that while \u201c[a] motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal,\u201d \u201c[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-19\">Defendants reply in two ways. First, they claim that Cox waived this argument by failing to raise it in the district court. We disagree, because this claim of error cannot be waived. A dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) is a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. \u201cA dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, to dismiss with prejudice under Rule 12(b)(1) is to disclaim jurisdiction and then exercise it. Our precedent does not sanction the practice,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>and we will not do so here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Second, defendants contend that the district court\u2019s order should be understood as holding that Cox lacked <em>statutory </em>standing \u2014 not Article III standing \u2014 and that the district court therefore did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction. They ask us to affirm under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that Cox failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This argument has some force. The district court did, of course, explain that because it found \u201cthere is no standing, there is no jurisdiction and the court will grant the Motion to Dismiss pursuant to [Rule] 12(b)(1).\u201d We agree with defendants, however, that the court\u2019s analysis more closely tracked an inquiry into whether plaintiff stated a claim under Louisiana\u2019s Racketeering Act \u2014 a Rule 12(b)(6) question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But instead of rewriting the district court\u2019s order to affirm on the merits, we VACATE and REMAND for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

They err by conflating \"removal jurisdiction\u201d with subject-matter jurisdiction.
