By moving to proceed IFP, Lewis is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-20\">He does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. Thus, Lewis has abandoned any challenge to that determination. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (issues not adequately briefed by pro se appellant are waived). Because the district court determined that Lewis was ineligible for a sentence reduction, it did not err or abuse its discretion by not considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or Lewis\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>Cf. Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-21\">Lewis has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
