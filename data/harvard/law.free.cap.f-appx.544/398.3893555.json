The Deputies sought summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">We must first determine our jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. \u201cNormally, we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for summary judgment because such [an order] is not a final one within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is a narrow exception to this rule in the context of absolute or qualified immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cIn such a case, we possess appellate jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal because the claim in question is separate from the underlying merits of the case and therefore fits within the collateral order exception laid out in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even then, however, our jurisdiction is circumscribed. We may review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for summary judgment on immunity grounds only to the extent that the denial turns on an issue of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Put otherwise, we may evaluate only the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the materiality of the facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By contrast, we may not review a summary judgment order that \u201cdetermines only a question of \u2018evidence sufficiency.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-18\">Each of the arguments contained in the Deputies\u2019 initial brief in this court is directed at the sufficiency of the evidence rather than the materiality of the facts. We are therefore without jurisdiction to consider them in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">The Deputies first allege that \u201cthere is no evidence ... regarding whether the altercation was the result of something Skinner said or did, or whether the altercation was merely a random act that could not be foreseen by the[ ] [Deputies].\u201d This argument is apparently directed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>district court\u2019s conclusion that there was a genuine issue of fact regarding \u201cwhether [the Deputies] recognized a substantial risk to leaving Skinner in a general-population cell without supervision long enough to suffer harm\u201d given their knowledge that he was in a combative state and intoxicated. Since the Deputies\u2019 argument goes to the sufficiency of the evidence rather than the materiality of the facts found by the district court, we have no jurisdiction to evaluate it on interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The Deputies next argue \u201cthere is ... no evidence ... that the[ ] [Deputies] watched Skinner as he was in an altercation with another inmate or allowed the altercation to occur.\u201d This contention is apparently aimed at the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the Deputies \u201cacted immediately to protect Skinner\u201d or instead \u201cintentionally left [Skinner] in a cell long enough to suffer abuse.\u201d We are without jurisdiction to consider this argument since it is directed at the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The Deputies finally argue that to prove his claim, Skinner must show that \u201che suffered an injury caused by a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d; they assert that \u201c[t]his proof of causation is lacking in the evidence.\u201d We need not address this contention for two reasons. First, as with the Deputies\u2019 first two evidence-sufficiency arguments, we have no jurisdiction to consider it on interlocutory appeal. Second, the Deputies did not present this argument to the district court in their motion for summary judgment. It is familiar law that arguments not presented below are waived on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We acknowledge that certain of the arguments contained in the Deputies\u2019 reply brief come closer to raising the sort of legal arguments properly considered on interlocutory appeal. Like issues not raised below, however, arguments made for the first time in a reply brief are waived.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
