The district court concluded that the plaintiff was impermissibly approaching the federal courts for relief from a state judgment. Finding no jurisdiction over the case, the court dismissed all of Clavo\u2019s claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Plaintiff-Appellant Julie Clavo is a former phlebotomy supervisor who injured her back when she fell at work. Clavo eventually agreed to settle her ensuing workers\u2019 compensation claim, and the Louisiana Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Administration (\u201cWCA\u201d) closed the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clavo, however, later attempted to reopen her case, apparently alleging that her employer and others had fraudulently influenced her and had conspired to interfere with the WCA proceedings. When the WCA judge dismissed these new claims without permitting discovery, Clavo filed this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. She argues that her employer and others conspired to use the workers\u2019 compensation system to deprive Clavo of the full value of her workers\u2019 compensation and employment benefits. In addition, she objects to the WCA judge\u2019s handling of her case, complaining that he \u201cdisallowed evidence\u201d and dismissed her case prior to completion of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">The district judge examined Clavo\u2019s case and requested additional briefing to determine the status of any state proceedings. After confirming that the contested WCA decisions were final, and that Clavo had not appealed those decisions to the state courts, the district judge found no jurisdiction over the case. He then dismissed the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). We review 12(b)(1) dismissals de novo. <em>Union Planters Bank Nat. Ass\u2019n v. Salih, </em>369 F.3d 457, 460 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">The jurisdiction of the federal courts is established by the Constitution and by federal statute. <em>Weekly v. Morrow, </em>204 F.3d 613, 615 (5th Cir.2000). Neither the Constitution nor federal statute grants the district court jurisdiction to hear appeals of state decisions. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cfederal district courts, as courts of original jurisdiction, lack appellate jurisdiction to review, modify, or nullify final orders of state courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(referring to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, citing <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Tex., </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994)). This is equally true of orders and judgments rendered during workers\u2019 compensation hearings. <em>Randolph v. Texaco, Inc., </em>471 Fed.Appx. 416, 417 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Weekly, </em>204 F.3d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Clavo has attempted to establish jurisdiction by framing her case as a \u00a7 1983 claim. However, as the district court correctly noted, parties may not obtain federal review of state decisions merely by recasting what is effectively an appeal as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>civil rights claim. <em>Randolph, </em>471 Fed. Appx. at 417. Our review of the record confirms that Clavo\u2019s ostensible \u00a7 1983 <em>claim </em>\u2014 i.e., that various parties conspired against her to interfere with WCA proceedings and to deprive her of compensation and benefits \u2014 is merely an appeal of the decisions made by the WCA judge. Further, to whatever extent Clavo raises new claims, those claims are rooted in her allegation that the WCA proceedings were somehow deficient. The district court has no jurisdiction to consider such an argument, nor do we. <em>See Armant v. West, </em>155 Fed.Appx. 130 (5th Cir.2005) (finding no jurisdiction over a \u00a7 1983 claim because the claim was based on an argument that a state judgment was \u201cdeficient\u201d). Consequently, the case was properly dismissed, and we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\">. The administrative record is not before this court, so our summary is based on the parties' filings. These facts do not appear to be in dispute. The three claims Clavo filed with the WCA are Louisiana Office of Workers Compensation Docket Nos. 09-02850, 11-05605, and 12-02127.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
