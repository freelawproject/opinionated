Williams, III, Texas prisoner # 1667311, seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Williams alleged in his complaint that the defendants had assaulted him and had used excessive force. The district court found that his complaint failed to allege more than a de minimis injury and that, pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), Williams\u2019 conviction for assault of a public servant involving bodily injury barred his claim for use of excessive force arising from the same inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>dent. The district court denied his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that his appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Williams is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). A motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Williams does not address the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to allege more than a de minimis injury and that his claims were barred by <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to those determinations, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987), and has failed to demonstrate that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Williams has not shown that his appeal involves a nonfrivo-lous issue, we deny his motion to proceed IFP on appeal and dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n.24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Williams\u2019 remaining motions, for the appointment of counsel and for leave to seek discovery, also are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Williams has at least one other strike resulting from the dismissal of a frivolous complaint. <em>See Williams v. Tucker, </em>No. 5:09-CV-633 (W.D.Tex. Oct. 1, 2009). As Williams has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Williams is further warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
