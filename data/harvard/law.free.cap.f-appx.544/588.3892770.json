Halton seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court denied Halton leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that his appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Halton is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-24\">In this court, Halton does not address the district court\u2019s determination that Du-plantis was not a state actor and that the Public Defender\u2019s Office was not a jural entity. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to that determination, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987), and has failed to demonstrate that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Halton has not shown that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue, we deny his motion to proceed IFP on appeal and dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion to compel production of documents is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-25\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>We warn Halton that if he accumulates at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. See \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; \u00a7 1915(g) WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
