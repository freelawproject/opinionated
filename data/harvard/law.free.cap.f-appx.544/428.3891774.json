Redmond contends that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), and that the district court erred in refusing to permit him to challenge his convictions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the Savings Clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). See <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Redmond bears the burden of showing, inter alia, that his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">Redmond argues that his convictions are invalid because the Government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he used, carried, or brandished a firearm, an element of his convictions. In <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>the Supreme Court held that the machine gun provision under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii) was an element of the offense rather than a sentencing factor. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2173, 2180. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>does not provide a basis for Redmond\u2019s claim, as Redmond makes no assertion that his convictions or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>sentences were based on the possession of a machine gun or other type of firearm proscribed in \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii). There was no dispute in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>that the Government was required to prove as an element of an offense under \u00a7 924(c) that a firearm was used, carried, or possessed by the defendant. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2172. Such a requirement had been made explicit by the Supreme Court at least by its decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, </em>526 U.S. 275, 280, 119 S.Ct. 1239, 143 L.Ed.2d 388 (1999). Redmond cannot show that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of <em>O\u2019Brien. See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
