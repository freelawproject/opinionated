By moving to proceed IFP, VanHook challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">VanHook contends that his right of access to the courts was denied when the defendant corrections officer seized legal materials that were pertinent to his direct criminal appeal. Although he was represented by counsel at the time of the seizure, VanHook contends that he had a right to respond to the Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief filed subsequently by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-25\">VanHook makes no effort to show how he was prejudiced in his efforts to respond to the <em>Anders </em>brief by the seizure of his legal materials. <em>See Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002). Nor has he shown that the magistrate judge considered improperly his disciplinary record or that she was unfairly biased. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-26\">We conclude that VanHook has not shown that his appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-27\">We caution VanHook that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). If he accumulates a third strike, VanHook will be barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-28\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
