Sneed was sentenced to a 120-month term of imprisonment in 2007 for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. This was the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment at the time of Sneed\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-24\">On appeal, Sneed argues that the district court erred by failing to apply the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA), then use its discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to lower his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-25\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the ease of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). A sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendments to the Guidelines \u201cdo[ ] not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Sneed was sentenced in 2007, before the 2010 enactment of the FSA. The FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants sentenced before its effective date. <em>United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011). A mandatory minimum statutory penalty overrides the retroactive application of a new Guideline. <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994). Sneed\u2019s sentence of 120 months of imprisonment was statutorily mandated, and, thus, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see Pardue, </em>36 F.3d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
