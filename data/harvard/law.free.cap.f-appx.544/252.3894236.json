Pennywell pleaded guilty in 2004 to possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base (crack cocaine) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count One); possession of a firearm during, in relation to, and in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Count Two); possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count Three); and possession of a firearm while being subject to a protective order in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8) (Count Four). He was sentenced as a career offender to concurrent terms of 216 months of imprisonment on Count One and 120 months of imprisonment on Counts Three and Four, and a consecutive term of 60 months of imprisonment on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Pennywell contends that he was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his non-guidelines sentence on Count One was not based on the Career Offender Guideline. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Uni<em>ted States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (2011). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">Contrary to Pennywell\u2019s contention, his sentence was both based on the Career Offender Guideline and within the applicable guidelines range. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(c) (2004), the district court concluded that Pennywell was subject to a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months of imprisonment. In accordance with \u00a7 5G1.2(e) (2004), the district court apportioned the total punishment among the four counts of conviction. Thus, although the 216-month sentence imposed on Count One fell below the applicable guidelines range, the total punishment of 276 months of imprisonment was well within that range. Because Pennywell was sentenced as a career offender, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of time is DENIED. Pennywell\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
