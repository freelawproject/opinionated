Horn now appeals his conviction and sentence. He challenges his conviction on the ground that the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress his post-arrest statements to the police because he \u201cwas in an impaired mental and physical state\u201d when the officers obtained his waiver of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights. He challenges his sentence on two grounds: the District Court erred (1) in applying a four-level enhancement to his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2. 1(b)(6)(B), because he did not use or possess a firearm in connection with a felony offense, and (2) in sentencing him as an armed career criminal, because his pri- or convictions were not charged in the indictment or found by the jury. We address these challenges in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The circumstances that led to Horn\u2019s arrest, his interrogation by an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d) and a Miami Shores Police Department (\u201cMSPD\u201d) detective were these.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Horn was looking for Willie Weaver because Weaver, who had an extensive criminal record, had stolen three guns from him. Horn thought Weaver might be hiding out at the Miami Shores Hotel, so he drove to the hotel in his black Dodge Charger. He discovered that Weaver and his girlfriend, Isabel Greenberg, were in room No. 48. Armed with a handgun, Horn began banging violently on the door, yelling and screaming, \u201cI know you\u2019re inside, come out, I know you are in there.\u201d Horn had threatened Weaver before, so Weaver called the police. The MSPD dispatcher sent officers to the motel under code \u201c232,\u201d an aggravated assault in progress. The dispatcher told them that Horn was an Asian male and that he had driven to the motel in a black Dodge Charger. On arrival, they found the car, with Wellington Griffin siting in the front seat. They had an outstanding warrant for Griffin\u2019s arrest, so they took him into custody. Officer Rivera then located Horn trying to gain access to a motel room to hide. He brought Horn to room 48, where Weaver and Greenberg identified him. Horn acknowledged to Rivera that he had come to the motel to find Weaver, because Weaver had stolen guns from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Horn gave the officers consent to search his automobile. They found three backpacks and two duffel bags containing guns and ammunition inside the trunk. Horn identified the backpacks and duffel bags as his, but stated that the guns belonged to his wife, Tara Horn. In all, the search revealed two firearms and well over 80 rounds of ammunition; a Mac-10 semiautomatic pistol extender; 42 rounds of .45 caliber bullets; twenty .223 caliber rifle rounds; a Colt gun case and a fully-loaded .45 caliber magazine; and a Browning 9 mm pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">The officers arrested Horn for possessing a firearm, weapon, and ammunition as a convicted felon, transported him to the MSPD\u2019s main stationhouse for booking, and notified the ATF. After he was booked, ATF Agent Morales and MSPD Detective Cazzola, the lead detective in the case, asked Horn if he would be willing to speak to them. Agent Morales provided Horn with a <em>Miranda </em>Rights and Waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>form and had Horn read the form out loud and indicate his understanding of each right by placing his initials on the line and his signature at the end. Before he signed the form, Horn said that he had smoked marijuana two days before, but was not under the influence of any drugs and alcohol. He explained that he had not slept much in the previous two days because he had been searching for Weaver, who had stolen three rifles and a handgun from his business, Professional Movers, in Hialeah Gardens. He later recanted his statement that Weaver had stolen the firearms from his business and said that they were stolen from a hotel room the previous week.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Horn said that he and Griffin went to the Miami Shores Motel. He knocked on the door to Weaver\u2019s room, but Weaver would not answer. He denied carrying a gun at the time, insisting that the object he was carrying in his hand was a \u201ccigarette.\u201d When asked about the firearms found in the trunk of his car, he claimed that his wife, Tara Horn, must have put them there. Shortly after the interview concluded, Horn signed a consent form to give a DNA specimen. It revealed that Horn had handled the Browning 9 mm pistol recovered from the trunk of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Horn claims that he signed the <em>Miranda </em>Rights and Waiver form and submitted to questioning while in an impaired physical and mental state. Accordingly, after he was indicted for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), he moved the District Court to suppress the statements he made to Agent Morales and Detective Cazzola.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Attached to Horn\u2019s motion was the deposition of Detective Gazzola and an opinion letter from Dr. Juan B. Espinosa, a retained psychiatrist and neurologist. Caz-zola testified that he became involved in the case when he was called to the scene by Officer Rivera. He found Horn was sitting in the patrol car and \u201cwas really, really under the influence of narcotics,\u201d \u201ccoming down off crack cocaine.\u201d He was having trouble standing. A friend of Horn\u2019s told Cazzola that they had been \u201csmoking crack for 72 hours straight,\u201d including a couple of hours before his arrest. Cazzola said that during Horn\u2019s interview at the stationhouse, Horn kept nodding off; but \u201c[sjtrangely, it was only around the important questions where he would nod out.\u201d Regarding Horn\u2019s speech, it was \u201cvery lucid and coherent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">In his opinion letter, based on a reading of Cazzola\u2019s deposition, medical and legal records provided by Horn\u2019s counsel, and his examination of Horn, Dr. Espinosa concluded that Horn \u201cwas under the influence of substances at the moment of his arrest,\u201d and that it was \u201cvery probable that he was not competent to give consent or meaningful information at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">At the evidentiary hearing before the District Court, Agent Morales testified that, before he and Detective Cazzola interviewed Horn, he told them that he was a high school graduate and understood English. Morales said that he presented Horn with a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form, that Horn appeared to understand his rights, reading them out loud, and that he waived his rights, signing the form. During the interview, Horn \u201clooked a little sleepy,\u201d but was \u201clucid\u201d and \u201ccoherent,\u201d in his response to questioning. Agent Morales had read Detective Cazzola\u2019s deposition, but did not believe Cazzola\u2019s testimony that Horn was under the influence of narcotics or that he was coming down from crack. Nor did Morales believe that Horn \u201cwas genuinely falling asleep\u201d during the questioning; rather, he seemed to pretend to fall asleep when asked \u201chard questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Officer Rivera testified that during his encounters with Horn at the motel, Horn did not appear to be sick or under the influence of narcotics. Horn looked \u201cnor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>mal,\u201d may have been tired, but never fell asleep midsentence. He voluntarily consented to a search of his car even after being informed that he did not have to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied Horn\u2019s suppression motion. It credited Agent Morales testimony, disregarded Cazzola\u2019s testimony that Horn was under the influence of crack cocaine when he saw him at the motel, and found that Horn understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and knowlingly and voluntarily waived them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). Rulings of law are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>while the court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. \u201cThe district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the voluntariness of a confession, or the waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, raises questions of law to be reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Barbour, </em>70 F.3d 580, 584 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Before it may introduce a defendant\u2019s uncounseled statements made during custodial interrogation, the government must show that the defendant made a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel. <em>United States v. Beale, </em>921 F.2d 1412, 1434 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cThis showing has two distinct dimensions: (1) relinquishment of the right must have been the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception, and (2) waiver must have been made with the awareness of both the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A waiver of <em>Miranda </em>is effec-five' where the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension.\u201d <em>Barbour, 70 </em>F.3d at 585. A written <em>Miranda </em>waiver \u201cis usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 840 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s denial of Horn\u2019s motion to suppress. The court did not clearly err in its factual finding that Horn\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver was not obtained by intimidation, coercion, or deception, and there was strong evidence \u2014 including a written <em>Miranda </em>waiver \u2014 that Horn was aware of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them. We therefore affirm Horn\u2019s conviction, and move to the challenges to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002), and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Evaluating whether a firearm was used \u201cin connection with\u201d a felony offense is a factual determination and is evaluated for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 &amp; n. 8 (11th Cir.1995). To find clear error, we \u201cmust be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">In determining a defendant\u2019s total offense level under the Guidelines, the court consults U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2. 1(b)(6)(B), which provides a four-level enhancement where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2. 1(b)(6)(B). It is the government\u2019s burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the evidence warrants the enhancement. <em>United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Simple assault does not qualify as a felony under Florida law, so the conduct must rise to the level of an aggravated assault in order to qualify as a felony. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.011(2). Under Florida law, an assault is \u201can intentional, unlawful threat by word or act to do violence to the person of another, coupled with an apparent ability to do so\u201d along with \u201csome act which creates a well-founded fear in such other person that such violence is imminent.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.011(1). An aggravated assault is an assault which involves the use of a \u201cdeadly weapon without intent to kill\u201d or is done \u201cwith an intent to commit a felony.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The government\u2019s proof at trial \u2014 which mirrored the evidence before the court when it heard Horn\u2019s motion to suppress\u2014 was sufficient to satisfy, by a preponderance of the evidence, the elements of the crime of felony aggravated assault under Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 784.011 and 784.021. Thus, there was no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that Horn possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">We review constitutional sentencing issues de novo. <em>United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), any person convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), \u201cshall be imprisoned not more than 10 years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), a person convicted under \u00a7 922(g) who has three previous convictions in any court for violent felonies or serious drug offenses \u2014 which is the case here \u2014 is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The government need not allege in its indictment or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a sentencing court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222-23, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">As Horn properly concedes, <em>Almenda-rez-Torres </em>remains good law; hence, the district courts may determine both the existence of prior convictions and the factual nature of those convictions for Armed Career Criminal Act purposes. <em>See United States v. Weeks, </em>711 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2013), cert. denied (No. 13-5563) (U.S. Oct. 7, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">For the reasons stated in parts I, II and III, Horn\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-7\">.
