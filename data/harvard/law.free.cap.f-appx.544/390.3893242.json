In this appeal, Vega contends the district court erred in failing to reduce his offense level by two levels for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Because error was not adequately preserved, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Claiborne, </em>676 F.3d 434, 438 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cWhether a defendant has sufficiently demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility is a question of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 647 (5th Cir.2003). \u201c[Questions of fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error.\u201d <em>Claiborne, </em>676 F.3d at 438. Even if the argument is not reviewed for plain error, Vega cannot show that the district court\u2019s refusal to award the adjustment was without foundation because Vega contested the drug quantity attributable to him as relevant conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(A); <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246-47 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1230 (5th Cir.1994). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
