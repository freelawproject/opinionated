Approximately seventeen years after the district court denied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief, Alexander sought relief from the district court\u2019s order pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. He subsequently moved to amend his Rule 60(b) motion to assert claims that the judgment in the \u00a7 2255 proceeding was void because the district court refused to consider evidence submitted in support of his \u00a7 2255 claims. The district court denied both the motion to amend and the amended motion. Alexander has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">As the evidence cited by Alexander did not exist at the time his \u00a7 2255 motion was pending in the district court, his pleadings did not allege a \u201cdefect in the integrity of the [\u00a7 2255] proceedings\u201d and instead raised second or successive claims that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>see also, United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we conclude that the appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">We have previously warned Alexander that frivolous, repetitive, or abusive filings related to relief under \u00a7 2255 would invite the imposition of sanctions. Alexander is ORDERED to pay a monetary sanction of $100 to the clerk of this court. Until that sanction is paid, he may file no more appeals or initial pleadings challenging the validity of this conviction and sentence, whether those challenges are governed by \u00a7 2241, \u00a7 2255, or any other statutory provision, in this court or in any court under this court\u2019s jurisdiction. We WARN Alexander that future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive challenges to this conviction and sentence in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional and progressively more severe sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
