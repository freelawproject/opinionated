Latham appeals the 21-month sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to attempting to transfer obscene materials to a minor. He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it does not give due weight to his personal circumstances and because it gives inordinate weight to letters from his estranged wife and her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">We presume that the sentence within the proper guideline range is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Given the district court\u2019s thorough consideration of the arguments, evidence, and sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), Latham\u2019s contentions are reduced to a mere disagreement with the district court, and he thus fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). Latham\u2019s invitation to substitute his assessment of the relevant factors for the district court\u2019s assessment is contrary to the deferential review mandated by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
