Sheppard pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and to aiding and abetting. He was sentenced to 327 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Sheppard contends that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750, which implemented the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) and revised the Guidelines applicable to offenses involving cocaine base. Sheppard cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">As Sheppard\u2019s motion to reconsider was filed more than 14 days following the district court\u2019s ruling on his' \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, that court lacked jurisdiction to hear that motion. <em>See United States v. Miramontez, </em>995 F.2d 56, 58 n. 2 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>670 F.2d 46, 48 (5th Cir.1982). Accordingly, the judgment denying reconsideration is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b591-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
