Tax-Garcia contends on appeal that the district court erred by refusing to award him a third point for acceptance of responsibility under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3E 1.1(b) after the government refused to move for the reduction because he would not waive his right of appeal. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 376-79 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
