The enhancement was administered when Prozer was found to have violated the terms of his bond and subsequently lied to the magistrate judge presiding over his bond-revocation hearing. At sentencing, the Government requested and the district court granted the 2-level enhancement after Prozer pled guilty to seven separate counts relating to wire, mail, and bank fraud. On appeal, Prozer argues \u00a7 3C1.1 is inapplicable to a bond revocation hearing where the grounds for revocation derive from a separate offense. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm Prozer\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">The district court did not err in applying Prozer\u2019s 2-level obstruction enhancement for lying to the magistrate judge presiding over his hearing. We have held that giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>ing materially<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> false information at a bond hearing is sufficient to warrant an obstruction enhancement. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1648, 182 L.Ed.2d 242 (2012). Further, the commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 states an obstruction enhancement applies when a defendant provides \u201cmaterially false information to a ... magistrate judge.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4(F). Prozer\u2019s argument that the obstruction enhancement should not apply because his lies are wholly unrelated to his offense fails. The bond revocation hearing would have been impossible without Prozer first committing wire, mail, and bank fraud. Further, in fashioning \u00a7 3C1.1, the Sentencing Commission intended the provision to encompass any obstruction during the prosecution of the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, Amend. 693 (2006); <em>see also Doe, </em>661 F.3d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Finally, Prozer argues the district court\u2019s failure to make specific findings of fact regarding the reasoning for his obstruction enhancement must result in the reversal of the enhancement. This argument also fails. It is true the district court \u201cshould note specifically what each defendant did, why that conduct warrants the enhancement, and, if applicable, how that conduct actually hindered the investigation or prosecution of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Alpert, </em>28 F.3d 1104, 1108 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). However, where the record visibly reflects the basis for the enhancement and supports it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the obstruction enhancement will stand. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>88 F.3d 938, 944 (11th Cir.1996). The record reveals Prozer lied at his bond revocation hearing and the district court had sufficient reason to grant the Government\u2019s request for a 2-level obstruction enhancement. Thus, Prozer\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-14\">.
