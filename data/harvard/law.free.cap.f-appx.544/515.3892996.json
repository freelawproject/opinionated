According to Jones, the district court abused its discretion when it determined that he was not entitled to a reduction under Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines. He challenges the district court\u2019s denial of IFP status and certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The guidelines range applicable to Jones\u2019s case was not based on the quantity of cocaine base involved in the offense; it was based on Jones\u2019s career offender status. \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jones\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id.; United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Jones demonstrates no error in the district court\u2019s certification decision and fails to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
