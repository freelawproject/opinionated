The immigration judge determined that Pallapothula\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that CAT relief was unavailable because Pallapothula had not claimed that he would be tortured by Indian governmental authorities or with their acquiescence. Additionally, the immigration judge found, based on inconsistencies in Pallapothula\u2019s written statement and testimony, that Pallapothula was not credible. The immigration judge determined also that Pallapothula failed to present other evidence to corroborate his claim. Consequently, the immigration judge concluded that Pallapothula failed to demonstrate entitlement to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Pallapothula has briefed neither an asylum claim nor a CAT claim in this court. Consequently, he has abandoned those claims. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Additionally, we deny the petition for review of the denial of withholding of removal. We reject the contention that the immigration judge erred in finding Palla-pothula not credible. In making a credibility determination, the factfinder may consider, inter alia, \u201cthe inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements [and] any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) \u00a7 1281(b)(8)(C). Because an immigration judge \u201cmay rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an ... applicant is not credible,\u201d we must defer to that determination \u201cunless it is plain that no reasonable factfinder could make\u201d such a ruling. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">Pallapothula points to no basis for rejecting the IJ\u2019s determination that he was not credible. Pallapothula\u2019s conclusory assertions of truthfulness are insufficient. <em>Cf. Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 182 (5th Cir.1986). The inconsistencies in Pal-lapothula\u2019s statements and testimony concerning alleged attacks in 2006 and 2007 substantially support the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Dayo v. Holder, </em>687 F.3d 653, 657-58 (5th Cir.2012). Pallapo-thula has failed to demonstrate \u201cthat no reasonable factfinder could\u201d have deemed him incredible. <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">We conclude also that Pallapothula is not entitled to relief on his assertion that he was deprived of the chance to provide corroborating evidence of his claim of persecution by a terrorist group in India, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Naxalites. Pallapothula asserts that the immigration judge did not advise him of the need for corroboration. Pallapothula cites no precedent of this circuit that supports his contention that he should have been told by the IJ to present corroborating evidence. Moreover, the asylum form itself alerts an applicant to the need to attach documentation evidencing the specific facts on which his claim relies or to explain why such documentation cannot be produced. Also meritless is Pallapothula\u2019s suggestion that the IJ failed to provide an opportunity to rebut the facts; the IJ noted several times during the hearing that he believed there were discrepancies in Pallapothula\u2019s testimonial proof. Therefore, in addition to the opportunity provided by the asylum form, Pallapothula had a full hearing that allowed him the chance to make his case; all that Pallapothula and his counsel at the hearing had to do was present credible evidence. A tribunal need not make a litigant\u2019s case for him. <em>United States. v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Because Pallapothula fails to show error in the determination that he was not credible and fails to present corroborating evidence, he \u201cdoes not have enough evidence to show\u201d a clear probability of persecution and thus to be entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See Dayo, </em>687 F.3d at 657-59; <em>Campos-Guardado v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir.1987). Pallapothula consequently fails to demonstrate that he presented evidence \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d a clear probability of persecution. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 351 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
