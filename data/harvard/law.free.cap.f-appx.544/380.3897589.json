A review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict indicates that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson was guilty as charged. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>690 F.3d 358, 366 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Jara-Favela, </em>686 F.3d 289, 301 (5th Cir.2012). The evidence overwhelmingly established that Jackson, Lonnie Johnson, and numerous other coconspirators pooled their money to purchase kilograms of powder cocaine at a lower price from sources in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, including Benito Figueroa and Salvador Alvarez. Alvarez delivered the cocaine to Johnson and others at three stash houses. After Johnson, Jackson, and others obtained the powder cocaine, they used the houses on Jo Lyn Street to store it, convert it into crack cocaine, and sell it to their own individual customers. Although the evidence did not establish that Jackson personally knew the conspirators named in the indictment, the evidence established that he was aware that there were other participants in a large scale conspiracy in which numerous persons agreed to possess large quantities of cocaine with the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to distribute it as charged in the indictment. The Government was not required to prove that Jackson knew all the details of the objectives of the conspiracy or the identity of all coconspirators, as long as he knowingly participated in some fashion in the larger objectives of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>553 F.3d 768, 781 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>553 F.3d 380, 391 n. 4 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Next, Jackson argues that there was a material variance between the allegations of a single conspiracy in the indictment and the trial evidence which allegedly proved multiple conspiracies. He has not shown that there was a material variance between the indictment and the trial evidence as the evidence established Jackson\u2019s involvement in a single conspiracy with the common goal of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>46 F.3d 410, 414-15 (5th Cir.1995). The evidence established that there was a common scheme and continuous operation that required the actions of the suppliers as well as the purchasers, who then converted the powder cocaine to crack cocaine and distributed it to their customers. <em>See id. </em>Further, there were core participants, including Figueroa, Alvarez, and Johnson, who supplied cocaine to Jackson and others. <em>See id. </em>at 416. Moreover, because Jackson was tried alone, there was no danger of transference of guilt from one codefendant to another, and he cannot show any error under the rules of joinder and severance. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 770-71 (5th Cir.2007). Additionally, because the Government provided Jackson\u2019s counsel with the witnesses\u2019 debriefing statements, Jackson has not shown that any variance affected his substantial rights because he was not surprised by the witnesses\u2019 testimony concerning persons and dates not alleged in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Valencia, </em>600 F.3d 389, 432 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The remaining claims raised by Jackson are raised for the first time on appeal and therefore are reviewed for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, Jackson must demonstrate that the district court committed an error that was clear or obvious, and that affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">According to Jackson, the district court erred in admitting hearsay statements in the plea agreements. Because the plea agreements were not introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, they were not hearsay. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>967 F.2d 1032, 1035 (5th Cir.1992). The district court also instructed the jury that the accomplices\u2019 guilty pleas were not evidence of the guilt of any other person. Regardless, Jackson has not shown reversible plain error as he has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights in light of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Next, Jackson argues that the district court erred in not giving a jury instruction on the proper use of his cocon-spirators\u2019 plea agreements at the time they were admitted into evidence. The district court\u2019s failure to sua sponte give a limiting instruction when the plea agreements were admitted into evidence did not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 324 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s actual instruction fairly and adequately covered the issue presented. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 410 (5th Cir.2005). Jackson\u2019s reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>on <em>United States v. Harrell, </em>436 F.2d 606, 614 (5th Cir.1970), is misplaced as it is easily distinguished. Unlike in <em>Harrell, </em>the plea agreements were introduced to blunt their impact on the credibility of the witnesses, and the district court gave an instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the witnesses\u2019 guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In his next argument, Jackson contends that the admission of Agent Martinez\u2019s testimony concerning Lonnie Johnson\u2019s post-arrest statement violated the Confrontation Clause. Even if the admission of Agent Martinez\u2019s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, Jackson has not shown reversible plain error. In light of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, he has not shown a reasonable probability that but for the Confrontation Clause violation, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Rios, </em>595 F.3d 581, 587 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Jackson also argues that the district court erred in permitting the introduction of evidence of other similar crimes that occurred prior to the dates alleged in the indictment, in violation of Federal Rul\u00e9 of Evidence 404(b). The Government presented the evidence as direct evidence that the conspiracy and Jackson\u2019s involvement in it began before the date alleged in the indictment and continued through the date alleged in the indictment and within the five-year statute of limitations period. Because the evidence established that the conspiracy continued through the time stated in the indictment, the district court did not err in admitting it. <em>See United States v. Girod, </em>646 F.3d 304, 316 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Lokey, </em>945 F.2d 825, 832 (5th Cir.1991). Further, because the Government provided all of its witnesses\u2019 debriefing statements to Jackson, any variance between the dates in the indictment and the evidence did not affect his substantial rights because he was not surprised by the evidence. <em>See Valencia, </em>600 F.3d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Additionally, Jackson argues that the prosecutor made the following misstatements during closing argument: (1) Alvarez testified he dealt directly with Jackson after Johnson was arrested on murder charges, and (2) Rodgers testified that he and Jackson sold cocaine to each other. Because the statements at issue were an isolated, small portion of the overall closing argument, and because the evidence of Jackson\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not \u201ccast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See United States v. Gracia, </em>522 F.3d 597, 603 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Mendoza, </em>522 F.3d 482, 492 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Finally, Jackson argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in that he did not object to the introduction of Agent Martinez\u2019s testimony as a violation of the Confrontation Clause; he failed to discuss the defense with Jackson and failed to investigate information relevant to Jackson\u2019s defense, such as the credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses; and he failed to investigate the facts, interview witnesses, and seek independent tests of the alleged controlled substances. Because Jackson\u2019s ineffective assistance claims were not presented to the district court, we decline to review them at this time. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">In one sentence, Jackson states that the district court committed clear error in misapprehending its authority to grant a downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Jackson has abandoned this issue on appeal by failing to brief it adequately. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>States v. Green, </em>964 F.2d 365, 371 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
