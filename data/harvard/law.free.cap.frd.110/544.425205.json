Only four acknowledgments were completed and returned; six mailings came back undeliverable. Although the probability that the remaining. \u25a0 defendants received service is great, and the possibility, that any Grant partners are without knowledge of this litigation is very remote, the court nevertheless must find that service by mail alone is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The plaintiff relies upon <em>Morse v. Elmira Country Club, </em>752 F.2d 35 (2d Cir.1984). In <em>Morse, </em>however, that court was confronted with a case presenting a difficult situation involving an attempt to manipulate Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) in an effort to invoke a statute of limitations defense. The peculiar equitable considerations may well have affected that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">This court is not faced with the peculiar equities presented to the <em>Morse </em>court. Grant partners merely exercised an option provided for under Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In <em>Delta Steamships Lines, Inc. v. Albano, </em>768 F.2d 728, 730 (5th Cir.1985), the court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) is an integrated procedure for establishing and proving <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction as well as service of process and that the defendant\u2019s return and acknowledgment are an essential part of that procedure. It necessarily follows that the requirements of Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) must be fully satisfied if the benefits of the Rule are claimed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The Grant defendants having failed to acknowledge service of process within 20 days after mailing, the plaintiff thereby becomes obligated to effectuate service of process pursuant to Rule 4(d)(1) or (3) which detail the manner of personal, domiciliary and agency service of process. <em>Delta Steamships, Inc. v. Albano, Id.; Stranahan Gear Company, Inc. v. NL Industries, Inc., </em>102 F.R.D. 250 (E.D.Penn.1984); <em>Billy v. Ashland Oil, Inc., </em>102 F.R.D. 230 (W.D.Penn.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">Although the court cannot approve of the defendants\u2019 obvious disregard for the spirit of Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii), it believes itself powerless to hold otherwise. The court notes that the intent of Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) clearly counsels against the defendants\u2019 inaction. Until such time as the Rule is refined or \u00bfmended, however, this strategy will continue to frustrate both plaintiffs and the judiciary. Plaintiffs will be left to the remedy available to them under Rule 4(c)(2)(D), that is, reimbursement of the costs of personal service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">Accordingly, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the receiver\u2019s Motion for Determination as to Mail Service be and the same is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">It is further ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that service by mail alone is deemed insufficient to obtain personal jurisdiction over , the defendants absent their return of an acknowledgment of service as required by Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii). The receiver shall proceed with service of process pursuant to Rule 4(d)(1) or (d)(3).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\">. As mail service is not sufficient, the court need not address the defendants\u2019 contention that mail service is unavailable for out-of-state defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
