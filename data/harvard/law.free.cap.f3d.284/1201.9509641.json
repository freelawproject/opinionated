No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). We granted a certificate of appealability on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA_\">Whether the district court correctly determined that appellant\u2019s federal habeas corpus petition was untimely under the one-year statute of limitations provision in the [AEDPA].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">Bridges argues that the statute should have been tolled during the pendency of his application for sentence review under Georgia Code \u00a7 17-10-6, and therefore, that his federal habeas petition was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a petition for federal habeas corpus relief was time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). <em>See Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000). After thorough review of the pleadings, the record, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">The facts pertaining to the timeliness of Bridges\u2019s habeas petition are straightforward. Bridges pled guilty to terroristic threats, aggravated assault and stalking charges, and was sentenced to 26 years\u2019 imprisonment on November 21, 1996. He did not appeal his convictions and sentences, but he did request that his sentence be reviewed by a sentence review panel, pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6. He applied to the sentence review panel in December 1996, and the panel denied his application on June 13, 1997. On January 15, 1998, Bridges filed a state habeas petition that was ultimately denied by the Georgia Supreme Court on February 14, 2000. Bridges filed the instant federal habeas petition on March 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-9\">As the facts reveal, Bridges filed his initial habeas petition after applying to the state sentence review panel, and over one year after the date on which his judgment became final. As provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), his judgment became final on the date that the time for seeking direct review expired; this date was not affected by his application for sentence review, because an application for sentence review is not a part of the direct appeal process under Georgia law. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>247 Ga.App. 716, 716, 544 S.E.2d 541, 542 (2001) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201ca sentence review is a \u2018first appeal\u2019 as a matter of right\u201d); <em>see also Murphy v. Balkcom, </em>245 Ga. 13, 14, 262 S.E.2d 784, 785 (1980) (recognizing a distinction between an appeal as of right and an application to the sentence review panel). Accordingly, Bridges\u2019s judgment of conviction became final on December 21, 1996, the date on which his 30-day right to appeal the November 21, 1996 judgment expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-10\">Because he did not file for state habeas relief until over one year after his judgment of conviction became final, Bridges\u2019s petition for federal habeas relief would have been timely <em>only if </em>his application for sentence'review under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6 is the type of post-conviction remedy that tolls the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court has previously affirmed without opinion a district court\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>that an application for sentence review made pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6 does <em>not </em>toll the \u00a7 2244(d) statute of limitations, since an application for sentence review \u201cis not a mechanism for \u2018collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Young v. Head, </em>89 F.Supp.2d 1370, 1370 (N.D.Ga.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>247 F.3d 247 (11th Cir.2001) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">Indeed, recent Supreme Court precedent when read together with the applicable Georgia Code provisions strongly supports this conclusion. In <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 2127-28, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001), where the Supreme Court held that an application for federal habeas corpus review does not toll the \u00a7 2244(d) limitations period, the Court stated that the goals of the AEDPA provisions include: (1) ensuring \u201cthat the state courts have the opportunity fully to consider federal-law challenges to a state custodial judgment before the lower federal courts may entertain a collateral attack upon that judgment,\u201d and (2) serving \u201cthe well-recognized interest in the finality of state court judgments.\u201d The Court continued: \u201cThe tolling provision of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period,\u201d in that it allows only the filing of state habeas corpus petitions to toll the limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 2128. The sentence review process, under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6, however, does not qualify as state post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) because it does not promote exhaustion by giving state courts the opportunity to consider federal-law challenges to state court judgments, and it does not promote finality of state court judgments by reducing the time in which federal review is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">Adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, the district court dismissed Bridges\u2019s federal habeas petition as time-barred. Under the AEDPA, a one-year period of limitations applies to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by a person in state custody, and the limitations period begins to run from \u201cthe date on which the [state court] judgment [of conviction] became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). However, \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). In dismissing Bridges\u2019s habeas petition, the district court concluded that an application for sentence review under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6 is not \u201cpost-conviction or other collateral review\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and thus, does not toll the statute of limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">On the contrary, the Georgia Code provides that the sentence review panel\u2019s sole task is to determine whether the sentence or sentences are excessively harsh, based only on \u201cthe nature of the crime for which the defendant has been convicted and ... the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6(a). The statute also provides that sentence review is available only to those Georgia state prisoners who have been sentenced to more than 12 years in prison. <em>See id. </em>The statute further provides that the panel is not required to issue written opinions and may not increase or completely eliminate a sentence, and that a panel\u2019s decision is not reviewable. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 17-10-6(c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">Because the above provisions of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6 reveal that an application for sentence review is merely a means for comparing sentences to ensure accuracy, viewing it as a means to toll the limitations period would not enhance exhaustion of state review or finality of state court judgments. Therefore, we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>district court\u2019s conclusion that sentence review does not qualify under the statute as \u201cState post-conviction or other collateral review,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and does not toll the \u00a7 2244(d) limitations period. As the district court correctly observed, \u201csentence review is not an attack on the constitutionality or legal correctness of a sentence or judgment in contrast to a direct appeal or habeas action.\u201d <em>See also Young, </em>89 F.Supp.2d at 1370 (finding that an application for sentence review \u201cdoes not serve as the substitute for an appeal, habeas corpus proceeding, or extraordinary motion for new trial, and cannot serve as the forum to exhaust state court remedies for purposes of federal habeas corpus review\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">In short, we conclude that the district court properly determined that an application for sentence review does not affect a defendant\u2019s post-conviction remedies and thus does not toll the one-year limitations period, and that the district court properly found that Bridges\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1212-7\">. It is not disputed that the filing of a state habeas petition tolls the AEDPA statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). In this case, however, Bridges's state habeas petition was filed after the one-year limitation period for federal habeas relief had expired; as a result, the time during which the state courts reviewed his state habeas petition did not toll the federal limitations period. <em>See Webster v. Moore, </em>199 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.) (holding that a state court petition filed after the expiration of the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period cannot toll that period \u201cbecause there is no period remaining to be tolled\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 991, 121 S.Ct. 481, 148 L.Ed.2d 454 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">. Moreover, the Georgia Supreme Court has acknowledged that an application for sentence review is separate from a habeas corpus petition. <em>See Saleem v. Forrester, </em>262 Ga. 693, 694, 424 S.E.2d 623, 623 (1993) (\"[T]he exclusive means for seeking review of that sentence, after review by the sentence review panel and after direct appeal, is through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under the procedures set forth in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-40 <em>et seq.\").</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">. Bridges also argues that if this Court holds that an application for sentence review does not toll the AEDPA statute of limitations, then this rule should not be applied to him because that would constitute a retroactive application of new law, and more broadly, he argues that AEDPA should not be applied to him because it is an unsound law and an \"absurd\u201d limitation on the writ of habeas corpus. We find these arguments unpersuasive. First, the holding in this case does not involve a new rule of constitutional law, and thus its applicability to the instant case is without question. <em>See Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1075, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). Second, we have held that \"as a general matter, the \u00a7 2244(d) <em>limitations </em>period does not render the collateral relief ineffective or inadequate to test the legality of detention, and therefore is not an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Wyzykowski v. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 226 </em>F.3d 1213, 1217 (11th Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
