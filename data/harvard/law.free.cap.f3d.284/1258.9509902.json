In September 1997 Dominguez applied for lawful permanent status. That status was denied in March 2000, at which time removal proceedings were initiated. On September 19, 2000, notice to appear at the November 14, 2000 removal proceeding was mailed to Dominguez at a Jacksonville, North Carolina address. She does not deny that the address to which the notice was sent was the address which she had given the INS in her formal submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">Dominguez did not appear at the removal hearing, and was ordered removed in absentia on November 14, 2000. On November 24, 2000, she moved to reopen that decision, claiming that she had not received constitutionally sufficient notice. The court denied that motion, noting that she had no proof, other than an uncorroborated affidavit, that she did not receive notice. Dominguez appealed the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen her case to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA subsequently dismissed that appeal. It is from the BIA\u2019s dismissal that she now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen a deportation order for abuse of discretion. <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1276 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">Dominguez contends that the notice afforded her violated due process, and therefore the deportation order should be rescinded. The record reveals that written notice of the hearing was sent to the address most recently provided by Dominguez. Dominguez asserts, however, that the INS could have sent the notice to her sister, whose address she gave to INS agents during an oral interview in 1997. Supporting her assertion, Dominguez proffered a sheet allegedly coming from her INS file which she obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request; the sheet revealed a handwritten note as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvT\">staying with cousin'\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-11\">Staying in California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amv\">1608 Bragmont Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGA\">Cohena, CA 91722</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">Dominguez argues that this handwritten note should have been sufficient to put the INS on notice that they needed to send notice to another address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">We disagree. Due process is satisfied so long as the method of notice is conducted \u201cin a manner \u2018reasonably calculated\u2019 to ensure that notice reaches the alien\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1278, citing <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 318, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). The INS has a duty to provide written notice to those appearing before it in a hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1). Section 1229(a)(1) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-14\">In removal proceedings under section 1229a of this title, written notice (in this section referred to as a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d) shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or to the alien\u2019s counsel of record, if any) specifying the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-15\">(F)(i) The requirement that the alien must immediately provide (or have provided) the Attorney General with a written record of an address and telephone number (if any) at which the alien may be contacted respecting proceedings un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>der section 1229a of this title [removal proceedings].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-4\">(ii) The requirement that the alien must provide the Attorney General immediately with a written record of any change of the alien\u2019s address or telephone number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(c), the notice specified in \u00a7 1229(a) is effective if sent to the \u201clast address provided by the alien.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, an alien has an affirmative duty to provide the government with a correct address; under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the alien must notify the attorney general within ten days from the date of a change of address. <em>See also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Failing to provide the INS with a change of address will preclude the alien from claiming that the INS did not provide him or her with notice of a hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(5)(B) (\u201cNo written notice shall be required ... if the alien has failed to provide the address required under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">In addition to those clear statutory requirements, we also recognize the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d 733 (5th Cir.1995), in which that court held that notice sent to the alien\u2019s last known address satisfied due process, even though the alien argued that the INS could have easily notified his family. <em>Id. </em>at 736. As the Fifth Circuit recognized, it is the alien\u2019s statutory duty to notify the government of each change of address within ten days of the date of that change. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a). The Fifth Circuit concluded: the \u201cultimate fault lies with the Appellant for [her] failure to comply with a law that is essential to the administration of the INS.\u201d <em>Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-13\">The statute clearly provides that notice to the alien at the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice, and that there can be an in absentia removal after such notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is clear that the notice of the November 14, 2000 hearing was properly sent to the most recent address provided in writing by Dominguez pursuant to the foregoing statutory requirements. The handwritten note relied upon by Dominguez does not satisfy the statutory requirement that the notice be in writing. Moreover, the record does not support Dominguez\u2019s argument that the handwritten note proved even an informal notice to INS of her address as of the INS\u2019s September 19, 2000 notice to her scheduling the November 14, 2000 hearing. At best, the note merely suggested that Dominguez was staying at that California address at that particular time in November 1997, not that she was residing there; Dominguez\u2019s own assertion is that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>moved from her Jacksonville, North Carolina address in March 1999; also, there is no proof as to when the handwritten note was made a part of Dominguez\u2019s file, or if it was there as of September 2000; finally, the address on the handwritten note is different from the address in her notice of appeal. We readily conclude that Dominguez\u2019s due process argument is without merit. Her other arguments are rejected without need for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-9\">Service by mail under this section shall be sufficient if there is proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(F) of this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-11\">Each alien required to be registered under this subchapter who is within the United States shall notify the Attorney General in writing of each change of address and new address within ten days from the date of such change and furnish with such notice such additional information as the Attorney General may require by regulation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.1 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKg\">Except for those exempted by section 263(b) of the Act, all aliens in the United States required to register under section 262 of the Act shall report each change of address and new address within 10 days.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1270-16\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-17\">No written notice shall be required [in a removal proceeding] if the alien has failed to provide the address under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
