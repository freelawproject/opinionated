Three concurrent county jail sentences were ordered for a maximum of 60 days. He appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">His first contention is that there was no probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant which turned up the evidence on which he was convicted. The contention has been considered and is found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The affidavit upon which the search warrant was based was that of a peace officer; it was dated May 7, 1969, the same day on which the search warrant was later issued. In it the officer related that on May 7, 1969, a 13-year-old girl, Peggy, had given him the following information. She stated that four days earlier, May 3d, she and her 17-year-old sister went to the premises for which the search warrant was later sought. Upon entering, the sister asked defendant Delvin Young, \u201cWhere is the grass?\u201d Young then brought out a plastic bag containing what Peggy \u201cbelieved to be marijuana.\u201d Young then rolled some of the substance into three \u201chome-made cigarettes\u201d which were thereupon smoked by the sister, Young, and another man, Frank Spencer. The girl described \u201cthe odor of the substance that was being smoked and its general physical characteristics\u201d to the officer. Each of the other three persons told Peggy \u201cthat it was \u2018grass\u2019 \u201d they were smoking. All concerned then went out for an automobile ride on which more of the same type of cigarettes were made up and smoked and passed around the car. Frank Spencer \u201chad a baggie of marijuana on his lap\u201d from which such a cigarette was rolled. The officer\u2019s affidavit gave this additional information. Peggy\u2019s description to him of the substance she had seen and smelled made it \u201cappear that it was marijuana.\u201d The county sheriff\u2019s department for a couple of weeks had received \u201ccomplaints from the neighborhood ... to the following effect: Individuals that can be described as Hippies have been coming and going from that [described] house day and night.\u201d One such complaint stated that this traffic was \u201call hours of the day and night\u201d and that it included many young girls. Five men, including Frank Spencer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>known to frequent the premises were also known to be \u201cnarcotic users and/or dealers.\u201d Frank Spencer had three times been arrested for narcotic violations. Several narcotics users had previously told the officer \u201cthat their source of supply was Rocky Young\u201d (the defendant here).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\">We find the recitals of the officer\u2019s affidavit to be amply supportive of a reasonable belief that narcotics would probably be found in the described premises. We believe that Peggy\u2019s status was that of a \u201ccitizen informer\u201d whose testimony need not be corroborated. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 54, 55-58 [79 Cal.Rptr. 701]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>260 Cal.App. 2d 131, 137 [67 Cal.Rptr. 8] [cert. den. 393 U.S. 1039 (21 L.Ed.2d 586, 89 S.Ct. 663)]; <em>People v. Coleman, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 560, 564 [65 Cal.Rptr. 732].) Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that corroboration was required (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scoma, </em>71 Cal.2d 332, 338-339 [78 Cal.Rptr. 491, 455 P.2d 419]), the additional information known to the police adequately served that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The contention that \u201ca nighttime search was unauthorized by the warrant\u201d is also without merit. Young\u2019s argument here is that the magistrate did not \u201cinsert a direction in the warrant\u201d to authorize a night search as provided by Penal Code section 1533.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The subject search warrant, among other thing, commanded the officers to whom it was directed \u201cto make immediate search in the daytime <em>(at any time of the day or night, good cause being shown </em>therefor), etc.\u201d The parenthesized words were underlined by the magistrate who then initialed and dated the adjacent margin. The intent of the magistrate to allow a nighttime search was indicated, and the pertinent Penal Code provision was substantially complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Nor is merit seen in Young\u2019s final contention of error in allowing a laboratory technician, whose duties had to do with the testing and identification of dangerous drugs, to answer the question, \u201cNow, what is the effect of this particular type of drug?\u201d Young objected to the question \u201con the grounds he is not qualified as a doctor, he\u2019s only qualified as a chemist or physiologist,\u201d and as not being relevant to the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The first ground of objection is obviously unfounded. Few, if any, academic disciplines would be better qualified to discuss the effect of dangerous drugs on the human body, than that of physiology. The question was relevant to the issues before the jury; its answer would reasonably have some bearing on whether the subject drugs were \u201crestricted dangerous drugs\u201d the possession of which is proscribed by statute. And since the search uncovered about a \u201ccupfull\u201d of the substance which the jury could reasonably conclude was used by Young and his \u201cfurnishees,\u201d the subject matter of the criticized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>question reasonably related to Young\u2019s knowledge of the substance\u2019s character as a restricted dangerous drug\u2014a necessary element of one of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\">No contention was made at the trial, and none is made here, that the laboratory technician\u2019s answer was not reasonably responsive to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
