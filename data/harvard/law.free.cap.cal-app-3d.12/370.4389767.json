Plaintiffs appeal an order striking their second amended complaint in its entirety and a judgment dismissing their action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subd. 3 for failure to amend within the time allowed. This appeal is properly taken, for an appeal lies from an order striking an entire complaint <em>(Honan </em>v. <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co., </em>9 Cal.App.2d 675 [50 P.2d 1068]) and from a dismissal which constitutes a judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 58Id).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint in paragraph I refers to the first amended complaint, paragraphs I to VI, and includes \u201cthe whole thereof herein thereby.\u201d The first amended complaint in paragraph I refers to and includes the original complaint, paragraphs I to VIII, and also refers to and includes an amendment to the original complaint entitled \u201cAddendum to Complaint.\u201d Additionally, plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint in paragraph VI refers to paragraphs I to V of the same pleading and includes \u201cthe whole thereof herein thereby.\u201d As previously noted, paragraph I of the second amended complaint refers to the first amended complaint, which in turn refers to the original complaint and to the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ment to the original complaint. The trial court made the following order: \u201cThe Court . . , strikes the Second Amended Complaint in that it is improper for a pleading to refer to prior pleadings for substantial allegations or to incorporate them; each pleading must be complete in itself . . . Plaintiffs are granted twenty (20) days leave to file complete amended pleading.\u201d Plaintiffs did not amend. Instead, they moved that the trial court vacate its order \u201cas provided for by Section 473 C.C.P.\u201d The trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">Plaintiffs contend the trial court exceeded its power in striking the second amended complaint, since reference to prior pleadings \u201cis an accepted and approved manner of pleading,\u201d and consequently they have been wrongfully denied their day in court on the merits of their cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">There is authority for the proposition that a pleading <em>may </em>be valid even if it refers to prior pleadings. <em>(Ogier </em>v. <em>Pacific Oil &amp; Gas etc. Corp., </em>132 Cal.App.2d 496 [282 P.2d 574]; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>244 Cal.App.2d 650 [53 Cal.Rptr. 378].) However, it does not follow that a trial court cannot, in its discretion, require a party to write out his pleadings in full. In <em>Ogier, supra, </em>the original complaint contained 25 causes of action and was 24 pages long. The amended complaint incorporated the entire original complaint, only changing a single paragraph in the first 12 causes of action and another single paragraph in the next 12 causes of action. The court said: \u201cNo particular point would be gained by rewriting that complaint. It was perfectly obvious to court and counsel what was before the court. We can see no reason why the complaint as thus amended did not constitute a proper pleading.\u201d <em>(Ogier, supra, </em>at p. 499.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The situation here differs from <em>Ogier, </em>in that the trial court did not find it \u201cperfectly obvious . . . what was before the court.\u201d Averments from three prior pleadings were directly and indirectly incorporated by reference into a fourth. To clarify matters plaintiffs had only to write out a few extra pages in order to present their claims in a clear, straightforward manner and save the trial court from fumbling through four successive pleadings in an attempt to puzzle out plaintiffs\u2019 claims. For reasons which are not apparent to us plaintiffs chose to ignore the trial court\u2019s request to file a comprehensive pleading, a request communicated to them not only in the written order but also in two subsequent oral hearings. In refusing to comply with the trial court\u2019s request for a complete written pleading in one document, a request well within the bounds of the trial court\u2019s discretion, plaintiffs fell below minimum standards of compliance with court procedures required from litigants and their counsel and charted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>a course which can best be described as trifling with the court. In persisting in that course plaintiffs brought about their own denial of a hearing on the merits of their cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Roth, P. J., and Herndon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
