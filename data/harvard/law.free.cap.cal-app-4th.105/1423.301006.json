Wheeler guilty of first degree murder, attempted voluntary manslaughter, and discharge of a firearm at an inhabited dwelling. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 664, 192, subd. (a), 246.) He argues his wife\u2019s statement to him shortly before the murder that she committed adultery with the man whom he killed not long afterward was violative of the hearsay rule and insufficiently trustworthy to pass confrontation clause muster. In the published portion of our opinion, we will hold that the court properly admitted his wife\u2019s statement under the social interest exception to the hearsay rule and that the evidence was sufficiently trustworthy to satisfy the confrontation clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">The parties disagree whether the statutory denial of presentence custody credits to \u201cany person who is convicted of murder\u201d applies to the offender (entirely barring those credits) or only to the offense (allowing those credits on any offense other than murder). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2933.2.) In the published portion of our opinion, we will hold that Penal Code section 2933.2 applies to the offender not to the offense (entirely barring those credits). In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we will address other contentions of error and direct correction of the abstract of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">Three young men\u2014Ruben Sanchez (Ruben), his brother Jermaine Sanchez (Jermaine), and Eric Buckingham\u2014stepped out of the Sanchez home after Wheeler asked to speak to Ruben. Referring to his wife, Gracie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>Wheeler (Gracie), Wheeler asked, \u201cWhat do you know about Gracie?\u201d Gracie and Ruben had dated each other in high school. Jermaine said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know nothing about Gracie. Why don\u2019t you get out of here[?]\u201d After Jermaine said, \u201cNobody cares about [Gracie,]\u201d Wheeler lunged at him. Scared that Wheeler was about to hit him, Jermaine punched him twice in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Wheeler fell to the ground and got up with a firearm in his hand. Ruben, Jermaine, and Buckingham took off running. Wheeler fired three rounds toward the door through which Jermaine was running back inside. Buckingham saw Wheeler outside within an arm\u2019s length of Ruben. After Jermaine and Buckingham both heard three more shots, Buckingham saw Wheeler take off in his car and saw Ruben fall to the ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">I. <em>Statement Admitting Adultery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Anticipating Grade\u2019s invocation of her spousal privilege not to testify against Wheeler, both parties sought rulings in limine on the admissibility of her statement to Wheeler about her adultery with Ruben shortly before his murder. (\u00a7 970.) The prosecutor characterized her statement as admissible nonhearsay and, in the alternative, as admissible hearsay under the social interest exception. (\u00a7 1230.) Wheeler characterized her statement as inadmissible hearsay. (\u00a7 1200.) Once Gracie refused to testify, the court found her statement relevant as evidence of a motive to harm Ruben and admissible under the social interest exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">Wheeler argues Grade\u2019s statement to him about her adultery with Ruben shortly before his murder was violative of the hearsay rule and insufficiently trustworthy to pass confrontation clause muster. (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.) The Attorney General argues the court committed no statutory or constitutional error in admitting the statement under the social interest exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">Our analysis commences with the language of the statute: \u201cEvidence of a statement [1] <em>by a declarant having sufficient knowledge of the subject </em>is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule [2] <em>if the declarant is unavailable as a witness </em>and [3] <em>the statement, when made, </em>was so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far subjected [her] to the risk of civil or criminal liability, or so far tended to render invalid a claim by [her] against another, or <em>created such a risk of making [her] an object of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number><em>hatred, ridicule, or social disgrace in the community, that a reasonable [wo]man in [her] position would not have made the statement unless [s]he believed it to be true.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1230, italics added.) Wheeler agrees Grade\u2019s statement to Wheeler about her adultery with Ruben shortly before his murder gave her \u201csufficient knowledge of the subject\u201d to satisfy the first statutory requirement. He agrees her invocation of the spousal privilege satisfied the second statutory requirement since she was \u201cunavailable as a witness.\u201d He takes issue with the third statutory requirement, which requires that her \u201cstatement, when made, . . . created such a risk of making [her] an object of hatred, ridicule, or social disgrace in the community, that a reasonable [wo]man in [her] position would not have made the statement unless [s]he believed it to be true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">California is among a minority of jurisdictions that have either adopted by statute or embraced by case law the social interest exception. (See Note, <em>Sin, Suffering, and \u201cSocial Interest\u201d: A Hearsay Exception for Statements Subjecting the Hearsay Declarant to \u201cHatred, Ridicule, or Disgrace\u201d </em>(1985) 4 Rev. Litig. 367, fn. 4, 368, fh. 5 (hereafter <em>A Hearsay </em>Exception).) Even in jurisdictions that permit admission of statements against social interest, \u201clitigants and judges rarely invoke that theory as a basis for admitting hearsay testimony.\u201d (Imwinkelried, <em>Declarations Against Social Interest: The (Still) Embarrassingly Neglected Hearsay Exception </em>(1996) 69 So.Cal. L.Rev. 1427, 1431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">California adopted the social interest exception in 1965 as an integral part of the original Evidence Code. (\u00a7 1230; Stats. 1965, ch. 299, \u00a7 2, p. 1340.) The intent of the Law Revision Commission, which recommended legislative adoption of the new code, was to make the social interest exception \u201csufficiently broad\u201d to admit previously inadmissible statements about illegitimacy, pregnancy out of wedlock, and impotency <em>(A Hearsay Exception, supra, 4 </em>Rev. Litig. at p. 385, fn. 81): \u201cA man admits paternity of an illegitimate child; an unmarried woman states that she is pregnant; a man states that he is impotent. Professor McCormick refers to these statements as declarations against \u2018social interests.\u2019 Currently such declarations are usually excluded. Under the new rule they would be admitted\u2014in our opinion, wisely so.\u201d (Tentative Recommendation and A Study Relating to the Uniform Rules of Evidence (Aug. 1962) 4 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1963) p. 501, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">Implicit in Gracie\u2019s statement about adultery was a breach of trust conspicuously absent from illegitimacy, pregnancy out of wedlock (without reference to adultery), and impotency\u2014the three statements expressly within the contemplation of the Law Revision Commission in recommending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>admission of those statements under the social interest exception. Arguably the breach of trust that is implicit in adultery accounts in part for the \u201cstrong condemnation of adultery in all religions.\u201d (See The Oxford Diet, of World Religions (1997) p. 21 [defining \u201cadultery\u201d].) As one of numerous factors establishing who is and who is not \u201can object of. . . social disgrace in the community\u201d (\u00a7 1230), clerical disapprobation indubitably influences societal mores. A statement to one\u2019s spouse about adultery certainly runs no smaller risk, and arguably incurs a greater risk, of making the declarant an object of social disgrace than do any of the three statements the Law Revision Commission expressly intended the social interest exception to embrace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Since California Supreme Court authority guides us in the construction of statutory provisions, we turn to two cases adjudicating the applicability of the social interest exception to other kinds of statements. (See <em>Sacramento Police Officers Assn. v. Venegas </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 916, 924 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 666].) In the first case, <em>In re Weber </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 703 [114 Cal.Rptr. 429, 523 P.2d 229], a prison inmate who testified the petitioner solicited him to offer a bribe later told another inmate his testimony v/as perjury. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 711-712.) At a posttrial evidentiary hearing, the petitioner sought in vain to introduce the statement under the social interest exception after the inmate who heard the statement invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 712-713.) On the rationale that an admission of perjury might both impair and improve one\u2019s social standing in the inmate community, the Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of the statement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 722.) In the case at bar, on the other hand, nothing in the record suggests Gracie\u2019s statement about adultery could possibly have improved her social standing with anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">The Supreme Court grounded the holding in <em>Weber </em>not only on doctrine intrinsic to the social interest exception but also on two extrinsic rules of law. <em>(In re Weber, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 722.) Both of those rules derive from the \u201cvarious motives\u201d prison inmates may have \u201cfor making false statements, not the least of which is a possible desire to curry favor with the authorities.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>First, evidence of a witness\u2019s posttrial offer to retract sworn testimony is to be viewed with suspicion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Second, evidence that a fellow inmate heard a retraction is even more unworthy of belief. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the case at bar, on the other hand, no comparable extrinsic rules of law come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">In the second case, <em>People v. Lawley </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 102 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 38 P.3d 461], a prison inmate seeking full membership in the Aryan Brotherhood told another inmate that he killed the victim on a gang contract and-that an innocent person was in custody for the murder. <em>(Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>at pp. 151-155.) After the inmate who made the statement later invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused sought admission of the evidence under the social interest exception. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 155.) On the rationale that the intent of the inmate\u2019s statement could have been to enhance his own prestige or that of the Aryan Brotherhood, the Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit the evidence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We note again, as before, that nothing in the record in the case at bar suggests Gracie\u2019s statement about adultery could have improved her social standing with anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">In two cases decided before section 1230 took effect in 1967; we recognized the validity of the common law precursor to the social interest exception. In the first case, <em>People v. Parriera </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 275 [46 Cal.Rptr. 835], the issue was whether the accused shot his wife or whether she shot herself. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 277.) The trial court permitted two nurses to testify they heard her volunteer she shot herself. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 282.) The trial court \u201cseverely restricted\u201d the impact of that statement by limiting jury consideration to her credibility as a witness and by prohibiting jury consideration on the issue of her culpability as the shooter. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Noting that admissible hearsay evidence usually \u201chas a high degree of trustworthiness\u201d <em>(People v. Spriggs </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 868, 874 [36 Cal.Rptr. 841, 389 P.2d 377]), we held that to so limit the jury\u2019s consideration of that evidence was \u201cunjust\u201d since the wife\u2019s statement would \u201csubject her to odium.\u201d <em>(People v. Parriera, supra, </em>at pp. 284-285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">In the second case, <em>People v. Salcido </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 450 [54 Cal.Rptr. 820], the issue was whether the accused shot his girlfriend or whether she shot herself. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 457.) The trial court admitted the girlfriend\u2019s suicide threat. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The statement was not only probative of the identity of the shooter but also revelatory of her emotional instability and predisposition to self-destruction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 457-462.) In holding the statement admissible for the truth of the matter, we followed two murder cases from the late 19th and early 20th centuries on the general trustworthiness of like hearsay evidence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the late 19th-century case, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts ruled admissible the threat of the decedent\u2014a single pregnant woman\u2014to kill herself. <em>(Commonwealth v. Trefethen </em>(1892) 157 Mass. 180, 181-195 [31 N.E. 961, 961-967].) In the early 20th-century case, the Supreme Court of Missouri ruled admissible the decedent\u2019s threats\u2014\u201cas original evidence of the condition of the mind from which they spring\u201d\u2014to kill himself. <em>(State v. Ilgenfritz </em>(1915) 263 Mo. 615, 631-635 [173 S.W. 1041, 1045-1046].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">To the issue whether the court properly admitted Gracie\u2019s statement under the social interest exception to the hearsay rule, the parties agree the abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>of discretion standard of review applies. (See <em>People v. Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1252 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251], overruled on another ground <em>in People v. Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 834-835 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436].) By that standard, we hold that the court committed no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">Even if Gracie\u2019s statement satisfied the third statutory requirement, Wheeler argues the evidence lacked the trustworthiness necessary to pass confrontation clause muster. (U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.) As one of Shakespeare\u2019s characters warned, \u201c \u2018The purest treasure mortal times afford . . . [f] Is spotless reputations, that away, [f] Men are but [gilded] loam or painted clay.\u2019 \u201d <em>(A Hearsay Exception, supra, 4 </em>Rev. Litig. at p. 391, fn. omitted, quoting Shakespeare, Richard II, act I, scene 1.) The human hesitancy to blemish one\u2019s \u201c \u2018treasure [that] mortal times afford\u2019 \u201d creates the circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness that is implicit in the social interest exception. <em>(A Hearsay Exception, supra, </em>at p. 392, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">A case from another state that adopted by statute the social interest exception specifically adjudicated the impact on that \u201ctreasure\u201d of a spouse\u2019s statement about adultery. <em>(Muller v. State </em>(1980) 94 Wis.2d 450 [289 N.W.2d 570].) As in the case at bar, the cuckold in that case killed the paramour of the spouse who admitted adultery. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 453-464 [289 N.W.2d at pp. 572-577].) The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the spouse\u2019s statement at a civil deposition about adultery with her paramour satisfied the social interest exception since her own words \u201cmade her an \u2018object of disgrace.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 463 [289 N.W.2d at p. 577].) Noting the right to confrontation \u201c \u2018is not absolute,\u2019 \u201d the court found no confrontation clause violation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 463-464 [289 N.W.2d at pp. 577-578]; see <em>Barber v. Page </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 719, 722 [88 S.Ct. 1318, 1320-1321, 20 L.Ed.2d 255]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 742, 784 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">Although the statement in the case at bar occurred during a homicide investigation and not, as in <em>Muller, </em>during a civil deposition, the broad assumption is common to both that \u201c \u2018a person is unlikely to fabricate a statement against his [or her] own interest at the time it is made.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lilly v. Virginia </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 116, 126-127 [119 S.Ct. 1887, 1895, 144 L.Ed.2d 117], quoting <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 284, 299 [93 S.Ct. 1038, 1047-1048, 35 L.Ed.2d 297].)  Embracing penal, proprietaiy, and social interests alike, the general hearsay exception for declarations against interest is a \u201c \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 \u201d doctrine with the \u201c \u2018longstanding judicial and legislative experience\u2019 \u201d to ensure \u201c \u2018virtually any evidence\u2019 \u201d within its scope \u201c \u2018comports with the \u201csubstance of the constitutional protection.\u2019\u201d\u201d (Li<em>lly v. Virginia, supra, </em>at p. 126 [119 S.Ct. at p. 1895], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>quoting <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 805, 817 [110 S.Ct. 3139, 3147-3148, 111 L.Ed.2d 638], and <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 66 [100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597].) We note again, as before, that the common law roots of the social interest exception long predate the adoption of section 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">In the opinion of at least a plurality of the United States Supreme Court, appellate courts should independently review whether the government\u2019s proffered guarantees of the trustworthiness of a hearsay statement satisfy the confrontation clause. <em>(Lilly v. Virginia, supra, </em>527 U.S. at p. 136 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 1899-1900].)  To make the original determination whether a hearsay statement \u201cpasses the required threshold of trustworthiness,\u201d trial courts \u201c \u2018may take into account not just the words but the circumstances under which they were uttered, the possible motivation of the declarant, and the declarant\u2019s relationship to the defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 607 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].)  With no apparent motive to lie, Gracie made her statement about her relationship with the victim to her husband in a homicide investigation in which she was not a suspect. The intoxicated in-custody suspect in <em>Lilly, </em>on the other hand, trying to shift blame to other people in a homicide investigation, had every motive to lie. <em>(Lilly v. Virginia, supra, </em>at pp. 121-122 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 1893-1894].) The United States Supreme Court held that the admission of the suspect\u2019s statement in <em>Lilly </em>violated the confrontation clause. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 139 [119 S.Ct. at p. 1901].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">On the strikingly dissimilar circumstances in the case at bar, we hold that Gracie\u2019s statement was sufficiently trustworthy to satisfy the confrontation clause. In so holding, we review solely for abuse of discretion. (See <em>People v. Cudjo, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 607.) Even were we to engage in review de novo, we would still so hold. (See <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra, </em>527 U.S. at pp. 136-137 [119 S.Ct. at pp. 1899-1900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">II. <em>Possible Juror Misconduct</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">III. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">A. <em>Presentence conduct credit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">The Attorney General argues Penal Code section 2933.2 precludes the court\u2019s award of 100 days of presentence conduct credits, since Wheeler\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>count 1 conviction was for murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wheeler argues the court properly awarded those credits since his counts 2 and 3 convictions were for other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Penal Code section 2933.2 prohibits an award of presentence conduct credits to <em>\u201cany person </em>who is convicted of murder.\u201d (\u00a7 2933.2, subds.

By parity of reasoning, we hold that Penal Code section 2933.2 applies to the offender not to the offense and so limits a murderer\u2019s conduct credits irrespective of whether or not all his or her offenses were murder. (See <em>People v. Herrera </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1366-1367 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 793].)
