Plaintiff-appellant Zion Lavie appeals from the judgment against him and in favor of defendants-respondents Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (Procter &amp; Gamble), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Syntex Health Products, Inc. (Syntex), Procter-Syntex Health Products Company (Procter-Syntex), and others,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following a court trial upon appellant\u2019s action challenging television advertising supporting the launch of ProcterSyntex nonprescription pain reliever Aleve in the mid-1990\u2019s. Among other claims, appellant alleged the television advertising promoting Aleve violated the California unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200) (UCL) and this state\u2019s false advertising law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the explicit claim of the ads that \u201cAleve is gentler to the stomach lining than aspirin\u201d was false and/or likely to mislead members of the public and because the advertisements contained an implicit and false message that Aleve was gentle to the stomach and would not cause stomach upset. At the end of a 13-day bench trial, the trial court found in favor of respondents on all counts, including finding that respondents did not engage in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices or unfair, deceptive or misleading advertising within the meaning of section 17200 or 17500. The court found the substantial weight of the evidence supported the conclusion that the phrase \u201cAleve is gentler to your stomach lining than aspirin\u201d was a true statement and that the challenged ads were not likely to deceive reasonable consumers. The court also found that the ads did not target particularly gullible consumers and that the evidence did not show that a substantial number of consumers were deceived into thinking Aleve would not cause gastrointestinal side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Appellant contends the judgment must be reversed as the court erred: (1) in employing the wrong methodology in determining what messages were conveyed by the commercial, relying upon its own intuition rather than viewing the ads from the vantage point of a reasonable consumer; (2) by disregarding evidence showing the messages were misleading and unsupported by the medical data; and (3) by disregarding evidence that these messages were impressed upon a significant number of consumers and were therefore likely to deceive the public. Appellant also contends that the evidence established defendants\u2019 conscious decision to communicate implied messages they knew would mislead many California consumers, and that such was an unfair business practice under section 17200. Finally, he argues that if the matter is reversed, the trial court on remand has discretion to enter restitution relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Attorney General has filed an amicus curiae brief in this appeal, contending the likelihood of deception under the UCL must be measured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the standard of the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d and that the trial court erred in using a \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard to determine whether the advertisements were likely to deceive the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em>The </em>lawsuit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In June 1994, Aleve was brought to the market as a new addition to over-the-counter pain relief products. Appellant, aged 47, is a computer programmer and manager. He testified that he took Aleve in mid-December 1994 for relief of cold symptoms. Twelve years before, he had been diagnosed with an ulcer and his doctor had told him to avoid aspirin. The ulcer had been inactive. Appellant decided to try Aleve after seeing some newspaper and television ads. He took Aleve over the weekend and on the following Monday was hospitalized overnight with serious gastrointestinal bleeding. His doctor told him not to use Aleve and appellant presented evidence the bleeding was caused by his ingestion of Aleve.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Appellant wrote to Procter &amp; Gamble about his problem, stating he believed the company should be working on revising its warning label. Procter &amp; Gamble responded by offering him his purchase price plus interest and requesting the name of his doctor, so the matter could be looked into. Plaintiff did not accept return of the purchase price. He sued respondents on various claims centering on the allegation that the television advertising for Aleve was false, misleading and/or likely to mislead. He asserted claims both individually and on behalf of the general public for violation of the UCL (\u00a7 17200 et seq.) and the false advertising act (\u00a7 17500). He also asserted claims for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.). Although he eventually waived any claims for personal injury, appellant sought restitution for himself and the general public with respect to his UCL and false advertising claims in the amount of all sales of Aleve to customers in California (a sum ranging from approximately $104 million to $140 million) and injunctive relief in the form of corrective advertising. Appellant also sought actual and punitive damages under his common law and Consumers Legal Remedies Act claims. Finally, he sought to have any monetary relief awarded under the UCL or the Consumers Legal Remedies Act enhanced up to treble the amount awarded pursuant to Civil Code section 3345.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">At the end of a 13-day bench trial, the Honorable Isabella H. Grant found against appellant and in favor of respondents on all claims, including finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that defendants did not engage in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices or unfair, deceptive or misleading advertising within the meaning of section 17200 or 17500. Judgment was entered on October 11, 2000, and this timely appeal followed. Appellant challenges the judgment against him on his UCL and false advertising claims only.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">I. <em>California laws prohibiting unfair competition (\u00a7 17200 et seq.) and false advertising (\u00a7 17500).</em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">II. <em>\u201cReasonable consumer\u201d versus \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">A. <em>Amicus curiae brief raising issue of the standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In an amicus curiae brief filed in this appeal, the Attorney General argues that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to use a \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard rather than a \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard to determine whether the advertisements were likely to mislead or deceive the public. It is analytically necessary to address this issue first, for if we agreed with the Attorney General, the additional issues raised on this appeal likely would be rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Both parties and the trial court agreed below that the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard applied and appellant did not raise this claim of error on appeal.  Ordinarily, \u201c[a]micus curiae must take the case as they find it.\u201d <em>California Assn. for Safety Education v. Brown </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1274-1275 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 404]; accord, Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 2001) \u00b6 9:210.1 (rev. #1 2002).) \u201c1 \u201c[A]n appellate court will consider only those questions properly raised by the appealing parties. Amicus curiae must accept the issues made and propositions urged by the appealing parties, and any additional questions presented in a brief filed by an amicus curiae will not be considered [citations].\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Younger </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 806, 813-814 [187 Cal.Rptr. 310]; see <em>Fisher v. City of Berkeley </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 644, 711, fn. 1 [209 Cal.Rptr. 682, 693 P.2d 261] (conc. opn. of Bird, C. J.); <em>E.L. White, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 497, 510-511 [146 Cal.Rptr. 614, 579 P.2d 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>However, the rule is not absolute. An appellate court has discretion to consider new issues raised by an amicus. (See <em>Fisher v. City of Berkeley, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 644, 654-655 [Supreme Court considered argument for invalidating rent control ordinance raised by amicus curiae]; <em>E.L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington Beach, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 497, 510-511; Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 9:210.1 (rev. #1 2002).) Although we do not depart lightly from the general rule, we are persuaded that this case is one in which it is not only permissible, but also appropriate to do so. The Supreme Court has justified consideration of a new issue on appeal for the first time \u201cwhen the issue posed is purely a question of law based on undisputed facts, and involves important questions of public policy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fisher v. City of Berkeley, supra, </em>at pp. 654-655, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The standard to be used in evaluating whether an advertisement is deceptive under the UCL is purely a question of law and certainly has important public policy implications for California consumers and businesses. Moreover, the Attorney General has a particular interest in the interpretation of sections 17200 and 17500, as these sections \u201care the basic tools of the Attorney General and the district attorneys in combating consumer fraud.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Olson) </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 181, 189, fn. 6 [157 Cal.Rptr. 628]; see also <em>Manufacturers Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 257, 275, fn. 8 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 220, 895 P.2d 56].) The Attorney General and district attorneys have an independent role in the enforcement of this state\u2019s false advertising laws. They are authorized to prosecute violations of the UCL criminally (see \u00a7 17500) and may also seek redress through the bringing of civil law enforcement cases seeking equitable relief and civil penalties beyond those available to private parties (see \u00a7\u00a7 17203, 17206, 17535, 17536). The' possibility that a published decision could contain a misstatement of law as to a fundamental provision of these statutes is a cause of particular concern to the Attorney General. The Legislature has recognized the importance of amicus curiae participation by the Attorney General in these appeals by requiring that the Attorney General and the district attorney of the county in which the proceeding occurred receive notice and copies of the briefs in any appeal in which sections 17200 and 17500 are at issue. (\u00a7\u00a7 17209, 17536.5; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 15(e)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Finally, the question of the standard to be applied in determining whether the advertisements here violated the UCL is inherent in this case. If, as the Attorney General argues, the parties and the trial court applied an erroneous standard, a rule of decision relying upon that incorrect standard could have profound precedential impact on the operation and enforcement of the UCL. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>For all of these reasons, we exercise our discretion to consider the question raised by the Attorney General.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">B. <em>\u201cReasonable consumer\u201d or \u201cleast sophisticated consumer. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Attorney General contends that the trial court must apply a \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard in determining whether an advertisement was likely to mislead the public. In a lengthy discussion of the origins of the UCL, he argues that California\u2019s deceptive advertising law has always prohibited advertising that has the capacity or tendency to mislead members of the public, including the unwary, unsophisticated, and the gullible. Asserting that an advertisement violates the law if it is false or if it has the capacity to mislead unwary, unsophisticated or the most gullible consumers, the Attorney General maintains, the \u201ctrial court\u2019s failure to apply the \u2018least sophisticated consumer\u2019 standard as the measure of deception and the court\u2019s imposition of responsibility on consumers to investigate the merits of advertising claims were error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We disagree. California and federal courts applying the UCL have never applied a \u201cleast sophisticated consumer standard,\u201d absent evidence that the ad targeted particularly vulnerable customers. Rather, they have consistently applied a standard closer to an ordinary or \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard to evaluate unfair advertising claims. Nor do we view the court\u2019s application of the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard as requiring consumers to investigate the merits of advertising claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">As a necessary corollary to his argument, the Attorney General urges that we reject <em>Freeman v. Time, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 68 F.3d 285 <em>(Freeman) </em>and <em>Haskell v. Time, Inc. </em>(E.D.Cal. 1994) 857 F.Supp. 1392 <em>(Haskell), </em>as well as other federal decisions which have concluded that California employs the reasonable person or reasonable consumer standard in evaluating deceptive advertising. In <em>Freeman, </em>the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court in <em>Haskell </em>that the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard was the appropriate test for a violation of the UCL. Recognizing that to state a claim under the UCL \u201cone need only show that \u2018members of the public are likely to be deceived\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th. at p. 1267, quoting <em>Chern </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 866, 876 [127 Cal.Rptr. 110, 544 P.2d 1310]), <em>Freeman </em>rejected the contention that to so demonstrate, the plaintiff \u201cneed show only that some members of the public, such as the elderly, minors or the mentally disadvantaged are likely to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>deceived.\u201d <em>(Freeman, </em>at p. 289.) Rather, the court adopted the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard championed in <em>Haskell </em>and variants thereof applied in other cases. <em>(Ibid., </em>also citing <em>State Bd. of Funeral Directors v. Mortuary in Westminster Memorial Park </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 638, 642 [76 Cal.Rptr. 832] [\u201c[w]hat a person of ordinary intelligence would imply\u201d from ads in a \u00a7 17500 false advertising case]; <em>Audio Fidelity, Inc. </em>v. <em>High Fidelity Recordings, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1960) 283 F.2d 551, 557 [applying \u201cthe eye of the ordinary purchaser\u201d standard to interpretation of California\u2019s unfair competition and misleading advertising law with respect to a similarly designed package claim].) <em>Freeman </em>reasoned that the \u201cordinary person\u201d standard was consistent with the standard articulated in <em>Bank of the West v. Superior </em>Court,\u2014whether members of the public are \u201clikely\u201d to be deceived. <em>(Freeman, supra, </em>at p. 289.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Both <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Haskell </em>pointed out that the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard was the common standard in the law in a number of contexts involving claims of deception and that it is the standard the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) uses in interpreting section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1)), which contains similar provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As <em>Haskell </em>observed, \u201c[T]he reasonable person standard is well ensconced in the law in a variety of legal contexts in which a claim of deception is brought. It is the standard for false advertising and unfair competition under the Lanham Act, [citations], for securities fraud [citation], for deceit and misrepresentation [citations] and for common law unfair competition [citation]. This list no doubt could be much expanded. Section 17500 of the Business and Professions Code, on which plaintiff proceeds, in no way expressly departs from the \u2018reasonable person\u2019 standard so well rooted in the law. . . . Indeed, by explicitly imposing a \u2018reasonable care\u2019 standard on advertisers, \u00a7 17500 impliedly adopts such a standard for consumers as well: unless particularly gullible consumers are targeted, a reasonable person may expect others to behave reasonably well. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Haskell, supra, </em>857 F.Supp. at pp. 1398-1399; accord, <em>Freeman, supra, </em>68 F.3d at p. 289.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>Haskell </em>also relied upon the FTC\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Trade Commission Act because of the relationship between the UCL and the federal act.  \u201c[T]he Unfair Business Practices Act is one \u2018of the so-called \u201clittle FTC Acts\u201d of the 1930\u2019s, enacted by many states in the wake of amendments to the Federal Trade Commission Act enlarging the commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction to include unfair business practices that harmed, not merely the interests of business competitors, but of the general public as well.\u2019 <em>Rubin v. Green </em>[(1993)] 4 Cal.4th 1187 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 847 P.2d 1044] . . . . See <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, [supra], </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Cal.4th 1254 . . . . Because of this relationship between the [UCL] and the Federal Trade Commission Act, judicial interpretations of the federal act have persuasive force. [Citations.] Since 1982 the FTC has interpreted \u2018deception\u2019 in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to require a showing of \u2018potential deception of \u201cconsumers acting reasonably in the circumstances,\u201d not just any consumers.\u2019 <em>Southwest Sunsites, Inc. </em>v. <em>F.T.C., </em>785 F.2d 1431, 1436 (9th Cir.1986) relying on <em>Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., </em>3 CCH Trade Reg.Rep. \u00b6 22,137, 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984).\u201d <em>(Haskell, supra, </em>857 F.Supp. at p. 1399.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We agree with the <em>Haskell </em>court that a reasonable consumer may be unwary or trusting. Where advertising is aimed at a particularly susceptible audience, such as the preschool children targeted by the advertisements in <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 693 P.2d 660], its truthfulness must be measured by the impact it will likely have on members of that group, not others to whom it was not primarily directed. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 214; <em>In the Matter of Kirchner </em>(1963) 63 F.T.C. 1282 [1983 FTC Lexis 71].) We also recognize that an advertisement may be designed to appeal to specific groups of consumers, although it is ostensibly directed to the public at large. Where the plaintiff contends that a more vulnerable subgroup is the true target of such an advertisement, a question of fact is presented, which the trial court must resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">However, unless the advertisement targets a particular disadvantaged or vulnerable group, it is judged by the effect it would have on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>reasonable consumer. <em>(Haskell, supra, </em>857 F.Supp. at p. 1399.) As noted by the FTC many years ago: \u201cPerhaps a few misguided souls believe, for example, that all \u2018Danish pastry\u2019 is made in Denmark. Is it, therefore, an actionable deception to advertise \u2018Danish pastry\u2019 when it is made in this country? Of course not. A representation does not become \u2018false and deceptive\u2019 merely because it will be unreasonably misunderstood by an insignificant and unrepresentative segment of the class of persons to whom the representation is addressed.\u201d <em>(In the Matter of Kirchner, supra, </em>63 F.T.C. at p. 1282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Federal courts have followed <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Haskell </em>in adopting the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard for California UCL claims: (See <em>Southwest Sunsites, Inc. v. F.T.C., supra, </em>785 F.2d 1431; <em>Churchill Village, L.L.C. v. General Elec. Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2000) 169 F.Supp.2d 1119, 1131 [\u201cA reasonable consumer standard applies to a false advertising claim under the UCL.\u201d]; <em>Cairns v. Franklin Mint Co. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1998) 24 F.Supp.2d 1013, 1037 [\u201cTo state a claim under [sections 17200 and 17500 et seq.], one need only show that \u2018members of the public are likely to be deceived.\u2019 [Citation.] A claim based on false or misleading advertising and unfair business practices \u2018must be evaluated from the vantage of a reasonable consumer.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Attorney General contends the FTC\u2019s reinterpretation of the Federal Trade Commission Act should not affect what the Attorney General characterizes as the traditional interpretation of the UCL by California courts. We disagree. FTC interpretation of the federal act has always been viewed as \u201cmore than ordinarily persuasive\u201d (e.g., <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 186 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527]; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1263-1264) in its construction of the breadth of the protection afforded consumers under the UCL and we see no good reason to depart from that view here. More importantly, we believe that California case law has never embraced a \u201cleast sophisticated consumer test\u201d to determine whether a UCL violation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The California Supreme Court recognized the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard in <em>Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 960 P.2d 513]. There, prospective sellers of real property sued a title insurer who refused to issue title insurance policies on property acquired by plaintiffs at a tax sale, despite the company\u2019s representation that title insurance would be issued on any property with good title. The Supreme Court held, among other things, that the plaintiffs had stated a cause of action for unfair competition under the UCL. \u201cIf plaintiffs are able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>to establish that a tax deed is \u2018good\u2019 title within the understanding of a reasonable consumer, </em>the advertisement may be conduct prohibited as unfair competition under the section 17200 definition as \u2018deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 55, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Other California cases, while not specifically referring to the reasonableness of the consumer, acknowledge that the standard to be applied in assessing whether the conduct or advertisement violates the UCL is whether it is \u201clikely to deceive\u201d the consumer. <em>(Barquis </em>v. <em>Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 111 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817]; <em>Schnall </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1167-1169 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 439]; <em>AICCO Inc. v. Ins. Co. of North America </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 579, 588 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 359]; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1105 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 229], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v.

Rather, the phrase indicates that the ad is such that it is probable that a significant portion of the general consuming public or of targeted consumers, acting reasonably in the circumstances, could be misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">As <em>Haskell </em>noted, \u201cThe statement in some of the case law to the effect that \u00a7 17500 protects \u2018unwary consumers\u2019 is only descriptive of the effect of \u00a7 17500 and does not set the standard for liability. The reasonable consumer may well be unwary. The use of this language does not suggest that the Act protects the unwary, unreasonable consumer. Nor do statements that the Act protects the \u2018public as a whole\u2019 suggest a different standard from the average or reasonable member of the public. <em>See Sunset House Distrib.

Rather, most of the cases cited by the Attorney General stand for the proposition that whether an advertisement or business practice violates the UCL is <em>not </em>measured by the perception of the <em>most </em>sophisticated, wary, or expert consumer, but by the likely effect on the normally credulous consumer. The Attorney General\u2019s error is his equating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of the rejection of a standard requiring heightened consumer vigilance with the adoption of a \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard.

Read Magazine </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 178, 189 [68 S.Ct. 591, 597, 92 L.Ed. 628], which did not arise under the Federal Trade Commission Act, but which is extensively quoted and relied upon by the Attorney General, involved a challenge to an order by the United States Postmaster finding plaintiffs had used the mail to further a fraudulent scheme and directing that mail be returned to the senders marked \u201cFraudulent,\u201d and that postal money order sums be returned. The Supreme Court articulated a standard more like the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard than the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard posited by the Attorney General, as the court explained that an advertisement may be literally true, but nonetheless misleading to the ordinary reader:  \u201cAdvertisements as a whole may be completely misleading although every sentence separately considered is literally true. This may be because things are omitted that should be said, or because advertisements are composed or purposefully printed in such way as to mislead. [Citations.] That exceptionally acute and sophisticated readers might have been able by penetrating analysis to have deciphered the true nature of the contest\u2019s terms is not sufficient to bar findings of fraud by a factfinding tribunal. Questions of fraud may be <em>determined in the light of the effect advertisements would most probably produce on ordinary minds. </em>[Citations.] People have a right to assume that fraudulent advertising traps will not be laid to ensnare them. \u2018Laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 188-189 [68 S.Ct. at p. 597], italics added; see also <em>Trade Comm\u2019n v.

Nor need a reasonable consumer necessarily be wary or suspicious of advertising claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Nor is it the case, as suggested by the Attorney General, that California appellate cases predating <em>Cliffdale Associates, Inc., </em>particularly <em>People </em>v. <em>Wahl </em>(1940) 39 Cal.App.2d Supp. 771 [100 P.2d 550] and <em>Dept, of Agriculture </em>v. <em>Tide Oil Co. </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 145 [74 Cal.Rptr. 799], recognized the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard. Rather, California courts consistently have looked to the ordinary consumer within the target population.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">As stated in <em>People v. Wahl, supra, 39 </em>Cal.App.2d Supp. 771, 774: \u201cThe advertisement, although literally true, was nevertheless deceptive and misleading in its implications and this is sufficient to bring it under the ban of the statute.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> The fact that a Firestone dealer, or other person who knew the whole truth, would not be led astray by it does not make it lawful. None of the advertising described in the statute, even though utterly false, could harm one who knew the truth, but such laws are passed to protect the general public who read advertisements and are likely to know nothing of the facts, not the dealers who publish them or other experts on their subject-matter.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. <em>113-11 A)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In <em>Dept, of Agriculture </em>v. <em>Tide Oil Co., supra, </em>269 Cal.App.2d 145, the appellate court acknowledged that advertising signs which stated, \u201c \u2018We Give 2[cent] a Gal. Cash Disc. Coupon,\u2019 or variations of similar phraseology\u201d came within the scope of [former] section 20880, subdivisions (b) and (c) prohibiting certain advertising practices by service stations, as the signs could be read to refer to a designated numerical discount per gallon in cash. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 154-155.) \u201cWhile a sophisticated buyer may not attribute such meaning to the advertisement, it is within the regulatory ambit of the Legislature to protect the more gullible public.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 155, fh. omitted.) The Attorney General erroneously construes this sentence to mean that the Legislature intended to protect members of the public \u201cmore gullible\u201d than ordinary members of the public. We think the sentence merely embodies the idea that the general public is \u201cmore gullible\u201d than the \u201csophisticated buyer.\u201d This interpretation is confirmed by an accompanying footnote, in which the court quoted from the holding in <em>Donaldson v. Read Magazine, supra, 33 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>U.S. 178, that \u201c \u2018Questions of fraud may be determined in the light of the effect advertisements <em>would most probably produce on ordinary minds. </em>[Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dept. of Agriculture v.

Bank of America, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 866, the court held that the practice of quoting a per annum rate of interest computed on the basis of a 360-day year was likely to mislead a bank\u2019s potential customers, and that such practice could be enjoined as false and misleading advertising under the false advertising law and the UCL. (\u00a7\u00a7 17500, 17535; [former] Civ. Code \u00a7 3369, subd. 2 [now contained in \u00a7 17200 et seq.].) <em>(Chern, </em>atpp. 876-877.) \u201cIn the absence of evidence to the contrary,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cwe must assume that the public is <em>likely to understand </em>that a \u2018per annum\u2019 rate is an annual rate based on a 365-day calendar year. The fact that it may be \u2018customary\u2019 business practice within the banking community to quote interest rates on the basis of a 360-day year does not necessarily establish that the practice is not misleading to the general public with whom defendant deals.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In <em>South Bay Chevrolet </em>v. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp., supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 861, a case involving sophisticated businesses in an ongoing relationship, rather than the consuming public as a whole, the plaintiff auto dealership contended that General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC)\u2019s business practice of using a similar method to calculate interest on loans to California dealerships violated sections 17200 and 17500 as a matter of law. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove GMAC\u2019s use of the 365/360 method to calculate interest on wholesale floor plan loans violated section 17200 because the dealership knew, understood, and agreed to that method of interest calculation. Analyzing the issue, the court applied the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard: \u201cThe trial court correctly noted that to recover under section 17200, South Bay had the burden to establish GMAC\u2019s conduct was unlawful, unfair, fraudulent or in violation of section 17500. <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court </em>[(1996)] 45 Cal.App.4th [1093,] 1102 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 229].) The trial court also correctly noted that to recover under the third or fourth prong of section 17200, South Bay had the burden to establish GMAC engaged in a business practice <em>\u2018likely to deceive\u2019 the reasonable consumer to whom the practice was directed. (Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1267; <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp., supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 211; <em>Chern </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Bank of America, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 876.)\u201d <em>(South Bay Chevrolet, </em>at p. 878, italics added.) <em>South Bay </em>was a case involving loans made to \u201ca financially sophisticated automotive dealership with knowledge of the lender\u2019s use of the 365/360 method in the parties\u2019 ongoing relationship.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 883.) Because the practice was directed to automobile dealerships and not to the general public, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s use of a \u201creasonable dealership\u201d standard, distinguishing <em>Chern </em>as a case directed toward the consuming public, (/\u00bf/. at p. 884.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Read together, <em>Chern v. Bank of America, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 866 and <em>South Bay Chevrolet </em>v. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp., supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 861, support our conclusion that the standard applied in UCL and false advertising cases is that of the ordinary consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances. Where the advertising or practice is targeted to a particular group or type of consumers, either more sophisticated or less sophisticated than the ordinary consumer, the question whether it is misleading to the public will be viewed from the vantage point of members of the targeted group, not others to whom it is not primarily directed. (See <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp., supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 197.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">That the parties, who were represented by very capable counsel, accepted the reasonableness standard applied by the trial court reflects how well-established the reasonableness standard is in California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Nor are we persuaded by the Attorney General\u2019s argument that federal courts have continued to apply the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard in non-FTC cases, such as those arising under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 et seq.), prohibiting debt collectors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>from using \u201cany false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means\u201d to collect a debt. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e.) Cases arising under the federal debt collection statutes are inapposite. Even the Ninth Circuit, which recognized the \u201creasonable\u201d consumer standard for cases arising under the UCL in <em>Freeman, </em>agreed that a \u201cleast sophisticated debtor standard\u201d applied under the plain language of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. (See <em>Swanson v. Southern Oregon Credit Service, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 869 F.2d 1222, 1227.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the extent federal law provides the template for our analysis, we look to the Federal Trade Commission Act, not to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The trial court did not err in assessing UCL and unfair advertising claims using a reasonable consumer standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">III., IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff had failed to show the commercials were likely to deceive members of the public, and that the commercials at issue were neither deceptive nor misleading under the UCL or the false advertising law.

That representations were made justifying this belief; that the plan was outlined in letters going directly from the companies; that men and women were deceived by them\u2014there can be little doubt. Certainly the Commission was justified from the evidence in finding that customers were misled. <em>Testimony in the record from citizens of ten states\u2014teachers, doctors, college professors, club women, business men\u2014proves beyond doubt that the practice was not only the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>commonly accepted sales method for respondents\u2019 encyclopedias, but that it successfully deceived and deluded its victims.\u201d (Trade Comm\u2019n v.

Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra, </em>20 Cal.4th 163, the California Supreme Court turned to section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act for guidance in formulating a more precise test for determining what is \u201cunfair\u201d under the \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d prohibition of the UCL governing injuries to competitors. The court did <em>not </em>expressly adopt the federal test for injury to <em>consumers. </em>(Cel-Tech, at p. 185.) However, the willingness of the court to follow the federal lead in defining \u201cunfairness\u201d under the UCL for competitors indicates the court would also follow the federal lead in determining the standard for unfairness relating to consumers, absent clear language in the statute or in case law refusing to do so. For example, California law clearly rejects incorporation of a reliance or damages requirement into the UCL. (E.g., <em>Day v. AT&amp;T Corp., supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th 325, 334; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1105; <em>AICCO, Inc. v.

But, as we have explained, California law has consistently measured whether an advertisement or practice is \u201clikely to mislead\u201d the consuming public by the ordinary consumer\u2014a standard which implies not sophistication or wariness, but reasonableness in the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\"> Moreover, even courts under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act have applied a somewhat modified test, employing the term \u201c \u2018unsophisticated,\u2019 instead of the phrase, \u2018least sophisticated,\u2019 to describe the hypothetical consumer whose reasonable perceptions will be used to determine if collection messages are deceptive or misleading.\u201d <em>(Gammon </em>v. <em>GC Services Ltd.

As stated by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals: \u201c[W]e believe that a modification of the least sophisticated consumer standard as articulated in cases such as <em>Clomon </em>[v. <em>Jackson </em>(2d Cir. 1993) 988 F.2d 1314,] would relieve the incongruity between what the standard would entail if read literally, and the way courts have interpreted the standard. [^[] It strikes us virtually impossible to analyze a debt collection letter based on the reasonable interpretations of the least sophisticated consumer. Literally, the least sophisticated consumer is not merely \u2018below average,\u2019 he is the very last rung on the sophistication ladder. Stated another way, he is the single most unsophisticated consumer who exists. Even assuming that he would be willing to do so, such a consumer would likely not be able to read a collection notice with care (or at all), let alone interpret it in a reasonable fashion. Courts which use the \u2018least sophisticated consumer\u2019 test, however, routinely blend in the element of reasonableness. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gammon v. GC Services Ltd.

First of all, and certainly most importantly, it effectively asks us to not only create new law but to do so in direct contradiction of precedent from our own Supreme Court. As the majority notes, that court has stated that the test under Business and Professions Code section 17200 is whether a \u201creasonable consumer\u201d would have been misled. (See <em>Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 55 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 960 P.2d 513].) As I am sure the Attorney General\u2019s Office understands, we are required to follows applicable precedent from our Supreme Court. (See <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Second, and aside from our mandate to follow binding precedent, the Attorney General essentially asks us to become <em>the only court </em>to hold that a violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 is evaluated by whether the representation may impact on the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer.\u201d As the majority opinion points out, every other court that has considered that issue has declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Third and finally, the position adopted in those cases is consistent with common sense; the Attorney General\u2019s position is not. That position would, I suggest, allow a Business and Professions Code section 17200 cause of action to the consumer who interprets literally the radio ads saying \u201cAlbert-son\u2019s is <em>your </em>store\u201d and goes to court when he is not given access to his local store\u2019s daily receipts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
