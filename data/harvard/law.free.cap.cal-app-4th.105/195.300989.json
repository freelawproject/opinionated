Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a)) and of unlawfully taking a vehicle. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a).) For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the judgment as to the felony evading count and remand for resentencing on the remaining count.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Facts and Procedural History<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On the night of October 3, 2001, defendant and appellant Enrique Acevedo was spotted driving a car that had been reported as stolen. A high-speed chase through city streets ensued, ending with a foot pursuit by police officers and Acevedo\u2019s eventual arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Acevedo was charged with and convicted of two counts: (1) felony evasion of a pursuing police officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a)); and (2) the unlawful taking of another\u2019s car. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">At issue here is whether there was sufficient evidence to establish one of the necessary elements of the evasion charge\u2014that the pursuing police car was exhibiting at least one red lamp that was visible from the front of the car. (\u00a7\u00a7 2800.1, subd. (a)(1), 2800.2, subd. (a).) The only evidence on this point came from the police officer who drove the lead pursuit vehicle. According to that officer, he \u201cactivated [his] overhead emergency lights with the siren.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Acevedo contends this evidence was insufficient. He also contends that the court erred by instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 17.41.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">1. <em>Felony Evasion Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Any person, who, while driving a car, intentionally flees from or tries to elude a pursuing police car, is guilty of a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 2800.1, subd. (a).) The offense becomes a felony when the defendant drives in a willful or wanton manner with disregard for the safety of persons or property. (\u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a).) The prosecution must prove that the police car was distinctively marked (\u00a7 2800.1, subd. (a)(3)), was sounding a siren as may be reasonably necessary (\u00a7 2800.1, subd. (a)(2)) and was \u201cexhibiting at least one lighted red lamp visible from the front\u201d which the defendant either saw or reasonably should have seen. (\u00a72800.1, subd. (a)(1).) The prosecution must prove each statutory element\u2014the corpus delicti\u2014beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>doubt. Our task is to review the entire record in search of substantial evidence. When the facts give equal support to two competing inferences, neither is established. <em>(People v. Brown </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 596, 599-600 [264 Cal.Rptr. 908] <em>(Brown).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><em>Brown </em>is the only reported decision to construe the red light requirement of section 2800.1 In that case, the pursuing officer testified that her squad car was capable of displaying three possible light signals, depending on which switch was activated: a flashing amber light to the rear, blinking blue and white lights to the front and rear, or rotating red, blue and white lights. The officer recalled that she \u201cactivated [her] overhead signals\u201d but could not recall which ones. Bystander witnesses testified that the squad car\u2019s lights were on at the time. As the <em>Brown </em>court observed, \u201c[t]here was no testimony that established the color of the lights.\u201d <em>(Brown, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 600.) Because the evidence gave equal support to two inconsistent inferences, neither had been established and the court held there was insufficient evidence to establish that the pursuing car displayed a red light, as required by the statute. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Acevedo relies on <em>Brown </em>to show there was no evidence that the lights atop the pursuing police car were red. Respondent tries to distinguish <em>Brown, </em>contending: (1) unlike <em>Brown, </em>there was no evidence of different colored lights; (2) the police officer here did not testify he was unsure which colored light he activated; and (3) the officer testified that he turned on his emergency lights and the term \u201cemergency\u201d is virtually synonymous with the use of red lights. Respondent extracts the latter conclusion from section 165, subdivision (b)(1) which requires all emergency vehicles, including police cars, to h\u00e1ve at least one steady, visible red lamp, and from section 25252, which permits additional red lights to be positioned around emergency vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Respondent\u2019s reliance on these provisions appears to rest on the presumption that an official duty has been regularly performed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Eyid. Code, \u00a7 664.) This is a presumption affecting the burden of proof (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 660) which, in a criminal case, operates only if the facts giving rise to the presumption have been found or otherwise established beyond a reasonable doubt. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 607.) The jury should also be instructed on the applicability of the presumption. (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, com. reprinted at 29B pt. 2 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) foil. \u00a7 607, p. 69.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>This issue was never raised below. Because the jury here was not told about the statutory duty to install red lights on emergency vehicles, reliance on the presumption is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Respondent also points to the prevalence of televised police chases, which depict flashing red lights atop pursuing patrol cars. Based on this, respondent contends the jury could rely on its common knowledge to find that the patrol car chasing Acevedo had a red light turned on. This argument is also flawed. First, as with the Evidence Code section 664 presumption, respondent has not fully articulated the argument and has cited no supporting authority, leading us to deem the issue waived.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (P<em>eople v. Sangani, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1135-1136.) Second, while we agree it is common knowledge that police patrol cars carry red lights, it is equally well known that police cars display different colored lights. (See \u00a7\u00a7 25258, 25259 [amber, white or blue lights permitted].) Therefore, the jury\u2019s common knowledge arguably gives rise to the competing inferences of different colored lights which called for a reversal in <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In short, the prosecution simply failed to close a sizable evidentiary gap mandated by the terms of the statute Acevedo allegedly violated. It is a gap that could have been easily bridged: when the officer testified about activating his lights, he could have been asked one or two more questions to verify that the lights he was talking about satisfied the statutory visibility requirements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Francisco </em>(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 355, 360, and fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 503] [proof that county jail prisoner charged with escape had been in legal custody held insufficient to prove other statutory requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that he also had been booked, charged with or convicted of a crime; appellate court refused to \u201cpil[e] . . . presumption upon presumption\u201d that official duty was performed or to \u201cplace a premium upon the district attorney\u2019s indolence. Any relaxation of a rule requiring proof of the corpus delicti would be a dangerous precedent^]\u201d especially when proof of the missing element could have been so easily supplied (Fn. omitted.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We therefore reverse the judgment as to the count under section 2800.2, but do so reluctantly.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It has been suggested that section 2800.1\u2019s requirement of a clearly identifiable police car was designed to protect the public from being forced to stop by police impersonators. <em>(People v. Estrella </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 716, 723, fn. 4 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 383] [construing requirement that pursuing police vehicle have been distinctively marked].) If so, that purpose was more than satisfied here. As the jury found, Acevedo stole someone\u2019s car, then took off in that car at high speed when pursued by two marked police cars, one of which had sounded its siren. After ditching the car, he ran for some distance until he was finally found hiding beneath a parked car. His guilt\u2014his intentional act of fleeing his police pursuers\u2014 therefore seems abundantly clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">As respondent notes, the televised police chase has become a staple of local news fare. They are dangerous spectacles, putting not just pursuer and pursued at risk, but innocent bystanders as well. The Legislature may consider it appropriate to revisit this statute and consider an amendment that will permit a conviction in circumstances such as this, where there could be no doubt that the defendant knew he was being pursued by the police.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Accord, <em>People v. Chicanti </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 956, 961-962 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] [when construing requirement in \u00a7 2800.2 that the pursuing police car be \u201cdistinctively marked,\u201d held that pursuit by a traditional \u201cblack and white\u201d squad car is not always necessary; instead, all the circumstances should be considered to determine whether there is substantial evidence to show that the pursuit vehicle was sufficiently marked to inform any reasonable person he was being chased by a police car].)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>2. <em>CAUIC No. 17.41.1</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment is reversed as to only the conviction under Vehicle Code section 2800.2 and the matter is remanded for resentencing under Vehicle Code section 10851, subdivision (a).
