In July 2014, a Jackson County jury found Dominic C. Robinson guilty of three counts of aggravated assault, and he was sentenced to serve a total of thirty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Robinson now appeals his convictions, arguing that the trial court erred in its evidentiary rulings and instructions to the jury and that his convictions are not supported by the weight of the evidence. In addition to those issues, which were raised by the Office of Indigent Appeals, Robinson has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising eleven additional assignments of error. Finding no reversible error, we affirm Robinson's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On March 5, 2011, Robinson told his girlfriend, Mary Adams, that he was going to a rap concert in Moss Point that night. Adams described Robinson as having braids, a moustache, and a goatee on the night in question. After Robinson left for the concert, Adams did not see him again until three days later, at which point he had shaved off his goatee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Between the late evening hours of March 5, 2011, and the early morning hours of March 6, 2011, Robinson attended a concert by rapper Lil Phat at the Creme De La Creme nightclub in Moss Point. The club had hired several members of Showtime Security to serve as security guards for the event. Jonathan Woods was assigned to stand inside the front door of the club and make sure that concert-goers paid before they entered. Darius Wright, Carmen Thompson, and Jonathan's wife Jessica Woods were working just outside the front door, securing the line into the club and searching concert-goers as they entered. Charles Tyler White was assigned to the door of the club's VIP room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. During the concert, Robinson attempted to enter the club's VIP room, which was reserved for guests with VIP passes. White did not allow Robinson to enter the VIP room because he did not have a pass. White described Robinson as having dreadlocks and a goatee and wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans. Robinson returned to the VIP area a second time, and White again denied him entry. At this point, Robinson became irate and tried to push his way past White. White responded by restraining Robinson and physically removing him from the nightclub.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In the parking lot, Robinson spoke with security guard Darius Wright, who had known Robinson for about fifteen years. Wright also described Robinson as having braided hair and a goatee and wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. Robinson told Wright that he was allowed to re-enter the club, so Wright searched him and let him back in.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Robinson\n   was escorted back out of the club just a few minutes later. Robinson asked Wright for the name of the man who had kicked him out of the club and wanted to know when his shift ended, stating, \"I'm going to get him [security guard Charles Tyler White]. I want to know what time he get off.\" Wright would not give Robinson this information, so Robinson and his brother Darold Payne left the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Later that night, Robinson approached the nightclub and tried to enter a third time. At this point, Wright was opening the tailgate of a truck parked near the club's entrance in an effort to prevent people from cutting through the line into the club. Wright noticed that Robinson had changed his shirt since the last time he had seen him. Robinson walked over to Wright, and Wright asked him to leave the club. Wright was standing on the side of the truck nearest the entrance to the club, and Robinson was standing on the other side. At this time, Damion Kimble approached Wright and began talking to Robinson. Kimble stated at trial that he had known Robinson all his life. Robinson told Kimble not to go into the nightclub, so Kimble turned around and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Wright spoke with Robinson and tried to get him to leave, but Robinson was unwilling to do so. Wright then turned away from Robinson to go back to his station at the front door of the club. At this point, Carmen Thompson saw Robinson draw a handgun and point it at the front of the nightclub. Thompson yelled \"Gun!\" and tackled Wright out of Robinson's line of sight. Wright then glanced around and saw Robinson shooting at Jonathan and Jessica Woods. According to Wright, Thompson drew her pistol and fired a shot that hit the truck's tailgate, causing Robinson to turn and run. Thompson, however, denied firing her weapon. After the shooting stopped, Wright called 911 and remained at the scene until an ambulance arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Jonathan Woods was shot once in the buttocks; the bullet passed through his pelvis and lodged itself at the base of his spine. Jessica Woods was shot a total of five times in the chest, back, hips, and legs. The gunshots to her chest injured her spine and left her paralyzed from the chest down. Three nightclub patrons, Ara Osgood, Anquaneshia Thomas, and Dawonshea Wells, were shot in their right legs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Detective Johnny Jefferson with the Moss Point Police Department responded to a call of reported gunshots at the nightclub at around 2:50 a.m. on March 6, 2011. He arrived to find a chaotic scene, with people running out of the building and into the parking lot. Detective Jefferson saw Jonathan lying on his stomach in the club's entryway, and Jessica was being treated in a nearby ambulance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later, Detective Jefferson traveled to Singing River Hospital and spoke to the nightclub patrons who had sustained gunshot wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Detective J.D. Savage with the Moss Point Police Department arrived at the nightclub as other police officers were securing the scene. The police located twelve nine-millimeter bullet casings in the parking lot, which were collected and photographed. Bullet fragments were found near the entrance to the nightclub and inside near the bar, and there were four bullet holes in the glass door at the front of the club. After leaving the nightclub, Detective Savage went to the hospital and spoke with Jonathan, Osgood, Wells, and\n   Thomas. He did not speak with Jessica because she was in surgery at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Robinson's brother Darold Payne initially was identified as a possible suspect in the shooting, but he was ruled out after Detective Savage spoke with Wright, who identified Robinson as the shooter. Wright also identified Robinson from a six-person photographic lineup. Robinson turned himself in to the Pascagoula Police Department on March 9, 2011. Detective Savage went to Pascagoula to speak with Robinson, but Robinson refused to talk until his attorney arrived. Robinson's attorney never showed up, and Robinson was transferred to the Moss Point Police Department several days later. Robinson never gave a statement to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. On August 21, 2012, a Jackson County grand jury indicted Robinson on five counts of aggravated assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Robinson's trial was held on July 14-16, 2014. At the conclusion of the State's case-in-chief, the trial court granted Robinson a directed verdict as to Count III (Thomas) and Count IV (Wells), finding that the State had failed to present sufficient evidence to support those charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Robinson then testified in his own defense. Robinson admitted that he had attended the concert at the Creme De La Creme nightclub on the night in question. He also admitted that he had been thrown out of the club, but he claimed that he had been mistaken for another person. Robinson testified that, after being thrown out of the club, he left and drove to Mobile, where he sold music CDs over the weekend. Robinson then went to his grandmother's house. Robinson contended that he had not owned a gun since 2008 or 2009 and did not know how to fire a gun. Robinson believed that Tommy Landrum, the owner of Showtime Security, was trying to pin the shooting on him to cover up the fact that the security guards had \"jumped\" him for no reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Robinson guilty of the remaining three counts of aggravated assault (Counts I, II, and V). The trial court sentenced Robinson to serve concurrent sentences of twenty years for Counts I and II. The trial court also sentenced Robinson to serve a sentence of twenty years for Count V, to run consecutively to the sentences in Count I and II, and with ten years in Count V suspended and five years of post-release supervision, for a total of thirty (30) years to serve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. Robinson, now represented by the Office of Indigent Appeals, appeals his convictions to this Court, raising the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the trial court erred in granting Instruction S-14A.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the trial court erred in excluding Exhibit D-1.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Whether the verdicts were against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition, Robinson has filed a pro se supplemental brief\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   raising eleven additional issues, which we reorganize and restate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Whether Robinson was denied effective assistance of counsel.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Whether the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during Robinson's trial.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Whether the State violated Robinson's due-process rights by delaying his indictment.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Whether the State failed to preserve exculpatory evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Whether the State knowingly introduced false, incompetent, and inflammatory evidence, resulting in an unfair trial.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    X. Whether the trial court erred in limiting Robinson's cross-examination of Damion Kimble.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    XI. Whether the State violated Robinson's right to a fair trial by supplying false information during closing arguments.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the trial court erred in granting Instruction S-14A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 15. At trial, three witnesses testified that the shooter was the same man who had been kicked out of the nightclub earlier in the night in question, and their descriptions of the shooter matched Robinson's physical appearance. However, Darius Wright was the only witness who had known Robinson personally prior to the shooting. Wright told Detective Savage that Robinson was the shooter, and he identified Robinson from a six-person photo lineup. Wright also identified Robinson at trial. At the conclusion of the trial, the State offered Instruction S-14A, which instructed the jury on eyewitness identification testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court instructs the Jury that the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense was committed and that the defendant was the person who committed it. You have heard the evidence regarding the identification of the defendant as the person who committed the crime. In this connection, you should consider the witness's opportunity to observe the criminal act and the person committing it, including the length of time the witness had to observe the person committing the crime, the witness's state of mind, and any other circumstances surrounding the event. You should also consider the witness's certainty or lack of certainty, the accuracy of any prior description, and the witness's credibility or lack of credibility, as well as any other factor surrounding the identification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    You have heard evidence during the trial that the witness, Darius Wright, identified the defendant. The identification of the defendant by a single eyewitness, as the person who committed the crime, if believed beyond a reasonable doubt, can be enough evidence to convict the defendant.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   It is for you to determine the reliability of any identification and give it the weight you believe it deserves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Robinson objected to the portion of the instruction that stated that the identification testimony of a single witness could be sufficient to convict a defendant. The trial court overruled Robinson's objection and granted Instruction S-14A. On appeal, Robinson argues that Instruction S-14A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   impermissibly commented on the weight of the evidence by emphasizing Wright's identification testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 16.

This Court has held that \"[a] jury instruction that emphasizes any particular part of the testimony given at trial in a manner as to amount to a comment on the weight of the evidence, is improper.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

Robinson argues that Instruction S-14A improperly commented on the weight of Wright's testimony by pointing the jury specifically to Wright's identification of Robinson and stating that the testimony of one eyewitness can be sufficient to convict. We find no merit in this argument. First, unlike the instructions in\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Goss\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Hines\n   </em>\n   , Instruction S-14A did not require the jury to assign a certain weight to Wright's testimony. On the contrary, Instruction S-14A specifically told the jury, \"It is for you to determine the reliability of any identification and give it the weight you believe it deserves.\" In addition, Instruction S-14A did not require the jury to convict Robinson even if it believed Wright's testimony. Rather, the instruction provides that \"[t]he identification of the defendant by a single eyewitness, as the person who committed the crime, if believed beyond a reasonable doubt,\n   <em>\n    can be\n   </em>\n   enough evidence to convict the defendant,\" which is a correct statement of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doby v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11314760\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/532/584/#p591\">\n    532 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (Miss. 1988) (recognizing the rule that \"persons may be found guilty on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness\"). Instruction S-14A left to the jury the task of judging the credibility of Wright's testimony and weighing it against the other evidence presented at trial. We hold that the mere mention of Wright's testimony in Instruction S-14A did not\n   amount to an improper comment on the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the trial court erred in excluding Exhibit D-1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 19. After the State had rested at Robinson's trial, Robinson attempted to admit into evidence Exhibit D-1, which was an order entered on August 3, 2011-six months after the shooting in this case-in a criminal cause in which Darius Wright was the defendant. The order shows that the prosecution moved to reduce a pending drug-possession charge against Wright from a felony to a misdemeanor. The trial court granted this motion, and Wright pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor. Wright was sentenced to a six-month suspended sentence, six months of nonreporting probation, and a monetary fine. Notably, the order does not list the date of Wright's offense or the date on which he was formally charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 20. Robinson argued that Exhibit D-1 would \"go to Mr. Wright's testimony or his credibility.\" The trial court analyzed Exhibit D-1 under Rule 609 of the Mississippi Rules of Evidence and concluded that the exhibit was inadmissible because it was not probative of Wright's \"veracity or credibility.\" On appeal, Robinson contends that the trial court erred in excluding Exhibit D-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 21. \"The standard of review for the admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7031366\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/54/212/#p213\">\n    54 So.3d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (Miss. 2011) (citation omitted). \"However, this discretion must be exercised within the confines of the Mississippi Rules of Evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112728\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/849/1257/#p1268\">\n    849 So.2d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (Miss. 2003) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 22. As an initial matter, we find that the trial court did not err in finding that Exhibit D-1 was inadmissible under Rule 609. Rule 609 allows admission of evidence of a criminal conviction evidence under certain circumstances for the purpose of \"attacking a witness's character for truthfulness.\" Miss. R. Evid. 609(a). But because Wright's conviction imposed a sentence of less than one year, Exhibit D-1 would be admissible under Rule 609 only \"if the court can readily determine that establishing the elements of the crime required proving-or the witness's admitting-a dishonest act or false statement.\" Miss. R. Evid. 609(a)(2). The elements of possession of a controlled substance do not require proof of a dishonest act or false statement, so Exhibit D-1 was not admissible to attack Wright's character for truthfulness under Rule 609.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 23. Robinson now claims, however, that he was not attempting to admit Exhibit D-1 under Rule 609 to attack Wright's character for truthfulness. Instead, Robinson asserts that he intended to use Exhibit D-1 to show that Wright had made a deal with law-enforcement authorities for leniency in his drug-possession case in exchange for his testimony in Robinson's case. In other words, he argues that his purpose for offering Exhibit D-1 \"was not simply to discredit [Wright] because he had been convicted of such a crime (which may very well have been inadmissible under some provision of Rule 609 ), but to ferret out any motive or reason [Wright] might have to be such a favorable state witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Bevill v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7523238\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/556/699/#p713\">\n    556 So.2d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713-14 (Miss. 1990). Accordingly, Robinson argues that Exhibit D-1 was admissible under Rule 616, which provides, \"Evidence of a witness's bias, prejudice, or interest-for or against any party-is admissible to attack the witness's credibility.\" Miss. R. Evid. 616.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 24. We find that Robinson failed to inform the trial court of the substance of his argument with an offer of proof sufficient\n   to preserve this claim of error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. R. Evid. 103(a)(2). Beyond generally stating that Exhibit D-1 would go to Wright's \"credibility,\" Robinson never specifically argued Rule 616 as a basis for Exhibit D-1's admissibility. In fact, while considering the admissibility of Exhibit D-1, the trial court stated, \"I don't think the question is whether that relates to any kind of deal [Wright] may have had with the District Attorney. It's being offered as impeachment evidence in regard to his truthfulness under Rule 609.\" Robinson did not respond to this statement to correct what he now claims to be the trial court's misunderstanding of his argument. Accordingly, we find that Robinson's argument is procedurally barred, because the issue of Wright's bias, prejudice, or interest was not presented clearly to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 25.

But this argument amounts to mere speculation, as there is no evidence that Wright's drug charge even existed at the time of his meeting with Detective Savage.

Prior to trial, the State demanded notice of Robinson's intent to offer an alibi defense, but it received no response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   URCCC 9.05. At trial, Robinson testified that he left the Creme De La Creme prior to the shooting and spent the rest of the weekend in Mobile selling music CDs. At the conclusion of its cross-examination of Robinson, the State asked the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q: I got one more question.

On appeal, Robinson argues that the above-quoted question was an improper comment on his exercise of his constitutional right to remain silent.

We find that\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   did not offer an alibi defense at trial, so he had no legal duty to inform the prosecution of his whereabouts at the time of the offense. Here, on the other hand, Robinson offered an alibi defense by testifying on direct examination that he left the Creme De La Creme and was traveling to Mobile when the shooting occurred. As such, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   , Robinson had a duty to inform the prosecution of his intent to rely on an alibi defense and to disclose certain evidence related to that defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Upon the written demand of the prosecuting attorney ... the defendant shall serve within ten days ... upon the prosecuting attorney a written notice of the intention to offer a defense of alibi, which notice\n   <em>\n    shall state the specific place or places at which the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense\n   </em>\n   and the names and addresses of the witnesses upon which the defendant intends to rely to establish such alibi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   URCCC 9.05 (emphasis added). \"[T]he specific purpose of alibi defense discovery is to allow the state an opportunity of investigation and discovery [of] evidence, if any, which may rebut the anticipated alibi defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

The State demanded notice of Robinson's intent to offer an alibi defense prior to trial, but Robinson did not respond. Accordingly, the State was not made aware of Robinson's alibi defense until he took the witness stand, by which point the State was unable to respond to his defense. Therefore, we find the prosecutor's question to Robinson about the novelty of his alibi defense to be a comment on his failure to comply with a discovery rule rather than an attempt to attack the credibility of his testimony. Under the specific circumstances of this case, we hold that the prosecutor's question did not amount to plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

In challenging the weight of the evidence, Robinson focuses primarily on several perceived conflicts in the testimony of the State's witnesses. First, he points out that Detective Savage testified that he recovered nine-millimeter shell casings from the scene of the crime, while Jessica's and Jonathan's medical records indicated that they had been shot by a .45 caliber weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, he claims that witnesses' identifications of Robinson were based on Wright's identification, which was unreliable because Wright had made a deal for leniency with the State. In addition, he notes that the State's witnesses provided\n   differing descriptions of the shooter's clothing. Finally, he points out that Thompson's and Wright's testimony conflicted on whether Thompson fired a gun at the shooter. Based on these alleged discrepancies, Robinson contends that he should be granted a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 33. We find that the jury's verdicts were not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence presented at trial. Robinson admitted that he was at the Creme De La Creme nightclub on the night of the shooting and that he was thrown out of the club for attempting to enter the VIP room. Five other witnesses testified that a man matching Robinson's description was thrown out of the club during the concert, and three of these witnesses testified that the man who was thrown out of the club was the shooter. One eyewitness, Darius Wright, also positively identified Robinson as the shooter. Robinson's arguments are based on conflicts in the evidence and the credibility of the State's witnesses, matters to be decided by the jury. \"It is well settled that in such a case of conflicting testimony, each distinct view is absorbed into the minds of the jury as the finders of fact, and it is within the province of the jury to determine the credibility among several witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

Robinson argues that his attorney's deficient performance deprived him of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 37. We find that Robinson's first claim of ineffective assistance is plainly without merit, because it is based on an incorrect reading of the law. Robinson cites Rule 13.9(c) of the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure to support his claim that his attorney failed to file a timely motion to dismiss the charges against him. But the Rules of Criminal Procedure had not yet been enacted at the time of Robinson's trial. And even if those rules did apply to the instant case, Rule 13.9(c) was not adopted into the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Robinson does not cite any other specific rule that his attorney violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 38. As for Robinson's second claim, the record does not contain sufficient evidence for review on direct appeal. In order to succeed on his claim that his attorney failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the case, Robinson must \"state with particularity what the investigation would have revealed and specify how it would have altered the outcome of trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Robinson also raises a claim of ineffective assistance against his appellate attorney for failing to present claims of actual innocence and ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

Thus, we dismiss this claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Whether the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during Robinson's trial.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 40. Robinson argues that the prosecution engaged in a continuous pattern of misconduct during his trial that rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. No objections were raised to any of the following alleged instances of misconduct, and as such, these issues are procedurally barred from review on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rubenstein v.

We review each of Robinson's allegations separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the State elicited irrelevant and inflammatory testimony implying other criminal conduct committed by Robinson.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 41. Robinson argues that the State committed misconduct by eliciting irrelevant and prejudicial testimony from several witnesses that implied that Robinson may have engaged in other criminal acts for which he was not charged. Robinson points to two specific instances of this alleged misconduct. First, during its redirect examination of Detective Savage, the State asked whether a person could buy a firearm \"off the street\" without filling out any registration paperwork. Robinson asserts that this line of questioning was irrelevant and inflammatory because the State never recovered the gun used in the shooting and presented no evidence that he even owned a gun. Second, Robinson claims that the State asked him questions on cross-examination that were meant to insinuate that he was selling CDs illegally on the days following the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 42. We find that Robinson's arguments lack merit. The State's question to Detective Savage concerning the purchase of firearms was asked in direct response to questions posed by Robinson on cross-examination. Specifically, Robinson asked Detective Savage, \"If I bought a gun today in Pascagoula, would it be registered with anybody?\" He then asked Detective Savage if he had checked any firearms records to determine whether Robinson owned a gun. The State's questions on redirect simply clarified an issue raised by Robinson on cross-examination. \"Where the defense attorney inquires into a subject on cross-examination of the State's witness, the prosecutor on rebuttal is unquestionably entitled to elaborate on the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Crenshaw v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7562957\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/520/131/#p133\">\n    520 So.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (Miss. 1988) (citing\n   <em>\n    Winters v.

Additionally, the State's cross-examination of Robinson concerning his sale of CDs was not improper. Robinson testified during direct examination that he was in Mobile selling CDs on the days immediately following the shooting. On cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to clarify Robinson's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q: You had indicated you sell CDs. What does that mean, sell CDs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A: I make music.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q: You make music CDs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A: Yes, sir, I make music.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Q: It's your own music that you're selling?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Q: You don't sell anybody else's?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   A: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Contrary to Robinson's assertions, this line of questioning does not insinuate that Robinson's act of selling CDs was illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether the prosecutor impermissibly implied that Robinson had fled the scene of the crime.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 43. Robinson argues that the State committed misconduct by implying through questions to witnesses and arguments to the jury that Robinson had fled the scene of the crime. For example, in response to Robinson's testimony that he went to Mobile \"to get away,\" the State asked Robinson on cross-examination,\n   \"You were getting away from a shooting, aren't you? That's what you're getting away from.\" During closing argument, the State contended that Robinson was \"hiding\" in Mobile before he turned himself in to the police. The prosecutor also returned to Robinson's statement that he went to Mobile \"to get away\" by arguing, \"Members of the jury, he has been trying to get away for three years now. It's time to hold him accountable for his actions on March 6, 2011.\" Robinson argues that these questions and statements were improper because he had explained during his testimony that he had left the nightclub before the shooting started.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 44. We find no merit in Robinson's allegations of misconduct. \"Mississippi allows wide-open cross-examination of any matter that is relevant ....\"\n   <em>\n    Anthony v.

Here, the State presented evidence that Robinson fled the scene of the crime after shooting Jonathan and Jessica. Robinson attempted to explain his flight by testifying on direct examination that he left the nightclub before the shooting occurred and that he had gone to Mobile to sell CDs. Robinson also testified specifically that he had gone to Mobile to \"get away.\" On cross-examination, the State was entitled to point out the conflicts between Robinson's testimony and that of the other witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 45.

During closing argument, the prosecutor made the following statement to the jury: \"I ask you to please consider the evidence, listen to what every witness has told you, look at all the physical evidence and find [Robinson] guilty on all three counts of aggravated assault because that's what he's guilty of.\" On appeal, Robinson argues that, in making this statement, the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal opinion on Robinson's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 47. \"[T]his State does not allow a prosecutor to comment on his personal beliefs about a defendant's guilt or innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Mack v.

In this case, the prosecutor was commenting on the sufficiency of the evidence and did not offer a personal opinion concerning the defendant's guilt. In\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that the prosecutor's repeated use of the phrase \"I know\" during closing statements was improper, because \"[t]he use of 'I' leaves open the inference that the prosecutor personally believed that Mack committed the capital murder.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7473760\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/650/1289/#p1320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7473760\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/650/1289/#p1320\">\n    at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

During its cross-examination of Robinson, the prosecutor asked a series of questions about whether the State's witnesses were telling the truth when they described Robinson's appearance and clothing on the night of the crime. The prosecutor also asked Robinson if the description of the shooting provided by the State's witnesses was a \"fabrication,\" since it conflicted with his claim that he had left the Creme De La Creme before the shooting occurred. And finally, during closing arguments, the prosecutor stated, \"It makes no sense, if you think about this, that every witness who testified to y'all got it wrong. That's what y'all got to believe to turn [Robinson] loose. Every one of them got it wrong.\" Robinson argues that these questions and comments were inappropriate because they infringed on the jury's right to judge the credibility of the State's witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 49. \"It is essential ... to the proper functioning of the adversary system that when a defendant takes the stand, the government be permitted proper and effective cross-examination in an attempt to elicit the truth.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

After reviewing the record in this case, we find that the prosecutor's questions and comments did not amount to plain error.

For example, the prosecutor asked Robinson whether the State's witnesses were being truthful when they testified that Robinson was wearing a white shirt and blue jeans on the night of the shooting, but Robinson had just testified that he was wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. The prosecutor also asked Robinson whether Mary Adams was telling the truth when she testified that she told Robinson not to go to the club, but Robinson had testified on direct examination that Adams had told him not to go. In addition, the jury was instructed that it had a duty to determine the credibility of each witness. \"Generally speaking, our law presumes that jurors follow the trial judge's instructions, as upon their oaths they are obliged to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

Meanwhile, he alleges that the State lost exculpatory evidence and was able to secure witnesses and \"coach\" their testimony. Accordingly, Robinson contends that the delay in his indictment severely impaired his ability to mount an effective defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 54.

Whether the State failed to preserve exculpatory evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 55. Detective Savage testified that twelve nine-millimeter bullet casings and several bullet fragments were recovered from the scene of the crime. However, these casings and fragments were lost prior to trial. Detective Savage explained that a new police chief had taken office and had ordered a major purge of the evidence room, which had fallen into complete disarray under the previous administration. Detective Savage believed that the casings and fragments had been discarded during that process. While the casings and fragments were unavailable, the State did introduce photographs of them into evidence. On appeal, Robinson argues that the State violated his due-process rights by failing to preserve this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 56. This Court has adopted the following test to determine whether the State's failure to preserve evidence violated the defendant's right to due process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (1) the evidence in question must possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed; (2) the evidence must be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means; and (3) the prosecution's destruction of the evidence must have been in bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

We find that Robinson has failed to prove the first and third prongs of this test. First, there is no clear indication that the casings and fragments possess any apparent exculpatory value. If anything, the locations of the casings, which were memorialized in photographs that were produced to Robinson during discovery and admitted into evidence at trial, supported the testimony of the State's witnesses concerning the location of the shooter. And because the weapon used in the shooting was never recovered, it could not be tested against the casings and fragments. Robinson's arguments concerning the potential usefulness of the casings and fragments to his defense amount to mere speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 57. Additionally, the record contains no evidence that the casings and fragments were destroyed in bad faith. \"Bad faith, the third and final prong, is defined as 'not simply bad judgment or negligence, but rather ... conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity[.]' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

Detective Savage testified at trial that the casings and fragments were discarded inadvertently during a major reorganization of the police department's evidence room. Accordingly, the record indicates that the loss of this evidence was the result of, at most, carelessness on the part of the police department. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Whether the State knowingly introduced false, incompetent, and inflammatory evidence, resulting in an unfair trial.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 58. Robinson presents several separate assignments of error in which he accuses State witnesses of providing false testimony at his trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   These accusations are based primarily on inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies, and Robinson interprets these inconsistencies as proof that the State's witnesses were lying on the stand. For example, Robinson points out that Officer Jefferson's testimony and Carmen Thompson's testimony conflict on whether Thompson spoke to the police on the night of the shooting. On a similar note, Detective Savage and Darius Wright had different recollections of the timing of their meeting, during which Wright identified Robinson as the shooter. Detective Savage also testified that he took photographs of the crime scene, but his report indicates that another police officer took the photos. Robinson claims that Jonathan Woods gave conflicting testimony about whether the front door of the Creme De La Creme was open or closed when the shooting started and whether he could see the shooter. And finally, Darius Wright and Carmen Thompson provided conflicting testimony on whether Thompson had fired her gun at the shooter. Robinson contends that this alleged false testimony resulted in the denial of his right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 59.

After reviewing Robinson's various allegations of false testimony, we find that Robinson has failed to demonstrate that any of the State's witnesses intentionally lied on the stand. Robinson simply points out inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies, and \"[w]hen asked to reverse on the ground of inconsistencies or contradictions in testimony, we have held this is clearly in the jury's province\n   and refused.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Accordingly, this argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    X. Whether the trial court erred in limiting Robinson's cross-examination of Damion Kimble.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 61. Robinson argues that the trial court erred in prohibiting him from cross-examining Damion Kimble about a sexual-assault charge that was pending against Kimble at the time of trial. Robinson alleges that Kimble made a deal with the State in exchange for his testimony in this case and that the exclusion of evidence of Kimble's pending criminal charge prevented the jury from considering his interest in testifying for the State. This argument is without merit for two reasons. First, while the State did file a motion in limine seeking to prevent Robinson from admitting evidence of Kimble's pending criminal charge, the trial court never ruled on that motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, contrary to Robinson's assertion, the trial court did not limit his right to cross-examine Kimble. Robinson simply failed to raise the issue during trial. Notwithstanding this fact, the record contains no evidence that Kimble had received or would receive favorable treatment from the State in exchange for his testimony. Accordingly, similarly to the evidence of Wright's guilty plea discussed above, Kimble's criminal charge was not relevant to his interest in testifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    XI. Whether the State violated Robinson's right to a fair trial by supplying false information during closing arguments.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 62. In the final assignment of error in his pro se brief, Robinson claims that the prosecutor incorrectly stated during closing argument that Jessica Woods identified him as the shooter. He claims that Jessica never identified him during her testimony and that the prosecutor's comment provided false information to the jury and violated his due-process rights. Because Robinson failed to object to the prosecutor's comment at trial, this argument is procedurally barred.\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7551619\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/525/365/#p369\">\n    525 So.2d at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding the procedural bar, this argument is without merit. Robinson's characterizations of the prosecutor's comment and Jessica's testimony are incorrect. Jessica testified that the shooter was the same man who had been kicked out of the club earlier in the night in question. During closing arguments, while commenting on Robinson's theory that the State's witnesses were conspiring against him, the prosecutor stated, \"[H]ow does Jessica Woods say the same guy who was kicked out of the club was the shooter when she was in surgery fighting for her life in and out of consciousness? How did she get her story straight with everybody else? Doesn't make sense.\" Contrary to Robinson's assertion, the prosecutor did\n   not incorrectly state that Jessica had identified Robinson specifically as the shooter..\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 63.

I respectfully dissent. Jury Instruction S-14A erroneously singled out the identification testimony of Darius Wright and amounted to a comment on the quality and weight of his testimony. Additionally, the prosecutor used Robinson's exercise of his right to remain silent to impeach his trial testimony about his whereabouts at the time of the shooting, constituting plain error. Because of these errors, I would reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    I. Jury Instruction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 66. At the trial, it was undisputed that, during the early morning hours of March 6, 2011, someone fired multiple gunshots toward the entrance of the Creme de La Creme nightclub in Moss Point, Mississippi. The critical question was whether that person was Robinson. Darius Wright and several other witnesses identified Robinson as the culprit. But Wright was the only eyewitness to the shooting who had known Robinson before that night, having grown up with him in the Moss Point area. The State requested, and the trial court granted, Instruction S-14A, that provided the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court instructs the jury that the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense was committed and that the defendant was the person who committed it. You have heard evidence regarding the identification of the defendant as the person who committed the crime. In this connection you should consider the witness's opportunity to observe the criminal act and the person committing it, including the length of time the witness had to observe the person committing the crime, the witness's state of mind, and any other circumstances surrounding the event. You should also consider the witness's certainty or lack of certainty, the accuracy of any prior description, and the witness's credibility or lack of credibility, as well as any other factor surrounding the identification.\n   <em>\n    You have heard evidence during the trial that the witness, Darius Wright, identified the defendant.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    The identification of the defendant by a single eyewitness, as the person who committed the crime, if believed beyond a reasonable doubt, can be enough evidence to convict the defendant.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   It is for you to determine the reliability of any identification and give it the weight it deserves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Instruction S-14A reminded the jury that Darius Wright had identified the defendant and that, if it believed his identification of the defendant as the shooter beyond a reasonable doubt, it could convict. Robinson argues that Instruction S-14A was erroneous because it emphasized the evidence that Wright in particular had identified him as the culprit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 67. \"The judge in any criminal cause, shall not sum up or comment on the testimony, or charge the jury as to the weight of evidence ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-17-35\">\n    Miss.

The majority recognizes that error occurs if a jury instruction draws attention to a particular part of the evidence adduced at trial in a way that comments on its weight. Yet the majority finds that Instruction S-14A did no such thing. Certainly, the jury instruction told the jury to weigh the reliability of any identification and give it the weight it believed it deserved. And the jury instruction did not specifically say that the jury should convict if it believed Wright's testimony without assessing the other evidence. But the flawed jury instruction was not cured by those attributes. The problem with Instruction S-14A was that, although there were numerous eyewitnesses to the shooting, it focused the jury's attention on the State's strongest eyewitness, Darius Wright, the only eyewitness who previously had known Robinson. Every other eyewitness said that he or she had not known Robinson before the shooting, but that the shooter was the same person who had been thrown out of the club earlier that night and identified as Robinson. While it was permissible to instruct the jury on the law that the identification testimony of a single eyewitness, if believed beyond a reasonable doubt, was sufficient to convict, it was impermissible for the instruction to suggest that the most believable witness was the State's strongest witness, Wright. I would find that Instruction S-14A commented on the weight and quality of the evidence, and that the trial court abused its discretion by granting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 69. I observe that it is beyond question that both the State and the defense viewed Instruction S-14A as a suggestion that the jury should find Wright's testimony to be especially weighty. At the jury instruction conference, defense counsel objected to the instruction on the basis that it singled out Wright from the group of eyewitnesses. Defense counsel said the instruction \"would seem right to me if it wasn't for singling out Darius Wright. I mean, four [other] people up there basically identified him.\" The trial court's response indicated its view that the instruction's singling out Wright was a feature, not a problem: \"the case hinges on the identification by Darius Wright. That's in evidence....\n   <em>\n    It just focuses the jury's attention on that witness\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The trial court overruled the objection. Of course, the judge should not be in the business of focusing the jury's attention on this or any other portion of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 70. During closing arguments, the prosecutor twice drew the jury's attention to Instruction S-14A:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, we have eye witnesses as I said. I'll bring your attention to this jury instruction. Here you go, ladies and gentlemen. The identification of a defendant by a single eye witness as a person who committed the crime, if believed beyond a reasonable doubt, can be enough evidence to convict. I submit to you, Darius Wright, he identifies him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Now, if this was just-if I had just brought Darius Wright in here and that was the only witness y'all heard from, I'd still be telling you that if you believe him that's proof beyond a reasonable doubt because it is. Ms. Van Buskirk showed you the instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   I find that Instruction S-14A was intended to be, and operated as, a judicial comment on the weight and quality of Darius Wright's testimony. Because the instruction erroneously placed undue emphasis upon the testimony of the State's strongest witness, Robinson's jury was improperly instructed, and I would reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <em>\n    II.

After Robinson's arrest, the police read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights and he invoked his right to remain silent. Thus, Robinson exercised that constitutional right and never spoke to the police about his activities on the night of the shooting. At trial, Robinson testified on direct examination that he had left the club before the shooting and then had traveled to Mobile, Alabama. On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Robinson about that testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Q. I got one more question.

As in\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   , the prosecution impeached Robinson by eliciting his admission that the trial was the first time he had spoken about his whereabouts on the night of the crime. Because Robinson had exercised his right to remain silent, the prosecutor's use of his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence to impeach him and imply his guilt violated Robinson's federal and state constitutional due process rights. Further, considering the error in light of this Court's admonition in\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   that the law had been established for almost thirty years at the time of the decision, and that \"[w]e would expect that this cross-examination technique employed by the prosecutor, and allowed by the trial court, would cease,\" I find that the error here was a plain, clear, and obvious one. Because the error violated Robinson's fundamental due process rights, resulting in a manifest miscarriage of justice, I would reverse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.A.P. 28(a)(3) (when a defendant's substantive or fundamental rights are affected, this Court will notice \"a plain error not identified or distinctly specified.\");\n   <em>\n    Cozart v.

The majority finds\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   distinguishable from this case because, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   , Robinson offered an alibi defense at trial by testifying on direct examination that he had left the club before the shooting, bound for Mobile. The majority concludes that this distinction is critical because, pursuant to Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 9.05, Robinson was supposed to have disclosed any alibi defense to the State upon demand:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   Upon the written demand of the prosecuting attorney ... the defendant shall serve within ten days ... upon the prosecuting attorney a written notice of the intention to offer a defense of alibi, which notice shall state the specific place or places at which the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and the names and addresses of\n   the witnesses upon which the defendant intends to rely to establish such alibi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   URCCC 9.05. Although the State demanded notice of Robinson's intent to offer an alibi defense, Robinson never responded. Therefore, the State's first notice of his alibi defense was at the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 77. The majority concludes that, because Robinson violated Rule 9.05 by failing to provide the State with notice of his alibi defense, \"the prosecutor's question to Robinson about the novelty of his alibi defense [was] a comment on his failure to comply with a discovery rule rather than an attempt to attack the credibility of his testimony.\" But Robinson's failure to provide the State notice of his alibi defense was a purely procedural matter not relevant to the jury's determination of Robinson's guilt or innocence. It had no tendency to make Robinson's guilt, or any fact of consequence in the case, more or less probable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.E. 401(a). Therefore, trial testimony on the matter was immaterial and irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.E. 402 (\"[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible\"). If the prosecutor had a problem with Robinson's offering an alibi defense due to his noncompliance with the discovery rule, the appropriate action would have been to inform the trial judge, not raise the matter before the jury. There was no reason for the prosecutor to have elicited testimony about it, because such testimony was irrelevant to anything properly before the jury, and it was inadmissible. The notion that the prosecutor's question was an inquiry into Robinson's noncompliance with Rule 9.05, rather than an attempt to cast suspicion on him due to his exercise of the right to remain silent, strains credulity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 78. The majority errs by deciding that the prosecutor's question was a comment on the irrelevant matter of Robinson's compliance with Rule 9.05, rather than a relevant, but impermissible, comment on his exercise of the right to remain silent. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the defendant's failure to give the State timely notice of an alibi defense could have been a relevant jury issue in this case, no instruction was given to the jury to inform it of the existence of Rule 9.05 or to explain the relevance of the fact that Robinson's defense counsel had failed to comply with it. Nor was any limiting instruction given to the jury to consider Robinson's testimony for its tendency to show the Rule 9.05 violation as opposed to the unconstitutional purpose of impeaching his exercise of the right to remain silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 79. As the majority notes, a prosecutor's comment on the defendant's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence has been found to be harmless error when there was overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249495\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/869/405/#p410\">\n    869 So.2d at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I would decline to deem the error in this case harmless. No physical evidence such as DNA or fingerprints linked Robinson with the crime. The weapon used in the shooting never was recovered, and the State did not prove that Robinson owned or had access to a gun. Robinson never confessed. The State's case rested solely upon the identification testimony of eyewitnesses whose impressions were formed in the chaotic atmosphere of a nightclub shooting. Therefore, the evidence of guilt was not overwhelming, rendering the prosecutor's insinuation that Robinson had concocted an alibi for the trial especially damaging. I would find that the prosecutor's impeachment of Robinson's alibi testimony with the evidence that he had exercised his right to remain silent was a plain error demanding that this Court reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b6 80. Two significant errors occurred in this case. Instruction S-14A singled out the identification testimony of Darius\n   Wright for special attention by the jury, constituting an improper comment on the quality and weight of the evidence. And a plain error occurred when the prosecutor used Robinson's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence to impeach his trial testimony that he was traveling to Mobile at the time of the shooting. Because these two errors should not be allowed to stand, I would reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   KING, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    <em>\n     Miranda v.
