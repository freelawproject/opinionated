Defendant stabbed the victim five times during the course of a robbery. The victim died as a result of the stab wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 27, 2010, Defendant was indicted for the first degree murder of Timothy Falgout, in violation of La.R.S. 14:30. At the same time, Defendant was indicted for attempted first degree murder, violations of La.R.S. 14:27 and 14:30, and purse-snatching, a violation of La.R.S. 14:65.1. The latter two charges were severed from the first degree murder charge on April 30, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 8, 2010, Defendant filed a \"Jackson Demand for Notice of Any Bad Acts That the State May Wish to Use at Either Phase.\" On January 12, 2012, the State filed a \"State's Notice with Regard to Aggravating Circumstances\" and \"State's Response to Defendant's Jackson Demand for Notice of Any Bad Acts That the State May Wish to Use at Either Phase\" and on March 28, 2012, the State filed an amended response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue of the La.Code Evid. art. 404(B) other crimes evidence was taken up on May 30, 2012. Following testimony and arguments, the trial court took the matter under advisement. On July 9, 2012, the trial court ruled that the evidence the State sought to admit at trial was relevant and admissible. The trial court's ruling was affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, to be served consecutively with any other sentence Defendant was currently serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant has perfected this timely appeal, wherein he asserts four assignments of error: (1) The trial court erred in allowing the introduction of other crimes evidence; (2) The trial court erred in failing to grant defense counsel's challenges for cause and in granting a state's challenge for cause; (3) The trial court erred in releasing a potential juror for cause on its own; and (4) The evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to find Defendant guilty of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the following reasons, we find no merit in any of Defendant's assignments of error and affirm his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Addie Bourgeois testified that in April 2009, after arriving at Buffalo Wild Wings' parking lot in Lafayette, Louisiana, she was mugged (as she exited her vehicle) and robbed. She stated that even before she was outside her car, a man approached her, punched her in the face, and stole her purse. She described him as a light brown\n   male, possibly Hispanic, wearing a green polo shirt. While Ms. Bourgeois never identified Defendant as the assailant, Todd Borel (a detective with the Lafayette Police Department) investigated the robbery and eventually connected Defendant to the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Detective Borel testified he obtained a video from Buffalo Wild Wing's surveillance camera for the evening of the robbery. The video showed Ms. Bourgeois' vehicle pulling into the parking lot. Another vehicle pulled in right behind her vehicle. A man exited the second car, approached Ms. Bourgeois, struck her, and raced back to the waiting vehicle. The detective stated the next day he learned that one of Ms. Bourgeois' credit cards was used at a Wal-Mart store approximately forty-five minutes after the robbery. Detective Borel obtained Wal-Mart's surveillance video and identified Defendant, wearing a green polo shirt, and another man making a purchase with Ms. Bourgeois' credit card. That same evening, the credit card was used again at a gas station in Kaplan. A surveillance video was also obtained of one of the men using the credit card. The gas station's store clerk identified the man using the credit card as Darvin Williams. Mr. Williams was picked up and questioned by police. Mr. Williams admitted that he was with Defendant the night Ms. Bourgeois was robbed. Mr. Williams told the detective he was driving the vehicle that pulled up behind Ms. Bourgeois' vehicle and it was Defendant who assaulted and robbed Ms. Bourgeois. Detective Borel identified Defendant in court as the man who was with Darvin Williams at Wal-Mart wearing a green polo shirt. The detective said Defendant told him it was Mr. Williams who hit and robbed Ms. Bourgeois and that they had switched shirts afterwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (2). Mary Courville testified, on March 30, 2010, at approximately 1:30 a.m., she was attacked by a man after she left a bar in Lafayette and was walking towards her vehicle. She testified the man walked up behind her, punched her in the face, and stole her purse. She reported the assault and theft to the police, but she was not able to identify the perpetrator. Detective Ben Suire, a detective with the Lafayette City Police, worked Ms. Courville's case. On April 7, 2010, he learned that Ms. Courville's credit card was used at a local Circle K approximately twenty minutes after the assault and robbery took place. Detective Suire obtained the surveillance video from the Circle K for the morning of March 30, 2010. The video showed Defendant and another man making purchases matching the purchases made on Ms. Courville's card. At the time, Detective Suire did not know who the men were. He put out a \"be on the look out\" for the two men. In September 2010, he received information from another law enforcement agency that one of the men was Marcus Feast, who was incarcerated at the time. The detective talked with Mr. Feast. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Feast was charged with unauthorized use of a credit card, and Defendant was charged with simple robbery of Ms. Courville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (3). Cassie Lacomb testified, on March 29, 2010, she arrived home with her two young children around 6:30 p.m. She lived in a subdivision close to Ambassador Caffery in Lafayette at the time. She ordered a pizza to be delivered. While waiting for the pizza to arrive, she heard a vehicle turn into her driveway. She then heard a commotion but thought a car was just turning around. A little later, she decided to call Pizza Hut because it was getting late, but then she saw a car sitting in the drive, behind her car, with the door opened. When she went outside, she saw a person laying on the ground, bleeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   She called 911. It was the victim, Mr. Falgout, who had been delivering her pizza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   When deputies from Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office arrived, they found the victim deceased on Ms. Lacomb's lawn. The police were able to identify the victim from the plates on his vehicle. He had no wallet or other identification on his person, although later, the police were advised the victim always carried a wallet. A bloody knife was located near the victim's body. The knife was sent to Acadiana Criminalist Laboratory for DNA analysis. Ms. Lacomb told the police she ordered the pizza around 7:30 p.m. After talking with the manager of Pizza Hut, the police determined that Mr. Falgout would have arrived at Ms. Lacomb's house at approximately 8:30 p.m. The police backtracked the possible routes the victim could have taken to deliver the pizza from the Pizza Hut to Ms. Lacomb's house and located a house in the neighborhood that had a surveillance camera facing the roadway. When they viewed the video, they saw the victim's car drive past at the approximate time it was determined it would have arrived at Ms. Lacomb's house. They also saw a black SUV following closely behind the victim's car. Attempts to identify the SUV were unsuccessful. However, in June 2010, the police received word from Acadiana Criminalist Laboratory that two DNA matches were located through CODIS (Combined DNA Index System) from the evidence sent for analysis, one DNA match was found on the knife and one on the victim's clothing. The DNA located on the victim's clothing was from a man who lived in Alexandria, but who was deceased at the time the victim was killed. The DNA located on the knife which stabbed the victim matched Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Detective Thad Badeaux, with the Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office, said further inquiry established, while Defendant was living in Virginia at the time, he was in Lafayette on March 29, 2010, for an April 1, 2010 court date concerning the 2009 assault and robbery of Ms. Bourgeois. Detective Badeaux then obtained a police report, written by a Lafayette City deputy marshal, Shane Duplechin, who encountered Defendant and Marcus Feast in the early morning of March 30, 2010, in Mr. Feast's vehicle, a light gold Mercedes Benz. The marshal ran the plates on the Mercedes Benz and a background check on the occupants of the vehicle. Detective Badeaux testified, with this information they reexamined the March 30, 2010 surveillance recording of the victim's car on its way to deliver pizza to Ms. Lacomb's house and saw that shortly after the black SUV passed the surveillance camera, a light gold Mercedes Benz passed the camera. Shortly thereafter, the Mercedes Benz drove back in front of the surveillance camera, traveling at a high rate of speed on the wrong side of the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Detective Badeaux said he talked with Defendant on August 5, 2010, when he was in town for a court date. Defendant initially denied being with Mr. Feast on the evening of March 29, 2010. He eventually stated he was picked up by Mr. Feast in the early morning on March 30, 2010, shortly before Mr. Feast was pulled over by the city marshal. The detective stated when he told Defendant his DNA was on the knife that killed Mr. Falgout, Defendant said that was not possible and accused the police of planting the DNA. Defendant was arrested for the first degree murder of the victim. The detective took a buccal swab and sent it to Acadiana Crime Lab for comparison with the DNA found on the knife. The DNA analysis came back a positive match.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Detective Badeaux interviewed Mr. Feast on August 9, 2010, and again on\n   August 17, 2010. During the first interview, Mr. Feast was vague about where he was on March 29 and 30, 2010. However, Mr. Feast drove the detective around town, retracing the routes he had taken on March 29 and 30, 2010. Mr. Feast told the detective he and Defendant were \"scrapping,\" collecting metal to sell the next day. He drove through the neighborhood where Mr. Falgout was killed. At the second interview, Mr. Feast gave more information. He stated he drove Defendant to the neighborhood where Mr. Falgout was killed. Mr. Feast said he dropped Defendant off per his instructions, drove around a bit, then returned and picked Defendant up. Mr. Feast testified when Defendant jumped in the car, he told Mr. Feast to \"Hurry up, get out of here. I think I just killed somebody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Marcus Feast's testimony was consistent with Detective Badeaux's testimony. Mr. Feast explained he was vague about the incident in question during the first interview because he was high on drugs the night of the murder and really did not remember Defendant. However, when he was reminded about the marshal pulling him over in the early morning of March 30, 2010, he remembered more details of the incident. At the time of trial, Mr. Feast was on parole from a fifteen-year sentence imposed on a guilty plea for his involvement in the stabbing death of Mr. Falgout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As noted, Defendant argues the evidence was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He argues it was error to have permitted the testimony of Ms. Bourgeois and Ms. Courville. He asserts these offenses were submitted solely to show that Defendant was a bad man. However, as noted above, Defendant sought a writ of review on the issue of the admissibility of the testimony, and this court found no error in the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant also argues Mr. Feast's testimony was not credible. He contends Mr. Feast lied initially when he denied Defendant was in his vehicle on the evening of the murder. He points out Mr. Feast admitted that at the time he was high on drugs on the night of the murder. However, it is well settled the fact finder's role is to weigh the credibility of witnesses.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, Defendant and Mr. Feast were together in Mr. Feast's gold Mercedes Benz on the evening of the murder. Video surveillance showed Mr. Feast's vehicle following the victim's car on his way to deliver the pizza shortly before Mr. Falgout was discovered dead. Video surveillance from Circle K showed Mr. Feast and Defendant using Ms. Courville's credit card, stolen later in the evening. Deputy Marshal Duplechin\n   testified he had pulled Mr. Feast's vehicle over at approximately 4:00 a.m. on March 30, 2010, and Defendant was in the car. Testimony established Mr. Feast drove Defendant to the site where Mr. Falgout was killed and then picked him up a few minutes later. Mr. Feast stated Defendant said he may have just killed a man. Additionally, Mr. Falgout's wallet was missing, seemingly cut out of his pocket, to be discovered a few days later tossed into some bushes. Finally, considering the only DNA found on the knife that killed Mr. Falgout was Mr. Falgout's and Defendant's, we find there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find, while Defendant was robbing Mr. Falgout, he intentionally stabbed him several times, which resulted in his death. As noted above, specific intent can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the offense. Stabbing a person five times, three times in the chest, indicates specific intent to kill or inflict serious bodily harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He was not forced to accept a juror he felt was prejudicial to his case because all of his peremptory challenges were used. Defendant has failed to show prejudice in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The State's challenge for cause granted by the trial court\n    </em>\n    :\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court granted the State's challenge for cause for prospective juror Chelsea Lewis. Ms. Lewis stated she did not believe that people on drugs or alcohol could form the requisite intent to commit a crime. Ms. Lewis testified her biological father committed murder when he was intoxicated. She stated he was not in his right mind when he did it and should have been given a second chance. The trial court questioned Ms. Lewis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   THE COURT: Yes. If someone by chance was on drugs or alcohol, it would affect your ability to find them guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A. It does affect me. Two or three days ago if I would see him sober, I would not do this. I could find that he didn't know what he was doing and I would give him a second chance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   THE COURT: Would it affect your ability to find someone guilty or not guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Ms. Lewis then testified her husband was currently in prison for crimes committed while he was on drugs and alcohol. She admitted she had a drug and alcohol problem, and she was broke because of it. She continued to assert she did not believe someone on drugs could form the requisite intent to commit crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The State challenged Ms. Lewis for cause pointing out she explicitly stated that a person on drugs and/or alcohol was not capable of forming the intent to commit a crime. Defense counsel objected, stating that Ms. Lewis did say she would try to be fair and impartial. The trial court granted the State's challenge for cause, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   THE COURT: I will excuse her for cause in regards to drugs and alcohol especially what she said about drugs and alcohol. She doesn't believe people can form an intent if they're on drugs and alcohol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   She may have a hard time. The State would have a hard time convincing her. She is excused for cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In brief, Defendant argues Ms. Lewis was sufficiently rehabilitated when, upon questioning by defense counsel, she had said that she would try to be fair should she be picked for the jury. However, in\n   <em>\n    Munson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998567\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/115/6/#p12\">\n    115 So.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant argued the trial court erred when it granted the state's challenge for cause of a potential juror who expressed strong reluctance to convict based on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness. The fifth circuit noted, under Louisiana jurisprudence, a single witness' testimony was usually sufficient in the absence of internal contradiction or irreconcilable conflict with the evidence. After an attempt to rehabilitate the juror, the trial court stated \" 'I'm convinced after listening to Ms. Herbert,\n   no matter what the state proves in testimony alone, she thinks there is a high burden, higher burden, so I'm going to grant their motion for cause.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998567\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/115/6/#p12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998567\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/115/6/#p12\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the current case, Ms. Lewis' opinion regarding the effect of drugs and alcohol on the mental capacity to form intent placed an impossible burden on the State. If a defendant proves he was intoxicated at the time of the offense, the state then has the burden of negating that defense by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ms. Lewis's responses reflected a bias and an inability to render a judgment according to the law. We cannot say the trial court abused its discretion when it granted the State's challenge for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Trial court's release of a potential juror for cause\n    </em>\n    :\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Simone Broussard told the State she did not want to be on the jury. She stated she was not a good judge of character. She suffered from anxiety and was on medication for the anxiety. Although she had no opinion of Defendant's guilt or innocence, she stated it made her very nervous having to make judgment on someone. She said if she were picked for the jury she would not be able to communicate with the other jurors. Later, when the prospective jurors were asked by the State if the State met its burden of proof could they convict Defendant to a life sentence, Ms. Broussard repeated she did not \"want to be the deciding factor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The State challenged Ms. Broussard for cause because of her apparent anxiety and her admission she would not be able to communicate with the rest of the jurors. The trial court denied the challenge. Defense counsel thought Ms. Broussard would work it out if she were chosen as a juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The trial court later stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, Ms. Simone Broussard, Number 120. It was observed in the bathroom by court personnel during the break-she's been complaining about anxiety problems, telling me she has anxiety problems. She's breaking down in the bathroom right now crying hysterically. The inference was made that they wouldn't be able to get her out of the bathroom. So, I've noticed as the day progresses that she's getting quieter and quieter and quieter and not answering the questions. She's being very low. I think there's cause there, obviously. She won't be able to pay attention in this trial if she's breaking down and having problems. So I'm releasing her at this point. I don't think she could make it through the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defense counsel objected without reason. In brief, Defendant argues he did not have an opportunity to question Ms. Broussard. The record shows defense counsel questioned Ms. Broussard during the voir dire process. Moreover, while defense counsel objected, he did not state a reason for his objection. A defendant is limited to the grounds he stated at the time of the trial court's ruling to support his objection. A new basis for an objection may not be first raised on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.
