By its very application to only murderers under the age of 18, the provisions of La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1 mandating a\n   sentencing hearing at which the defense will be given an opportunity to present mitigating factors-which obviously include the defendant's age as an important part of his social history-satisfy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's requirement that mitigating factors favoring a juvenile killer be heard in a proceeding held for that purpose...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ... life without parole is still a constitutionally acceptable sentence for adult killers and it is not a prohibited sentence for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   juvenile killers. Our legislature carefully designed an adequate solution by adding a new statute pertaining to parole eligibility for juvenile killers which is to be read in conjunction with the first and second degree murder statutes. In the event that the trial court imposes a life sentence with parole eligibility, La. R.S. 15:574.4(E) provides conditions which must be satisfied before the defendant can apply to the parole board for parole consideration.
