A prisoner, Timothy Gene Pryer, filed an action in chancery court against the Itawamba County Sheriff's Department and the Itawamba County Circuit Clerk. Pryer claimed that the defendants wrongfully had denied him access to public records under the Mississippi Public Records Act, entitling him to civil damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2025-61-15\">\n    Miss.

More than three years after filing the complaint, Pryer filed a motion for leave to amend it to add a Public Records Act claim against Circuit Judge Thomas Gardner, III. Pryer alleged that, in deeming his public records request a motion for post-conviction relief, and then denying it, Judge Gardner had violated the Public Records Act, entitling Pryer to civil damages. The Chancery Court of Itawamba County granted Judge Gardner's motion to dismiss, and Pryer appeals. Because Pryer's claim against Judge Gardner is barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity, we affirm the dismissal of his amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2.

This Court found that Pryer had filed a motion to show cause in circuit court rather than following the statutory procedure set forth by the Public Records Act, which provides for the institution of a suit in chancery court by \"any person denied the right granted by Section 25-61-5 to inspect or copy public records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 715-16 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2025-61-13\">\n    Miss.

During the pendency of his appellate litigation, on July 3, 2013, Pryer filed the instant action in the Chancery Court of Itawamba County against the Itawamba County Sheriff's Department and the Itawamba County Circuit Clerk. He claimed that these entities were liable for civil penalties for failing to respond to his public records requests made on May 18, 2011;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   July 5, 2011; August 2, 2012; and September 13, 2012, asking for copies of capiases served on December 2, 2004.

Despite his efforts at achieving proper service, Pryer never served the defendants with his complaint. On June 23, 2014, he filed a motion to amend his complaint to add Judge Gardner as a defendant. On October 13, 2016, the chancellor entered an order granting the motion to amend, finding that no responsive pleading had been filed and that amendment would not be prejudicial to adverse parties. Pryer filed his amended complaint on November 1, 2016. In the amended complaint, Pryer made the following allegations against Judge Gardner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant Thomas J. Gardner is Circuit Court Judge in Itawamba County. After receiving the request for Public Records addressed to Defendant Gates, Gardner held the request to be a Post-Conviction Relief Petition, and den[ied] those records to Pryer on June 3, 2011. On June 15, 2011 A.D. Pryer filed a Motion to Show Cause in the Circuit Court asking why he was being denied access to Public Records by the Circuit Court even after offering payment for said records. On December 19, 2011 A.D., Pryer filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus with the Supreme Court of Mississippi to compel Defendant Gardner to answer Pryer[']s Motion to Show Cause. Defendant Gardner was ordered to respond and on January 20, 2012 denied Pryer Public Records citing \"no free documents.\" Defendant Gardner has denied Pryer access to Public Records twice in violation of MCA \u00a7 25-61-5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   He claimed that Judge Gardner's two alleged violations of the Public Records Act entitled him to an additional $200 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 6. Pryer served Judge Gardner with process. On January 12, 2017, Judge Gardner moved to dismiss Pryer's claim against him under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the basis of judicial immunity or, alternatively, because the statute of limitations had expired. On March 30, 2017, the chancellor granted Judge Gardner's motion to dismiss. The chancellor found that Pryer's complaint was against a judge in his judicial capacity and that judicial immunity shielded Judge Gardner from liability. The chancellor also held that the action against Judge Gardner was time barred because the amended complaint was filed outside the limitations period. Finding no just reason for delay, the chancellor directed the entry of a final judgment in favor of Judge Gardner pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). The chancellor denied Pryer's motion for reconsideration. Pryer has appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 7.

Pryer contends that Judge Gardner lacked jurisdiction to enter the 2011 and 2012 orders, so judicial immunity does not apply to his actions. The difficulty with Pryer's argument is that this Court explicitly has held that Judge Gardner had jurisdiction to enter the orders. In Pryer's earlier action challenging the denials of his requests for documents, he argued that \"the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a Public Records request as a Post Conviction Relief petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Pryer\n   </em>\n   , 139 So.3d at 716. This Court held that, because the 2011 order was not in the record and nothing in the 2012 order showed Judge Gardner had treated Pryer's filings as a post-conviction relief matter, \"the record provides no indication that the circuit court treated Pryer's Motion to Show Cause as a petition for post-conviction relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 716. Recognizing the fact that the Mississippi Constitution vests jurisdiction in the circuit courts \"in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   matters civil and criminal in this state not vested by this Constitution in some other court,\" the Court held that the circuit court had jurisdiction to rule upon Pryer's filings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 715, 716 (citing Miss. Const. Art. 6 \u00a7 156 ). Because it is beyond question that Judge Gardner had jurisdiction to rule on Pryer's filings, judicial immunity insulates him from Pryer's civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 12. Pryer also argues that the provision in Section 21-61-15 that \"[a]ny person\" may be liable for denying another access to public records abrogates judicial immunity. He argues that, because Section 21-61-15 says \"any person,\" and because a judge is a person, Section 21-61-15 includes a private right of action against a judge. This argument tasks the Court with determining whether Section 21-61-15 abrogates the common law doctrine of judicial immunity. \"The function of the Court is not to decide what a statute should provide, but to determine what it\n   does provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037847\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/1024/#p1027\">\n    75 So.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1027 (Miss. 2011). When engaging in this function, the Court seeks to give effect to the intent of the legislature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037847\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/1024/#p1027\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court first examines the language of the statute; if the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, the Court will apply the plain meaning of the statute and refrain from applying principles of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037847\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/1024/#p1027\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 13. The State points out that the United States Supreme Court rejected an extremely similar argument to Pryer's in\n   <em>\n    Pierson\n   </em>\n   . There, the Supreme Court examined\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which creates a cause of action against \"every person\" who under color of law deprives another person of his civil rights, to determine whether the statute abrogated judicial immunity.\n   <em>\n    Pierson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n    386 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court held that the language of the statute itself contained no indication that Congress intended to abolish the hallowed common law principle of judicial immunity to provide a cause of action against a judge for a Section 1983 violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n    at 554-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the language of Section 25-61-15 contains no indication that, by its enactment, the Mississippi Legislature intended to abrogate judicial immunity. Because there is no textual indication whatsoever that the legislature intended to abrogate judicial immunity, we decline to read the \"any person\" language in Section 25-61-15 as a limitation on judicial immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burns v. Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8818181\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/202/240/#p243\">\n    202 Miss. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8818181\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/202/240/#p243\">\n    31 So.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (1947) (if the legislature intended to abrogate a requirement of the common law, \"it must be held to have retained so much thereof as is not specifically dispensed with.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 14. Finally, Pryer argues that this Court, in its opinion affirming the denial of his documents requests, held that he was entitled to seek damages from Judge Gardner in chancery court. This argument is without merit. While in the earlier case we mentioned that Pryer could file a suit seeking the documents under Section 25-61-13(1)(a) in chancery court, the Court in no way condoned, encouraged, or authorized Pryer to file an action against Judge Gardner seeking civil damages under Section 25-61-15.\n   <em>\n    Pryer\n   </em>\n   , 139 So.3d at 716.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 15. Pryer and Judge Gardner both make arguments pertaining to the circuit court's finding, in the alternative, that the amended complaint against Judge Gardner was barred by the statute of limitations. Because we affirm the dismissal of Pryer's amended complaint on the ground of judicial immunity, we decline to address the circuit court's alternative finding that the claim also was time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 16. Because Pryer's claim against Judge Gardner is barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity, we affirm the chancery court's dismissal of the amended complaint for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 17.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH, P.J., KING, COLEMAN, MAXWELL, BEAM, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Although the order does not appear in the record, in a prior decision of this Court, we quoted Pryer's allegations concerning the order made in his \"Motion to Show Cause,\" filed on June 20, 2011.\n    <em>\n     Pryer\n    </em>\n    , 139 So.3d at 714.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    On December 11, 2017, the State filed a motion to strike six exhibits attached to Pryer's reply brief and his arguments associated with those exhibits on the ground that the exhibits were not in the record.

Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 30(a) provides that \"[a]ppeals shall be on the record as designated pursuant to Rule 10.\" M.R.A.P. 30(a).
