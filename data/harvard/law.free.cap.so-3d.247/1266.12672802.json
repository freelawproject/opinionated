Paul and Sylvia Minor's home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. The Minors had a homeowner's insurance policy with United Services Automobile Association (USAA). The policy provided coverage limits for: house-$1,028,000, boathouse and shed-$102,800; guest cottage-$108,000; detached carport-$41,000; personal property-$771,000; and jewelry, watches, furs, and silverware-$4,000. The policy also included a two-percent named-storm deductible and covered damage caused by wind but excluded damage caused by storm surge or flood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The Minors reported their loss to USAA in January 2006. USAA assigned adjusters to inspect the property and hired an independent engineering firm to inspect the structure to determine the extent of damage as a result of Hurricane Katrina's storm surge or winds. USAA issued payments for the damage that it concluded was caused by wind and did not pay for damage it determined was caused by storm surge or flood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. The Minors were not satisfied with USAA's payments and claimed that they suffered a total loss caused by wind. The Minors demanded USAA pay the policy limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. On August 14, 2008, the Minors filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Jackson County. The complaint asked for \"monetary damages for all losses incurred,\" and punitive and extracontractual damages due to USAA's bad-faith refusal to pay their claim for benefits under the homeowner's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. On August 9, 2013, USAA served a motion for partial summary judgment as to the Minors' claims for punitive and extracontractual damages. The circuit court agreed and granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. The case then went to trial on all other claims. A jury returned a verdict, on September 20, 2013, in the amount of $1,547,293.37. After the posttrial motions were denied, the Minors filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    I. Whether the circuit court erred by granting the motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of punitive and extracontractual damages.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. In\n   <em>\n    Karpinsky v. American National Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000060\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/109/84/#p88\">\n    109 So.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88-89 (\u00b6\u00b6 9-11) (Miss. 2013), the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I. Standard of Review\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion has been made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   II. The Summary Judgment Standard\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate and shall be rendered if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Importantly, the party opposing summary judgment may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, will be entered against him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court has explained that in a summary judgment hearing, the burden of producing evidence in support of, or in opposition to, the motion is a function of Mississippi rules regarding the burden of proof at trial on the issues in question. The movant bears the burden of persuading the trial judge that: (1) no genuine issue of material fact exists, and (2) on the basis of the facts established, he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The movant bears the burden of production if, at trial, he would bear the burden of proof on the issue raised. In other words, the movant only bears the burden of production where [he] would bear the burden of proof at trial. Furthermore, summary judgment is appropriate when the non-moving party has failed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    B. USAA's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8. USAA served the motion for partial summary judgment on the deadline to file motions set in the scheduling order. The motion was scheduled for hearing and was rescheduled several times. The circuit court heard argument on the motion on September 9 and entered an order granting the motion on September 10, the same day that voir dire began. Opening statements began on September 11. At the conclusion of the trial, the Minors asked the court to reconsider its earlier ruling on the motion for partial summary judgment, and the court declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9. USAA's motion raised three issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. USAA has had legitimate and arguable reasons for handling the Minors' claims as it has.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. USAA never acted with malice, gross negligence or reckless disregard for the Minors' rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. As a matter of law, the Minors cannot recover extra-contractual damages because they cannot prove that USAA did not have an arguable basis for its actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 10. The Minors' punitive damage claim was for USAA's alleged bad-faith failure to pay their claim or its delay in payment. To prevail, the Minors had to prove that USAA did not have a legitimate and arguable reason for how it adjusted and paid the Minors' claims. According to USAA, the supreme court has defined an \"arguable reason\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   An arguable reason is one in support of which there is some credible evidence. There may well be evidence to the contrary. A person is said to have an arguable reason for acting if there is some credible evidence that supports the conclusions on the basis of which he acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, Inc. v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7623446\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/466/833/#p851\">\n    466 So.2d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (Miss. 1984). The Court has further held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   We are of the opinion that the term \"legitimate or arguable reason,\" although spawning much comment in our cases and in briefs and arguments of counsel, is nothing more than an expression indicating the act or acts of the alleged tortfeasor do not rise to the heightened level of an independent tort. Additionally, the very term expresses the holding of this Court establishing a distinction between ordinary torts, the product of forgetfulness, oversight, or the like; and heightened torts, which are the product of gross, callous or wanton conduct, or, if intentional, are accompanied by fraud or deceit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7589788\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/477/242/#p250\">\n    477 So.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (Miss. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 11. USAA argued that there was no genuine issue as to a material fact in dispute and that it was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. M.R.C.P. 56(c). This required that the circuit court and now this Court use the summary-judgment standard to review whether USAA conducted a timely investigation into the losses, the loss mechanisms, and the Minors' claims that arose therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 12. The Minors' property was significantly damaged. The Minors did not have flood insurance, but did have a standard homeowner's policy. It contained a water-damage exclusion that excluded claims caused by \"flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind.\" \"Storm surge\" was contained within the \"water damage\" exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Corban v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7052062\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/20/601/#p611\">\n    20 So.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611 (\u00b6 26) (Miss. 2009) (holding that \"storm surge\" is contained unambiguously within the \"water damage\" exclusion of a USAA policy, and no other \"logical interpretation\" exists). During its investigation and adjustment, USAA sought to pay the amounts that it determined were owed under the policy for wind-related damage and not pay for damage caused by storm surge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 13. USAA explained how it handled the Minors' claims. USAA began its investigation after the Minors reported the claim. The initial investigation included, but was not limited to: a site inspection by a USAA adjuster; discussions with the Minors, including a request for an inventory of contents; and an inspection, investigation, and preparation of a report on the loss mechanisms by PT&amp;C, an independent professional engineering firm. USAA specifically requested that PT&amp;C take the following action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   a. inspect the structure and ... determine the extent of the damage as a result of Hurricane Katrina's storm surge and/or winds, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   b. determine the feasibility of repair to the structure as well as the integrity of the structures and foundations at the time of PT&amp;C's inspection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After inspection, PT&amp;C prepared an assessment that concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   a. the insured property experienced wind-related damage to the shingles; canopies and/or overhangs; trim material; window systems; and soffit and fascia material around the eaves of the structure as a result of winds, with estimated speeds above 110 miles per hour; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   b. the remainder of the structure was destroyed by the estimated ten (10) foot storm surge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 14. As a result of its investigation and the PT&amp;C report, USAA adjusted the dwelling/other structures claim and issued a $37,245.86 check to the Minors (which included $2,000 for additional living expenses). USAA did not submit a payment for the Minors' contents claim because it claimed the Minors had not yet submitted an inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 15. USAA also argues that it repeatedly asked the Minors to provide more information so USAA could further adjust the claim. After several requests, USAA argues, Paul Minor finally submitted a floor plan and several pre-storm photographs of the house. He also notified the USAA adjusters that his house had been evaluated for value in the past and that evaluation by vendors for USAA would contain more photographs and diagrams. USAA contends it then immediately recalled the value evaluations from storage, used the additional floor plan and photographs, and reevaluated the estimates of wind damage based upon this new information. Shortly thereafter, USAA updated its original adjustment and issued a supplemental check in the amount of $194,322.85 for damage to the dwelling/other structures. At this point, USAA had made a total dwelling/other structures payment for wind damage of $231,568.71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 16. USAA also argues that the Minors did not present a contents list to USAA until after filing the complaint and in response to discovery. Further, USAA claimed that the list did not give specific descriptions of the contents, did not include estimated purchase prices, and did not include the condition of the property. Nevertheless, USAA evaluated the contents lists for the items that may have been damaged by wind or windblown rain, and made payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 17. USAA also argued that the Mississippi Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    United Services Automobile Association v. Lisanby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n    47 So.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2010), was \"instructive.\" USAA asserted that, in\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court held that USAA had an arguable basis for its denial of a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n    at 1178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, USAA argued that the following facts were sufficient for the\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   court to find that USAA had legitimate and arguable reasons for its claims handling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   1. USAA did not arbitrarily declare that the damage was caused solely by flood;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   2. USAA opened a homeowners' claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   3. USAA completed its investigation before attributing the majority of the damage to flood; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   4. USAA prepared the wind damage estimates after receiving the independent engineering report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In essence, USAA argued that the facts in this case were the same as in\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   ; therefore, USAA asked the court to find that there was no genuine issue of a material fact in dispute and USAA was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. M.R.C.P. 56(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Circuit Court's Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 18. The circuit court agreed with USAA. The court entered an order that found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The Minors made claims for extra-contractual damages, including attorney's\n   fees and punitive damages. The undisputed facts show that USAA had an arguable or reasonable basis for its claims decisions. The Minors did show credible material proof that USAA did not have a reasonable or arguable reason to make its claims decisions.\n   <em>\n    United Servs. Auto. Ass'n v. Lisanby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n    47 So.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (Miss. 2010) provided this Court with the necessary guidance. In\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   , the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in favor of USAA on the extracontractual and punitive damages claims based upon USAA's same claims handling practices and decisions for the same Hurricane Katrina. As a matter of law, USAA acted with an arguable basis, and without malice, reckless disregard or gross negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    D. This Court's Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 19. A motion for summary judgment is governed by Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   There are two parts to this rule. First, the court must determine that there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the court must determine that the movant is \"entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 20. Our review is de novo. But we start with the circuit court's order and consider its findings. The order appears to contain an obvious contradiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 21. The circuit court found that \"[t]he undisputed facts show that USAA had an arguable or reasonable basis for its claims decisions.\" Yet, in the next sentence, the court also found \"[t]he Minors\n   <em>\n    did show\n   </em>\n   credible material proof that\n   <em>\n    USAA did not have a reasonable or arguable reason\n   </em>\n   to make its claims decisions.\" (Emphasis added). As early as\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Credit Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7625006,7625102\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/444/358/\">\n    444 So.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362 (Miss. 1983), the court recognized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A motion for summary judgment lies only where there is no genuine issue of material fact; summary judgment is not a substitute for the trial of disputed fact issues. Accordingly, the court cannot try issues of fact on a Rule 56 motion; it may only determine whether there are issues to be tried.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 22. A summary judgment motion requires that the circuit court and this court consider not whether USAA has presented evidence to prove that it possessed a legitimate or arguable basis for its claims decisions. Instead, we must decide whether there is a genuine issue of a material fact in dispute as to whether USAA possessed a legitimate or arguable basis for its claims decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 23. The circuit court's finding that \"[t]he Minors\n   <em>\n    did show\n   </em>\n   credible material proof that\n   <em>\n    USAA did not have a reasonable or arguable reason\n   </em>\n   to make its claims decisions\" leads to the conclusion that this finding was and should have been enough to defeat the motion for partial summary judgment. This finding acknowledges that there was a genuine issue of a material fact in dispute, which would prohibit the grant of a summary judgment under Rule 56(c) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 24. Next, the circuit court relied on\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   , to conclude that, \"[a]s a matter of law, USAA acted with an arguable basis, and without malice, reckless disregard or gross negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   is indeed \"instructive,\" but there are important differences. In\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court did not\n   grant a partial summary judgment as to punitive or extracontractual damages before trial. Instead, after hearing all of the evidence presented at trial, the court \"declined to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury, but awarded the plaintiffs an additional $302,920.44 in attorneys' fees and $211,069.47 in litigation expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n    47 So.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 25. Further, the\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   court did not rule that USAA's Hurricane Katrina claims practices were proper. Instead, the court merely affirmed the circuit court's decision to deny further consideration of punitive damages because it found: \"[O]n appeal, the plaintiffs cite numerous instances of conduct that they contend support a finding that USAA acted in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    However, most of these allegations are not supported by the record,\n   </em>\n   and USAA persuasively disputes all of them without response from the plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n    at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19) (emphasis added). We find that the circuit court's finding that \"[i]n\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   , the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in favor of USAA on the extra-contractual and punitive damages claims based upon USAA's same claims handling practices and decisions for the same Hurricane Katrina\" was an incorrect statement of the supreme court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   . In fact, in\n   <em>\n    Lisanby\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court held that the plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence that would allow the punitive- and extracontractual-damage claims from going to the jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n    at 1178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 19-24). Hence, the court affirmed the circuit court's decision, after hearing evidence at trial, to deny the plaintiffs an opportunity to present their punitive-damage claim and reversed and rendered the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045405\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/1172/\">\n    at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 24). Such finding does not support the grant of summary judgment here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 26. Based on our review, we find that there was evidentiary support for several issues that would support the Minors' claims for punitive and extracontractual damages. We limit our discussion to two important issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 27. First, the evidence of USAA's failure to consider the information that the Minors had provided to USAA in the pre-Katrina underwriting was a genuine issue of material fact in dispute. In paragraph 16 above, we discuss USAA's contention that \"it repeatedly requested the Minors to provide more information so USAA could further adjust the claim\" and then USAA argued that \"after many requests, Paul Minor ... notified the USAA adjusters that his house had been evaluated for value in the past and that evaluation by vendors for USAA would contain more photographs and diagrams.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 28. On at least two occasions before Hurricane Katrina, in 1994 and again in 2001, USAA sent underwriters to visit the Minors' property. The purpose of these visits was for USAA to evaluate the underwriting risk and determine the appropriate premium to be charged. Thus, before the storm and the damage, USAA had a substantial amount of information about the Minors' property that would be, and ultimately was, useful in the adjustment of the Minors' claims. This was evidence that USAA had detailed information in its possession from the beginning of the Minors' claim that it did not use; and had USAA used the information in a timely manner, the Minors' claims would have been paid much sooner. In fact, once USAA used this information, it issued a supplemental check for damage to dwelling/other structures. The Minors correctly argue that this information was at all times available to USAA, as it was part of USAA's corporate records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 29. From the time the claim was initiated, USAA had in its possession the 1994 and 2001 inspections and appraisal reports that established and set the value of the structures and contents; along with detailed diagrams showing square footage of the home, guest house and other structures; in addition to the numerous photographs of these buildings showing the location of all windows (approximately 90) and the unique floor-to-ceiling glass doors and windows that are 360 degrees around the house. Included in the appraisal reports were numerous photographs that depicted the Minors' personal contents located in every room in the house and \"special features\" that discussed the high quality of their personal property, i.e., \"antique rugs throughout the home\"; \"special marble\"; \"fine arts and expensive jewelry\"; and \"a collection of fine wine\" in the wine cellar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 30. Also, USAA had an engineer's report entered into its Information Management System (IMS) by adjuster Teri Bergstrom that put USAA on notice that all the window systems had been damaged by the wind forces of Katrina, along with her \"confidential\" conclusion that this report makes USAA \"accountable to replace all the windows and opens\" up payment for \"contents in all the rooms (the entire house) with windows.\" The confidential memo, which was not entered in the IMS, included a comment by Bergstrom about what their USAA team leader would think about the engineer's window observations: \"If we're paying for all the windows it would open up contents in all the rooms with windows. You may want to discuss this with your team leader.\" Bergstrom's final words were, \"You know he won't be happy w/that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 31. Based on this information, it appears that USAA's adjuster concluded that USAA was accountable to pay for the losses to contents in the entire home. Yet USAA did not make a payment for loss of contents for almost four years, until May 2013, approximately three months before the commencement of the trial, and for only $67,864.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 32. This is certainly evidence that there is a genuine issue as to a material fact in dispute as to why USAA had engineering information in its possession, since March 2006, that concluded all of the windows in the main structure were destroyed by wind and that would make USAA liable for all of the contents in those rooms; yet no payment was made until just before the trial. There was also evidence that there is a genuine issue as to a material fact in dispute as to why USAA told the Minors, in a letter dated June 18, 2006, that \"based on its engineer report\" USAA would only consider payment for contents on the southern elevation, when the engineer and the USAA adjuster had said the insurance company was accountable for contents in all of the rooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 33. We find that this evidence was sufficient to conclude that there was a genuine issue of a material fact in dispute as to whether USAA had an arguable and legitimate basis to deny or delay payment to the Minors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 34. Second, there was a genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to the damage caused by the storm surge. As discussed in paragraph 14 above, USAA hired PT&amp;C, an independent professional engineering firm, which opined that \"the remainder of the structure was destroyed by the estimated ten (10) foot storm surge.\" There was evidence of an Elevation Certificate, dated April 2006, that indicated the Minors' property was at an elevation of almost fifteen feet, which would have been above the storm surge. In fact, the exact amount of storm surge was in dispute in this trial. There was evidence at trial that the storm surge was as high as twenty-one\n   feet. Regardless, there was conflicting evidence as to the height of storm surge and whether there was a legitimate or arguable basis for USAA to determine that a storm surge caused or contributed to the destruction of the residence. Ultimately, this was an issue decided by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 35. To be clear, this Court does not find that the Minors are entitled to present their claims for punitive or extracontractual damages to a jury. Instead, we merely find that there was a genuine issue of material fact in dispute and that USAA was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on this issue before trial. Thus, we conclude that it was reversible error for the circuit court to grant USAA's motion for partial summary judgment and dismiss the Minors' claim for punitive and extracontractual damages before trial. Therefore, we reverse and remand this issue for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    II. Whether the court erred in giving Jury Instruction D-29b\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 36.

The Minors argue that Instruction D-29b peremptorily capped and limited the amount of damages the jury could award. Specifically, they claim that Instruction D-29b \"incorrectly included $86,947.78 for depreciation and deductible\" for the main house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Minors argue that rather than allowing the jury to award the total value owed to the Minors, the circuit court \"invaded the province of the jury and preempted their verdict by incorrectly allowing USAA to receive credits of the main structure for 'recoverable depreciation.' \" However, such argument does not consider the clear and unambiguous\n   policy language that included a two-percent deductible and required payment of actual cash value unless repair or replacement was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 46. The Minors also argue that Instruction D-29b incorrectly included depreciation of $140,225.92 for the personal property. The Minors argue that by incorrectly allowing USAA to depreciate the true value of the contents, Instruction D-29b left the Minors with a shortfall of $140,225.92. However, the policy clearly provided for payment on an actual-cash-value basis. To determine the actual cash value, USAA was required to estimate replacement cost, less depreciation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 47. The amounts included in Instruction D-29b for the house and personal property represent the estimated replacement cost of the wind-damaged items. Pursuant to the policy, the Minors were compensated for these wind-damaged items on an actual-cash-value basis, with depreciation to be paid when replacement was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 48. There was no evidence that the Minors repaired or replaced the items to which the recoverable depreciation applies. Thus, the Minors are not entitled to recover the depreciation. Although the Minors take issue with USAA's adjustment of their claims, such issue does not affect the plain language of their policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 49. USAA inspected the property and issued payment for damage it concluded was caused by wind. Instruction D-29b asks the jury to determine whether there was any additional damage caused by wind over and above what was already considered by USAA. Although Instruction D-29b limits the amount of damages the jury can award, such limitation was consistent with the policy language and was supported by the facts. Thus, we find no error in the circuit court's decision to give Instruction D-29b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    III.

Here, we find sufficient evidence to support the verdict. The jury considered the evidence and found additional damage was caused solely by wind or wind-driven rain. The damages awarded were consistent with the policy language and supported by the facts. The Minors' request for the policy limits ignores the clear and unambiguous language in their policy that USAA will pay no more than the actual cash value of the damage unless actual repair or replacement is complete. Thus, we find no merit to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 53. Finally, on appeal, the Minors ask this Court to correct the judgment by granting an additur in the amount of $88,647.75 for the structures and $140,225.92 for the personal property. Thus, the Minors want this Court to award the depreciation amounts as well as the deductible.

On appeal in seeking reversal of the summary judgment granted below, the Minors assert the two following arguments as support for their claim for punitive and extracontractual damages: (1) that USAA lacked an arguable basis for its conclusion that a storm surge caused or contributed to the destruction of the Minors' residence and (2) that USAA lacked an arguable basis for its decision to not immediately pay the Minors their personal-property limits. I will separately address the record support for the circuit court's findings and grant of summary judgment for the dwelling/other structures claim and the personal-property claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b6 64. Regarding the Minors' dwelling/other structures claim, the record herein supports the circuit court's determination that USAA possessed an arguable basis when determining a storm surge caused some of the damage, as evidenced by USAA's reliance on independent engineer reports, adjustment inspections, photographs, and adjustment decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record is undisputed that Hurricane Katrina hit on August 29, 2005, and that the Minors reported their loss to USAA on January 16, 2006. The record shows that USAA immediately assigned adjusters to inspect the property and, within a week of the Minors' claim, USAA hired PT&amp;C, an independent professional engineering firm, to inspect and offer a professional opinion as to causation, i.e., wind versus flood/storm surge, to determine if direct physical loss by wind contributed to the damage to the residence. USAA sought clarification from PT&amp;C regarding damage to the window systems, and PT&amp;C submitted the engineering report to USAA on March 2, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 65. On March 20, 2006, USAA asked the Minors for a floor plan of the residence but failed to receive the information from the Minors for over seven months. Despite lacking the floor plan, the record reflects that USAA adjusted the loss by relying on the engineer's report, adjuster information, and photographs. The record also reflects that on June 18, 2006, USAA advised the Minors that the majority of the damage to their home was the result of flooding and that an estimate of the wind damage was created based upon information then available. The replacement cost for the covered damage to the main dwelling, the guest house, and the carport was $55,805.86, and USAA paid the actual cash value of $35,245.86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6 66. The record further reflects that USAA informed the Minors by letter dated June 18, 2006, that the dwelling/other structures claim was being held open because USAA had not yet received the requested floor plan, pre-loss photos, and personal-property list. According to the record, on October 24, 2006, and on December 5, 2006, Paul Minor provided the floor plan for the house and a few photos of the exterior of the home and explained that the remainder of the photos were lost in the hurricane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 67. In response to information provided by Paul, USAA then tracked down prior\n   evaluations from 1994 and 2000. Despite still lacking some requested details, USAA then used this new information to estimate the wind damage more accurately. On March 29, 2007, USAA made a supplemental actual-cash-value payment to the Minors of $194,322.85. The record reflects that the Minors were advised that the amount of $66,387.77 was still available in recoverable depreciation that they could obtain for the covered damage upon completion of the repairs, in accordance with the terms of the Minors' replacement-cost policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 68. The record shows that Minors received total payments of $229,568.71 for the wind damage to their insured structures. The Minors failed to provide any information to USAA disputing the PT&amp;C engineer report until the Minors presented their expert reports as part of this lawsuit. Clearly, the record supports the circuit court's finding of an arguable basis in support of USAA's payment and adjustment decisions regarding the Minors' dwelling/other structures claims given the evidence of USAA's reliance on the report of an independent engineer, claims-adjuster inspections, photographs, and information provided by the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 69. With respect to the adjustment of the Minors' personal-property claim, the record also supports the circuit court's determination that USAA's decisions similarly possessed an arguable basis. In adjusting the Minors' personal-property claim, the record reflects that USAA relied on PT&amp;C's engineer report, information from the adjuster, information from the Minors, and photographs to determine which rooms could have had contents damaged by wind prior to the storm surge of Hurricane Katrina. Moreover, the record reflects that USAA repeatedly requested a list of the Minors' damaged personal property and that for three years, the Minors failed to provide any information about their personal property. Moreover, the list eventually provided by the Minors failed to contain the amount of detail required under the policy or in the discovery request; specifically, the list provided no quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of the loss. The Minors also failed to provide any bills, receipts, and related documents to justify the figures in the inventory. USAA even resorted to filing a motion to compel for the depositions of the Minors' children, both of whom possessed knowledge of the house and its contents prior to the hurricane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 70. Despite the lack of required detail, the record shows that USAA adjusted the Minors' personal-property claim relying on information about the damage to the structure when determining which damaged contents were covered. Using the independent engineer and the adjuster reports, USAA adjusted the Minors' personal-property claim, paying for certain items in rooms that had wind-related damage, and the adjuster researched the value of the damaged items. As acknowledged by the majority opinion, the record reflects without dispute that the Minors possessed a replacement-cost insurance policy that excluded damage caused by water/flood or storm surge. The record is also not in dispute that the Minors possessed no flood insurance. The record shows that since the contents had not been replaced, USAA provided the policy-mandated actual-cash-value payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b6 71. Based upon the foregoing, the undisputed record reflects no unreasonable delay by USAA in the payment of and adjustment of the Minors' personal-property claim. In support of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment and findings, the record also shows without dispute that USAA possessed an arguable basis for its payment and adjustment decisions in its\n   reliance upon the independent engineer reports, photographs, adjuster information, and information from the Minors, including the delinquently provided contents list that lacked the required detail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I therefore would affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   WILSON, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Any party to a civil action may move for summary judgment upon a claim as to which there is no genuine issue of material fact and upon which the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R.C.P. 56(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sobley v.
