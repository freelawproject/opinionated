A DeSoto County jury convicted Everett Moore of second-degree murder for shooting and killing Norris Smith. The Circuit Court of DeSoto County, Mississippi, sentenced Moore to thirty years' imprisonment. We reverse Moore's conviction\n   and sentence and remand the case for a new trial because the trial court committed reversible error in denying Moore's proposed circumstantial evidence jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On September 29, 2015, at 12:07 p.m., Officer Walter Medford of the Olive Branch Police Department responded to reports of an accident with injuries. Upon arrival at the scene, Officer Medford observed a white Nissan Altima that had collided with a building. Officer Medford testified that he \"noticed a black male ... in the driver's seat slumped over the arm rest\" who was unresponsive and who \"appeared to have a gun shot wound to his head.\" The window on the driver's side \"was broken out.\" Investigator Roger Hutchins, who is Chief Inspector of the Detective Division of the DeSoto County Sheriff's Department, testified that a badge was found under the driver's seat of the vehicle which identified the victim as Norris Smith. Investigator Hutchins interviewed Smith's wife, who, \"right off the bat,\" said that the shooter was Moore. Over defense counsel's hearsay objection, Investigator Hutchins testified that Smith's wife stated that \"there had been an ongoing problem with Mr. Moore accusing Norris Smith, the victim, of having an affair with his wife.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Because the surrounding area where Smith's vehicle was located is heavily industrialized, the DeSoto County Sherriff's Department was able to obtain video surveillance footage from View, Inc.; Anda Pharmaceuticals; McKesson Pharmaceutical Distribution; Syncreon Security Technology; and Williams-Sonoma.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Steve English of the Criminal Investigations Division of the DeSoto County Sheriff's Department testified that he assisted in gathering and reviewing all surveillance video footage pertinent to the investigation. According to Detective English, the Syncreon surveillance video footage from September 29, 2015, captured Norris Smith, who that same day had begun working at Syncreon Security Technology, coming out of the building where he worked during the lunch hour (some time between 11:38 p.m. and 12:00 p.m.) and getting into a Nissan Altima which belonged to his wife. The Syncreon surveillance video footage then showed Moore's white SUV pulling in behind Smith's vehicle. According to the surveillance video footage and the testimony of Detective English, at approximately 12:00 p.m., Moore exited his SUV and approached the driver's side of Smith's vehicle. Moore leaned on Smith's vehicle and appeared from the surveillance video to be \"having some sort of conversation with [Smith].\" After their brief conversation concluded, Moore returned to his SUV and \"proceeded to drive west through the parking lot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Detective English also took a number of \"screen captures of the images that are shown of the surveillance video.\" That series of screen captures-still photographs of images from various surveillance videos-was received in evidence as Exhibit 29. According to Detective English's interpretation, the screen captures show that Moore, driving west through the Syncreon parking lot, stopped his vehicle briefly. Smith's vehicle then exited Syncreon's parking lot onto Kirk Road. Detective English opined that, \"[o]nce [Moore] sees that Mr. Smith has left out the opposite entrance, he starts proceeding to the west exit of Syncreon's property.\" After Smith's vehicle had driven past, according to Detective English, Moore then drove\n   out of the Syncreon parking lot and onto Kirk Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Detective English testified that the screen captures from the Anda Pharmaceutical surveillance show \"both vehicles side by side on Kirk Road ....\" According to Detective English, the screen captures show Smith's \"vehicle ... coming into contact with the curb on the right and Mr. Moore ... slowing down his actions, backing up behind the vehicle to allow Smith's vehicle to keep going forward ... on Kirk Road.\" The next screen capture, Detective English testified, shows Smith's vehicle \"bounce[ ] off of that right curb and [ ] driv[e] down the roadway uncontrollably as Mr. Moore is following behind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Detective English described the Anda Pharmaceutical surveillance video, which he said showed \"Mr. Smith's vehicle slowly come into the intersection almost striking [an] orange 18-wheeler [which] had a green light at the time. Mr. Smith's vehicle went through the intersection, over the curb and down the embankment where it came to a final rest at Prime Automotive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Various witnesses testified about what they had observed. Ronnie Schuldt said that, as he was driving south on Polk Lane and approaching the intersection with Kirk Road, he was prevented from continuing through the intersection, despite having a green light: \"I slowed down and stopped or almost stopped, and the car continued through the intersection heading west and drove up over the curb and then started down; and there was an embankment that goes down to the [Prime Automotive] building.\" Schuldt, who got out of his own vehicle and walked down the embankment to the driver's side of the car, stated that he saw an unresponsive person slumped over the console with an apparent head wound and that the driver's side window had been shattered. A Prime Automotive employee, Esau Fant, testified that he heard two gunshots and watched a white Altima drive through the intersection and coast down to the Prime Automotive plant. He saw the broken glass and saw that the driver had been shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Jonathan Young, an employee of View, Inc., testified that he had turned left onto Polk Road off Kirk Road and \"was almost rear ended by a white SUV.\" Young continued that the SUV, which had a Benton County tag, passed his vehicle in a turn lane and then ran a red light. Young testified that Moore, the defendant, was the person he observed driving the SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Nine to ten hours after the shooting, Moore turned himself in to the police. After reading Moore's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights to him and obtaining a written waiver, Investigator Hutchins interviewed Moore. The audio recorded interview was played for the jury. In the interview, Moore admitted having been in the Syncreon parking lot. Moore referenced a text message between his wife and Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Dr. Brent Davis, a deputy chief medical examiner with the office of the Mississippi State Medical Examiner, who was tendered by the State and accepted by the trial court as an expert in forensic pathology, testified that his colleague, Dr. Lisa Funte, actually performed the autopsy but she was unavailable to testify. Dr. Davis testified that he had reviewed and concurred with Dr. Funte's conclusions following Smith's autopsy. He stated that, \"[i]n our office, currently all homicides are reviewed and signed off on by each pathologist in the office.\" Dr. Davis testified that the cause of Smith's death was \"[m]ultiple gunshot wounds\" and that the manner of Smith's death was \"homicide.\" Moore did\n   not object to any of Dr. Davis's testimony or evidence except for photographs the State offered through him that Moore argued were gruesome and would inflame the jury. The court admitted them, overruling Moore's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. A DeSoto County grand jury had indicted Moore for murder but the jury found Moore guilty of second-degree murder. Moore sought a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, a new trial, which the trial court denied. Moore was sentenced to a term of forty years, thirty years to be served in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the remaining ten years to be served on post-release supervision. Moore timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Moore argues on appeal that: (1) the trial court erred by giving a second-degree murder instruction that was not supported by the evidence; (2) the trial court erred in refusing the circumstantial evidence jury instruction Moore had sought; (3) the trial court committed plain error by allowing a forensic pathologist to testify about an expert opinion which was not his own; and (4) the trial court erred by admitting hearsay evidence. We address only the dispositive question of whether the trial court erred in refusing Moore's tendered circumstantial evidence instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. The State produced no confession or eyewitness to the shooting. Moore proposed a circumstantial evidence jury instruction, but the trial court declined to give it. Moore argues on appeal that he was entitled to a circumstantial evidence instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. This Court reviews a grant or denial of jury instructions for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    McInnis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037076\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/872/#p875\">\n    61 So.3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 875 (Miss. 2011). Further, jury instructions \"must be read as a whole to determine [whether] they fairly announce the law, and they must be supported by evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037076\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/872/#p875\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. Moore contends that, under\n   <em>\n    Stringfellow v. State\n   </em>\n   , a circumstantial evidence instruction \" 'should be given only when the prosecution can produce neither eyewitnesses [nor] a confession to the offense charged.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stringfellow v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7521729\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/595/1320/#p1322\">\n    595 So.2d 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1322 (Miss. 1992). The State responds that Moore was not entitled to a circumstantial evidence jury instruction because it had adduced direct evidence of Moore's guilt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The video tape shows Moore's car and its relation to the victim's car at the exact place where the shots were fired as evidenced by the glass fragments and shell casings found at that location. An eye witness identified Moore as the one fleeing the scene and another eye witness described how the victim's car appeared to lose control and go off road until it came to rest against the side of a building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. But in\n   <em>\n    Burleson v. State\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that, \"[w]here the State 'is without a confession and wholly without eyewitness testimony to the gravamen of the offense charged,' the defendant is entitled to an instruction requiring the jury to 'exclude every other reasonable hypothesis other than that of guilt before a conviction can be had.' \"\n   <em>\n    Burleson v.

This Court defined \"gravamen\" as the \" 'substantial point or essence of a claim, grievance, or complaint.' \"\n   <em>\n    Burleson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867562\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/166/499/#p509\">\n    166 So.3d at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McInnis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037076\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/872/#p875\">\n    61 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   876 ). Further, the Court recognized that \"[d]irect evidence ...

Ct. App. 1999) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17. In the present case, the State has produced neither Moore's confession nor an eyewitness to the gravamen of the offense charged. Here, the gravamen of the crime is the actual shooting of Smith. To remove this case from the circumstantial evidence realm, the State bore the burden of adducing evidence to show directly, and not merely by inference, that Moore shot and killed Smith. This is true, no matter how compelling the inference may be. The State claims that Moore's fingerprints on Smith's car, the video evidence of the vehicles, the broken glass and shell casing, the witness who observed Moore driving past him at a high rate of speed, and the other videos amount to direct evidence that Moore shot Smith. An inference that Moore shot Smith does arise from the evidence. But evidence that implicates the defendant by inference is circumstantial evidence, without regard to how persuasive the inference appears to be. Moreover, the sum of circumstantial evidence, however great it may be-and although often it is sufficient to sustain a conviction-never becomes direct evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18. The State argues that video evidence can constitute direct evidence of the crime, citing\n   <em>\n    Golden v. State\n   </em>\n   . Golden was a cashier at a casino.\n   <em>\n    Golden v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305433\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/820/#p821\">\n    860 So.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003). One evening, after Golden had left her post and exited the casino, \"casino officials discovered that her cash drawer was short over $19,000.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305433\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/820/#p821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At trial, the State presented video footage showing her taking the money from her drawer and delivering it to her sister.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305433\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/820/#p821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305433\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/820/#p821\">\n    at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Mississippi Court of Appeals upheld her conviction: \"[v]ideotape evidence submitted to the jury of an accused's unlawful acts constitutes direct evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305433\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/820/#p821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In concluding that the videotape evidence was direct evidence, the Court of Appeals relied on\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. State\n   </em>\n   , in which this Court had affirmed a conviction for burglary where the defendant had hidden in the restroom of a Junior Food Mart in Aberdeen, Mississippi, \"with the express purpose of stealing from the store once it closed.\"\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554845\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/744/751/\">\n    744 So.2d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss.1999). This Court affirmed Haynes's conviction and sentence because, \"[i]n addition to the testimony of the officers who arrested Haynes, the jury was also presented with a videotape of Haynes dragging a garbage bag full of stolen goods around the store.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554845\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/744/751/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554845\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/744/751/\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19. But, in both\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   , surveillance video had captured the nefarious misdeeds of the parties. In those cases, the video footage captured the gravamen of the crimes as they were being committed. The circumstantial evidence in the present case, albeit copious, does not reach beyond the realm of the inferential. The surveillance videos here showed only Moore's encounter with Smith in the Syncreon parking lot and the close proximity of Moore's vehicle to Smith's just before Smith's vehicle careened out of control. An inference arises from this circumstantial evidence that Smith did, in fact, shoot Moore. But inferences do not amount to direct evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20. Because the State adduced no direct evidence of Moore's guilt, the trial court's refusal of Moore's sought circumstantial evidence jury instruction was an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we reverse Moore's conviction and sentence and remand the case to the Circuit Court of DeSoto County for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21. The dissent calls for the abolition of the circumstantial evidence jury instruction. But as the dissent recognizes, that view has been rejected by a majority\n   of this Court no fewer than five times.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burleson v.

The majority throws out the jury's guilty verdict and renders what is tantamount to an automatic reversal of Moore's second degree murder conviction based solely on a harmless instructional error. With respect for the majority, I find this approach is flawed, manifestly wrong, and results in a mischievous outcome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because there is no reversible error, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 34. First, the majority acts on a completely false premise-that there is an \"\n   <em>\n    arguably stricter burden of proof placed upon the state in circumstantial evidence cases.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is simply untrue. In reality, as hopefully we can all agree, the State's constitutionally required burden of proof in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   criminal cases is the same-beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 35. Second, mandating what is essentially automatic reversal for an instructional error, which has zero effect on a jury's verdict is illogical and impractical. Until today, this Court has consistently and very clearly \"\n   <em>\n    rejected the proposition that the failure to give [a circumstantial evidence] instruction can be harmless error\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the majority now concedes this stringent view was incorrect. It now admits that failure to give a circumstantial-evidence instruction-just like any other nonstructural trial error-can be subject to harmless-error analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   While I do commend the majority for recognizing our precedent requiring automatic reversal was wrong, it appears the majority's newfound appreciation of the harmless error doctrine is, in\n   application, little more than lip service. I say this because instead of explaining why and to what extent Moore was harmed by the lack of a circumstantial-evidence instruction, the majority simply decrees \"today's case does not present such a fact pattern.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the majority puts it, \"we decline to speculate about a hypothetical scenario.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 36. But with respect for the majority-this Court is not facing a hypothetical scenario. This is a real murder case. And a unanimous, twelve-member jury found Moore guilty of murdering Smith-a real person. To completely duck these facts and the overwhelming evidence of Moore's guilt, giving absolutely no analysis of any resulting harm from excluding the instruction, rings hollow and very dismissive. It is not the way this Court or any other American appellate court applies harmless-error review. And I do not join in this approach. I would instead apply our traditional harmless-error standard, under which we examine whether the defendant was harmed sufficiently to overturn the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 37. A third truth is that the United States Supreme Court, every single federal court, and the vast majority of State courts, agree that refusal to give a circumstantial-evidence instruction is not even error at all. And numerous Justices on this Court have heavily criticized and called for the abolishment of circumstantial-evidence instructions\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -for good reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 38. The bottom line is that Mississippi law says \"[c]ircumstantial evidence is entitled to the same weight and effect as direct evidence[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   So if a jury is properly instructed on the State's burden of proof, as it was here, no more stringent instruction is required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 39. For these reasons, I would affirm Moore's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

While the majority of this court apparently prefers and demands a higher burden of proof in circumstantial-evidence-based criminal cases-I cannot join them.

First, the evidence supporting the verdict was overwhelming. Video evidence, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and Moore's own damning actions doomed him. The day of the shooting, Moore had accused Smith of having an affair with his wife. Moore traveled to Smith's workplace. And a business surveillance video captured Moore sitting in his SUV in the parking lot awaiting Smith. It showed the confrontation between Moore and Smith, then caught Moore climbing into his vehicle and Smith his. It shows Moore's SUV rapidly following Smith's out of the parking lot. Eyewitnesses saw Moore's vehicle pull next to Smith's, then Smith's vehicle careen out of control. Another witness heard the fatal gunshots ring out. After the shooting, Moore \"picked up speed and ran the red light.\" In doing so, he almost crashed into another vehicle. Once Smith's vehicle stopped, Smith's dead body confirmed what everyone had just seen and heard-Moore had pulled alongside Smith and shot him to death. Additionally, when Moore turned himself in, eight hours later, he was driving a different vehicle and had changed into different clothes. Officers determined the interior and exterior of the SUV Moore had driven in the video had just been wiped down with cleaning agents. Officers also found large jugs of cleaning materials in Moore's SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 54. Simply put, in light of this overwhelming evidence of guilt, the lack of a circumstantial-evidence instruction was insignificant.
