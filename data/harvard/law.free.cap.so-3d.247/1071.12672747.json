In 2002, he was indicted by a grand jury. He was subsequently convicted on two counts of second degree murder, and on June 27, 2006, was given two concurrent life sentences, without possibility of parole. His convictions and sentences were affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brooks\n   </em>\n   , 42,226 (La.

For the reasons stated, we affirm Brooks' amended sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin by outlining the development of the law involved in this case, and we place the trial court's ruling in that chronology. At the time Brooks committed the second degree murders, La. R.S. 14:30.1 provided a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without parole. In 2012,\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra\n   </em>\n   , changed the law by holding that the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment disallows the imposition of a mandatory life sentence-without possibility of parole-on a person who commits murder prior to reaching the age of 18 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, the Louisiana legislature amended La. R.S. 15:574.4 and La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1 in order to satisfy the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . However, the Louisiana Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Tate\n   </em>\n   , 2012-2763 (La. 11/5/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279899\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/130/829/\">\n    130 So.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , held that these provisions were prospective only, and that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   itself is prospective only. In\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   , 577 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court overruled\n   <em>\n    Tate\n   </em>\n   , holding that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On remand in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , in 2016, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that the courts of this state are to implement\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    , i.e.\n   </em>\n   , provide those who were under 18 at the time they committed murder with the opportunity to obtain parole eligibility via contradictory hearing. The court so held despite the absence of legislative authority for implementing\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactively, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Therefore, in the absence of further legislative action, the previously enacted provisions [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the 2013 amendments which were held in\n   <em>\n    Tate\n   </em>\n   to be prospective only], should be used for the resentencing hearings that must now be conducted on remand from the United States Supreme Court to determine whether Henry Montgomery, and other prisoners like him, will be granted or denied parole eligibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 15:574(E) (2013). However, effective August 1, 2017, the legislature added\n   <em>\n    retroactive\n   </em>\n   provisions to La. R.S. 15:574.4 and La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1. These provisions allow juvenile murderers to obtain parole in accordance with the conditions and requirements set forth therein.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20La.%20Acts%202017\">\n    2017 La.

Our approach remains unaltered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lack of judicial authority to grant parole eligibility\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Effective August 1, 2017, the Legislature added Subsection (G) to La. R.S. 15:574.4 and expansively amended La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1. These retroactive provisions allow juvenile murderers to obtain parole eligibility as required by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, these amendments reduced-from 35 years to 25 years-the time that a juvenile murderer must serve before becoming eligible for parole consideration. These amendments apply to the instant case, and therefore, Brooks' argument that, in granting him parole eligibility, the trial court exceeded its authority, and violated due process and the separation of powers is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We note, however, that La. R.S. 15:574(G) (2017) now governs Brooks' parole eligibility. La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1(B)(2)(a) dictates that result, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) If an offender was indicted prior to August 1, 2017, for the crime of ... second degree murder ( R.S. 14:30.1 ) where the offender was under the age of eighteen years at the time of the commission of the offense and a hearing was held pursuant to this Article prior to August 1, 2017, the following shall apply: (a) If the court determined at the hearing that was held prior to August 1, 2017, that the offender's sentence shall be imposed with parole eligibility, the offender shall be eligible for parole pursuant to R.S. 15:574.4(G).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Brooks further argues that, because his sentence is \"illegal,\" he should instead be given the maximum sentence for the most serious lesser included offense,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , manslaughter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The premise of this argument, however, is wrong: his sentence, as amended, is not illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, these assignments of error are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Meaningful opportunity for release; evidentiary hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Granting parole eligibility to juveniles found guilty of murder satisfies the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   The U.S. Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Giving\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactive effect, moreover, does not require States to relitigate sentences, let alone convictions, in every case where a juvenile offender received\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-10-301\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-10-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2013) (juvenile homicide offenders eligible for parole after 25 years). Allowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity-and who have since matured-will not be forced to serve a\n   disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-10-301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-10-301\">\n    at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Furthermore, contrary to Brooks' argument, parole eligibility under La. R.S. 15:574.4 and La. C. Cr.

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The sole question to be answered in a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing is whether the defendant should have a chance for parole. Accordingly there is no consideration of whether there should be a downward departure from mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor. Rather, the trial court considers only whether that mandatory sentence should include parole eligibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803640,6803570,6803676,6803605\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/583/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calhoun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   These assignments of error are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Time when defendant becomes parole eligible\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Brooks asserts that, in granting him parole eligibility, the trial court failed to specify when he would be eligible for parole consideration. That assertion is incorrect: by specifying that Brooks' parole eligibility was governed by La. R.S. 15:574(E), the trial court incorporated the 35-year minimum which existed at that time. Additionally, La. R.S. 15:574.4(G)(1)(a) now governs retroactively, and specifies that a convict who committed second degree murder before turning 18 years of age becomes eligible for parole consideration, if at all, after serving 25 years of the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, Brooks' sentence, as now governed by La.
