On February 15, 2017, a jury heard evidence and convicted Defendant of the two charges for possession of a firearm. The jury acquitted him of the third charge, which related to methamphetamine. The other two counts were misdemeanors; they were not tried with the three felony charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 23, 2017, the district court denied Defendant's motion for new trial, then sentenced him to ten years at hard labor for each conviction for possession of a firearm; said sentences to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Counsel has filed a brief seeking to withdraw pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

In the course of his investigation, Sergeant Clement spoke to Defendant, who was an area resident. Defendant denied shooting a gun recently but admitted to firing one earlier in the day. He revealed that he was wearing a holstered pistol and that he had another weapon in his truck. Upon Sergeant Clement's instruction, Defendant put both pistols in the officer's possession. Sergeant Clement wrote him a citation for discharging a weapon within the city limits and returned the weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, Sergeant Clement determined that Defendant was a convicted felon, prepared a search warrant, and executed it. The search, conducted on February 26, led to the seizure of two firearms: one was in the house and the other was seized from Defendant's girlfriend who pulled up\n   while the search was taking place; the pistol was in her purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record.

When the trial court allows this kind of arrangement the defendant acts as his only legal representative. The legal counsel that is appointed does not represent the defendant; he only advises him. Because the court appointed attorney is only acting as an advisor, the accused is abandoning his right to be represented by counsel. At the same time he is exercising his right to self-representation. Therefore, when an attorney is appointed as an advisor the accused must knowingly abandon his right to be represented by counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In this case, although co-counsel was appointed as an advisor to Dupre, counsel spent a significant portion of the trial representing Dupre. Taylor argued motions, made objections, examined witnesses and assisted in closing arguments. The fact that Taylor partially represented Dupre at trial raises the initial issue of whether Dupre was thereby afforded all the benefits of legal representation and whether this representation abrogated\n   the need for an adequate waiver of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   We hold that it did not. Even though he has an attorney partially representing him, when the accused assumes functions that are at the core of the lawyer's traditional role, as Dupre did, he will often undermine his own defense. Because he has a constitutional right to have his lawyer perform core functions, he must knowingly and intelligently waive that right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This court found that although the trial court did not specifically advise the defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, considering the record as a whole as in\n   <em>\n    Poche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450704\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1225/#p1231\">\n    924 So.2d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court found that the right to counsel was adequately waived during pre-trial proceedings considering the trial court was aware that the defendant was \"literate, competent, and understood the charges against him and the judicial process.\"\n   <em>\n    Queen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12662773\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/237/547/#p551\">\n    237 So.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Poche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450704\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1225/#p1231\">\n    924 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1233 ). Additionally, this court noted that the defendant was assisted by co-counsel at numerous proceedings and it discussed those proceedings which occurred after the August 20, 2009 waiver before reaching the conclusion that the defendant was aware of the judicial process and that his choice to represent himself was part of a strategy. Thus, this court concluded the waiver was adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Poche\n   </em>\n   , the issue of self-representation was raised by the defendant on appeal. This court found that the trial court's interview of the defendant regarding self-representation did not meet the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   requirements necessary to determine whether the defendant's waiver was valid because the court did not make an express determination regarding his literacy, competency, or understanding; it did not determine whether his waiver was intelligently made; and it failed to inform him of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. However, based on the record as a whole, this court found the trial court's determination was not error. It noted that the defendant had filed numerous pre-trial pro se briefs with the trial court, some of which he argued himself at hearings on the motions. The defendant\n   was also made aware of the elements of each crime at arraignment, which was prior to his request to represent himself. Thus, this court found that at the time of the waiver, the trial court was aware that the defendant was literate, competent, and understood the charges against him and the judicial process. Thus, to satisfy the first step of the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   test, all that was left was for the trial court to determine the defendant's volition, which it had done. This court had to only determine whether the defendant was made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. In concluding that defendant was aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, this court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

But I need to have this discussion with you on the record because I feel it's very important and necessary and you have the right to represent yourself but you also have the right to counsel. And the reason that you have the right to counsel is because representing yourself in a criminal matter, or anyone representing anyone in a criminal matter is not a very easy thing to do. There are certain pitfalls and certain difficulties that a person encounters during pre-trial matters and also for trial matters. And so the court wants to make sure that you first of all are competent to understand that and that you understand that you're waiving certain rights. Having said that you also have the right as I said under the 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   amendment to represent yourself. They have a saying and I guess most of the time I agree with it. A person who represents themselves has a fool for a client, because you never know, somebody said I forget exactly who said it but I think it's a very wise thing because you know when you're at trial you're going to be trying to listen to what the attorney says and try to figure out your strategy and you're going to be missing things and so at the very least the court will appoint standby counsel to represent you.

So for ever how long you represent yourself that will be water under the bridge as they say and if you ever want to invoke the right to counsel then the case would go from that point forward so the court will appoint Ms. Guillory as standby counsel in your matters, okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The court then discussed Defendant's appeal, and his request for a bond reduction was taken up. While addressing that issue, Defendant noted for the court that he had \"been coming to court here for [sic] I think since I was born and I might have one or two failure to appears [sic] due to I was coming to court two or three times a month.\" In addressing Defendant's bond reduction request in another docket number, the prosecutor noted that Defendant was a third or fourth felony offender. This is substantiated by Defendant's rapsheet introduced at trial as State Exhibit #5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   At the time of the waiver of Defendant's right to counsel, he was aware of the charges against him. At his seventy-two-hour hearing, Defendant told the court he was charged with possession of a firearm, which the court later clarified to be possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Additionally, Defendant informed the court that he had obtained his GED, and he had clearly expressed to the court his desire to represent himself. Thus, we find the trial court was aware that Defendant was literate, competent, and understood the charges against him. Although Defendant was not made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation at the time of the waiver of his right to counsel, he clearly had a prior felony conviction which formed the basis of his current conviction. He had been present during the current trial, and the prosecutor's comment referenced above indicated Defendant had multiple prior felonies. Further, when Defendant was later fully advised of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation at the June 29, 2017 hearing, there was nothing to indicate that his responses would have been any different if asked at his May 23, 2017 hearing. Considering the record as a whole, as this court did in\n   <em>\n    Poche\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Queen\n   </em>\n   , we find Defendant adequately waived his right to counsel during post-trial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Next, there is a misjoinder of offenses in the bill of information. The bill of information charged the Defendant with three felonies triable by jury and two misdemeanors triable by a judge without a jury. La.Code Crim.P. art. 779. Therefore, counts four and five were improperly joined with counts one through three. However, the Defendant did not file a motion to quash the bill of information on the basis of misjoinder of offenses, as required by statute. La.Code Crim.P. art. 495. Thus, review of this error is waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Next, since counts four and five are misdemeanors, the proper mode of appellate review for these offenses is an application for writ of review rather than an appeal. La.Code Crim.P. art. 912.1. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=04-1250%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%203/2/05%29\">\n    04-1250 (La.App. 3 Cir. 3/2/05)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9023860\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/896/286/\">\n    896 So.2d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 05-871 (La. 12/12/05),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006203,9006260,9006221,9006238\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/917/1084/\">\n    917 So.2d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court severed a misdemeanor conviction for possession of marijuana from the defendant's appeal of two felony convictions and instructed the defendant to file a writ of review regarding the possession of marijuana conviction, if so desired. This court noted that the defendant did not make any specific arguments regarding the misdemeanor conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , Defendant has not raised any assignment of error regarding these misdemeanors. Therefore, as was done by this court in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , this court severs the misdemeanors from the appeal. However, unlike\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , the record does not establish a disposition of the misdemeanor charges.

Counsel observes there were no challenges for cause by the defense during voir dire and no contemporaneous objections were made during trial. Our review of the record indicates the assertion regarding voir dire is correct; further, it appears the defense did not raise any formal objections during testimony. To the extent that Defendant's trial counsel raised concerns about any of the evidence that was introduced, those concerns were resolved by actions the prosecutor took to accommodate such concerns, i.e\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   , by redacting potentially prejudicial information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In going through the record, Defense counsel indicates that the evidence in the record was sufficient to support the conviction. The evidence showed that Defendant had a prior conviction for second degree battery. His former probation officer testified that the sentence for that conviction terminated in April of 2009; thus, under La.R.S. 14:95.1 as it existed at the time, he could not have possessed any firearms legally until 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   As for the actual possession of firearms at issue, Sergeant Clement's testimony about his initial encounter with Defendant showed that Defendant had physical possession of two firearms at that time. Further, although Sergeant Clement misidentified the calibers of the two weapons, he indicated the weapons recovered pursuant to the search warrant were the same two guns he saw during his initial contact with Defendant. Defendant's girlfriend, Jolene McGee, testified that she recognized one of the weapons as one that had belonged to Defendant's father and that Defendant had\n   physically possessed; at some point they had pawned it but later redeemed it. She did not recognize the smaller pistol in evidence, although she and Defendant had obtained a small-caliber gun from a pawn shop. The weapons were registered in her name; Defendant was aware that he could not legally possess firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Ms. McGee remembered handling only one weapon during the initial encounter with Sergeant Clement and disputed some other points in the officer's account of events but testified that Defendant had used both the .38 caliber pistol and a .25 caliber pistol at some point. Counsel suggests, and we agree, that after hearing testimony from Sergeants Clement and Ms. McGee, the jury's decision to convict Defendant of both counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon was rational. Although there were some conflicts or discrepancies between the testimonies of the two main witnesses, it is settled that a jury may accept or reject any testimony in whole or in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Regarding Defendant's pretrial motions, counsel notes that both the motion to suppress and the motion to quash were based upon the misidentification of the calibers by Sergeant Clement. At the initial encounter with Defendant, the officer though he saw a .22 caliber pistol and .40 caliber pistol, but police later seized a .25 and a .38. As counsel notes, this minor discrepancy did not support the granting of either motion. The misidentification of the calibers is a matter of weight, and its assessment was soundly within the discretion of the district court. Our survey of the jurisprudence indicates counsel's assertions are correct.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We find this observation is correct.\n   <em>\n    State v. Blackson\n   </em>\n   , 38, 044 (La.App. 2 Cir. 1/28/04),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9285362\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/865/272/\">\n    865 So.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first assignment states there is a discrepancy in the date of the police report; in the second assignment, he complains that there is a discrepancy between the Witness Statement and the Detailed Call Report. We observe that these sorts of issues go to credibility or general weight. As noted earlier, the assessment of the weight of evidence is within the jury's province. Regarding the offense report, Sergeant Clement testified that he wrote it soon after the initial incident on February 22, 2015. However, the document itself shows that it was filled out on February 26. It is not clear what effect the difference in the dates would allegedly have had on the case. Discrepancies regarding the Witness Statement were discussed before the jury during cross-examination, re-direct, and the examination of Sergeant Clement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   His third, fourth, and fifth pro se assignments appear to focus on the initial misidentification of the calibers of the weapons by Sergeant Clement. Defendant seems to argue that the weapons seized\n   differed from those that Sergeant Clement saw him possessing during their initial encounter. As discussed earlier, the misidentification of the calibers was put before the jury at trial. Also, even if two entirely different weapons had been found during the search of Defendant's home, as opposed to the weapons seen during the initial encounter, the weapons seized from the home could have formed the basis of criminal charges. The offense date listed on the bill of information would go to the issue of notice, but Defendant does not contend he did not know the nature of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   In his sixth assignment of error, he notes that Sergeant Clement testified that he has known Defendant since fourth or fifth grade; but he provides no evidence that any prior association between them was prejudicial. In his seventh assignment of error, he claims that time discrepancies in the Detailed Call Report are \"proof of Profiling by Officer.\" However, Defendant does not explain how an alleged nine-minute discrepancy in the call report demonstrates that Sergeant Clement profiled him or had any personal ill will toward him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In his eighth assignment of error, he again addresses the credibility of Sergeant Clement. Defendant claims it is not clear from the record whether Sergeant Clement ever unholstered the pistols or ran the registration numbers. This is a minor point that goes to weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In his ninth and final assignment of error, Defendant complains that his motion to suppress was heard by a different judge than the one who conducted the trial. He does not explain how this prejudiced his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The pro se assignments of error lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In light of the foregoing discussion, we find that appellate counsel has demonstrated that he has performed a thorough review of the record and has found no non-frivolous issues. Accordingly, the convictions and sentences are affirmed, counsel's motion to withdraw is granted, and the case is remanded for disposition of counts four and five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED.
