(\"Wholesale\"), appeals the district court's August 2, 2017 judgment dismissing its \"Petition for Appeal of Administrative Adjudication\" for lack of jurisdiction, as the petition was impermissibly filed on its behalf by a non-lawyer corporate representative and therefore, without effect. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 13, 2017, the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission (\"LMVC\") conducted a hearing addressing a complaint that Wholesale had engaged in both the unlicensed business of financing motor vehicles and in misleading and prohibited advertising for the period between January 27, 2015, and March 13, 2017, all in violation of Louisiana law. Following its hearing, on April 19, 2017, LMVC issued its judgment against Wholesale in both regards, finding Wholesale had violated both La. R.S. 6:969.35 and Louisiana Administrative Code 46.V.703, 713, 745 and 749. LMVC assessed a $100,000.00 fine against Wholesale as well as costs in the amount of $35,583.56, related to the LMVC proceedings, and $2,940.24, related to the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wholesale was represented by counsel during the LMVC proceedings. Thereafter, on May 12, 2017, in response to the judgment, fine, and costs assessed, Wholesale filed a \"Petition for Appeal of Administrative Adjudication and Request for Stay Order Pending Appeal\" in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court. Danny Alonzo, Wholesale's corporate agent and owner, filed the appellate petition in the 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court on Wholesale's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alonzo is not licensed to practice law in Louisiana. Wholesale in its petition for administrative appeal sought reversal of LMVC's April 19, 2017 judgment, arguing the judgment (1) violates the Louisiana Constitution; (2) violates the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act; (3) exceeds the statutory authority of the Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act; and (4) is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence. On May 16, 2017, pending a hearing on the merits of the appeal, the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court issued an order staying the execution of the LMVC judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to Wholesale's petition for administrative appeal, LMVC filed an \"Opposition to Rule Nisi and Request for this\n   Court's Dismissal of Appeal\n   <em>\n    Ex Proprio Motu\n   </em>\n   ,\" arguing that Wholesale's petition for appeal was null and without legal effect because Danny Alonzo, as a non-lawyer corporate agent for Wholesale, was not authorized to represent Wholesale, and had engaged in the unlawful practice of law in violation of La. R.S. 37:213. Consequently, LMVC argued that because the petition for appeal was not properly filed within thirty days of the mailing of the notice of judgment, pursuant to La. R.S. 49:964(B), the filing of the petition for appeal in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court was without effect and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 19, 2017, Wholesale filed an opposition to the request for dismissal claiming Alonzo's motion for appeal was legally valid as a corporation is entitled to tend to its own business and legal demands. Wholesale argued the filing of its petition for appeal falls within the narrow exception, set forth in La. R.S. 37:212(C), to the general rule provided in La. R.S. 37:213, precluding non-lawyers from practicing law. Wholesale argued La. R.S. 37:212 (C) generally permits a non-lawyer corporate representative to appear in court on behalf of a corporate entity, particularly in this case as the LMVC judgment issued only a fine and costs, which is distinguishable from a judgment arising out of a claim for money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 24, 2017, the district court heard arguments on LMVC's request for dismissal and on August 2, 2017, the district court granted LMVC's motion and dismissed Wholesale's appeal. On August 15, 2017, Wholesale filed a motion for appeal, which the district court granted on August 16, 2017. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Louisiana, as a general rule, no individual not admitted to practice law by the Louisiana Supreme Court may represent another in court.

Under the first interpretation, subsection (C) is read to limit non-lawyers acting as corporate agents to asserting or defending claims in an amount not exceeding $5,000.00. Under this interpretation, since the \"asserting or defending any claim\" language appears immediately before the clause providing for a maximum amount in dispute of $5,000.00, the statute is viewed as intending to impose this $5,000.00 cap on all claims, regardless of whether filed in a court of limited or general jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900953\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/418/#p425\">\n    150 So.3d at 426-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concurring opinion). Under an alternative interpretation, that argued here by Wholesale, subsection 37:212(C) is read to limit a non-lawyer agent of a corporate entity to asserting or defending claims on the corporation's behalf in a court of limited jurisdiction not exceeding $5,000.00, but to permit an authorized partner, shareholder, officer, employee, or duly authorized agent to assert or defend a claim of any amount in a court of general jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900953\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/418/#p425\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Wholesale argues that\n   <em>\n    In re LaMartina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , a recent disciplinary decision rendered by the Louisiana Supreme Court, supports its proposed statutory interpretation.

R.S. 37:212(C) was again amended in 2010, to delete the \"defense pertaining to an open account\" language and to add an \"or\" following \"courts of limited jurisdiction[.]\" The changes are reflected as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Nothing in this Section shall prohibit any partnership, corporation, or other legal entity from asserting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or defending\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   any claim, not exceeding five thousand dollars, on its own behalf in the courts of limited jurisdiction\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   on its own behalf through a duly authorized partner, shareholder, officer, employee, or duly authorized agent or representative.

The legislature, in the 2010 amended version-in effect at the time the trial court ruled on First Bank's Motion to Disqualify Keith Paul Gagnon-placed the language \"asserting or defending any claim\" before the language imposing the \"five thousand dollar\" limitation to the amount in controversy. I interpret the amended language to impose a five thousand dollar limitation to any claim\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   defense asserted by a legal entity on its own behalf, whether filed in a court of limited jurisdiction or in any other court.

R.S. 37:213 restriction prohibiting non-lawyer corporations from practicing law meaningless. This interpretation would cause the exception to overcome the general rule and would further render the first sentence of La.
