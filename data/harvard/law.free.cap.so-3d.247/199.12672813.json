Article 878.1 requires the District Court to conduct a hearing \"[i]n any case where an offender is to be sentenced to life imprisonment for a conviction of first degree murder ( R.S. 14:30 ) or second degree murder ( R.S. 14:30.1 ) where the offender was under\n   the age of eighteen years at the time of the commission of the offense ... to determine whether the sentence shall be imposed with or without parole eligibility pursuant to the provisions of R.S. 15:574.4(E).\" La. R.S. 15:574.4(E) then provides the conditions under which any person serving a sentence of life imprisonment for first or second degree murder committed under the age of 18 can become parole eligible, provided a judicial determination has been made the person is entitled to parole eligibility pursuant to Article 878.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted of second degree murder and ultimately afforded a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing, after which he was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor with parole eligibility after 35 years, in accordance with La. R.S. 15:574.4(E). As in the instant case, the defendant argued on appeal that his sentence constituted an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   application of the law because\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was decided after his conviction and original sentencing. In affirming the defendant's sentence, we held, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [w]e reject defendant's contention that the appropriate remedy is to resentence him to the next lesser responsive verdict of manslaughter. Rather, the remedy for noncompliance with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is to remand the matter for the sentencing court to reconsider defendant's sentence after conducting a hearing to consider defendant's youth and attendant characteristics as mitigating circumstances before deciding whether to impose the harshest penalty for juveniles convicted of a homicide offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6842992\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/176/713/\">\n    176 So.3d at 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , [Citations omitted].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Similarly, in the instant case, defendant has been afforded relief permissible under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to the trial court's proper application of La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1 and La. R.S. 15:574.4(E). Accordingly, we find no merit to the defendant's argument. Relatedly, because this substantive issue is without merit, defendant's claim that his appellate counsel is ineffective for failure to assign as error that his counsel at sentencing was ineffective for failing to raise it is also without merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
