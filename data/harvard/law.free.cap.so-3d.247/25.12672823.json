In a decision rendered on January 4, 2017, we reversed the final judgment and remanded with instructions for the trial court to reduce the plaintiff's damages by the percentage of fault that the jury attributed to Mrs. Grossman based on our then-binding precedent in\n   <em>\n    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Schoeff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839247\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/487/#p488\">\n    178 So.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015). The Florida Supreme Court thereafter\n   quashed our\n   <em>\n    Schoeff\n   </em>\n   decision and held that \"the comparative fault statute does not apply to\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   progeny cases in which the jury finds for the plaintiff on the intentional tort claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Schoeff v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420168\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/232/294/#p304\">\n    232 So.3d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (Fla. 2017). As a result, our decision in the instant case was also quashed. In accordance with the supreme court's mandate, we affirm the final judgment and remand for reinstatement of the entire amount of damages found by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed and remanded with instructions.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Conner, J., and Moyle, Paul O., Associate Judge, concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
