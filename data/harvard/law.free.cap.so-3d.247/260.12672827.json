Grace Ann McCarty was indicted for depraved-heart (second-degree) murder after she killed her husband, Joel, by backing his car over him in the driveway of their home. Grace claimed that Joel's death was an accident, but the jury found her guilty of manslaughter, and the court sentenced her to twenty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, with five years suspended and five years of post-release supervision. On appeal, Grace argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction and that the jury's verdict was against the\n   overwhelming weight of the evidence. She also argues that the trial judge should have granted her motion for a mistrial based on her allegation that Joel's cousin was \"coaching\" a witness during the trial. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Around 5 p.m. on November 2, 2014, Grace, Joel, Grace's ten-year-old daughter (Patricia), and Joel's adult son (Jay) were at the McCartys' home in Kosciusko. Jay testified that Grace and Joel were in front of the house and arguing about something. Jay could not recall the subject of the argument. Grace was \"wanting to go somewhere\" in Joel's car, a Chrysler PT Cruiser, but Joel told her \"that she wasn't taking that car nowhere.\" Joel told her that \"[h]e could call somebody to come get her or something,\" but he said, \"That's the only vehicle I got right now and you're not taking it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Jay testified that Grace got in the car despite what Joel had said. Patricia also got in the car. Joel responded by sitting down in the driveway several feet behind the car. Jay walked over to Joel and stood next to him. He urged Joel to get out of the driveway and go inside the house. Joel refused, stating that Grace was \"not leaving in the car.\" Joel told Jay that it was \"all right\" and that he (Jay) should go back inside. Jay turned and started to walk back to the house. As he did, he heard the car back up and run over Joel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Jay acknowledged that his memory was impaired as a result of head injuries that he suffered in a car accident when he was in college around 1995. He still sees a doctor about issues related to his injuries, and he takes medication for anxiety or agitation caused by the injuries. Jay testified that he takes a notebook with him everywhere and makes daily notes to help him remember things, but he did not write any notes about the day that Joel was killed. Jay testified that he could remember his father being run over because an event like that will \"stick\" in his mind. However, he could not remember where the family had been earlier that day, what Grace and Joel were arguing about, why they had gone outside the house, or other details about the day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jay also acknowledged that he discussed the incident with Joel's relatives before he spoke to police. He did not speak to the police until two or three months after the incident, and Joel's brother and uncle went with him when he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. After the car backed over Joel, he was still breathing, but he was non-responsive and bleeding profusely. Grace called 911, and a recording of the call was admitted into evidence at trial. Grace told the 911 operator that she ran over Joel by accident. She said that \"all [she and Patricia] were doing was going to the mailbox.\" An ambulance and police responded to the scene. Grace then told one of the officers that she and Patricia were going to a friend's house to retrieve Halloween decorations when she accidentally ran over Joel. Joel was taken to a local hospital and later died from his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Grace was arrested at a gas station later that evening for driving with a suspended license. Police were called to the gas station because of an argument between Grace and Joel's other son, Shay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The following day, Grace gave a statement to Detective Mark Hill. Grace told Hill that she had been upset the night\n   before and might have said some things that were not accurate. Grace said that Joel had been drinking heavily, that he and Jay were arguing, that both were very loud and upset, and that Joel had threatened to kill himself. Grace said that she and Patricia went to the car because they were afraid of Joel and Jay. She denied that she knew that Joel was sitting behind the car. Grace also told Hill that there were video cameras outside the house that might have recorded the incident, and she consented to a search of her residence for any video footage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Hill went to the McCartys' home to check for any video footage recorded by the outside cameras. There were three cameras outside the house, but only two were plugged in and working. One camera was pointed toward the front porch, but it did not record any footage at or near the time that Joel was run over. A camera pointed down the driveway did capture video of the incident. However, for reasons that are not clear, the video starts just before the car backs over Joel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. The video shows Joel sitting on the driveway with his legs crossed several feet behind the car. The car is already running. A male voice says something unintelligible, and then the car suddenly starts to back up. Joel tries to dive out of the way, but the car hits him. The right rear tire of the car drives over him. And then the right front tire drives over him before the car finally comes to a stop. Grace and Patricia exit the car. Patricia can then be heard screaming, and Jay can be heard yelling unintelligibly at Grace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. At trial, Grace testified that on the day in question, she, Joel, Patricia, and Jay all drove to Ethel to visit her father's grave because it was her father's birthday. She testified that she drove because \"Joel had been drinking too much.\" She testified that Joel became \"upset\" at the cemetery because he remembered that \"he had not gotten his mother and father a tombstone yet.\" On the drive back to Kosciusko, Joel and Jay \"argued quite a bit.\" When they got home, Grace started making supper, but Joel was still upset about the tombstone and about financial difficulties. Joel and Jay continued to argue, and Grace could not calm them down. Joel became \"irate\" and \"talked about killing himself,\" and Jay was also angry and cursing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Grace testified that she and Patricia were afraid of Joel and Jay. She testified that after she put supper on the table, she and Patricia slipped out the door and ran to the car. According to Grace, Joel and Jay \"did not know [she] was leaving,\" and she did not see or hear either of them follow her outside. She testified that she turned on the car and pushed the gas, and the next time she saw Joel was \"when he was in front of [the] car after [she] had run over him.\" The next time she saw Jay was \"a few seconds later.\" Grace claimed that she stopped the car as soon as she realized she had hit something, although both the rear and front tires drove over Joel. Grace testified that she never saw Jay outside of the house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Patricia's testimony at trial was generally consistent with Grace's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Like Grace, Patricia testified that she did not see Joel outside the house until after the car had backed over him. Patricia testified that she saw Jay standing on the sidewalk next to the driveway just as the car started to back up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. Grace testified that she told the 911 operator that she was only going to the mailbox because her driver's license was suspended. Grace claimed that she was afraid that, if she told the truth, she would be arrested for driving with a suspended license and she would be not be able to go to the hospital with Joel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. Grace also claimed that when Detective Hill came to her house the next day, he found and the two of them watched a second video that was recorded by the surveillance cameras. She testified that the video showed her and Patricia running down the walkway to the car, and then Joel ran out behind them and \"sat down behind [the] car\" just before she backed over him. Grace claimed that, after watching the video, Hill assured her that the case should never go before a grand jury because it was \"obvious\" that it was an accident and that she could not have seen Joel. Grace's mother also testified that she heard Hill make these assurances. However, Hill denied that he had seen such a video or made any such statements. Grace testified that she did not \"believe that [Hill] would lie\" but \"maybe he had forgotten\" about this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. During the trial, after the State and defense had both rested, Grace made a motion for a mistrial, alleging that Joel's cousin David had \"coached\" Jay during Jay's testimony in the State's case-in-chief. In a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Grace offered testimony from three people who had been in the audience during Jay's testimony. Two of the witnesses were close friends of Grace's attorney. The third was the publisher of the local newspaper. They testified that they observed David nodding his head in an \"exaggerated\" manner during Jay's testimony. One testified that Jay seemed to \"pause\" before answering questions, but none of the witnesses observed any eye contact between Jay and David. Nor could any of them say that Jay appeared to be taking cues from David.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16. David and Jay both denied that any \"coaching\" occurred. David testified that he was simply reacting to Jay's testimony, just as he did during other witnesses' testimony. The trial judge found that the allegation of coaching was \"absurd,\" and he denied the motion. The judge stated that he \"certainly\" would have noticed \"any type of coaching\" because he was seated \"less than six feet from [Jay]\" with \"a complete clear view of everyone ... in the audience of the courtroom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17. After the presentation of the evidence, the court instructed the jury on depraved-heart murder, culpable-negligence manslaughter, and heat-of-passion manslaughter. Grace initially objected to an instruction on heat-of-passion manslaughter, arguing that there was insufficient evidence of provocation or \"heat of passion.\" However, after the trial judge ruled that he would instruct the jury on culpable-negligence manslaughter, Grace's attorney specifically stated that she had \"no objection\" to an instruction on heat-of-passion manslaughter. The instruction on the form of the verdict did not require the jurors to specify a theory of manslaughter if they found Grace guilty of manslaughter. The jury returned a verdict finding Grace \"guilty of manslaughter.\" The circuit court sentenced Grace to serve twenty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, with five years suspended and five years of post-release supervision. The court subsequently denied Grace's motion\n   for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, and Grace appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18. As noted above, Grace argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, that the jury's verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, and that the trial judge erred by denying her motion for a mistrial. In addition, the dissent argues that a mistake in the jury instruction on culpable-negligence manslaughter requires a new trial, although Grace did not raise the issue at trial or on appeal. We address these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Weight and Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19. As noted above, the trial judge instructed the jury on two theories of manslaughter: culpable-negligence manslaughter and heat-of-passion manslaughter. Grace challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and the jury's verdict on both theories. We address the two theories of manslaughter separately below, but we start with two overarching rules that govern our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20. First, our Supreme Court has held \"in a number of cases and in a wide variety of contexts that, where there is in the record evidence legally sufficient to support a jury finding of guilty of murder, had the jury so found, the defendant will not be heard to complain that a manslaughter instruction was given.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7519450\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/551/132/#p146\">\n    551 So.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146 (Miss. 1989). \"This has been held so\n   <em>\n    even though the manslaughter instruction was not warranted under the evidence\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7519450\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/551/132/#p146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). When \"a defendant is convicted of manslaughter upon an instruction granted by the [S]tate to that effect and the evidence would have justified a conviction of murder, the instruction on manslaughter,\n   <em>\n    even if not authorized by the evidence\n   </em>\n   , does not constitute reversible error.\"\n   <em>\n    Grace v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9588528\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/379/540/#p542\">\n    379 So.2d 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542 (Miss. 1980) (emphasis added). Therefore, in the present case, if the State presented sufficient evidence of the greater offense of depraved-heart murder, Grace cannot complain that the jury instead convicted her of the lesser offense of manslaughter-even if there is insufficient evidence of \"heat of passion\" or some other element of manslaughter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9588528\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/379/540/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Therefore, in the present case, the manslaughter conviction must be affirmed if the State presented sufficient evidence of\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   heat-of-passion manslaughter\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   culpable-negligence manslaughter-even if we find that \"one of those theories is factually inadequate to sustain the conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7039393\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/46/315/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 57).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22. Thus, based on these two rules, we must affirm the manslaughter conviction in this case if the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the indicted offense of depraved-heart murder\n   <em>\n    or either\n   </em>\n   theory of manslaughter that was submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In this case, the State presented sufficient evidence of the essential elements of second-degree murder. Jay's testimony was sufficient to support the State's theory that Grace knew that Joel was sitting behind her car when she ran over him.

While not disputing that there was legally sufficient evidence of culpable negligence, the dissent argues that the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. We disagree. Jay testified that Joel and Grace argued in the driveway as she was getting into the car, that Joel specifically told Grace that he would not allow her to leave in his car, and that Joel then sat down in the driveway behind the car. Jay testified that he then walked over to Joel and stood next to him, talked to him, and urged him to move out of the way. When Joel refused, Jay walked away, and Grace ran over Joel. If the jurors found Jay's testimony credible on these material points, they were justified in concluding that Grace knew that Joel was behind the car and intentionally backed over him. At the very least, the jury could have found that Grace drove the car toward Joel with \"wanton disregard, or utter indifference to,\" his life.\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7008548\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/101/638/#p643\">\n    101 So.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31.

While Grace raised legitimate questions about Jay's memory and motives, these were ordinary issues of impeachment and credibility for a jury to resolve. There was no physical evidence or objective evidence that impeached the material points of Jay's testimony. Nor does the overwhelming\n   weight of the evidence show Jay's version of events to be \"implausible.\" The jury was entitled to find Jay more credible than Grace and the other defense witnesses and return a guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 34. In contrast to its treatment of Jay's testimony, the dissent is understanding of Grace's own shifting stories. The dissent notes that the day after Grace ran over Joel, \"she volunteered\" that her \"prior stated reasons\" for leaving the house \"were not accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 84). That is one way to put it, but the jury was entitled to conclude that Grace came up with a third lie only after realizing that neither of her first two stories-going to the mailbox and to retrieve Halloween decorations-provided a plausible or satisfactory explanation for how Joel ended up beneath the wheels of his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35. The dissent also says that the video in evidence \"does not impeach Grace or Patricia's testimony, nor does it corroborate Jay's.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 86). This is an odd way to put it because the converse is (at least) as true-i.e., the video does not impeach Jay's testimony, nor does it corroborate Grace's. The video starts just before Grace backs over Joel. Joel is already seated behind the car when the video begins, and he tries to dive out of the way when he realizes that the car is moving toward him. The video does not show or suggest that he came \"running out and sat down behind [the] car,\" as Grace claimed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 36. Finally, the dissent seems to credit Grace's (and her mother's) claim about a missing video that would have exonerated her.\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 89-90). Grace suggested that Detective Hill \"maybe ... had forgotten\" about this critical evidence. But Hill denied that he had ever seen such a video, and an expert in computer forensics testified that he found no evidence that any other video footage was saved or deleted on the day in question. The jury certainly was entitled to find Hill more credible on this point than Grace and her mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 37. In summary, the jury's verdict was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. The State and the defense presented conflicting testimony. It was up to the jury to sort out the conflicts and decide who was credible and who was not. The jurors were entitled to believe some witnesses and disbelieve others.

The evidence recounted above could also lead a reasonable hypothetical juror to believe that no one was present ... other than Jackson and his wife. From these facts, it may fairly be said that the jury's reasonable conclusion was that some sudden and unexpected provocation-admittedly unexplained-enraged Jackson causing him to take leave of his senses for a few moments to grab a nearby object-a coke bottle-and in the heat of passion strike his wife repeatedly.

The dissent also argues that a new trial is required because of a mistake in the jury instruction regarding culpable-negligence manslaughter, which stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court instructs the jury that culpable negligence manslaughter is the killing of a human being, by culpable negligence and without authority of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court instructs the Jury that if you believe from the evidence in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant, ... on or about November 2, 2014, in Attala County, Mississippi, killed Joel McCarty, a human being, without authority of law and by\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   culpable negligence, then the defendant is guilty of Manslaughter and it is your sworn duty to so find.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   If the State has failed to prove any one or more of the above listed elements of heat of passion manslaughter or culpable negligence manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt, then you shall find the defendant not guilty of Manslaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the instruction mistakenly referred to \"his culpable negligence\" rather than \"her\" (i.e., Grace's) culpable negligence. However, Grace did not raise this issue in the trial court, so any objection is procedurally barred.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Holliman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6844983\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/689/#p698\">\n    178 So.3d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 24).

I respectfully disagree and therefore dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 53. On the evening of Sunday, November 2, 2014, Grace, Patricia (Grace's ten-year-old daughter), Joel (Grace's husband), and Jay (Joel's son) were at Joel and Grace's home. Joel's Chrysler PT Cruiser was parked in the driveway beside their home. Grace and Patricia got in the car to back out of the driveway. Joel sat down, cross-legged, behind the car before it backed up. As Grace backed the car, Joel was hit-the car running over Joel. Grace stopped the car, exited (as did Patricia), and attempted to render aid to Joel. Patricia began screaming. Jay ran from the front of the house to where Joel lay and began yelling and asking what had happened. Patricia continued to be upset and protective of her mother, telling Jay to \"get away from her\" as he approached. Grace immediately called 911 requesting assistance and imploring them to come quickly, as she attempted to calm Patricia and deal with Jay. After the ambulance arrived, Joel was taken to an area hospital where he died from his injuries. Later that evening, Grace was taken into custody for driving without a valid driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 54. The following morning while in jail, Grace met with Detective Hill of the Kosciusko Police Department, who was investigating the incident. After waiving her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, Grace told Detective Hill that she and Patricia were leaving the house because Joel was in a drunken, emotional state and Joel was arguing with his son Jay. She stated that she was trying to get herself and Patricia away from Jay's and Joel's agitated states. She also stated that at no time did she ever see anyone else outside of the house, nor did she ever know that Joel was behind the car. Grace told Detective Hill of security cameras in operation at the house and offered to go with him to the house to view the footage. After viewing the footage, Detective Hill took possession of the \"system and entire monitors,\" which included a secure digital (SD) card containing the footage. Ten-year-old Patricia also met with Detective Hill the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 55. Detective Hill experienced trouble in scheduling an interview with Jay. He managed to interview Jay almost three months after the incident. That interview occurred after police reports and surveillance footage concerning the incident were obtained by Jay and Joel's extended family. The details of Jay's statements to Detective Hill were not in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 56. This case was presented to the Attala County grand jury, which returned an indictment for Grace for second-degree murder in violation of\n   Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-19(1)(b) (Rev. 2014). The case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    TESTIMONY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 57. Grace's testimony corroborated her prior statements to Detective Hill. Patricia testified that she \"didn't see anybody\" outside, except for Jay on the sidewalk in front of the house, but that she did not see him until they were \"backing out.\" When asked if she ever saw Joel come outside, she said,\"No, sir.\" When asked for the first time she saw Joel, she said, \"Whenever we backed over him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 58. Jay, the deceased's son, was not related to either Grace or Patricia. Along with Joel, Grace, and Patricia, Jay was at the house that evening. His testimony alone challenged Grace's and Patricia's. Jay's mental capacity has been impaired because of a prior accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 59. At the pretrial-motion hearing, Grace moved to challenge Jay's competency to testify at trial. Some years prior, Jay was involved in an automobile accident. In describing his abilities post-accident, Jay testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   It messed my mind up a good little bit but my mental doctor sent me to-it was some kind of special school that I had to go to [sic] learn to read and some rehabilitation like that. I could remember certain things but somebody really got me riled up or something I would forget it real quick. And they got me on medicine to keep me calm like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The trial court found Jay competent to testify based on his \"ability to recall the events of the night in question.\" Jay also testified during trial to his cognitive disabilities, saying that when his heart rate speeds up and he gets excited, that triggers his memory loss. Jay also testified, \"I have to keep my pen and notebook for certain things, you know. If I think it is serious I make a note. And every night before I go to bed I get my notebook out and see what happened ....\" But when asked if he wrote down anything from the night of the incident, he said, \"No sir. Certain things stick, like what happened to Daddy I do remember certain things, you know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 60. At trial, Jay testified that it was Grace and Joel that were arguing that evening both inside the house and outside in the front, and:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   I don't know what they were arguing about, but Ms. Grace was going to leave and go somewhere. And he said he wasn't going to let her take his car to go nowhere that he would take her somewhere or he would make a call for somebody to come pick her up. And they were arguing and they were standing out there in front of the house and they kept arguing something. And I started-Daddy said, \"Go back inside. It will be all right, Jay.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   After an objection, Jay was asked if he said Joel and Grace were having an argument about her taking the car. He continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Well, I don't know what they were-I thought that's what it was because she was getting in the car wanting to go somewhere. I don't know if they got in an argument before that or what but that's what he said that she wasn't taking the car nowhere. He could call somebody to come get her or something because he said, \"That's the only vehicle I got right now and you're not taking it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Ms. Grace was in the car and Daddy had walked up-there's a hill going up the driveway and about middle ways of the hill there is a crack going across the driveway. And that's where Daddy, he sat down across the crack. And I walked around and I told him, \"Daddy don't do\n   this crap.\" I said, \"Get up and come back in or whatever.\" And he said, \"No. No. Go in. It is all right, Jay. We are arguing about this and whatever.\" And I went to go back in the house and about-there is a walkway that goes down the driveway and then it turns and goes to the other side of the house and you can't see what's going on. And I heard the tires on the car. And I turned around to go back and she had hit him. And about that time I heard the lump but I didn't see it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Jay later testified, \"I can't remember real good. I keep thinking and thinking about it but I can't bring around exactly how it happened and I don't want to lead y'all wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 61. When asked how many times Jay had talked about what happened that night with other McCarty family members, specifically his brother and uncle, he testified, \"A good little bit. Because-a good bit. Because I would ask him, like I say, I'm really forgetful. Like he would tell me something and I would leave the room and a couple of minutes later and come and say explain that to me. I would start repeating what he said. I would say, see, I just lost it again. Tell me again exactly what happened, what you said happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 62. Toward the close of Jay's testimony, he reiterated, \"I'm trying to remember exactly how it happened. The more I think about it the more it makes my mind [sic] because I get madder and madder that I can't remember exactly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    SURVEILLANCE VIDEO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 63. The surveillance footage shown to the jury was from a camera on the driveway side of the house pointed up the length of the driveway toward the street. According to testimony, the video footage showed two moments discrete in time: when the car containing Grace, Jay, Joel, and Patricia pulled into the driveway returning home from earlier in the day, interrupted by blank video, and then it showed the moment the car struck Joel. However, the only video footage found in the record is an approximately thirty-three-second clip of when the car driven by Grace began to back out of the driveway, running over Joel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 64. The video found in the record begins with the moment the car starts backing up-Grace and Patricia inside, windows up, and Joel visible seated cross-legged directly behind the vehicle, in the vehicle's blind spot. As the car backed up the hill out of the driveway, Joel began to get up in attempt to get out of the way. The car knocked Joel down and ran over him. Grace decelerated after the first thump stopping the car. She and Patricia got out and went to Joel. The video shows Jay then running over from the front of the house after Grace and Patricia are already out of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 65. In the accompanying audio, outside of an incognizable sound at the start of the video, the following is audible: the vehicle's engine running as it is given gas to back up the hill, a thud from the back wheel as it runs over Joel, the engine decelerating at the first thud, the second thud as the front wheel runs over Joel, Patricia screaming inside the car immediately after Joel is hit and after she and Grace exit the car, Jay yelling incognizably, and Patricia imploring Jay to \"leave her alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 66. Detective Hill testified that his reports indicated that he saw footage from a camera that looked directly at the front porch and that he saw a \"disco ball\" hanging from the porch awning. But Detective Hill then testified that his prior report was mistaken and that he must have been thinking of a photo he had taken of the\n   same area with the same disco ball in the frame.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 67. Grace testified concerning what she saw while watching the video at her house with Detective Hill. According to Grace, the video showed \"my daughter running down the sidewalk. I hear me saying 'run, run, run' and then the doors are still open on the car even. I guess-the doors are open, like we open doors up, and you could see in the video that Joel comes running out and sat down behind my car. He squatted his legs and he sat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 68. Kendall Blaylock testified on behalf of the State as an expert in computer forensics regarding the surveillance footage. Blaylock partially addressed the abrupt beginning of the video-camera footage that was shown to the jury. Blaylock testified that there were two camera views recorded on the SD card for the surveillance system: one along the side of the house looking up the driveway toward the street, and the other viewing the \"front walk\" of the house. Blaylock testified, however, that only footage from the driveway view was found on the SD card for the day of the incident. Blaylock testified that the camera looking at the front of the house last recorded to the SD card on October 31, and for no explicable reason, it stopped recording to the SD card after that date. He testified that video files had been deleted from the SD card, stating that those deletions looked to be in the \"normal operation of the system[.]\" Blaylock also testified that \"there were some files that I'm not able to put a date on, but those didn't look to come from that time either.\" Blaylock testified that he wanted to look at the actual computer itself and not just the SD card because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   [e]ven if it was recording straight to the SD card, I would want to be able to look at the computer because you may be backing up archive videos to the computer. You know, just like backing up pictures from a camera, I may want to save those to my computer at some point. The other thing is the potential or something recording straight to a computer, I may want to be able to see that. Any time, honestly, you know, if I saw a computer sitting next to other digital equipment, I would want to see what was on the computer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Blaylock further testified that he never had access to the actual computer and that there was no way for him to know if there was footage from the surveillance system stored directly on the computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    JURY'S INSTRUCTIONS AND VERDICT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 69. Among the jury instructions given was Instruction 5 (S-2), which instructed the jury that, should it find the State failed to prove that Grace was guilty of second-degree murder, then it should proceed with deliberations on the lesser-included offense of manslaughter. The instruction describes two kinds of manslaughter: heat-of-passion manslaughter and culpable-negligence manslaughter. Particularly troubling, the section on culpable-negligence manslaughter read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   The Court instructs the Jury that if you believe from the evidence in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Grace Ann McCarty a/k/a Grace Ann Woods a/k/a Grace Ann Proctor, on or about November 2, 2014, in Attala County, Mississippi, killed Joel McCarty, a human being, without authority of law and by\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   culpable negligence, then the defendant is guilty of Manslaughter and it is your sworn duty to so find.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 70. The jury returned its verdict and found Grace \"guilty of manslaughter.\" Grace moved for a judgment notwithstanding\n   the verdict and a new trial, both of which were denied, and she timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 71. The jury did not state under which theory of manslaughter they found Grace guilty, nor did the trial court inquire into such; however, the \"Notice of Criminal Disposition\" from the trial-court clerk's office stated that Grace was sentenced under Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-47 (Rev. 2014), the culpable-negligence-manslaughter statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 72. Grace's appeal argues that (1) the evidence was insufficient, (2) the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a mistrial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 73. The majority affirms the jury's verdict, finding that there was sufficient evidence to convict Grace of murder or manslaughter; that the jury's verdict finding Grace guilty of manslaughter was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence; and that the error in the jury instruction did not constitute plain error or a manifest miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 74. However, the trial court improperly instructed the jury on culpable-negligence manslaughter focusing the jury on \"\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   culpable negligence,\" but not her culpable negligence, which is plain error. Further, the evidence for the jury's verdict is insufficient for heat-of-passion manslaughter, and due to the lack of evidence presented and its conflicting nature, allowing the jury's verdict for culpable-negligence manslaughter to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 75. Due to the plain error in instructing the jury, this case should be reversed and remanded. It is unclear which manslaughter the jury found Grace guilty of committing, heat-of-passion manslaughter or culpable-negligence manslaughter. Though the improper jury instruction is plain error, for which the unspecified verdict should be reversed and remanded, a discussion of the evidence presented for heat-of-passion and culpable-negligence manslaughter remains warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Culpable-Negligence Manslaughter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 76. Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-47 states that \"[e]very other killing of a human being, by the act, procurement, or culpable negligence of another, and without authority of law, not provided for in this title, shall be manslaughter.\" Culpable negligence is defined as \"the conscious and wanton or reckless disregard of the probabilities of fatal consequences to others as a result of the wilful creation of an unreasonable risk thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Chandler v.

The supreme court has also defined culpable negligence as \"such gross negligence as to evince a wanton or reckless disregard for the safety of human life, or such an indifference to the consequences of an act under the surrounding circumstances as to render such conduct tantamount to willfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337850\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/946/355/#p361\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Shumpert v.

Jury Instruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 77. A review of the jury instruction for culpable-negligence manslaughter reveals that the jury was instructed to determine Grace's guilt or innocence based on \"\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   culpable negligence,\" that being Joel's, not Grace's. (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 78. The majority admits that this jury instruction was in error, but finds that it does not rise to the level of plain error and that the issue is procedurally barred because it was not objected to at trial nor raised on appeal. However, the instruction given to the jury created \"plain error\" and, therefore, the court may review the record and address the unpreserved issue on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Lafayette v.

To do otherwise is reversible error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346557\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/212/22/#p28\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 79.

Thus, \"[t]he causation element is present in this definition-the unlawful killing must be a result of the\n   <em>\n    defendant's\n   </em>\n   culpable negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013774\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/108/956/#p968\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Therefore, the trial court's instructions to the jury must have contained, in some form, that Grace's culpable negligence caused Joel's death. However, instruction 5 (S-2) required the jury to find Grace guilty of culpable-negligence manslaughter by \"\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   [ (Joel's) ] negligence\" (emphasis added). This resulted in plain error. \"Failure to instruct the jury on the essential elements of the crime is plain error.\"\n   <em>\n    Wordlaw v.

The record reveals that Joel sat cross-legged in the driveway uphill and immediately behind a running automobile, in the middle of the back of the car and in its blind spot, before it backed out. While such behavior by Joel could be described as negligence \"of a degree so gross as to be tantamount to a wanton disregard of, or utter indifference to, the safety of human life,\" the jury instruction provided the law that Grace could be found guilty of manslaughter based upon Joel's culpable negligence. This equates to a peremptory instruction, requiring the jury to find Grace guilty, if it found that Joel was culpably negligent. Such is an error which is \"plain, clear, and obvious,\" and clearly \"prejudiced the outcome of the trial.\" As such, it is reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Further, the majority finds that the jury's verdict was not against the weight of the evidence because the State and defense presented conflicting testimony. The majority reasons that as appellate courts, the supreme court and court of appeals \"do not make independent resolution of conflicting evidence,\" but rather \"the jury [is] the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and the weight and worth of their testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Little v.

Oct. 12, 2017). Although I understand the newly clarified standard promulgated in\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   , I would find that in order to review whether a \"a verdict ... is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice\" requires the court to evaluate the weight of the entire evidence- which inevitably involves the consideration of witness credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 82. Upon review, Jay testified but then appeared to simultaneously recant, disqualify, and impeach his own testimony. He testified as to his version of that night,\n   but that he really was not sure, could not remember, or did not want to misspeak to the trial court. There was also Jay's impairment at the time of the incident and at trial. He said his impairment causes memory loss when his heart rate speeds up and when he gets excited. The surveillance footage, the recorded 911 call, and the testimony of the first responders suggest that Jay was highly agitated that night. Jay also stated he makes notes in his journal every night of everything important that happened during the day so that he does not forget. Jay testified that he did not make any notes of that night and no entries of that night, were brought into evidence. Jay also testified that he cannot remember what happened; that his brother would have to tell him what happened; and that he would walk off, try to process it, and then go back to his brother and have his brother tell him again how the events occurred because he had forgotten. Yet he testified that he remembered what happened that night because \"some things stick.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 83. It is noteworthy that Jay was not made available for a police interview until after Joel and Jay's extended family acquired the police reports and the surveillance footage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 84. As noted by the trial court, Grace maintained that she never even knew Joel was outside, let alone behind the car. She testified that she never saw anyone outside. She testified that it was Jay and Joel arguing in the house that evening and that she was leaving with Patricia to get away from them. She did give different reasons for operating the car to the 911 operator and first responders, but when she talked with Detective Hill she volunteered that her prior stated reasons were not accurate and that she was trying to leave because Jay and Joel were arguing. She stated that she did not state the same to the 911 operator and the first responders \"because I was afraid I was not going to be able to go to the hospital because I had no license. I had a suspended license. And I was afraid that if I told them that, I wouldn't be able to make it to the hospital. And I knew he was in really bad shape.\" Her reasoning appears corroborated because she was indeed arrested for driving with a suspended license while she was at a gas station en route to the hospital with Shay, also Joel's son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 85. Patricia's testimony corroborated Grace's. She testified that Jay and Joel were arguing that night, that she and Grace were leaving the house to get away from them, that she was unaware anyone else was outside until she saw Jay standing in front of the house on the sidewalk as they were backing out, and that she did not know Joel was outside until after she realized they hit him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 86. The video found in the record does not impeach Grace or Patricia's testimony, nor does it corroborate Jay's. At the start of the video, the PT Cruiser is backing up with Grace and Patricia inside, windows up, and no one else visible except Joel, who is seated cross-legged directly behind the vehicle and clearly in the middle of the vehicle's blind spot. As the car backs up the hill out of the driveway, Joel attempts to get out of the way. Grace stops the car, and she and Patricia get out and go to Joel. Jay comes running over from the\n   front of the house after Grace and Patricia are already out of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 87. In the accompanying audio, besides an incognizable sound at the start of the video, the following is audible: the engine running as it is given gas, the thuds from both sets of axle-wheels as they hit Joel, the engine immediately stops revving at the first thud, Grace and Patricia get out, Patricia screaming inside the car immediately after Joel is hit and after she exits the car, Jay yelling incoherently, and Patricia yelling \"leave her alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 88. The video begins abruptly after blank footage with Grace and Patricia in the car and Joel sitting cross-legged behind it. The failure of the surveillance system to record the scene before then is unexplained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 89. According to Grace, when at the house viewing the video with Detective Hill she saw \"[her] daughter running down the sidewalk. I hear me saying 'run, run, run' and then the doors are still open on the car even. I guess-the doors are open, like we open doors up, and you could see in the video that Joel comes running out and sat down behind my car. He squatted his legs and he sat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 90. Grace testified that after Detective Hill had viewed the video, she was outside with her mother when Detective Hill said \"that he didn't feel like this would ever go to trial, it would ever go before the grand jury. It was obvious that I had not, there was no way I could see that he ran-that I ran over him. There was no way you could see it.\" Grace's mother, Patricia, corroborated Grace's testimony. Grace's mother testified that, while she, Grace, and Detective Hill were in front of the house, Detective Hill said, \"it is plain to see that you could not have seen him. That it shouldn't even go before the grand jury.\" Detective Hill denied making the statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Heat-of-Passion Manslaughter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 91. Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-35 (Rev. 2014) states that \"[t]he killing of a human being, without malice, in the heat of passion, but in a cruel and unusual manner, or by the use of a dangerous weapon, without authority of law, and not in necessary self-defense, shall be manslaughter.\" \"Heat of passion\" is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   a state of violent and uncontrollable rage engendered by a blow or certain other provocation given, which will reduce a homicide from the grade of murder to that of manslaughter. Passion or anger suddenly aroused at the time by some immediate and reasonable provocation, by words or acts of one at the time. The term includes an emotional state of mind characterized by anger, rage, hatred, furious resentment or terror.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <em>\n    Batiste v.

The majority finds that the State presented sufficient evidence of the essential elements of second-degree murder and\n   culpable-negligence manslaughter and, therefore, finds it unnecessary to address heat-of-passion manslaughter. However, and perhaps more interestingly, the trial judge during consideration of the jury instructions stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   The only manslaughter instruction I honestly see that might be appropriate is culpable negligence because there-I have not seen any or heard testimony that she was enraged or in some kind of heat of passion when she backed over him. I mean, her testimony was that she didn't even know he was there. I don't see how it can possibly be a heat of passion-I'm certainly open to hearing discussion on the issue but my initial thought is how is it a heat of passion? You have got to have her saying that, you know, she was enraged about something that he had done and backed over him. And the only thing she has maintained is she didn't even know he was there at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   After a review of the colloquy on the jury instructions, it appears the only reason the trial judge granted the instruction on heat-of-passion manslaughter is that neither side objected to giving the instruction and the State's sole reason for requesting it was based on testimony of Joel and Grace's purported \"arguing\" as heat of passion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6 93. Here, there was no testimony that Grace and Joel even physically touched one another that night, let alone during their purported argument. And according to Jay, the argument was possibly about Grace using the car to leave. There was no evidence that Grace was enraged or that passion had usurped her mind. That is insufficient to provide the necessary provocation for heat-of-passion manslaughter because \"disagreements among people are not enough\" to claim heat of passion. As such, there is no way a \"rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 94. There was insufficient evidence to provide the basis for a conviction of heat-of-passion manslaughter. Therefore, the evidentiary weight of the same need not be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 95. Though not cited as error on appeal, the court's instruction to the jury that Grace could be found guilty of manslaughter because of \"\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   [ (Joel's) ] culpable negligence\" (emphasis added) created plain error that \"caused a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368618\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/233/288/#p289\">\n    233 So.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204546740\">\n    2017 WL 4546740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (\u00b6 46). Further, considering the evidence presented and its nature as discussed above, allowing the jury's verdict for culpable-negligence manslaughter to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice. The case should be reversed and remanded because of the plain error in the improper instruction of the jury on culpable-negligence manslaughter. Also, the evidence submitted was insufficient on heat-of-passion manslaughter to uphold a conviction of that crime. Therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   LEE, C.J., CARLTON AND WESTBROOKS, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    <em>\n     Miranda v.
