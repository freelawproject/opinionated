For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The deceased, August C. Baxter (August) died in 2005 at the age of 83. August was married three times. Of his first marriage, two daughters were born: Barbara Eve Schack and Debra A. Mulder. Of his second marriage, two sons were born, the succession administrator, John Brandt Baxter (John), and Eric Baxter (Eric). Named as a defendant is August's step-son, Robert C. Lewis (Robert), who is the child of Luella M. Lewis, August's third wife. August and Luella married in 1978 and established a separate property matrimonial regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   August suffered two strokes in 1997. Luella obtained a power of attorney to handle his affairs and August created a will in 1999 designating Barbara Schack executrix in the event that Luella predeceased him. In 2002, Luella died. Robert, one day prior to the death of his mother, obtained a power of attorney over the affairs of August. Two days after Luella's funeral, August executed a second codicil to his will. The codicils contain provisions relating to August's wishes during his life as to who will care for him and what nursing home he wished to be placed in. In September 2004, Robert filed a petition to have August interdicted. John and Eric contested the interdiction. Following a hearing in October 2004, August was fully interdicted with Robert named curator and Schack undercurator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2005, Schack, a California resident, was named executrix of August's will and Schack began administering the estate. On April 13, 2006, John and Eric filed a Petition to Annul Statutory Testament of August Constantine Baxter arguing that August did not have testamentary capacity at the time he executed the will and codicils. Schack, Mulder, and Robert were named as defendants. In November 2007, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, and the matter was tried in June 2009. In February 2010, the trial court rendered a judgment declaring the will and codicils null, finding that August lacked testamentary capacity to execute them. Schack ceased being the executor, although she did not resign. John was appointed independent administrator of August's succession on April 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2017, the succession filed a petition against Robert for damages for breach of fiduciary duty. The petition alleged that Robert breached his fiduciary duties to August by self-dealing, fraud, breaching the duty of loyalty, and breach of trust. The 110-page petition sets forth detailed allegations of fraud and self-dealing. The succession urged that the prescriptive period applicable to the claims was that of ten years as found in La.Civ. Code art. 3499. It further argued that\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   applied to suspend prescription and that its claims would not prescribe until April 5, 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Robert filed an exception of prescription, which the trial court took under advisement. In November 2017, the trial court sustained Robert's exception of prescription and dismissed the succession's claims. The succession now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The Trial Court erred by sustaining the Prescription Exception and dismissing the Baxter Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The Trial Court erred by failing to apply\n   <em>\n    Contra Non Valentem\n   </em>\n   to suspend the prescriptive period for asserting the Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3. The Trial Court erred by not granting the Plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to amend the Baxter petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    PRESCRIPTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Prescription\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the trial court's November 2017 order, it granted Robert's exception of prescription and dismissed the succession's claim finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   the allegations concern alleged acts of Defendant occurring more than ten (10) years ago, thus, albeit a prescriptive period of one or ten years, the cause of action has prescribed as a matter of law. The alleged acts of malfeasance were known to Plaintiff at the time of decedent's death in 2005. Plaintiff defends with the judicially-created exception to statutory prescription,\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem agree nulla currit praescriptio.\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiff at all time had standing to remove the former executrix under La.Code Civ.P. art. 3137 or traverse the proposed detailed descriptive list pursuant La.Code Civ. P. art. 3182. Further, standing for Plaintiff to contest the subject power of attorney and the interdiction always existed prior to decedent's passing. Awaiting appointment as Independent Administrator of the decedent's estate did not toll prescription for Plaintiff's claims for other avenues for relief were available in the interim. Therefore, Plaintiff's petition must be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The peremptory exception of prescription is provided for in La.Code Civ.P. art. 927.

These\n   categories thus allow \"the courts to weigh the 'equitable nature of the circumstances in each individual case' to determine whether prescription will be tolled.\" R.O.M.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1545.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to John's petition, Robert's breaches of his fiduciary duty in handling August's affairs began on June 13, 2002, the day he was appointed August's agent under the power of attorney agreement. However, in his petition, John argues that under\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [T]he earliest this suit could have been brought by an administrator of [August's] succession was the day after Ms. Schack could have been replaced as executrix. Since the Court rendered the Will Annulment Judgment on February 26, 2010, it was executable after the expiration of the time for a motion for new trial and suspensive appeal elapsed-or about April 5, 2010. Thus, the latest this lawsuit could be filed by the administrator of [August's] succession-[John Baxter]-for purposes of the ten-year prescriptive period is on or about April 5, 2020. Therefore, this lawsuit is timely filed and the claims stated herein have not prescribed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We disagree. August died in 2005, and John was well aware of the claims existing at that time of his death when Robert's control over August's affairs ceased as evidenced by the fact that the codicils executed under Robert's power of attorney were subsequently invalidated due to lack of testamentary capacity. Whether he had been appointed succession administrator is of no moment. John had recourse against Robert for his claims that Robert breached his fiduciary duties under the power of attorney agreement or for breach of his duties as a curator. The fiduciary relationship existed in both instances. As a legal heir, John had standing to contest the power of attorney granted in Robert's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.Civ.Code art. 1926 and\n   <em>\n    Noel v.

Further, La.R.S. 9:1025 provides that a \"relative of an interdict ... may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of a curator\" for breach of his fiduciary duties.
