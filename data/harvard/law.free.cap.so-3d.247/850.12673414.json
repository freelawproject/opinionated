Ultimately, the parties reached a settlement and submitted their request for approval of the compromise settlement, which the WCJ approved and additionally rendered a judgment of dismissal on October 3, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, Mr. Clark petitioned the WCJ to amend the order of approval to include language that reflected a division of the indemnity portion of the settlement over Mr. Clark's total lifetime, without altering the amount of the settlement agreed upon by the parties. His request was for the purpose of allowing the Social Security Administration (SSA) to pro-rate his settlement so that it could calculate any disability offset required as a result of the settlement. Walgreens objected to the amendment of the order and filed an exception of res judicata and a motion for sanctions. Following a March 27, 2017 hearing, the WCJ rendered an amended order of approval on June 2, 2017, to include language reflecting the indemnity aspect of the settlement over the total lifetime of the claimant and finding the \"functionally limiting effects of the injuries or medical conditions upon which this settlement is based shall exist for the remainder of the employee's life expectancy.\" The amended order of approval further set forth a computation of monthly indemnity benefits based on the overall net settlement to Mr. Clark, which was referred to as \"a stipulated monthly amount of $373.33.\" The court minutes from the hearing also indicate that both the exception of res judicata and the motion for sanctions were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Walgreens appealed from the amended order on July 28, 2017; however, the record indicates that its motion for appeal was denied based on the lack of a final judgment in the matter. Subsequently, the WCJ rendered a judgment on August 21, 2017, which stated that it \"replaces and supersedes the Amended Order signed on the 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   day of June, 2017 and is in conformity with my ruling in open court.\" Notice of the signing of this judgment was forwarded to all counsel on August 22, 2017. Among other issues addressed in this judgment was the formal denial of Walgreens' exception of res judicata and motion for sanctions. Walgreens appeals both the June 2, 2017 amending order and the August 21, 2017 judgment, asserting three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The trial court was legally erroneous in amending the Original Order of Approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.

Walgreens argues that its July 28, 2017 motion appealing the June 2, 2017 amended order, which was signed by the WCJ on July 31, 2017, divested the WCJ of jurisdiction to render its August 21, 2017 judgment. However, the record reflects that the order for appeal was, in fact, denied, as it contains a strike-through of the order and the WCJ's signature. It further contains marginal notations reflecting that it was denied. In conjunction with the August 21, 2017 judgment, the WCJ notified counsel for both parties that \"[t]his Judgment was redone so the employer could have an appealable judgment and to be in conformity with my ruling on March 27, 2017.\" Accordingly, we find no merit in Walgreens' argument that the WCJ was divested of jurisdiction based on its original motion for appeal, as the record reflects that this motion was denied by the WCJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its first assignment of error, Walgreens asserts that the WCJ committed legal error by amending the October 3, 2016 order approving the settlement, first, by the amended order on June 2, 2017, and, second, by the judgment rendered on August 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McCarroll v.

He stated that this language was required so that the SSA could \"properly calculate any federal offset\" resulting from his simultaneous receipt of workers' compensation benefits and Social Security Disability Income (SSDI). In response, Walgreens opposed Mr. Clark's motion to amend and filed an exception of res judicata and a motion for sanctions pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 863(B)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following a hearing on the motions and the exception, the WCJ amended its original order of approval on June 2, 2017, to include the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   It is expected that the functionally limiting effects of the injuries or medical conditions upon which this settlement is based shall exist for the remainder of the employee's life expectancy. For the purpose of prorating this settlement by the Social Security Administration and any disability policy, it is specified that the wage earner, KENNETTH [sic] CLARK, is a white male, sixty (60) years old with a reduced life expectancy of another 25 years, or 400 months. After deducting attorney's fees in the amount of TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO/100 ($28,000.00), the net amount of the indemnity portion of the settlement to Employee is ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND AND 00/100 (112,000.00). This amount being paid for future indemnity benefits pursuant to this compromised settlement agreement shall serve as substitute for periodic indemnity payments owed and/or payable for the remainder of KENNETH CLARK'S life, which computes to a stipulated monthly amount of $373.33. And further adding that Mr. Clark agrees that the inclusion of the foregoing provision cannot and will not be interpreted as any statement regarding whether or not he is now or may become totally and permanently disabled. Mr. Clark understands that the\n   settlement extinguishes his right to all past, present, and future benefits under the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Act, and he waives any claims regarding the proper discount rate pursuant to R.S. 23:1274.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Subsequent to the WCJ's amended order, a written judgment was rendered on August 21, 2017, in which the WCJ formally denied Walgreens' motion for sanctions and exception of res judicata and granted Mr. Clark's motion to amend, reciting the identical language of the June 2, 2017 amended order approving the settlement. The judgment further stated that it replaced and superseded the June 2, 2017 amended order and that it was \"in conformity with my ruling in open court.\" Walgreens filed a motion for a devolutive appeal on September 11, 2017, which was granted by the WCJ that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While it is true that a judgment rendered in conformity with La.R.S. 23:1272 is \"virtually unassailable,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a final judgment may still be amended in accordance with La.Code Civ.P. art. 1951, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   On motion of the court or any party, a final judgment may be amended at any time to alter the phraseology of the judgment, but not its substance, or to correct errors of calculation.

Thus, the WCJ was correct in stating that this language added nothing substantive to the language of the compromise settlement. Substantively, the compromise settlement provided that Walgreens agreed to pay Mr. Clark\n   $148,574.00 in exchange for Mr. Clark's full and final settlement of all claims against it. The added language, rather than substantively changing that agreement, merely changed the phraseology of the order of approval. It neither takes from nor adds to the settlement; rather, it merely assists the SSA in determining the offset it will take from Mr. Clark's monthly SSDI benefits based on the funds he receives from this settlement, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 424a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because, as stated by the WCJ, the settlement amount \"serves as a substitute for periodic indemnity payments\" Mr. Clark would have received from Walgreens in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Walgreens was aware that Mr. Clark was receiving SSDI benefits, as he testified at the September 30, 2014 trial on the merits that he began receiving the benefits due to his back condition at approximately the same time that Walgreens reduced his workers' compensation benefits. In view of the axiom that \"workers' compensation law is to be liberally construed in favor of protecting workers from the economic burden of work-related injuries[,]\" we find no merit in Walgreens' argument that the WCJ's August 21, 2017 judgment substantively changed the original October 3, 2016 order of approval.\n   <em>\n    McCarroll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896296\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/1173/#p1176\">\n    156 So.3d at 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We further find no merit in Walgreens' assertion that the amended language could potentially convert the parties' compromise settlement to a lump sum settlement and lead to future challenges by Mr. Clark based on the use of an improper discount rate. Both the amended order and the judgment clearly state that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Mr. Clark agrees that the inclusion of the foregoing provision cannot and will not be interpreted as any statement regarding whether or not he is now or may become totally and permanently disabled. Mr. Clark understands that the settlement extinguishes his right to all past, present, and future benefits under the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Act, and he waives any claims regarding the proper discount rate pursuant to [ R.S. 23:1274 ].\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thus, we find no merit in this argument and in this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In its final assignment of error, Walgreens argues that the WCJ legally erred in denying both its exception of res judicata and its motion for sanctions. However, based on our finding that the WCJ had the\n   legal authority to amend the original order of approval and the fact that the August 21, 2017 judgment in no way substantively changed that order, we find no merit in this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    ANSWER TO APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In response to Walgreens' appeal, Mr. Clark filed an answer to appeal, in which he seeks an award of attorney fees based on La.Code Civ.P. art. 2164. That article provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The appellate court shall render any judgment which is just, legal, and proper upon the record on appeal.

In doing so, we find that this appeal is so devoid of merit that it justifies being labeled as frivolous.
