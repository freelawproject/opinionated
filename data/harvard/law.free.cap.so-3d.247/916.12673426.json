The insurer denied the plaintiff's claims, alleging that its insured waived UM coverage. The plaintiff challenged the validity of the UM waiver. The issue of UM coverage was presented to the trial court in cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion for partial summary judgment filed by the plaintiff and denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the insurer, finding that the policy provided UM coverage for the plaintiff's damages. The insurer filed an appeal and an application for supervisory writs challenging that judgment, which this court consolidated. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff, Joey Higginbotham, was employed as a truck driver for Dupre Logistics, LLC (Dupre), when he was involved in a January 25, 2013 on-the-job automobile accident. He filed the underlying\n   action for damages against the other driver involved in the accident, as well as his insurer, USAgencies Casualty Insurance Company. Later, the plaintiff filed a supplemental and amending petition naming Dupre's trucker's liability insurer, Zurich American Insurance Company (Zurich) as a defendant, seeking UM coverage under the policy it issued to Dupre. In its answer to the amended petition, Zurich admitted that it issued trucker's liability insurance to Dupre, but denied coverage for the plaintiff's claims based upon its assertion that Dupre waived UM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Zurich filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the plaintiff's claims against it, alleging that Dupre waived UM coverage in the initial policy Zurich issued to it in October 2005, TRK 5916139-00, and in the renewal policies issued to it over the next six years. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that the Zurich policy afforded UM coverage for his claims because the purported waiver did not comply with Louisiana law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the close of a contradictory hearing, the trial court issued a ruling from the bench denying Zurich's motion for summary judgment and granting the motion for partial summary judgment filed by the plaintiff. In oral reasons for ruling given at that time, the trial court concluded that the 2005 UM form and the subsequent UM forms executed in conjunction with the renewal policies issued by Zurich\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were not valid for the reasons stated by this court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Upon application of the law to the evidence presented, this court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [W]e find the\n   <strong>\n    insurer failed to comply with the first formality\n   </strong>\n   which requires that the\n   <strong>\n    insured\n    <em>\n     chose\n    </em>\n    between types of UM coverage\n   </strong>\n   and outright rejection of all UM coverage. Compliance with this formality ensures that the insured by his own volition read and reviewed each available selection and consciously\n   and knowingly made a decision by the placement of his initials on the blank reflecting his choice. Mr. Johnson was not given any choice or option because the form had only one available selection when it was presented to him. The only blank which was left open, which Mr. Johnson was asked to initial, was the selection which stated: \"I do not want UMBI Coverage.\" All other blanks for the selection of UM coverage were pre-filled and marked \"N/A\" by Ms. Bass prior to the presentation of the form to Mr. Johnson. He initialed the only blank left open and signed the form.... The \"N/A\" designation was typed into the blanks which proves the blanks were filled in ahead of time and printed out in anticipation of Mr. Johnson's arrival shortly after closing. There is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest the insured had access to the form before it was presented to him or otherwise placed the computer generated \"N/A\" in the blank spaces before the form was signed. This evidence supports Mr. Johnson's testimony that he arrived at the agency with his check and was handed a pre-printed form to sign which left him with no option except to reject UM coverage. He also testified there was no discussion between him and Ms. Bass regarding his selection. He did testify, which testimony was not refuted, that he told Ms. Bass over the telephone he wanted \"full coverage.\" We have examined the evidence presented and find there is nothing to indicate Mr. Johnson made a conscious choice among several options. While in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   a post-filled form was found defective, we find in this case,\n   <strong>\n    a form which is pre-filled by the agent leaving the insured with no choice but to reject UM coverage is equally defective\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8390913\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/977/839/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8390913\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/977/839/\">\n    at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Then, and only then, can Zurich avail itself to the \"rebuttable presumption\" afforded by La.R.S. 22:1295.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its oral reasons for ruling, the trial court in this matter concluded that the 2005 form was invalid based on this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8385521\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/980/870/\">\n    980 So.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In doing so, the trial court remarked that it found it interesting that the supreme court \"quoted a First Circuit case for [the foregoing] proposition.\" Thereafter, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Again, I can't speculate or read the minds of those judges that rendered those decisions in the First Circuit. But I believe that they are not properly addressing the significance of the insertion of the letters \"N/A\" into the blanks. Rather, they are immediately going to the supporting documents, affidavits, depositions, et cetera, and discerning the parties' intent to then explain the \"N/A\" rather than following the clear mandates of\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   and cases like\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   that say, \"Don't look past the form, look at the form first.\" On the form, the very first requirement-the first of the six (6) that were given to us by\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   is that number one, the insured must initial the selection or rejection chosen, chosen, to indicate that the decision was made by the insured. As I said earlier, I feel that the approach or the analysis by the Third Circuit was correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After having completed a de novo review of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, we are convinced that the plaintiff met his burden of proving entitlement to partial summary judgment in his favor. The most telling evidence that supports our finding is the following pre-printed language on the original UM form, part of which we bold for emphasis: \"(Economic-only UMBI Coverage\n   <strong>\n    may not be available\n   </strong>\n   from your insurance company. In this case, your company will have marked options 3 and 4 below as \"\n   <strong>\n    Not Available\n   </strong>\n   .\").\" Thereafter, \"N/A\" was typed on the four blanks that include some type of UM coverage. Thus, it is preposterous for Zurich to suggest that the pre-printed UM form that it presented to Dupre made Dupre aware of coverage options that the form said were not available. Moreover, as the plaintiff correctly points out, the 2005 UM form is facially invalid, and Dupre's intent to waive UM coverage is irrelevant and cannot cure any defect in that form. Zurich's attempts to distinguish this matter from\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8385521\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/980/870/\">\n    980 So.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , are unpersuasive. The intent of the parties is quite simply irrelevant where a UM form does not meet the requirements of Louisiana law, which the supreme court laid out in\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   and which this court correctly applied in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Zurich's motion for summary judgment, in granting the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, and in holding that the trucker's liability policy that Zurich issued to Dupre provides UM coverage for the damages suffered by the plaintiff in the January 25, 2013 accident. Thus, Zurich's first assignment of error lacks merit, and we need not discuss its remaining assigned errors or the errors asserted in its writ application as they are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Costs of this proceeding are assessed to the defendant-appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.

For example, Mr. Coussan explained in his affidavit that he was \"aware that Dupr\u00e9 had the choice and option to select UMBI insurance coverage at the same limits as liability coverage, at lesser limits, at minimum limits, or to reject UMBI insurance coverage altogether.\" He explained that he had \"discussed and communicated with the agents and brokers for Dupr\u00e9 since he became primarily responsible for obtaining the policies of insurance\" and that \"[h]e ha[d] consistently and repeatedly communicated to the agents and brokers that Dupr\u00e9 does not want UMBI insurance coverage in Louisiana.\" Mr. Coussan thereafter specifically stated that: \"In response to his communications to the agents and brokers that Dupr\u00e9 does not want UMBI insurance coverage in Louisiana he received the attached Louisiana UMBI Coverage Forms with the \"N/A\" and/or \"Not Available\" inserted from the insurer ....\" Thus, contrary to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8385521\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/980/870/\">\n    980 So.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the plaintiff explained that he wanted \"full coverage\" and that the pre-filled form was presented to him, the insured in this case communicated its preference for no UM coverage, the insurer responded to that communication, and the insured, in turn, ultimately completed the form to decline coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Furthermore, the plaintiff argues broadly as to the holding of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8385521\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/980/870/\">\n    980 So.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , suggesting that the form alone, and not the circumstances of the insurer's placement of \"N/A\" onto the form, must be considered. The plaintiff suggests that such an inquiry would be one into the party's intent and would thus be contrary to the supreme court's statement that an \"insurer cannot rely on the insured's intent to waive UM coverage to cure a defect in the form of the waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. U.S.A.A. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 06-363, p. 14 (La. 11/29/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8324207\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/544/\">\n    950 So.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553. By this argument, the plaintiff collapses the concept of intent to waive UM coverage with the circumstances underlying the execution of such a waiver, i.e., the impetus and timing behind the placement of \"N/A\" onto the form's selections. Importantly, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8385521\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/980/870/\">\n    980 So.2d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiff \"testified there was no discussion between him and [the agent] regarding his selection\" other than his explanation over the telephone that \"he wanted 'full coverage'.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, in my opinion, the facts of the present case differ, and, in fact, evidence indicates that the insurer's inscription on the form came at the direction of the insured. Thereafter, the insured, via Mr. Coussan, initialed the rejection clause. Given that sequence of events, I find no merit in the plaintiff's contention that Zurich's placement of \"N/A\" onto certain selections of the initial, 2005 form indicates that it did not give Dupr\u00e9 a choice other than to select the rejection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Instead, the UM form of October 1, 2005, completed in conjunction with the issuance of the original policy, indicates that the tasks described in\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8324207\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/544/\">\n    950 So.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , were completed. As discussed, Mr. Coussan initialed the rejection of coverage. Additionally, the form includes the printed name of the insured and Mr. Coussan, as \"authorized Representative of Dupr\u00e9 Transport LLC[,]\" signed the form. The subject policy number-TRK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   5916139-00-is also included as is the date of \"10-1-05\".\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8324207\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/544/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Thus, under the facts of this case, I find that the subject form indicates an adequate waiver of UM coverage and that, in turn, the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff and rejecting the entry of summary judgment in favor of Zurich. I find that a reversal of each of those rulings is required. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
