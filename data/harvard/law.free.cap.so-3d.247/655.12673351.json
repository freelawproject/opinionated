The two discussed sports, television, and parents. They also discussed sex, Dygart becoming increasingly explicit. The discussions escalated, and Dygart eventually drove to Tallahassee's Killearn subdivision, where he planned to have sex with fourteen-year-old \"Amber.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When he arrived in Killearn, Dygart learned there was no \"Amber\"; he had been corresponding with a police detective involved in a sting operation. Officers arrested Dygart, and the State charged him with two crimes: one violation of section 847.0135(4)(a), which prohibits traveling for sex with a child (or someone thought to be a child) after using a computer to solicit\n   a child for sex; and one violation of section 847.0135(3)(a), which prohibits using a computer to solicit a child (or someone thought to be a child) for sex, whether the perpetrator travels or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A jury convicted Dygart on both counts, and the trial judge sentenced him to twenty-four months in prison, plus sex-offender probation. Dygart appealed, arguing insufficient evidence, entrapment, and double jeopardy, among others. This court affirmed with a short opinion that addressed only the double-jeopardy issue.\n   <em>\n    Dygart v.

Having reviewed the record, we conclude that Dygart has not met his burden. The record includes dozens of text messages over roughly twenty-four hours and included transmissions from which a jury could find multiple, discrete solicitations.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 847.0135(3), Fla. Stat. (2011) (\"Each separate use of a computer online service, Internet service, local bulletin board service, or any other device capable of electronic data storage or transmission wherein an offense described in this section is committed may be charged as a separate offense.\"). This means Dygart cannot demonstrate that both of his convictions relied on the same specific solicitation, which means that\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   does not require us to vacate either conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We do not disagree with the concurring opinion's observation that we should look\n   to what the State charged. And nothing in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   requires otherwise. Here, the State charged Dygart with one count of traveling (which includes as an element an act of solicitation), along with one count of solicitation (which likewise includes as an element an act of solicitation). We have no reason to assume that both counts are based on a single act of solicitation, particularly when the record shows Dygart committed multiple acts of solicitation. Nor can we accept the argument that an individual act of solicitation is not \"charged\" unless it is charged as a standalone solicitation, unconnected to any traveling violation. When the State charges traveling after solicitation, it is necessarily accusing the defendant of solicitation because solicitation is an element of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 847.0135(4)(a), Fla. Stat. (2011) (prohibiting traveling for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual conduct \"after using a computer online service [or other electronic means] to: (a) Seduce, solicit, lure, or entice\" a person believed to be a child to engage in unlawful sexual conduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Consider an example. Suppose a defendant solicits a minor over the Internet two separate times. No one would dispute that the defendant could be charged with two counts of solicitation; after all, he committed two separate offenses. Now suppose that after one of the two solicitations the same defendant travels to meet the minor for sex. Has he not still committed two separate offenses? Of course he has: one for the crime of solicitation (for the first solicitation, after which he did not travel) and one for traveling to meet the minor after the second solicitation. In this situation, the first offense turned on one solicitation, and the second offense turned on a second, independent solicitation.\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   would not require us to presume there was only one solicitation when the record showed more. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   applies only when multiple convictions turn on the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   solicitation.\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6844508\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/176/914/#p919\">\n    176 So.3d at 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding double jeopardy violation when dual convictions for solicitation and traveling after solicitation were \"based upon the same conduct\");\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12365763\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/223/342/#p351\">\n    223 So.3d at 351-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that Shelley holding applies only when multiple convictions are \"based on a single act of solicitation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Last, the concurring opinion notes that Dygart's jury was not instructed that it could convict on both counts only if it found two separate solicitations. But Dygart does not make that argument himself, and he did not preserve any challenge to the jury instructions. Nor has Dygart challenged the adequacy of the verdict form or the specificity of the charging document. He could have proposed different jury instructions below, objected to the verdict form, or filed a motion for a bill of particulars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   But we cannot reverse based on issues he did not preserve and does not argue here. Our only issue is whether, on this record, Dygart has met his burden of showing a double-jeopardy violation. Because he has not, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   AFFIRMED .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Winokur, J., concurs; Makar, J., concurs in result dubitante with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Makar, J., concurring in result dubitante.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

But for\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   would control in this case. As in\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   , Dygart was charged by information with a single violation of section 847.0135(3) (one act of solicitation on or about October 15th-16th) and a single violation of section 847.0135(4)(b) (\"traveling after solicitation\" on or about October 16th). Like\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   , where the \"State relied upon the same conduct to charge both offenses,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6844508\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/176/914/#p919\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6844508\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/176/914/#p919\">\n    at 916-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the charges here relied upon the same conduct over the same closely-specified time period. And, similarly to what happened in\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   , the State charged no separate and distinct counts of solicitation; only one count was charged against Shelley and Dygart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under these circumstances,\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   holds that dual convictions for these two offenses violates double jeopardy because the charged solicitation count is subsumed in the charged traveling after solicitation count. If Dygart had pled guilty to the two counts, as Shelley did, he would be entitled to relief; that he went to trial and was convicted on the two charged counts shouldn't change that result. Either way, the State is constrained by what it charged, not what it could have charged. As the Second District in\n   <em>\n    Shelley\n   </em>\n   said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The State asserts that because Shelley's three separate uses of computer devices on the date charged in the information would have supported three separate soliciting charges, the soliciting charge is not subsumed by the traveling charge. We are not persuaded by this argument. The State only charged one use of computer devices to solicit, and that charge was based on a solicitation occurring on the same date as the traveling offense.\n   <em>\n    We find no legal basis to deny a double jeopardy challenge based on uncharged conduct simply because it could have been charged.\n   </em>\n   But we acknowledge that convictions for both soliciting and traveling may be legally imposed in cases in which the State has charged and proven separate uses of computer devices to solicit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Shelley v.

Like those in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the jury instructions in this case did not make this distinction, made no reference to the dates in the information, and did not limit the jury's consideration of uncharged solicitations.
