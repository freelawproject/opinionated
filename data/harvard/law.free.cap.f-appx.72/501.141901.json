The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to eighty-seven months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. On appeal, Sanchez-Flores\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Sanchez-Flores has filed a supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">Counsel argues that Sanchez-Flores\u2019s sentence is too severe in light of his background and lack of prior felonies. This argument fails. The District Court sentenced Sanchez-Flores at the bottom of a sentencing range to which he did not object, and which resulted from his plea-agreement stipulations. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (holding that \u201c[a] defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to a specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-20\">Sanchez-Flores\u2019s pro se arguments also fail. First, his entry of an unconditional guilty plea waived any argument that the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Arrellano, </em>213 F.3d 427, 430 (8th Cir.2000). Second, unless the District Court has abused its discretion in impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ing the sentence (which it has not), a mere disparity between his and his codefendant\u2019s sentences does not warrant resentencing. <em>See United States v. Skorniak, </em>59 F.3d 750, 758 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 980, 116 S.Ct. 487, 133 L.Ed.2d 414 (1995). Finally, his ineffective-assistance claim should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and not in this direct criminal appeal. <em>See United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We have conducted our own careful review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-14\">.
