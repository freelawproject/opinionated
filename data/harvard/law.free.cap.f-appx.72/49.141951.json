Durbin, Texas prisoner # 618341, appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c) of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. The district court determined that Durbin failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because he failed to allege the deprivation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-23\">Durbin first argues that the court erroneously dismissed his action for failing to state a claim. We review dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e <em>de novo. Newsome v. E.E.O.C., </em>301 F.3d 227, 231 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1049, 123 S.Ct. 660, 154 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002); <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-24\">To demonstrate an Eighth Amendment violation, a prisoner must show the prison official had a \u201csufficiently culpable state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>mind,\u201d that being \u201c \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). A prison official cannot be liable for deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment unless \u201cthe official <em>knows of </em>and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, <em>and he also must draw the inference. </em>\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 755 (5th Cir. 2001). Durbin has not made this requisite showing; the district court did not err when it dismissed Durbin\u2019s suit for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Next, Durbin argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his ease on its merits under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the <em>informa pauperis </em>statute, which does not provide for dismissal on the merits, but rather only dismissal of <em>informa pauperis </em>status. Not all dismissals under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute are without prejudice. <em>See Marts v. Hines, </em>117 F.3d 1504, 1504 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc) (holding that dismissals of frivolous claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) are presumed to be with prejudice). Further, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e is not an <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute. It is clear that Durbin\u2019s suit was dismissed on the merits under both statutes employed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Durbin last argues that the district court erred by dismissing his suit with prejudice without giving him notice of its intent to dismiss and an opportunity to respond or amend his complaint a second time. Error of this nature is ameliorated when the plaintiff has alleged his best case. <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d at 1054. Based on a review of Durbin\u2019s original complaint, his first amended complaint, and his proposed second amended complaint, we conclude that any error was harmless because Durbin had pleaded his best ease. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Because the district court committed no reversible error, its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
