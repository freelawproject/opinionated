Schneider argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilt and that the district court erred by denying his motion for acquittal. When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we ask whether no rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). We apply the same standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for acquittal. <em>United States v. Tipton, </em>56 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">A rational trier of fact could very well have concluded that Schneider was guilty of government theft and Social Security fraud. Schneider signed several forms acknowledging that he was obliged to report to the government when he returned to work. As an employee of the Social Security Administration, Schneider received extensive training on the obligations imposed on recipients of disability benefits. Yet, Schneider never voluntarily informed the government of his return to work. Instead, Schneider worked for five years while cashing a disability benefits check each month. We affirm Schneider\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">Schneider also argues that the district court erred when it declined to apply a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>282 F.3d 1228, 1230 (9th Cir. 2002). We agree with Schneider, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing. The record fails to make clear whether the district court recognized that Schneider\u2019s insistence on contesting his factual guilt at trial could not act as a <em>per se </em>bar to receiving the \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment. <em>See United States v. Cortes, </em>299 F.3d 1030, 1038-39 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">We AFFIRM Schneider\u2019s conviction, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b647-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
