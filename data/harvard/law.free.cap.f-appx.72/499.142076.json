He argues while he had access to both the firearms discovered under his mattress and in his garage, he did not know of the firearms\u2019 existence. The jury\u2019s verdict is supported by the facts. We therefore affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">On July 11, 2001, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Hopper\u2019s two-bedroom apartment in Waterloo, Iowa. Hopper\u2019s girlfriend, Suzie Kotlienthong, her child, and Robert Dale, occasionally lived at the apartment. But Hopper continually lived in the apartment, and the lease was, as of March 2002, in his name alone. Further, telephone and utility bills list Hopper as the resident at the address.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Inside the apartment law enforcement discovered evidence of an illegal narcotics operation: items of drug paraphernalia, contraband, and a loaded Ruger 9 mm handgun found under Hopper\u2019s mattress. On July 12, 2001, the day after the apartment search, law enforcement executed a second search warrant at Hopper\u2019s garage in the apartment complex. Within the garage, officers found a stolen Glock .40 handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">Hooper was indicted of two counts of possessing firearms as a convicted felon. At trial, Dale testified he stayed at the apartment from time to time, and Hopper had given him a key to the apartment, but not to the locked garage. He also testified he never stored his personal items in the larger of the two bedrooms where Hopper slept.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">Additionally, the property manager testified she rented the apartment and the secure garage to Hopper and his girlfriend, but sometime in March 2002 the girlfriend requested her name be taken off the rental agreement, which was done. The manager also testified she saw the girlfriend move her things out, and after-wards never saw the girlfriend, her child, or the girlfriend\u2019s vehicle at the apartment complex again. The manager also testified she never saw the girlfriend use the garage. Similarly, Hopper\u2019s mother testified she cleaned the apartment after Hopper\u2019s arrest, and only his belongings were in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">Another witness, Herlie Johnson, had briefly been housed at the Lynn County Jail along with Hopper. Johnson testified: Hopper told him he planned to get \u201chis girl\u201d to \u201ctake the gun charges.\u201d Subsequently, Hopper\u2019s girlfriend did testify she was responsible for both of the firearms, and Hopper had no knowledge of them. The jury did not believe her and found Hopper guilty. The district court also disbelieved Kotlienthong, concluding: \u201cI believe that Mr. Hopper did tell Herlie Johnson that he was trying to get Kotlienthong to take that particular offense. I think that he did obstruct justice.\u201d The jury also did not believe the testimony of Jennifer Jacobs, who testified she owned one of the firearms and Kotlienthong was secretly holding if for her. Hopper was convicted of two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The standard of review in this case is very strict. <em>United States v. Espino, </em>317 F.3d 788, 791 (8th Cir.2003). \u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, resolving evidentiary conflicts in favor of the government, and accepting all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence that support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792. We will reverse only if no reasonable jury could have found the accused guilty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">To convict someone under \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant had previously been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year; (2) the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm has been in or has affected interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>180 F.3d 967, 978 (8th Cir.1999) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The first and third elements are undisputed. In fact, Hopper also concedes, as he must, his dominion over or residence in his apartment is sufficient to establish his constructive possession of the two firearms. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cConstructive possession of the firearm is established if the person has dominion over the premises where the firearm is located, or control, ownership, or dominion over the firearm itself.\u201d); <em>United States v. Boykin, </em>986 F.2d 270, 274 (8th Cir.1993) (\u201cConstructive possession can be established by a showing that the firearm was seized at the defendant\u2019s residence\u201d). Likewise, it is undisputed constructive possession, like actual possession, can support a conviction for violating \u00a7 922(g). <em>Boyd, </em>180 F.3d at 978. Hopper argues only there was insufficient evidence his constructive possession of the two firearms was knowing as required by the statute and our case law. <em>E.g., United States v. Lemon, </em>239 F.3d 968, 970 (8th Cir.2001) <em>{\u201cIf there is knowledge, </em>control is established by proof the person has dominion over the premises in which the contraband is concealed.\u201d) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">This argument fails, for the record contains facts supporting the jury\u2019s determination. A firearm was discovered under Hopper\u2019s mattress, in a bedroom where only his clothing was stored. The second firearm was discovered in Hopper\u2019s locked garage to which he had a key, but Dale, an occasional houseguest, did not. Moreover, the property manager testified she saw Hopper, but never the girlfriend, using the garage. These facts <em>inter alia </em>support the conviction. Accordingly we affirm the decision below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
