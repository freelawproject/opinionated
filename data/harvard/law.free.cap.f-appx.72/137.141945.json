The district court dismissed Jennings\u2019 case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) after determining that Jennings failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted and that his allegations lacked an arguable basis in law. A dismissal of a complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard used to review a dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Newsome v. E.E.O.C., </em>301 F.3d 227, 231 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1049, 123 S.Ct. 660, 154 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-25\">Jennings argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment for the defendants. This char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>acterization is erroneous; the district court did not dismiss Jennings\u2019 case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Jennings\u2019 argument that the court erred when it did not consider the evidence in the light most favorable to him was not briefed and is therefore abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Jennings also argues that the district court erred when it determined that he failed to show that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. A prison official acts with deliberate indifference if he knows that an inmate faces a substantial risk of serious harm and the official disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Reeves v. Collins, </em>27 F.3d 174, 176 (5th Cir.1994) (applying <em>Farmer </em>to medical claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Jennings did not show that the defendants both knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his health and safety. Moreover, Jennings\u2019 allegations do not show that the defendants were personally involved in delaying Jennings\u2019 requests for treatment. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
