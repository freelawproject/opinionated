We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). Reviewing de novo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Woods contends that his rights under the Confrontation Clause were violated when the trial court precluded admission of the gang affiliations of the state\u2019s witnesses on cross-examination. However, the Washington Court of Appeals concluded that, given the apparent nature of Woods\u2019s intended use of this evidence and the fact that Woods was able to impeach these witnesses by other means, the trial court\u2019s decision was a proper exercise of that court\u2019s discretion to limit introduction of unfairly prejudicial evidence. That conclusion was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law as clearly established by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (stating that trial judges retain \u201cwide latitude\u201d to place limits on cross-examination to alleviate unfair prejudice and that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by reasonable such limitations). The district court therefore properly denied Woods\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b751-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\">.
