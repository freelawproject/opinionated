Seabrooks was familiar with Gibbs\u2019 voice through prior dealings with Gibbs. His testimony was limited to opinions and/or inferences that were rationally based on his own perception, his testimony was helpful to a clear understanding of a fact in issue, i.e. whether Gibbs was, in fact, \u201cBossman,\u201d and his testimony was not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Fed. R.Evid. Rule 702, testimony by experts. Therefore, Seabrooks\u2019 testimony did not run afoul of Fed.R.Evid. 701. Moreover, the rules of evidence allow voice identification \u201cby opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 901(b)(5). Seabrooks\u2019 voice identification was provided after Seabrooks\u2019 familiarity with Gibbs\u2019 voice was established. Therefore, his opinion was admissible, and arguments regarding the testimony go to the testimony\u2019s weight, not admissibility. <em>See United States v. Lampi\u00f3n, </em>158 F.3d 251, 259 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Gibbs also argues that Seabrooks\u2019 identification testimony violates due process because the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive and presented a substantial likelihood of misidentification because Seabrooks was an FBI agent. However, the jury did not learn that Sea-brooks was an FBI agent, and there is nothing inherently suspect regarding an in-court voice identification by an FBI agent whose testimony otherwise complies with the Federal Rules of Evidence. Although Seabrooks\u2019 in-court identification was made approximately nine years after Seabrooks heard Gibbs\u2019 voice, this fact was elicited from Seabrooks during cross-examination and thus was available for the jury to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Additionally, during the trial, the exemplar and numerous wiretap recordings were played for the jury, and the recordings were admitted into evidence. The jurors were free to evaluate the similarity of Bossman\u2019s voice and Gibbs\u2019 voice and use their opinion to assess Seabrooks\u2019 testimony. Therefore, Seabrooks\u2019 testimony did not violate Gibbs\u2019 due process rights. <em>See, e.g., Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972) (analyzing totality of circumstances to evaluate due process concerns raised by identification testimony). Based on the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted Seabrooks\u2019 testimony. <em>See United States v. Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d 276, 295 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Gibbs argues that the voice identification evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. It was for the jury to determine the weight to accord Seabrooks\u2019 voice identification testimony. <em>United States v. Cuesta, </em>597 F.2d 903, 915 (5th Cir.1979). Additionally, the jury heard the exemplar and numerous wiretap phone conversations in which Bossman spoke, and the recordings were admitted into evidence. Thus, the jury was free to make its own determination whether the voice on the exemplar and the wiretap phone conversations belonged to the same man. This court does not substitute its opinion for that of the jury in a sufficiency review. <em>See United States v. Landerman, </em>109 F.3d 1053, 1066 (5th Cir.1997). Based on the foregoing, a reasonable jury could find that the evidence established Gibbs\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Rodriguez, </em>966 F.2d 918, 920 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Gibbs also argues that the district court erred when it determined that he was an organizer or leader of criminal activity and added four levels to his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). While Gibbs argues that the presentence report (PSR) contains only conclusional statements regarding his role, Gibbs fails to identify any PSR paragraph that sets forth erroneous facts. Contrary to Gibbs\u2019 argument, the PSR contains numerous uncontested facts that indicate the adjustment was warranted. Therefore, the district court did not err when it concluded that Gibbs was an organizer or leader of a conspiracy involving five or more participants and sentenced Gibbs accordingly. <em>See United States v. West, </em>58 F.3d 133, 138 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
