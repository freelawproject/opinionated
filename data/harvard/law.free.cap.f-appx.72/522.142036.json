The district court also correctly calculated his criminal history score. This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a colateral chalenge to an underlying deportation. <em>United States v. Ahumada-Aguilar, </em>295 F.3d 943, 947 (9th Cir.2002). A district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction counts for purposes of the criminal history score under the Sentencing Guidelines is also reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Lopez-Pastrana, </em>244 F.3d 1025, 1027 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">In a criminal proceeding for ilegal reentry after deportation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXqx\">an alen may not chalenge the valdity of the deportation order ... unless the alen demonstrates that-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-18\">(1) the alen exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been avalable to seek relef against the order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-19\">(2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alen of the opportunity for judicial review; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-20\">(3) the entry of the order was fundamentaly unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-21\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-22\">Garcia-Peregrina was not deprived of the opportunity for judicial review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>therefore cannot collaterally attack the underlying deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d)(2). Garcia-Peregrina withdrew his pending appeal from this court, thereby waiving the right to continued judicial review. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 840, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Additionally, Garcia-Peregrina was not deprived of judicial review through retroactive application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) in his deportation proceedings. The rule announced by this court one and one-half years after Garcia-Peregrina\u2019s deportation that AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) cannot apply to \u201cdeportation cases pending on the date AEDPA became law,\u201d does not authorize a collateral challenge to the underlying deportation. <em>Magana-Pizano v. I.N.S., </em>200 F.3d 603, 611 (9th Cir.1999). This court recently stated, \u201cas <em>Magana-Pizano </em>announced a new rule, it does not apply retroactively on collateral review.\u201d <em>Alvarenga-Villalobos v. Ashcroft, </em>271 F.3d 1169, 1171 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The district court did not err in assigning one point to Garcia-Peregrina\u2019s criminal history score for a prior misdemeanor assault. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1, 4A1.2. The offense counts because \u201cassault is a serious crime which is normally counted under Guideline 4A1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Kemp, </em>938 F.2d 1020, 1024 n. 4 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b549-23\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
