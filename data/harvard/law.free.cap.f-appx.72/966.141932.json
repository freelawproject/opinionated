Holt argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not satisfy the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">Holt has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. He has neither pointed to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law nor shown how his claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his guilty-plea conviction, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903-04 (5th Cir.2001). The district court did not err when it declined to rule on Holt\u2019s requests that it take judicial notice, as a court is presumed to know the relevant law. <em>See Anderson v. Collins, </em>18 F.3d 1208, 1222 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
