Ostendorp violated his constitutional rights by denying him access to the courts. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>see Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">The district court properly dismissed Pedro\u2019s claim against Ostendorp because Pedro failed to allege that Ostendorp committed a constitutional violation while acting under color of state law. <em>See Kirtley v. Rainey, </em>326 F.3d 1088, 1092 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">The district court properly dismissed Pedro\u2019s claim against the justices of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. Alleging that the justices denied Pedro access to courts by ignoring his pro se filings when he was represented by counsel does not state a claim for injunctive relief. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>62 F.3d 1180, 1193 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that a criminal defendant does not have the right to proceed pro se when represented by counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">The district court properly dismissed Pedro\u2019s conelusory access to courts claim against Sakai because Pedro failed to establish actual injury to the appeal of his conviction in state court. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 348, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (requiring that plaintiff show \u201cactual prejudice with respect to contemplated or existing litigation, such as the inability to meet a filing deadline or to present a claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b725-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
