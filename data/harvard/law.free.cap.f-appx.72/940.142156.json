In M.E.\u2019s first appeal, we concluded that M.E.\u2019s claim against the Buncombe County Board of Education (the Board) was not barred by North Carolina\u2019s 60-day statute of limitations because the Board faded to give sufficient notice as required by North Carolina law. <em>See CM. v. Bd. of Educ. of Henderson County, </em>241 F.3d 374, 388 (4th Cir.2001) (consolidated appeal). On remand, the district court entered summary judgment against M.E. on the ground that M.E. had failed to show that the proposed Individualized Education Program (IEP) would not have provided C.E. with a free appropriate public education (FAPE). The district court, however, lacked jurisdiction to address the merits of M.E.\u2019s claim because there was no final administrative decision addressing the merits. Accordingly, we reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss M.E.\u2019s claim without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The facts of this case are set forth in <em>C.M., </em>241 F.3d at 377, and we need not reiterate them fully here. Suffice it to say, M.E. began negotiating with the Board in March 1996 regarding the education of her son C.E., who had been diagnosed with autism. The Board proposed an IEP, but M.E. rejected it and filed a petition for a due process hearing in April 1998. A state Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), without reaching the merits of her claim, dismissed M.E.\u2019s petition as untimely. M.E. then filed a complaint in the district court pursuant to 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1415(i)(2) (West 2000). Section 1415(i)(2)(A) provides that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision [in an administrative proceeding], shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented.\u201d The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the Board, reasoning that the ALJ had correctly ruled that North Carolina\u2019s 60-day limitations period barred the claim. <em>CM., </em>241 F.3d at 377. We reversed, holding that M.E.\u2019s claim was not time-barred because the Board had not adequately notified her that its decision was final and could be challenged in a due process hearing only if one was requested within 60 days. <em>C.M., </em>241 F.3d at 387. On remand from this court, the district court \u201cdecline[d] to remand the matter for additional state administrative proceedings,\u201d concluding that it could address the merits of M.E.\u2019s claim because the issue of whether the IEP provided a FAPE to C.E. was before the ALJ. (J.A. at 125.) The district court again entered summary judgment in favor of the Board, this time on the ground that M.E. had failed to carry her burden of proof to show that the proposed IEP would not have provided C.E. with a FAPE. M.E. filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction under the IDEA is limited to review of the final \u201cfindings and decision\u201d of the administrative proceedings. 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). Thus, where administrative remedies have not been exhausted, parties cannot maintain an action in federal court under \u00a7 1415(i)(2).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, </em>303 F.3d 523, 536 (4th Cir.2002) (explaining that failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprives the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the parent\u2019s claims); <em>Scruggs v. Campbell, </em>630 F.2d 237, 239 (4th Cir.1980) (holding that the \u201cfederal action was premature because the [parents] had not exhausted their administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>tive remedies\u201d). In this case, because the ALJ incorrectly dismissed M.E.\u2019s claim as untimely, the ALJ did not consider the merits of her claim. Consequently, there were no administrative \u201cfindings or decision\u201d regarding the merits of M.E.\u2019s claim for the district court to review and the district court did not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 1415(i)(2) to consider the merits of M.E.\u2019s claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss M.E.\u2019s complaint without prejudice, giving her the opportunity to pursue administrative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-6\"> While there are three exceptions to this rule, <em>see MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, </em>303 F.3d 523, 536 (4th Cir.2002), all three are inapplicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
