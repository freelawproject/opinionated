California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that Martinez\u2019s appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Dinkins v. Alabama, </em>526 F.2d 1268, 1269 (5th Cir. 1976). In response to counsel\u2019s motion, Martinez moves for the appointment of substitute counsel and, in the alternative, to dismiss his appeal voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, Martinez\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The request for a COA, set forth in counsel\u2019s brief, is DENIED. Martinez\u2019s motion for the appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED. Martinez\u2019s motion to dismiss his appeal voluntarily is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
