R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">With some variation, these appeals stem from the suspension by the Department of Social Security Administration (SSA) of plaintiff Steven Kent Bloom\u2019s Title II benefits based on an erroneous report that Mr. Bloom had been convicted of a felony. We will address each appeal separately, noting the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">\n<em>Case No. 02-3362</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">Mr. Bloom, a prisoner in the custody of the State of Kansas, filed a pro se complaint under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552 and 552a, attempting to procure information relating to the temporary discontinuance of his Title II benefits. The SSA moved to dismiss, arguing that the ease was moot because SSA had already turned over all requested documents to Mr. Bloom. The district court agreed and dismissed the case as moot. The court further denied Mr. Bloom\u2019s motion for sanctions against opposing counsel and his motion for attorney fees and costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-16\">On appeal, Mr. Bloom argues that the district court misconstrued the evidence, erred in dismissing the case as moot and in denying the motion for fees and costs, and abused its discretion in denying his motions for sanctions and discovery. Mr. Bloom further claims that the court attempted to \u201cbuy off\u2019 his complaint and displayed bias against him through its \u201corder.\u201d He also charges that the Kansas Department of Corrections has violated his right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>We review a dismissal under Fed. Civ. P. Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>U.S. West, Inc. v. Tristani, </em>182 F.3d 1202, 1206 (10th Cir. 1999). After reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 submissions and the relevant law, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court. After SSA released the documents to Mr. Bloom, there existed no \u201ccase or controversy\u201d sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal court. <em>See Iron Arrow Honor Soc\u2019y v. Heckler, </em>464 U.S. 67, 70, 104 S.Ct. 373, 78 L.Ed.2d 58 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">As for the matters committed to the discretion of the district court, we find no abuse of that discretion. There are no grounds upon which Mr. Bloom could be awarded fees and costs. There is nothing in the record to suggest bias on the part of the district court, and we specifically note that handing down an adverse judgment does not demonstrate bias against the losing party. <em>Willner v. Univ. of Kan., </em>848 F.2d 1023, 1028 (10th Cir.1988). Mr. Bloom\u2019s claim that the district court attempted to \u201cbuy off\u2019 his complaint is totally unsubstantiated and conelusory. Claims against the Kansas Department of Corrections are not within the ambit of this lawsuit because Mr. Bloom\u2019s complaint names only the SSA as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">\n<em>Case No. 02-3131</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In this case, Mr. Bloom filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3) against various state and county officials alleging constitutional infirmities and conspiracy in connection with his criminal conviction and resulting sentence in a Kansas state court. Mr. Bloom also reiterated his claim regarding the improper suspension of his Social Security benefits, the subject of his complaint in case No. 02-3362, discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlY\">in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">Other than his complaint about his Social Security benefits, all of Mr. Bloom\u2019s allegations identify \u201charms caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render his conviction and sentence invalid.\u201d The district court properly dismissed these claims without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>As for the claim relating to the wrongly withheld Social Security benefits, the district court correctly concluded that the claim did not rise to constitutional significance. Other than Mr. Bloom\u2019s unsupported and conclusory allegation that the county clerk \u201cmaliciously\u201d falsified records regarding him, the complaint reveals nothing more than negligence and, as such, is insufficient to implicate constitutional protections. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330-31, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Mr. Bloom alleges that the clerk admitted her mistake to the Veterans\u2019 Administration but continued to maintain that he was a felon to the SSA. Even if this claim was sufficient to meet the <em>Daniels </em>standard, the district court further correctly observed that the claim was not brought within the requisite two-year statute of limitations. <em>See Hamilton v. City of Overland Park, </em>730 F.2d 613, 614 (10th Cir. 1984). Contrary to Mr. Bloom\u2019s contention, there was nothing to toll the statute of limitations on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\n<em>Case No. 02-3439</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In this matter, Mr. Bloom filed a \u00a7 1983 claim against the State of Kansas, the Office of the Disciplinary Administrator, and the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator for their alleged denial of his right to equal protection stemming from their refusal to discipline an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA). Mr. Bloom alleged that the AUSA filed false pleadings in his FOIA case against the SSA, discussed above as case No. 02-3362. In an amended complaint, Mr. Bloom added two SSA employees and the AUSA as defendants and alleged a broad conspiracy to deny him his Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The district court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 complaint against the disciplinary board officials and the State for lack of standing, citing <em>Doyle v. Okla. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>998 F.2d 1559, 1566 (10th Cir.1993). The court further termed the conspiracy claims conclusory, frivolous, and malicious and dismissed them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">We review a dismissal for lack of standing de novo. <em>Higganbotham v. Okla. ex rel. Okla. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>328 F.3d 638, 641 (10th Cir.2003). We have \u201cnot yet determined whether a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915A on the ground that the complaint is legally frivolous is reviewed <em>de novo </em>or for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Plunk v. Givens, </em>234 F.3d 1128, 1130 (10th Cir. 2000). As in <em>Plunk, </em>however, we \u201cneed not resolve that question at this juncture\u201d based on our review of the entire record in this case, which reveals no reversible error under either standard. <em>See id. </em>We therefore affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-12\">. In granting SSA's motion to dismiss the case as moot, the district court noted that the documents released by SSA appeared to support Mr. Bloom\u2019s contention that erroneous information had indeed been submitted to the agency. While Mr. Bloom had been charged with felony counts, he had entered guilty pleas to two misdemeanor battery counts. The SSA acknowledged the error and remitted the underpayment to Mr. Bloom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">. In his opening brief, Mr. Bloom argues that the substance of his complaint concerns the alleged conspiracy to prevent him from pleading not guilty to the state charges. Apparently the actors in this alleged conspiracy are two attorneys retained by Mr. Bloom and a psychiatrist who examined him. As the district court correctly observed, defense attorneys serve the interests of their clients and do not act \"under color of state law\u201d for purposes of stating a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. <em>See </em>R. Yol. I tab 8 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"ALTL\">As for the examining psychiatrist, the doctor apparently offered his opinion regarding Mr. Bloom's mental state and that information was eventually forwarded to the Kansas Supreme Court. Again, the district court correctly advised Mr. Bloom that witnesses such as this doctor are absolutely immune for liability in damages for such testimony. <em>See Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 329-30, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
