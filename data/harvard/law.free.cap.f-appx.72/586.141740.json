(\u201cContinental\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Time Warner Entertainment Co. (\u201cTime Warner\u201d) on its duty to defend claim. Because the relevant facts are known to the parties they are not repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">At the outset, we note that the scope of the duty to defend is broad under California law. \u201cAn insurer ... bears a duty to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts which give rise to the potential of liability under the policy.\u201d <em>Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co., </em>65 Cal.2d 263, 276-77, 54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168 (1966); <em>see also Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Barbara B., </em>4 Cal.4th 1076, 1081, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792 (1993) (\u201cIt is by now a familiar principle that a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.\u201d); <em>CNA Cas. of Cal. v. Seaboard Surety Co., </em>176 Cal.App.3d 598, 605, 222 Cal.Rptr. 276 (1986) (\u201cAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend must be analyzed and determined on the basis of any <em>potential </em>liability arising from facts available ... to it at the time of the tender of defense.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">Indeed, \u201c[i]n resolving the question of whether a duty to defend arises under a policy, the insurer has a higher burden than the insured. The insured need only show that the underlying claim <em>may </em>fall within policy coverage; the insurer must prove it <em>cannot. </em>\u201d <em>Pension Trust Fund for Operating Eng\u2019rs v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>307 F.3d 944, 949 (9th Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">With this background in mind, we turn to Continental\u2019s first contention on appeal:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>that Time Warner\u2019s dealings with acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola do not fall within the Entertainment Risk Insurance Policy\u2019s (the \u201cPolicy\u2019s\u201d) coverage for \u201c[infringement of statutory or common law copyright, plagiarism, piracy, or misappropriation of other similar property right,\u201d and for piracy or misappropriation of names, trade names, characters, plots, or other similar property right. Continental argues that piracy and misappropriation reference the taking of rights to creative material, and that there were no such allegations set forth in the Coppola complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">But in <em>CNA Casualty, </em>the underlying antitrust suit contained allegations that the insured \u201c[k]nowingly misappropriated, stole and misused property interests\u201d and \u201c[m]ade intentional misrepresentations of fact to plaintiffs in an effort to further eliminate the competition of plaintiffs.\u201d 176 Cal.App.3d at 608 n.3, 222 Cal.Rptr. 276. The court found \u201c[t]hese charges [were] arguably within Seaboard\u2019s coverage for piracy, unfair competition and idea misappropriation, particularly since these terms [were] undefined in Seaboard\u2019s policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 222 Cal.Rptr. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Siliconix Inc., </em>729 F.Supp. 77 (N.D.Cal.1989), the court found that \u201cpiracy\u201d was susceptible to many definitions and that \u201cit may be interpreted to include such offenses as publication of trade secrets, interference with prospective economic advantage, or trademark infringement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. On the basis of such case law, we conclude that Time Warner made a plausible claim that its conduct fell within the enumerated offenses of piracy and misappropriation covered by the Policy, thereby invoking Continental\u2019s duty to defend under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Continental next contends that denial of coverage was appropriate because Section I.A. of the Policy (the relevant provision here) provides that the insurance company must defend against \u201cany Claim seeking damages, injunctive or declaratory relief ... arising out of [certain enumerated offenses] ... committed in the utterance or dissemination of Matter by the Insured in the Business of the Insured.\u201d Continental points to the fact that \u201cMatter\u201d is defined in the Policy as \u201cprinted, audio, visual, or informational works uttered or disseminated in any medium of expression to a mass audience in the Business of the Insured.\u201d Because Time Warner\u2019s alleged misrepresentations were made only to executives at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Columbia and to Coppola before actual production of the proposed \u201cPinocchio\u201d movie, and thus had nothing to do with dissemination of an artistic work to a mass audience, Continental argues that the Policy does not give rise to a duty to defend for Time Warner\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">But Continental\u2019s narrow reading of the Policy overlooks the fact that a covered \u201cClaim\u201d is defined as \u201cthe first receipt by the Insured of a demand for money or services, made by a person or entity from the Insured or from an Indemnified Party, <em>arising out of the dissemination of Matter or the investigation, gathering or acquisition of Matter by the Insured </em>or by an Indemnified Party.\u201d (emphasis added). It would appear that this contractual language provides coverage to Time Warner for the pre-production activity of acquiring and defending its property interest in a creative work.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Nevertheless, Continental counters that the Policy should not be read so broadly in light of the contractual language in Section 1. B. There, the Policy provides coverage against \u201cany Claim seeking damages, injunctive or declarative relief ... arising out of [certain enumerated offenses] ... committed in the gathering, investigation, or acquisition of information ... for the purpose of inclusion in books, magazines, or News Programming____\u201d Continental points to the absence of any similar language concerning the \u201cgathering, investigation, or acquisition of information\u201d in Section I.A. as to why that provision should be construed more narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">But Continental\u2019s argument fails because the absence of language similar to that of Section I.B. \u2014 a section that concerns Time Warner\u2019s publishing and cable businesses and specifically provides coverage for the act of acquiring and gathering \u201cinformation\u201d for a story \u2014 is of no consequence. Section I.A., unlike Section I.B., already has embedded within it provisions for the gathering, investigation, or acquisition of Matter. In addition to the definition of \u201cClaim,\u201d which includes \u201carising out of the investigation, gathering or acquisition of Matter,\u201d Section I.A. specifically encompasses the \u201cBusiness of the Insured,\u201d which is defined to include \u201ccreation, acquisition, pre-production ... of motion pictures or programs, commercial film ... script stories ... (published or unpublished).\u201d Accordingly we reject Continental\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Looking at the policy as a whole including Section I.C. which provides relief for an \u201celection by the Insured to cease or forego the dissemination of Matter\u201d (undermining Continental\u2019s argument that coverage only attaches after a creative work has been released to a consuming audience) \u2014 we conclude that the acquisition and creation of material for a motion picture is within the scope of the Policy\u2019s coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, Continental had a duty to defend Time Warner in the underlying Coppola litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-12\">. As an initial matter, notwithstanding the merits of Time Warner\u2019s claim, Continental claims that it is barred by the twelve month limitations period contained in the Policy. But in <em>Lambert v. Commonwealth Land Title Insurance, Co., </em>53 Cal.3d 1072, 282 Cal.Rptr. 445, 811 P.2d 737 (1991), the California Supreme Court found that a statutory limitations period was equitably tolled until resolution of the underlying claim. To hold otherwise could</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-19\">allow expiration of the statute of limitations on a lawsuit to vindicate the duty to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>even before the duty itself expires. This grim result is untenable. The insured must be allowed the option of waiting until the duty to defend has expired before filing suit to vindicate that duty. Allowing this option is equitable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1077-78, 282 Cal.Rptr. 445, 811 P.2d 737. In adopting this rule, the court \"recognize[d] the justice and fairness of equitably tolling the insured's action to establish coverage until resolution of the underlying claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1081, 282 Cal.Rptr. 445, 811 P.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">It is true that <em>Lambert </em>involved equitable tolling for a statutory limitation period, and the case at hand involves a privately-negotiated contractual limitation. But the California Supreme Court in <em>Lambert </em>expressed a strong public interest in tolling the limitations period to allow the insured to defend against the underlying substantive claim without having simultaneously to prosecute a collateral action against the insurer. Likewise, it appears here that California law may require tolling of the time that the Coppola suit was pending. In any event, even if California law would not require as such, the Policy failed to state clearly that it intended to deviate from the tolling principle announced in <em>Lambert. </em>Because California has recognized a strong public interest in tolling, and because the Policy does not explicitly provide otherwise, we conclude that Time Warner\u2019s suit against Continental was timely commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-10\">. At best for Continental the relevant provisions of the Policy lack a certain degree of clarity but such ambiguities are resolved against the insurer and in favor of coverage. <em>See Reserve Ins. Co. v. Pisciotta, </em>30 Cal.3d 800, 807-08, 180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\">. Even if the Policy does provide coverage, Continental contends that relevant exclusions are applicable. Continental first cites to ex-elusion A which prohibits coverage for any claim \"arising out of a breach of contract or failure by the Insured ... to perform any contract.\u201d But the Coppola complaint specifically alleged that there never was any binding agreement between the producer and Time Warner. Moreover, Coppola brought claims for slander of title and interference with prospective economic advantage which gave rise to potential liability not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>this exclusion. Accordingly, exclusion A cannot excuse Continental from its duty to defend. <em>See Horace Mann, </em>4 Cal.4th at 1081, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792 (insurer must defend entire action if lawsuit raises at least one potentially covered claim). Continental also points to exclusions C and I which prohibit coverage for suits brought by past or present employees arising out of the subject matter of the employment relationship. As pled by Coppola, he never was an employee of Time Warner. In addition, Coppola\u2019s suit against Time Warner concerned the company\u2019s interference with his dealings with Columbia, not merely the subject matter of his employment relationship with Time Warner. Accordingly, none of the exclusions to coverage apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In my view, the insurance policy cannot reasonably be read to provide coverage for the claims made by Francis Ford Coppola and his co-plaintiffs in <em>Coppola v. Warner Bros., Inc., </em>because those claims did not \u201caris[e] out of\u2019 any act \u201ccommitted in the utterance or dissemination of Matter\u201d under the meaning of paragraph I.A of the policy. There is simply no potential for liability here. Thus, no matter how broad the duty to defend may be under California law, there is no such duty here. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The policy obligates Continental to defend Time Warner against, and indemnify Time Warner for, liability resulting from only two types of claims. Those types of claims relate to two specific aspects of Time Warner\u2019s business. Paragraph I.A, on which Time Warner bases its claim, covers the first type: claims arising from unlawful acts that Time Warner may commit in disseminating artistic or informational material to a mass audience. The contract explicitly limits coverage under I.A to claims based on unlawful acts \u201ccommitted in the utterance or dissemination of Matter by the Insured [i.e., Time Warner] in the Business of the Insured.\u201d In section IV, \u201cDefinitions,\u201d the word \u201cMatter\u201d is defined as \u201cprinted audio, visual or informational works uttered or disseminated in any medium of expression <em>to a mass audience </em>in the Business of the Insured.\u201d 1\u00cdIV.M (emphasis added). The plain language of these provisions is confirmed by the fact that the unlawful acts listed in I.A are precisely those that one might expect to create liability for a company engaged in disseminating artistic material: the common law privacy torts, torts of defamation, unauthorized use of intellectual property, and the like. 111.A.1-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Paragraph I.B covers the second type of claims: claims arising from acts committed in the \u201cgathering, investigation, or acquisition of information ... for the purpose of including in books, magazines, or News Programming ... in the Publishing and Cable Businesses of the Insured.\u201d The unlawful acts listed in this paragraph\u2014 many fewer than in I.A \u2014 are those that a large news organization might commit in gathering information: trespass and related torts, as well as \u201cbreach of an agreement not to reveal the identity of a news source.\u201d 111.B.1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The claims of the <em>Coppola </em>plaintiffs are of neither type. Rather, they arose from Time Warner\u2019s effort to enforce an alleged agreement between Time Warner and Coppola concerning the development of a movie. The <em>Coppola </em>plaintiffs assert that Time Warner\u2019s letter to executives of Columbia Studios informing them that Coppola was not free to perform services in connection with Columbia\u2019s project was wrongful. Time Warner recognizes that these claims do not fall within paragraph I.B, as they do not involve information to be included in \u201cbooks, magazines, or News Programming\u201d and do not concern Time Warner\u2019s publishing or cable business. However, contrary to the argument of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Time Warner and the holding of the majority, the claims are not covered by I.A either, because the unlawful acts alleged by the <em>Coppola </em>plaintiffs were not \u201ccommitted in the utterance or dissemination of Matter\u201d to a mass audience. The claims at issue in this case are of a type for which Time Warner chose not to purchase insurance, at least not in this policy. The matter should end there. There is no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Time Warner, however, has persuaded the majority to overlook both the plain meaning of the policy language and the clear intent of the parties to limit coverage under I.A to liability arising out of the dissemination of creative material to a mass audience. The majority\u2019s misinterpretation rests upon reading \u201cto a mass audience\u201d out of the contract. This is accomplished by finding a supposed contradiction with this requirement in the definition of \u201cClaim\u201d in paragraph IV.C, a definition that applies to both I.A and to I.B. As the majority notes, \u201cClaim[s]\u201d include demands for money or services arising out of either the \u201cdissemination of Matter\u201d or \u201cthe investigation, gathering or acquisition of matter.\u201d Essentially, the majority\u2019s argument is that, because a claim can arise from acts committed in the acquisition of Matter, and paragraph I.A covers \u201cclaims,\u201d paragraph I.A covers claims arising from acts committed in the acquisition of Matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">This argument makes no sense. Paragraph I.A plainly covers only a subset of claims, not every claim that could fit within the meaning of the word \u201cclaim\u201d as defined in the contract\u2019s list of definitions. A claim may, indeed, arise from an act committed in the acquisition of Matter, and where such acts arise in Time Warner\u2019s publishing and cable businesses, there may be coverage under paragraph I.B. Paragraph I.A, however, is clear that not all claims are covered under that paragraph, only those arising from acts \u201ccommitted in the dissemination of Matter,\u201d which means \u201cto a mass audience.\u201d That some claims may arise from acts committed in the acquisition of Matter does not imply that every provision providing coverage for claims provides coverage for claims arising from acts committed in the acquisition of Matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The majority applies the same erroneous reasoning in relying on the definition of the term \u201cBusiness of the Insured\u201d in section IV. That term, like \u201cClaim,\u201d includes some matters for which there is coverage only under paragraph I.A, and others for which coverage exists only under paragraph I.B. In such circumstance, I fail to see why the definition leads the majority to believe that paragraph I.A must be extended to cover all occurrences within the entire policy. If paragraph I.A provided coverage for every \u201cClaim\u201d arising in the \u201cBusiness of the Insured,\u201d the paragraph would simply state that the Compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ny agrees to defend against liability \u201cfor any Claim arising in the Business of the Insured.\u201d Instead, however, the paragraph includes almost a full page of qualifying language, specifying particular claims that are covered under I.A and expressly limiting coverage under that paragraph to claims <em>\u201carising in the utterance or dissemination of Matter by the Insured </em>in the Business of the Insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The language in the definitions section simply cannot be read to extend coverage under paragraph I.A to all matters pertaining to the Business of the Insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In short, Time Warner\u2019s argument that I.A. provides coverage for claims arising from the acquisition of Matter, as well as from the dissemination of Matter to a mass audience, is without basis in the policy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">. As a demonstration of the majority's logic, imagine a contract in which Insurance Co. insures Mr. X\u2019s cars against theft. The contract contains a paragraph of definitions, which defines \"car\u201d as \"any two-door or four-door car owned by Mr. X.\u201d The contract also contains two provisions setting forth terms of coverage. Paragraph I states that \"Two-door cars are insured against any theft that occurs during daylight hours.\u201d Paragraph II states that \"Four-door cars are insured against any theft that occurs at any hour of the day.\u201d One of Mr. X\u2019s two-door cars is stolen at night. Most readers of the contract would say that Mr. X is out of luck. Under the majority\u2019s theory, however, the theft is covered-under paragraph II-because, even though paragraph II seems to cover only four-door cars, the contractual definition of \"car\" conflicts with that interpretation: A \"Car\u201d can be a two-door or a four-door cars. Ambiguities are settled in favor of broader coverage, so the Mr. X wins.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
