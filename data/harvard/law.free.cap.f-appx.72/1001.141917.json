Hafke appeals the district court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) motions for dismissal and the granting of a summary judgment motion. In his suit, Hafke, doing business as Magic Carpet Limousines, alleged various claims, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, and state law, against the defendants. An examination of the record and briefs shows that the district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-23\">Afforded liberal construction, Hafke argues that the district judge was biased and should have recused himself. Hafke has not shown that a reasonable and objective person, knowing all of the facts, would harbor doubts concerning the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>Levitt v. University of Texas at El Paso, </em>847 F.2d 221, 226 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-24\">Hafke failed to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact to defeat the summary judgment motion. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Hafke\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2724 and Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 731.005 claims fail because he has not shown that DFW or the individual defendants violated the statutes. Hafke has not shown that John Cornyn, as the Texas Attorney Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>eral, may be liable under the statutes, or that Cornyn, in his individual capacity, was personally involved in a constitutional violation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2725(2); Tex. Transp.Code \u00a7 730.003(5); <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 741 (5th Cir.2002). Hafke\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims fail because Hafke has not shown the deprivation of a federal right. <em>See Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980); <em>Randolph v. Cervantes, </em>130 F.3d 727, 730 (5th Cir.1997). Hafke\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985(2) claims fail because Hafke has not alleged a conspiracy with a nexus to a proceeding in federal court or that the defendants discriminated against him based on race or other class-based animus. <em>See Green v. State Bar of Texas, </em>27 F.3d 1083, 1086 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Bradt v. Smith, </em>634 F.2d 796, 800 (5th Cir.1981). Hafke\u2019s antitrust claims fail because Hafke did not allege facts that would support the elements of the claim. <em>See Ancar v. Sara Plasma, Inc., </em>964 F.2d 465, 469 (5th Cir. 1992); <em>see also Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The dismissal of the supplemental state law claims was not an abuse of discretion because all of the federal claims were properly dismissed. <em>See Dayton Indep. Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Mineral Products Co., </em>906 F.2d 1059, 1067 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
