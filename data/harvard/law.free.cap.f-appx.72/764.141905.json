He was barred from reentering the country for five years. Only two years later, however, Duran reentered the United States illegally and thereafter applied for adjustment of his immigration status. The Immigration and Naturalization Service rejected his application and reinstated his prior removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Duran, represented by counsel, filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, challenging the INS\u2019s reinstatement procedures on due process grounds. The district court, adopting the recommendation of a magistrate judge, transferred the petition to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Both parties assume, and we agree, that the petition is now before us as a direct appeal from the INS adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Because we find that Duran has failed to prove that he was prejudiced by the INS\u2019s reinstatement proceedings, we AFFIRM the decision of the INS.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">On April 12, 1998, Mexican national Ramon Duran Hernandez was caught attempting to enter the United States illegally with his American citizen wife at the Presidio, Texas, Point of Entry. Later that day, in a signed, sworn statement to an INS officer, Duran admitted that he was not a U.S. citizen and that both he and his wife had falsely claimed that he was a U.S. citizen when they tried to cross the border that morning. Duran admitted knowing that it was a crime to falsely claim U.S. citizenship. Duran also admitted to having lived illegally in the United States for 10 years prior to his reentry attempt and to having been previously ordered deported in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">That same day, the INS found that Duran was inadmissible to the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), which renders inadmissible any alien who falsely represents his United States citizenship. Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). Pursuant to the applicable provision of the INA, the INS ordered Duran returned to Mexico. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b)(l)(A)(i), INA \u00a7 235(b)(l)(A)(i). The INS gave Duran a \u25a0written notice stating that 1) he was barred from reentering the United States for five years from the date of his departure (April 12, 1998); 2) if he wished to reenter the United States before the end of that five-year period, he must ask for and receive permission to do so from the Attorney General (by using application forms available at any U.S. Consulate or INS office); and 3) that he could be criminally prosecuted for reentering without such permission. Duran signed the notice and walked back to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">On January 15, 2000 \u2014 within the five-year ban \u2014 Duran again illegally entered the United States by walking through the desert near El Paso, Texas, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9) (A) (i), INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(A)(i). He was not caught at that time and remained in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">On April 13, 2001, Duran applied (through his wife) for adjustment of status based on his 1997 marriage to an American citizen, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), INA \u00a7 245(i )<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eight months later, on December 18, 2001, the INS denied Duran\u2019s application. To be eligible for adjustment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>status, an alien must be \u201cadmissible to the United States for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i )(2)(A), INA \u00a7 <em>245(i </em>)(2)(A). Because Duran had reentered the United States within the five-year ban and without first applying to the Attorney General for permission, the INS found that Duran was not \u201cadmissible to the United States for permanent residence\u201d and therefore was ineligible to have his status adjusted. The INS also noted that Duran had admitted to having illegally entered the United States ten years before his 1998 attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The next day \u2014 December 19, 2001 \u2014 the INS began and concluded the process of reinstating Duran\u2019s 1998 removal order. During that process, Duran gave a second sworn statement to the INS. Before he gave that statement, he signed a section of the Sworn Statement form acknowledging that he understood his rights, that anything he said could be used against him, and that he did not wish to consult with a lawyer. In his handwritten answers to preprinted questions on the Sworn Statement form, Duran admitted, <em>inter alia, </em>1) that he had been deported on April 12, 1998; 2) that he last entered the United States on January 15, 2000, \u201cnear El Paso, TX. walking in the desert\u201d; and 3) that he never applied to the U.S. Attorney General for permission to reenter the country after his initial deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">That same day (December 19, 2001), the INS had Duran sign a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order, which stated that the INS would be reinstating its April 12, 1998 removal order pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5), INA \u00a7 241(a)(5). That statute \u2014 which is at the core of Duran\u2019s appeal \u2014 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">(5) Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering. If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is <em>not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief </em>under this Act, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5), INA \u00a7 241(a)(5) (emphasis added). The Notice form informed Duran that he \u201cmay contest this determination by making written or oral statement [sic] to an immigration officer. You do not have the right to a hearing before an immigration judge.\u201d Duran checked a box stating that he did not wish to make a statement, and he signed the form. The INS then issued its final reinstatement decision, which consisted of an INS official\u2019s signature under one sentence of preprinted text that stated, \u201cHaving reviewed all available evidence, the administrative file and any statements made or submitted in rebuttal, I have determined that the above-named alien is subject to removal through reinstatementof [sic] the prior order, in accordance with section [illegible on the blurred copy in the record, but presumably \u00a7 241(a)(5) ] of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAL\">On December 31, 2001, Duran filed (through counsel) a habeas corpus petition with the United States District Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the District of Kansas. First, he challenged the constitutionality of the INA\u2019s reinstatement provisions as violative of his due process rights. Second, he challenged the INS\u2019s purported failure to pursue his application for adjustment of status before reinstating the prior removal order. A magistrate judge recommended that the case be transferred to the Court of Appeals, because \u201creinstatement is actually the enforcement of a prior final removal order,\u201d over which the Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction. Citing <em>Castro-Cortez v. INS, </em>239 F.3d 1037, 1046 (9th Cir.2001), the magistrate judge concluded that transfer, rather than dismissal, was appropriate \u201cbecause jurisdiction in these cases has been in a state of flux.\u201d The district court agreed and ordered the case transferred to the Tenth Circuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Congress has declared that petitions for review of INS orders of removal must be filed \u201cwith the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2), INA \u00a7 242(b)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Duran did not follow this procedure; rather, he bypassed direct review and filed a habeas corpus petition (his first error) in the district court (his second error) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court then transferred that petition to the Tenth Circuit under the transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, which permits a court to transfer a case where there is \u201ca want of jurisdiction\u201d and transfer would be \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d Id. The district court\u2019s use of the transfer statute cures Duran\u2019s second error, the filing of his petition in the district court as opposed to the Tenth Circuit. That leaves us with only his first error\u2014 filing a habeas petition instead of a direct appeal \u2014 to consider. Both parties proceed as if Duran had properly filed a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>appeal with this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the interests of justice, we will also treat Duran\u2019s petition as if it had been so filed and review it as a direct appeal of the INS\u2019s action. <em>See Lopez v. Heinauer, </em>332 F.3d 507, 510-11 (8th Cir.2003); <em>Batista v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2001); <em>Castro-Cortez v. INS, </em>239 F.3d 1037, 1047 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Turning to the merits of Duran\u2019s appeal, his due process claim fails because he has not proven that he suffered prejudice as a result of the INS\u2019s reinstatement procedures. The regulation governing reinstatement of removal orders, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8(a), directs an immigration officer to determine three facts before reinstating a prior order of removal: 1) whether the alien was subject to a prior order of removal; 2) whether the alien is the same alien who was previously removed; and 3) whether the alien illegally reentered the United States. Because Duran contests none of these facts, he cannot prove that additional procedural safeguards would have changed the result in his case. This failure to prove prejudice leads us to reject Duran\u2019s due process claim. <em>See Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 292, 302 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Garcia-Martinez, </em>228 F.3d 956, 964 n. 10 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Salazar v. Ashcroft, </em>38 Fed.Appx. 812, 814 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We also reject Duran\u2019s adjustment of status claim. Duran asserts that the INS reinstated his removal order before it adjudicated his adjustment of status application. The record proves that the opposite is true: the INS adjudicated and rejected Duran\u2019s adjustment of status application on December 18, 2001, and it reinstated his removal order one day later, on December 19, 2001. Duran\u2019s claim to the contrary clearly lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the INS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b790-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-16\">. That statute allows an alien who is physically present in the United States to apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>upon submission of a $1,000 application fee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(C), INA \u00a7 245(t )(1)(C).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar-\">Upon receipt of such an application and the sum hereby required, the Attorney General <em>may </em>adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence <em>if </em>\u2014 (A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa <em>and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; </em>and (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(0(2), INA \u00a7 245(0(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">. On April 5, 2002, Duran filed an emergency motion for a stay of deportation pending appeal, as he was to be deported to Mexico later that day. In an April 5 Order, we denied the motion. Although neither the parties nor the record mention Duran's current whereabouts, we presume that he is now back in Mexico.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\">. Although \u00a7 1252 speaks specifically of judicial review of \"orders of removal,\u201d every circuit to address the question has found \u00a7 1252 to cover review of reinstatement orders as well. <em>See, e.g., Gomez-Chavez v. Perryman, </em>308 F.3d 796, 801 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Alvarez-Portillo v. Ashcroft, </em>280 F.3d 858, 861, 868 (8th Cir.2002); <em>Bejjani v. INS, </em>271 F.3d 670, 674 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Velasquez-Gabriel v. Crocetti, </em>263 F.3d 102, 105 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Castro-Cortez v. INS, </em>239 F.3d 1037, 1043 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Our Circuit has two conflicting unpublished opinions regarding this issue. <em>Compare Lopez-Herrera v. INS, </em>No. 00-9501, 2000 WL 91946, at *1, 2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 774, at *3 (10th Cir. Jan. 20, 2000), (\"[Tjhis court is specifically barred from reviewing the agency\u2019s reinstatement of a prior deportation order.\u201d), <em>with Yanez-Torres v.

Feb. 4, 2000), (\"We have jurisdiction to review the final order reinstating the 1981 deportation order under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1)....\"). We recognize that unpublished decisions are not binding authority, <em>United States v. Goff, </em>314 F.3d 1248, 1250 (10th Cir.2003), and therefore follow the weight of authority in other circuits and our own opinion in <em>Yanez-Torres. </em>Accordingly, we hold that we have jurisdiction to hear petitions for direct review of reinstatement orders under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, INA \u00a7 242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b793-12\">.
