Vasquez-Campos contends that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court deprived him of due process by imposing a sentence greater than 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)\u2019s two-year maximum based on his prior aggravated felony, where he did not admit to having committed a prior criminal offense which would qualify as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Vasquez-Campos states that he presents the issue merely to preserve it in the event of ensuing favorable Supreme Court precedent, and acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-37\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
