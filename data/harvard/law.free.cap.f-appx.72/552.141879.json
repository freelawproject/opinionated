We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo both a dismissal on statute of limitations grounds, <em>Williamson v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>208 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2000), and a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Sommatino v. United States, 255 </em>F.3d 704, 707 (9th Cir.2001). We may affirm a dismissal on any ground supported by the record. <em>Vestar Dev. II v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>249 F.3d 958, 960 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The district court properly dismissed as time-barred Zumel\u2019s California Fair Employment and Housing Act claims against her former employer and supervisors because she filed those claims in district court more than one year after the state agency issued its right-to-sue letter. <em>See </em>Cal. Gov.Code \u00a7 12965(b); <em>Romano v. Rockwell Internat., Inc., </em>14 Cal.4th 479, 492, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114 (1996). There was no basis for equitably tolling the statute of limitations because the state agency did not defer its investigation to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <em>Cf Salgado v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>823 F.2d 1322, 1325-27 (9th Cir.1987) (finding basis for tolling where state agency issued premature right-to-sue letter and deferred investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Zumel\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claim against Michael Fisher, the former Santa Clara Postmaster, was properly dismissed because she did not allege facts indicating that Fisher\u2019s conduct interfered with her ability to make or enforce a contract. <em>See Imagineering, Inc. v. Kiewit Pacific Co., </em>976 F.2d 1303, 1313 (9th Cir.1992). Zumel\u2019s effort to state a constitutional tort claim against Fisher fails because she does not specify the constitutional violation, and \u201c \u2018a liberal interpretation of a civil rights complaint may not supply essential elements of the claim that were not initially pled. Vague and conclusory allegations of official participation in civil rights violations are not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bruns v. National Credit Union Admin., </em>122 F.3d 1251, 1257 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Ivey v. Board of Regents of University of Alaska, </em>673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Zumel\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">All pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
