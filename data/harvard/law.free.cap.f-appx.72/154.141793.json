The district court did not clearly err by determining that Moore did not fully accept responsibility by truthfully admitting all conduct comprising the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1; <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Harlan, </em>35 F.3d 176, 181 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Moore also contends that the district court clearly erred by increasing his offense level based on the finding in the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) that Moore sped away from a Border Patrol checkpoint and led agents on a two-mile high-speed chase. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 (prescribing increase where a defendant recklessly endangers other during flight). Absent rebuttal evidence to show that the information relied upon in the PSR was \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable,\u201d the district court was permitted to adopt the facts in the PSR without further inquiry. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>277 F.3d 721, 724 (5th Cir.2001). This court has observed that leading police on a high-speed chase in itself creates a substantial risk of harm to others. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>989 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir.1993). The district court did not commit clear error by increasing the offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
