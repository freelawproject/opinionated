We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">Ramirez contends that the district court rendered incomplete and confusing advice concerning the application of the statute of limitations to his case when it dismissed his first unexhausted petition without prejudice. Ramirez also contends that he was denied access to adequate legal resources by the Department of Corrections when he attempted to conduct legal research on the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-24\">Even if true, these contentions do not merit equitable tolling because Ramirez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>waited a full year before returning to federal court after the California Supreme Court dismissed his habeas petition. <em>See Guillory v. Roe, </em>329 F.3d 1015, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that \u201cthe relevant measure of diligence is how quickly a petitioner sought to exhaust the claims dismissed as unexhausted, and how quickly he returned to federal court after doing so,\u201d and denying equitable tolling where petitioner took seven months to return to federal court following the state court\u2019s final decision); <em>see also Kelly v. Small, </em>315 F.3d 1063, 1071 (9th Cir.) (stating that 30 days is a reasonable time for a petitioner to return to federal court following final action by the state courts), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2094, 155 L.Ed.2d 1077 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
