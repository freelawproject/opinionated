Jahner demands a new trial, arguing that the district court abused its discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 in allowing the jury to see numerous photographs of his penis, and of his masturbating. He claims the photographs were highly prejudicial and of little probative value, given his willingness to stipulate to their contents and to the fact that he sent them to a person whom he believed to be a juvenile. Because the probative value of these images was not outweighed by their potential for unfair prejudice, the district court did not \u201cclear[ly] abuse its discretion.\u201d <em>Trevino v. Gates, </em>99 F.3d 911, 922 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that \u201c[t]he district court has considerable latitude in performing a Rule 403 balancing and we will uphold its decision absent clear abuse of discretion\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1117, 117 S.Ct. 1249, 137 L.Ed.2d 330 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">Although distasteful, the photographs were \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d of the crime of enticement and coercion. <em>See United States v. Yazzie, </em>59 F.3d 807, 811-12 (9th Cir.1995) (finding that penis-enlargement pump and sexually-explicit magazines were \u201cextremely\u201d probative of the victim\u2019s credibility and how the assaults were committed because the victim testified that these items were used during the episodes of sexual abuse and hence were \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d of the crime). They also served multiple functions, <em>see Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 187, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), including proving the elements of the charged offenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 69, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (explaining that \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s burden to prove every element of the crime is not relieved by a defendant\u2019s tactical decision not to contest an essential element of the offense\u201d), establishing the human significance of the defendant\u2019s actions, <em>see Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 188 (explaining that a proposed stipulation may not be of substantially the same or greater probative value as actual evidence because of the stipulation\u2019s failure to \u201cgive life to the moral underpinnings of [the] law\u2019s claims\u201d), and rebutting Jahner\u2019s affirmative defense of entrapment. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1430 (9th Cir.1994) (citation omitted) (explaining that when the defense of entrapment is at issue, the prosecution \u201cmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime prior to first being approached by government agents\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1171, 115 S.Ct. 1147, 130 L.Ed.2d 1106 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Taking into account the balancing test of Federal Rule of Evidence 403, we are satisfied that the district court did not err in concluding that this case falls within the longstanding rule that \u201cthe prosecution is entitled to prove its case by evidence of its own choice, or, more exactly, that a criminal defendant may not stipulate or admit his way out of the full evidentiary force of the case as the Government chooses to present it.\u201d <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 186-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-16\">.
