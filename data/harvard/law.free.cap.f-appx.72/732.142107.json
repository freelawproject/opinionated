Carrillo contends that the district court erred by granting summary judgment without allowing her discovery.

Accordingly, the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b758-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b758-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
