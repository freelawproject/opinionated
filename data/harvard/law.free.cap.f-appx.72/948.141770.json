We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Through counsel, Warren first claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence gathered from a stop of his vehicle. In seeking to reverse the district court\u2019s ruling, Warren challenges the factual findings made by the district court. We review this claim for clear error. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). Warren\u2019s own testimony regarding the probable cause for the stop of his vehicle was directly contradicted by the testimony of the involved police officer and, moreover, by Warren\u2019s other witnesses. Accordingly, Warren asks this court to overturn the credibility determinations of the district court. We decline to do so. <em>See United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1169 (4th Cir.1995) (reviewing credibility determination at pre-trial motion to suppress for clear error and according great deference to such findings). We therefore find that the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Warren asserts that the district court failed to comply with the colloquy requirement in regard to his prior conviction used for the purpose of enhancing his sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) (2000). As this claim was not preserved in the district court, we review for plain error and find none. Warren\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>326 F.3d 593, 598-99 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">We affirm the judgment of the district court and deny Warren\u2019s motion to withdraw counsel and proceed pro se. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
