Crockett, Texas prisoner # 730904, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">As Crockett has not shown that his disciplinary conviction has been overturned or otherwise invalidated, he may not maintain his claims for money damages, declaratory relief, or injunctive relief in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Accordingly, the district court did not err by dismissing Crockett\u2019s lawsuit for failure to state a claim and as frivolous. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Crockett\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit; it is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint in district court. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). If he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b997-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
