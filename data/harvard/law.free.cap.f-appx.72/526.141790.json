Hill, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Twenty-one years after Gary Ronald Warren pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary, he filed a \u00a7 2255 petition for habeas corpus. The district court considered and dismissed Warren\u2019s claims on the merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm on alternate grounds supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. Rule 9(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts (\u201cRule 9\u201d) provides a doctrine of laches defense to untimely habeas petitions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 9 bars a petitioner\u2019s habeas corpus proceeding if: (1) the Government proves that its ability to respond to the petition is prejudiced, (2) the petitioner\u2019s delay caused the Government\u2019s prejudice, and (3) the petitioner is unable to rebut the Government\u2019s showing of prejudice or otherwise justify his delay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, all of the elements are satisfied. Thus, the doctrine of laches bars Warren\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-18\">The Government proved that Warren\u2019s delay caused it prejudice in defending against his claims. Both the prosecutor and the trial judge are now deceased.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, Warren\u2019s defense counsel can neither locate Warren\u2019s file, nor remember most of the details from Warren\u2019s sentencing. Most of the transcripts are gone. Thus, the first two laches elements are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-19\">As for Rule 9\u2019s final prong, Warren can neither rebut the Government\u2019s showing of prejudice, nor justify his delay. Warren never claims that he has new evidence or facts that were not available to him during his sentencing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He merely claims that neurological impairments affect his ability to learn and process information. Accordingly, he has neither justified his substantial delay in filing the petition, nor rebutted the Government\u2019s showing of prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that Rule 9\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>doctrine of laches bars Warren\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition and affirm the district court on alternate grounds supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-12\">.
