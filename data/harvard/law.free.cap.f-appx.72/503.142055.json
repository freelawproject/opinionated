Grady\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion \u201cto vacate, set aside or correct [his] sentence.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-25\">This is Grady\u2019s third appearance before this court. In <em>United States v. Grady, </em>997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>F.2d 421 (8th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>510 U.S. 958, 114 S.Ct. 416, 126 L.Ed.2d 363 (1993), we affirmed the appellee\u2019s conviction for distribution of crack cocaine. In 2001, we vacated the District Court\u2019s decision that ordered a new trial for Grady and remanded the case for reconsideration of whether his \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed. <em>Grady v. United States, </em>269 F.3d 913 (8th Cir. 2001). Most recently, the District Court determined that Grady was entitled to the benefit of the prison mailbox rule and ruled that his motion was timely filed. The District Court incorporated its earlier ruling that vacated and set aside his sentence and granted Grady a new trial based on its conclusion that the District Court itself had compelled Grady to appear before the jury, during voir dire, in prison clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In the context of a federal prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>235 F.3d 1069, 1071 (8th Cir. 2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 879, 122 S.Ct. 182, 151 L.Ed.2d 126 (2001). It is settled law in this Circuit that an issue that was resolved on direct appeal cannot ordinarily be relitigated in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Wiley, </em>245 F.3d 750, 752 (8th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1083, 122 S.Ct. 818, 151 L.Ed.2d 701 (2002). That rule is clearly applicable in this case where Grady seeks a new trial based on his claim that he was compelled to appear before the jury in prison clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In his direct appeal, Grady argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201che was denied a fair trial because he appeared before the jury in jail clothing.\u201d <em>Grady, </em>997 F.2d at 424. In that case, we noted that the crucial determination is whether the defendant was compelled to stand trial while in prison clothing. We rejected Grady\u2019s claim because he failed to object to his appearance before the jury in his prison clothing and, accordingly, we were unable to discern any compulsion. Our decision cited <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>a case in which the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe failure to make an objection to the court as to being tried in such clothes, <em>for whatever reason, </em>is sufficient to negate the presence of compulsion necessary to establish a constitutional violation.\u201d 425 U.S. 501, 512-13, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976) (emphasis added). We will not revisit our prior ruling, the existence of which means that the District Court erred when it ruled that Grady was entitled to a new trial because he was compelled to appear before the jury in prison clothing. Accordingly, the decision of the District Court granting Grady a new trial is reversed and the case is remanded for reinstatement of Grady\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
