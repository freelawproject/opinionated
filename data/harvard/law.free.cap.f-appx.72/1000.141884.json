He argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals erred when it concluded that he had not been the victim of past persecution and that his fear of being persecuted upon removal was not well-founded. We have reviewed the record and the briefs and determine that the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the evidence in the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1026-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
