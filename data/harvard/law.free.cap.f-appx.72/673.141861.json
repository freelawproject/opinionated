Soos twice failed to allege any facts to support a conclusion that the named defendants were personally responsible for his lost mail. The district court dismissed his first amended complaint, holding that Soos had not alleged facts to support a constitutional claim and that his claim was barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-28\">A negligent act such as that alleged by Soos cannot furnish a basis for an action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). <em>See O\u2019Neal v. Eu, </em>866 F.2d 314, 314 (9th Cir.1989) (per curiam). Further, the Federal Tort Claims Act does not apply to \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b); <em>see Anderson v. United States Postal Service, </em>761 F.2d 527, 528 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam). Although Soos argues that his complaint stated claims for negligence and breach of contract, the ultimate claim is liability for negligent transmission. Soos\u2019s claim is thus barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
