Based upon testimony at the sentencing hearing from two postal inspectors, the district court determined that the loss amount was between $200,000 and $400,000, thus warranting an offense level increase of 12 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G) as opposed to the $6,500 loss amount stated in the presentence report. Ngufor argues that the Government did not sufficiently prove that the loss amount involved in his offense was over $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-20\">The calculation of a loss amount involved in an offense is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>101 F.3d 375, 384 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Ismoila, </em>100 F.3d 380, 396 (5th Cir.1996). The loss amount need not be determined with precision, and the district court need make only a reasonable estimate of the loss, based upon the available information. <em>Ismoila, </em>100 F.3d at 396. The district court\u2019s determination of the loss was supported by the record, and there was no clear error. Ngufor\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b212-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
