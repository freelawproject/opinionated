The district court imposed a 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">On his first appeal, Deagueros-Cortes argued that his prior \u201cattempted sexual assault\u201d could not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) and (U) because it did not involve a minor, nor under (43)(F) as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because the sentence imposed was less than one year. The government\u2019s response maintained that defendant\u2019s prior offense was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d aggravated felony under (43)(F), \u201cbut admitted] there [was] no evidence in the record that the victim of the sexual assault was a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">In an unpublished memorandum, we found plain error and reversed and remanded to the district court for resentencing. We held that Deagueros-Cortes\u2019 pri- or \u201cattempted sexual assault\u201d conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) because the sentence imposed had been less than one year. The mandate did not address the applicability of an enhancement under (43)(A) and (U) and did not limit the scope of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">On remand, the government argued that the mandate did not limit a finding of a guideline \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under amended guideline provision U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2001), and application note l(B)(ii), which had become effective in the interim. The government also asserted that under the old guideline, defendant\u2019s prior offense qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(43)(A) because that statutory provision did not require that the victim of a \u201crape\u201d be a minor; \u201cminor\u201d was not a qualifier to \u201crape\u201d or \u201cmurder.\u201d The district court explained that previously it found that defendant\u2019s prior offense was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under (43)(A) and (U) \u2014 not (43)(F). Deagueros-Cortes\u2019s prior \u201cattempted sexual assault\u201d was an attempted \u201crape,\u201d which qualified as an aggravated felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>under (43)(A) and (U) regardless of whether a minor was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The district court further held that under the amended guideline provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2001), Deagueros-Cortes\u2019s prior offense was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that called for a 16-level enhancement. The district court noted that this guideline definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was different from the statutory definition under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">On resentencing, a district court should apply the sentencing guideline in effect at the time, unless the guideline in effect at the time of defendant\u2019s commission of the crime provides for a lesser sentence. <em>United States v. Guzman-Bruno, </em>27 F.3d 420, 422 (9th Cir.1994), <em>as amended </em>(9th Cir. Sept. 23, 1994). Deagueros-Cortes now argues that the district court on remand was barred from relying on \u201cattempted rape\u201d as an aggravated felony under (43)(A) and (U) subject to a 16-level enhancement under the old guideline because the government had purportedly waived the issue on appeal. Accordingly, he argues that on resentencing, the district court should have held that under the old guideline, he was only subject to a four-level enhancement and imposed a sentence accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\u201cOn remand, the district court generally should be free to consider any matters relevant to sentencing, even those that may not have been raised at the first sentencing hearing, as if it were sentencing de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885-86 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1120, 122 S.Ct. 2345, 153 L.Ed.2d 173 (2002). In this case, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s mandate did not limit the issues on remand at all. There also is nothing in the record to indicate any \u201cdeceptive, obstructive, or otherwise inappropriate conduct\u201d by the government. <em>Id. </em>at 889. The attorneys representing the government on the first appeal merely argued for what they mistakenly believed was the strongest ground on which to support the district court\u2019s enhancement. Furthermore, judicial estoppel did not bar the government\u2019s argument on resentencing. The government\u2019s argument on appeal that there was no evidence the victim was a minor was not \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with its position on remand that the victim need not be a minor for (43)(A) and (U) concerning an \u201cattempted\u201d \u201crape\u201d to qualify as an aggravated felony. <em>Hamilton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>270 F.3d 778, 782 (9th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The district court did not err in holding that a 16-level enhancement was appropriate under the old guideline. Section 1101(a)(43)(A) applied to defendant\u2019s prior attempted sexual assault despite that there was no evidence the victim was a minor. \u201cOf a minor\u201d in (43)(A) did not qualify \u201crape\u201d or \u201cmurder\u201d but rather only qualified the phrase \u201csexual abuse.\u201d <em>See United States v. Yanez-Saucedo, </em>295 F.3d 991 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1312, 154 L.Ed.2d 1066 (Feb. 24, 2003) (applying 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) to a conviction under a Washington rape statute that proscribed conduct <em>not </em>involving minors). Under Deagueros-Cortes\u2019s reading, any rape or murder of an adult would not qualify as an aggravated felony under Section 1101(a)(43)(A). When Congress added \u201crape\u201d and \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d to the list of aggravated felonies covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, which already included murder, when it enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, it obviously did not mean to thereby limit \u201cmurder\u201d to \u201cmurder of a minor.\u201d Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996). The intent of the amendment was to broaden\u2014 not to limit \u2014 the scope of \u201caggravated felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ny.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cWhen Congress added \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 to the list of aggravated felonies, it placed it in the company of two other crimes\u2014 murder and rape \u2014 traditionally proscribed by state law....\u201d). This conclusion comports with the analysis by other circuits that Congress intended to include \u201crape\u201d under (43)(A) without regard to whether the victim was a minor. <em>E.g., Guerrero-Perez v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 727, 736 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201cMurder and rape are widely recognized as felony crimes. [Congress grouped] sexual abuse of a minor with these two acts----\u201d); <em>United States v. Marin-Navarette, </em>244 F.3d 1284, 1286 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[S]exual abuse of a minor is included in the definition with other flagitious acts such as murder and rape\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Furthermore, the district court did not err in determining that under the amended guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (2001), Deagueros-Cortes\u2019s prior offense qualified for a 16-level enhancement. Per our ruling in <em>United States v. Pimentel-Flores, </em>339 F.3d 959 (9th Cir.2003), a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d subject to a 16-level enhancement under the amended guideline need <em>not </em>have met the statutory definition of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Accordingly, Deagueros-Cortes\u2019 prior \u201cattempted sexual assault\u201d was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the new guideline\u2019s definition despite that a sentence exceeding one year was not imposed for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Under the amended guideline, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d included an offense that has as an element the attempted use of physical force against the person of another and included \u201cforcible sex offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(ii). Deagueros-Cortes\u2019 prior \u201cattempted sexual assault\u201d qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d either per its attempted use of physical force <em>or </em>because it was a forcible sex offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 4 (including attempts to commit such offenses within the guideline); <em>United States v. Bonilla-Montenegro, </em>331 F.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that U.S.S.G. 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(ii) is to be read disjunctively not conjunctively).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Whether under the old or the amended guideline, therefore, Deagueros-Cortes\u2019s prior \u201cattempted sexual assault\u201d offense qualified his sentence for a 16-level enhancement. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s sentencing on remand is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
