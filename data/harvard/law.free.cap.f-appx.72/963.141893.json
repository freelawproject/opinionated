Mora-Garibay concedes that his appellate arguments are foreclosed. He nevertheless raises two issues to preserve them for possible <em>en banc </em>or Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Mora-Garibay argues that the district court erred in determining that his prior state felony conviction for possession of cocaine was a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) and thus an \u201caggravated felony\u201d which warranted an eight-level increase in his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2001) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Mora-Garibay\u2019s argument regarding the definitions of \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1948, 155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003). The district court did not err in sentencing Mora-Garibay under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2001) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Mora-Garibay also argues, for the first time on appeal, that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats a prior conviction for a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not as an element of the offense. Mora-Garibay\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule that decision. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, the district court did not err in sentencing Mora-Garibay under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The motion of the Government for summary affirmance is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
