See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b731-27\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-28\">Wallace Lee Loggins appeals his bench trial conviction for one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-29\">Loggins contends that the government failed to establish the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u201cin or affecting commerce\u201d element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court found that the gun was sold by its Texas manufacturer to a distributor in California in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">We reject Loggins\u2019 jurisdictional argument. We have held that the felon in possession statute, 18 U.S.G. \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u201crequire[s] only \u2018the minimal [jurisdictional] nexus that the firearm have been, at some time, in interstate commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hanna, </em>55 F.3d 1456, 1462 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 575, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977)); <em>see also United States v. Casterline, </em>103 F.3d 76, 77 (9th Cir.1996). Nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence undermines <em>Hanna. United States v. Rousseau, </em>257 F.3d 925, 932 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>242 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Loggins also contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Rousseau, </em>257 F.3d at 932-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Loggins finally contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that the subject gun moved in interstate commerce because he received the gun in a private non-commercial manner. The evidence that the serial number on the gun matched the serial number on the Texas invoice is sufficient to support the verdict. <em>See United States v. Polanco, </em>93 F.3d 555, 563 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Hanna, </em>55 F.3d at 1462.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b731-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
