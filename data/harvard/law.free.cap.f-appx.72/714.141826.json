Arreazola appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, which seeks to challenge his 188-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). Reviewing de novo, <em>Tripati v. Henman, </em>843 F.2d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir. 1988), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-24\">Arreazola seeks to challenge his sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Despite Arreazola\u2019s contrary assertion, this is a challenge to the validity of his sentence, which must normally be brought in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Lorentsen v. Hood, </em>223 F.3d 950, 953 (9th Cir.2000). Arreazola contends, however, that he may bring his challenge under \u00a7 2241 through \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (stating that a prisoner may use \u00a7 2241 instead of \u00a7 2255 when the remedy under \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d). However, the district court correctly determined that Arreazola has failed to demonstrate that the savings clause applies. <em>See Moore v. Reno, </em>185 F.3d 1054, 1055 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (concluding that AEDPA\u2019s filing limitations on \u00a7 2255 motions do not make \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective); <em>Tripati, </em>843 F.2d at 1162 (stating that \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because a given claim would not be successful). Because Arreazola did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>properly invoke \u00a7 2241 and because the district court was not the sentencing court and therefore could not entertain a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court properly dismissed the petition. <em>See id. </em>at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b740-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
