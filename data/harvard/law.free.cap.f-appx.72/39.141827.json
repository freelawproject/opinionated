Delcambre filed this action against those involved with his prosecution, presenting state and federal claims. The district court dismissed this action, holding: the wrongful discharge and intentional interference claims were barred by prescription; the malicious prosecution claims, by the guilty plea. A Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. Thompson v. Goetzmann, </em>315 F.3d 457, 459 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Delcambre maintains the claims are not time-barred. The termination of his employment, three years before filing this action, however, ends any continuous tort. <em>See Bustamento v. Tucker, </em>607 So.2d 532, 542 (La.1992). Further, Delcambre contends his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim is not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because it was rendered invalid by a state tribunal. Though his conviction was expunged and an order of acquittal entered, expunction under La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 44:9 does not render a prior conviction invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
