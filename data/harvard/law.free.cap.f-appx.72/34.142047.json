He argues that the magistrate judge abused her discretion in refusing to appoint counsel and in dismissing the complaint as frivolous. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We hold that the magistrate judge\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Castro Romero v. Becken, </em>256 F.3d 349, 353-54 (5th Cir.2001). Additionally, the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint prior to service on the defendants, despite Taylor\u2019s partial payment of the filing fee, was sanctioned by statute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Taylor\u2019s allegations of deliberate indifference are in fact an expression of his disagreement with the type of medical treatment provided, and, therefore, they do not state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997). Taylor\u2019s claim against Captain Richard Avants arising from his disciplinary proceedings is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Taylor\u2019s allegation that Avants threatened him is not cognizable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 proceeding. <em>See Calhoun v. Hargrove, </em>312 F.3d 730, 734 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of the instant suit as frivolous was appropriate and, therefore, constitutes a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Taylor accumulated two prior \u201cstrikes\u201d in <em>Taylor v. Howards, </em>No. 01-10336, 2001 WL 877606 (5th Cir. Jul. 17, 2001) (unpublished). He therefore is BARRED from bringing any civil action or appeal in forma pauperis while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he shows that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; THREE-STRIKES BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
