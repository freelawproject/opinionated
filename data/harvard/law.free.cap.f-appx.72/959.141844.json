He contends that use of these uncounseled convictions was prohibited by <em>Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002). As Martinez acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Perez-Macias, </em>335 F.3d 421, 427-28 (5th Cir.2003). He raises the argument only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-25\">Martinez also maintains that the sentencing scheme of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>tinez concedes, his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000). He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b985-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
