Aguilar-Juarez concedes that both of his appellate arguments are foreclosed. He raises the issues to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-18\">Aguilar-Juarez argues that the district court erred in determining that his prior state felony convictions for possession of marijuana were \u201cdrug trafficking crimes\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) and thus \u201caggravated felonies\u201d which warranted an eight-level increase in his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C)(2002) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Aguilar-Juarez\u2019s argument regarding the definitions of \u201cdrug trafficking crimes\u201d and \u201caggravated felonies\u201d is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1948, 155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003). The district court did not err in sentencing Aguilar-Juarez under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C)(2002) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-25\">Aguilar-Juarez also argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats a prior conviction for a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not as an element of the offense. Aguilar-Juarez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule that decision. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, the district court did not err in sentencing Aguilar-Juarez under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-26\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. The Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-27\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
