There is no merit to Johnson\u2019s contention that his Fourth Amendment claims relating to the search of his apartment and seizure of cocaine are not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Johnson\u2019s argument that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on his excessive force claim is equally unavailing. \u201c[Hjandcuffing too tightly, without more, does not amount to excessive force.\u201d <em>Glenn v. City of Tyler, </em>242 F.3d 307, 314 (5th Cir.2001). Johnson\u2019s challenge to the defendants\u2019 alleged death threats does not present a claim of physical injury and therefore fails to state an excessive force claim. <em>See Gomez v. Chandler, </em>163 F.3d 921, 923 (5th Cir.1999). Johnson\u2019s claim that the other officers did not intervene to stop Officer Burdick also fails, as Johnson has not shown that Officer Burdick was using excessive force. Therefore, there was no need for intervention. <em>See Hale v. Townley, </em>45 F.3d 914, 919 (5th Cir.1995). Johnson\u2019s allegation of a conspiracy among the officers to violate his rights is conclusions!</p>\n<p id=\"b125-19\">Finally, Johnson\u2019s assertions that he was not allowed sufficient discovery or the opportunity to amend his complaint are without merit. <em>See Wicks v. Mississippi State Employment Servs., </em>41 F.3d 991, 994-95 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-20\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment for defendants Bur-dick and McNaul, or in overruling John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>son\u2019s objections to its rulings on his procedural motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Johnson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is hereby DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
