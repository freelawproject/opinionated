We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Foster contends that his petition is not time-barred because Congress has not established a statute of limitations for the writ of habeas corpus. He is mistaken. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Foster\u2019s reliance on pre-1996 caselaw is therefore misplaced. <em>See Calderon v. United States Dist. Court </em>(Beeler), 128 F.3d 1283, 1286-87 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530, 540 (9th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated by Woodford v. Garceau, </em>538 U.S. 202, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 1403, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">To the extent that Foster seeks equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, we conclude he has failed to show any extraordinary factors beyond his control which prevented him from filing a federal petition during the several years after his unsuccessful pro se state petitions. <em>See Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that there must be \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d beyond the prisoner\u2019s control that made it impossible to file a petition on time).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
