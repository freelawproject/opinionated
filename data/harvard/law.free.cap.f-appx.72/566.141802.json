Barnett. Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-24\">The district court properly denied Cigna\u2019s motion because the arbitration provisions contained in Cigna\u2019s employee handbook were never incorporated into the employment contract between Cigna and Dr. Barnett. The contract provided that the parties\u2019 agreement \u201cmay not be modified or amended other than by an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ment in 'writing signed by the parties.\u201d Thus, Cigna contracted away any power it may have had to unilaterally alter its employment agreement with Dr. Barnett.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Barnett\u2019s acknowledgment that he <em>received </em>and <em>reviewed </em>the handbook does not constitute \u201can agreement in writing signed by the parties\u201d sufficient to modify the contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cigna points to no evidence in the record of a writing, signed by Dr. Barnett and Cigna, in which Dr. Barnett <em>accepts </em>the arbitration provisions proposed in the employee handbook.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the original contract did not provide for arbitration of employment disputes and Cigna did not comply with the contract\u2019s specified method for modification, the arbitration provisions never became part of the contract between Cigna and Dr. Barnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Cigna places great reliance upon the fact that the contract provided that \u201c[e]ither party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon not less than one-hundred twenty (120) days[\u2019] prior written notice to the other.\u201d Cigna\u2019s reliance is misplaced. The fact that Cigna (or Dr. Barnett) could terminate the agreement, with the requisite notice, at any time does not entitle Cigna to modify the contract without complying with its provisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Barnett had a contract right to the method of modification specified in the parties\u2019 contract. This right is unaffected by the fact that either party may terminate the agreement after providing appropriate notice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Similarly, Cigna\u2019s reliance upon the \u201cemployment policies\u201d provision in the contract is misplaced. That provision provides that Dr. Barnett \u201cagrees to abide by [Cigna\u2019s] policies and procedures relating to compensation and fringe benefits, ethics, performance standards, patient griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>anees, tenure, and other similar subject matters as in effect from time to time and subject to change at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">First, by its own terms and read in the context of the entire agreement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the provision does not apply to a requirement of mandatory arbitration. Mandatory arbitration is not a \u201csimilar' subject matter\u201d to things like performance standards and tenure. Further, according to the employee handbook, mandatory arbitration is not merely an employment \u201cpolic[y or] proeedure[ ],\u201d but rather a purported \u201cterm and condition\u201d of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Second, to read the provision as Cigna suggests would allow Cigna to eviscerate its agreement with Dr. Barnett and substitute a new agreement, in contravention of the express modification provision discussed above.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Third, the parties\u2019 own previous practice confirms our reading of the provision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They modified their contract once, using the modification method specified in the original contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Cigna had two options: (1) it could have modified the contract in accordance with the contract\u2019s terms, by reaching an agreement in writing with Dr. Barnett, or (2) it could have terminated Dr. Barnett\u2019s employment. It did neither. Thus, because we conclude that the arbitration provisions in the employee handbook were never incorporated into the employment contract, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b592-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-25\">.
