He argues that Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines retroactively changed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) to allow for pumshment of a defendant only for conduct pertaining to the count of conviction and, therefore, that Ms gMdelines should be recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">We first address the Government\u2019s contention that Owens\u2019 notice of appeal was not timely filed. Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, judgment denying Owens\u2019 motion for modification was not entered on the criminal docket until February 7, 2003. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(6). Owens\u2019 motion for reconsideration was filed within ten days of entry of that judgment and, thus, had a suspensive effect on the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Brewer, </em>60 F.3d 1142, 1144 (5th Cir.1995). Owens\u2019 notice of appeal was therefore timely, and we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">The appeal, however, is frivolous. <em>See 5th Cir. </em>R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Amendment 591 amended the Guidelines to provide that the enhanced penalties of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 applied only where a defendant was convicted of an offense referenced to that guideline. U.S.S.G., App. C Supp., amend. 591, p. 32 (Reasons for Amendment) (2001). Owens, however, did not receive a \u00a7 2D1.2 enhancement; Amendment <em>591 </em>is therefore inapplicable to Ms sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
