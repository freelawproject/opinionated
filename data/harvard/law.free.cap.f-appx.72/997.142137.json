R. Civ. P. 60(b). <em>See Harcon Barge Co. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 667 (5th Cir.1986) (en banc). In the instant appeal, Perry has filed motions seeking appointment of counsel and production of a transcript at government expense. Those motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">In his Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion, Perry challenged the dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit on the grounds that: (1) he had not been admonished of his right to appeal; (2) he was denied full disclosure of the evidence; (3) his requests for appointment of counsel had been denied; (4) he was denied access to adequate legal materials; and (5) the jail personnel interfered with his right to access the courts. Perry\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice because he failed to obey the magistrate judge\u2019s order and answer questions posed to him on cross-examination during the bench trial. As none of Perry\u2019s arguments in his Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion addressed that sole basis for dismissal, the denial of that motion was proper. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">As Perry\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit, it is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). If he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), Perry will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-14\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
