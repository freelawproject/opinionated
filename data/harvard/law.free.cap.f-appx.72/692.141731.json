We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-23\">Varela contends that his three-strikes sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. This claim is foreclosed by <em>Lock-yer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172-75, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that the state court\u2019s affirmance of two consecutive 25-years-to-life sentences for petty theft was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-24\">Varela raises a number of other constitutional claims not included in the certificate of appealability issued by the district court. We note that these constitutional claims were briefed by the government. However, we decline to broaden the certificate of appealability in order to address those claims. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (holding that for a certificate of appealability to issue \u201cpetitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong\u201d) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b718-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
