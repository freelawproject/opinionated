In hght of unrebutted evidence in the PreSentence Report (PSR) showing that Graciella helped manage and supervise other participants, the district court did not commit clear error by imposing the increase. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b); <em>see United, States v. Taylor, </em>277 F.3d 721, 724 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Graciella also contends that she should not have received a two-level increase for obstruction of justice. Graciella did not rebut the PSR\u2019s evidence showing that she gave false names, presented false identification documents, and misrepresented her immigration status during presentencing investigations. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 <em>&amp; </em>comment, (n.4); <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>964 F.2d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir. 1992). The judgment against Graciella Arteaga is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">Jose contends that his 84-month sentence, which was the result of a 50 percent downward departure, amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in fight of his age and poor health because the district court did not <em>sua sponte </em>depart further. This court lacks jurisdiction to consider this claim because there is no indication that the district court declined to give an additional downward departure based on any erroneous belief that such a departure was unauthorized by law. <em>See United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir. 1999). The appeal of Jose Arteaga-Limones is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-15\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
