We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-25\">Even assuming that Cota has a disability or is perceived as having one, there is no triable issue that he can perform the essential functions of a Maintenance Technician V, with or without reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). While Cota disputes Phelps Dodge\u2019s description of the \u201cessential functions\u201d of the Tech V position, his argument rests entirely on the opinion of a vocational rehabilitation specialist whose testimony the district court properly excluded. <em>See Broussard v. Univ. of Cal., at Berkeley, </em>192 F.3d 1252, 1258 (9th Cir.1999). He suggests that he could be accommodated by coworkers\u2019 performing essential functions that he cannot, but this is neither a <em>reasonable, </em>nor a required, accommodation. Accordingly, Cota failed to make out a prima facie case under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In any event, Phelps Dodge offered him a reasonable accommodation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). That Cota declined this position does not change the fact that he was accommodated in accordance with the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b565-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
