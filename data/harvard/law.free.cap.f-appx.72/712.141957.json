We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review de novo the Gregorios\u2019 claims of due process violations in their deportation proceedings. <em>See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-19\">The Gregorios\u2019 due process claim fails because they did not show that they were prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s refusal to permit their sons to testify on their behalf and to permit their counsel to present closing arguments. <em>Cf. Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971-73 (9th Cir.2000) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-20\">This Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the Gregorios failed to establish extreme hardship in support of their application for suspension of deportation. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
