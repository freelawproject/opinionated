At sentencing, the district court relied on the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSIR\u201d) in decreasing Sisk\u2019s offense level by two based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>her role as a minor participant, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SBl^Cb).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notwithstanding her failure to object below, Sisk challenges on appeal the district court\u2019s determination that she was a minor participant in the drug conspiracy eligible for a two-level reduction, rather than a minimal participant eligible for a four-level reduction. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8742(a), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In general, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determination as to whether a defendant was a minor or a minimal participant in a drug conspiracy, and we give due deference to the court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>182 F.3d 1165, 1175 (10th Cir.1999). Because Sisk failed to object to the PSIR\u2019s characterization of her role in the offense as minor, however, she has waived the issue on appeal unless the district court committed plain error. <em>See United States v. Ivy, 83 </em>F.3d 1266, 1297 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that if a defendant fails to object to [her] presentence report, [she] waives [her] right to challenge the district court\u2019s reliance on it, unless the district court\u2019s decision to do so amounts to plain error.\u201d). It is well-established that, to constitute plain error, a district court\u2019s decision must be \u201cparticularly egregious, as well as obvious and substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Based on our review of the undisputed facts of the instant case, as set forth in the PSIR, it is far from obvious whether Sisk was a minimal versus a minor participant in the conspiracy. As described in the PSIR, Sisk was a \u201crunner\u201d in the drug conspiracy, she had obtained the necessary paraphernalia for the manufacture of methamphetamine, and she was aware of the conspiracy. (13 R. at 17 1159.) Even if the district court erred in concluding that Sisk was a minor, rather than a minimal, participant, its error was not \u201cparticularly egregious, obvious, or substantial,\u201d <em>Ivy, </em>83 F.3d at 1297, so as to constitute plain error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b858-15\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows: (a) If the defendant was a minimal participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 4 levels. (b) If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
