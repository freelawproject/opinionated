The immigration judge (IJ) found that Wu\u2019s story of her involvement in the conspiracy was not credible and found that the government agent\u2019s story was credible. The government agent testified that Wu had a supervisory role in a scheme whereby illegal aliens were forced to work as prostitutes until their smuggling fees were paid. We have no doubt that the IJ acted well within his discretion when he determined that the crime for which Wu had been convicted was \u201cparticularly serious.\u201d <em>In re Q-T-M-T, </em>211. &amp; N.
