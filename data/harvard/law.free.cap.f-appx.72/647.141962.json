Lifton\u2019s mother (\u201cMrs.Lifton\u201d) filed suit against the officers alleging a variety of claims, including state tort claims, claims based on the California constitution, and a federal \u00a7 1983 claim based on the Fourth Amendment. The jury ultimately returned a verdict for Mrs. Lifton on the state tort law claims and awarded approximately $850,000. The officers appeal on several grounds, and Mrs. Lifton cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">\n<em>A. The Officers\u2019Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">1. Denial of Rule 50 Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b674-21\">The officers appeal the denial of their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>a. The officers argue that they owed no legal duty of care to Lifton. The officers failed to raise this issue before submission of the case to the jury. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(2). \u201cIn general, the requirement that the motion be made at the close of all the evidence is to be strictly observed.\u201d <em>Farley Transp. Co. v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., </em>786 F.2d 1342, 1346 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also Desrosiers v. Flight Int\u2019l Inc., </em>156 F.3d 952, 956-57 (9th Cir.1998) (suggesting that when a party fails to comply with Rule 50, a court has no power to grant the requested relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">b. The officers also argue that Mrs. Lifton presented insufficient evidence to show that their actions proximately caused Liftoffs injury. Again, they failed to raise this issue until after the jury had reached its verdict. Prior to submission to the jury, the officers made only vague arguments to the effect that \u201cthe plaintiffs have not proved their case.\u201d These vague statements did not constitute a proper Rule 50 motion on the issue of proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We may only review such challenges to sufficiency of evidence if \u201cthere is plain error apparent on the face of the record that, if not noticed, would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice. This exception, however, permits only extraordinarily deferential review that is limited to whether there was <em>any </em>evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of its sufficiency.\u201d <em>Patel v. Penman, </em>103 F.3d 868, 878 (9th Cir.1996) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We cannot say that the court below committed plain error or that the jury\u2019s verdict resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">2. Denial of Rule 59 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The officers also appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their Rule 59 motion for a new trial. The officers\u2019 Rule 59 motion was based on the same grounds as their Rule 50 motion. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">3. State Law Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Before the district court, the officers argued that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because they are immune from suit under Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 820.2. On appeal, they argue that they are entitled to immunity under Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 845.8. The two provisions are related. The California Law Revision Commission\u2019s comments to the 1963 adoption of \u00a7 845.8 state: \u201cThis section is a specific application of the discretionary immunity recognized in California cases and in Section 820.2.\u201d <em>See also Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>54 Cal.3d 202, 285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341, 1347-50 (Cal. 1991) (discussing generally immunity for police officers).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">It is well-established that \u00a7 820.2 does not provide immunity from excessive force claims. <em>See Robinson v. Solano County, </em>278 F.3d 1007, 1016 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). Although the California Supreme Court has held that officers are immune from liability under \u00a7 845.8 where a suspect\u2019s injuries are entirely self-inflicted, <em>see Ladd v. County of San Mateo, </em>12 Cal.4th 913, 50 Cal.Rptr.2d 309, 911 P.2d 496, 500-02 (Cal.1996), California courts have not granted officers immunity from suit where a suspect\u2019s injuries are caused by officers\u2019 use of excessive force, <em>see Larson v. City of Oakland, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 91, 95-98, 94 Cal.Rptr. 466 (1971); <em>Scruggs v. Haynes, </em>252 Cal.App.2d 256, 262-68, 60 Cal.Rptr. 355 (1967); <em>Ne Casek v. City of Los Angeles, </em>233 Cal.App.2d 131, 136-38, 43 Cal.Rptr. 294 (1965). Because \u00a7 845.8 is a \u201cspecific application\u201d of \u00a7 820.2, and because California courts have not granted immunity from excessive force claims, we reject the officers\u2019 argument that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>immune from Mrs. Lifton\u2019s suit under \u00a7 845.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">\n<em>B. Mrs. Lifton\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">1. Partial Qualified Immunity from Fourth Amendment Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Mrs. Lifton argues that the district court erred by holding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity from her claim that they used excessive force prior to the shooting in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court\u2019s decision to analyze the officers\u2019 pre-shooting conduct separately from the decision to use deadly force was proper under <em>Alexander v. City of San Francisco, </em>29 F.3d 1355 (9th Cir.1994). We also agree with the district court that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity from this claim. The officers\u2019 decisions to surround Lifton, shout at him, and use a taser to disable him were not violations of clearly established Fourth Amendment law governing excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">2. Denial of Rule 15 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Mrs. Lifton also cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 15(b) motion to amend her complaint to include a claim based on the search and seizure provision of the California state constitution. It is unclear whether this provision includes an implied private right of action for damages. Even assuming it does, Mrs. Lifton\u2019s proposed amendment was properly rejected because it would have been prejudicial to the officers. <em>See </em>3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 15.18 (3d ed.1999). The question presented in an excessive force claim is different from the question presented in a state tort claim. That the jury found a tort violation does not at all establish that the jury would have found a state constitutional violation. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying Mrs. Lifton\u2019s Rule 15 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s ruling in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
