Ransom, federal prisoner #27525-004, appeals the summary-judgment dismissal of his <em>Bivens</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>actions against the above-named parties. A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo </em>and will be upheld if the pleadings and the evidence show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) and (e); <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Sharif-Munir-Davidson Dev. Corp., </em>992 F.2d 1398, 1401 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">In dismissing Ransom\u2019s suits, the district court determined that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as is required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1977e(a). Ransom concedes that he failed to exhaust the third and final level of the administrative grievance process with respect to his claims. However, Ransom contends that the defendants interfered with his attempts to pursue his administrative remedies by placing him in administrative detention and intercepting his mail, and that \u201cthe exhaustion requirement should [therefore] be deemed satisfied.\u201d Ransom asserts that the defendants\u2019 actions raised a disputed issue of material fact that precluded summary judgment dismissal of his complaints. Ransom goes on the argue that, in any event, the defendants\u2019 summary judgment evidence was insufficient to show that he failed to meet the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-19\">The defendants presented competent summary-judgment evidence demonstrad ing that Ransom did not pursue all levels of the administrative remedies process pri- or to filing his suits, as is required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. Ransom\u2019s assertion that the defendants prevented him from completing the administrative grievance process is unsubstantiated and conclusional, and is based on little more than his own belief that the defendants intercepted his third-level administrative complaint. <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>(5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Ransom offers no evidence that he ever attempted the third and final level of administrative review. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ransom\u2019s civil rights actions for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was proper. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
