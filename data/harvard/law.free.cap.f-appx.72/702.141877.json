We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-25\">Bazley contends that his habeas petition is a proper vehicle to challenge the validity of a 1965 conviction that was used to increase his current sentence. He relies on an implied exception to <em>Lackawanna County Dist. Attorney v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>394, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001), arguing that habeas relief should be available because he cannot be faulted for \u201cfailing to obtain timely review of a constitutional claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Bazle/s failure to follow through after the state trial court\u2019s denial of his 1972 habeas petition refutes his claim that a federal petition in 2000 was the first available vehicle for review of his constitutional challenges to his 1965 guilty plea. <em>Cf. id.; Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 383,121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001) (discussing in a plurality opinion the possible exceptions to the general rule that prior convictions cannot be attacked in a federal habeas petition after the time for direct and collateral review has expired).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Nor did obtaining a second exculpatory declaration, 36 years after Bazley submitted the first one, establish eligibility for a new \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception for purposes of <em>Lackawanna, </em>532 U.S. at 405, or <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b728-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
