Concerning his application for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, our court granted Crandell a certificate of appealability on: (1) whether <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), bars CrandelTs asserting his challenge to the indictment; (2) whether Crandell validly asserted denial of due process and equal protection by the alleged racially discriminatory method of selecting grand jury forepersons in Bossier Parish; and (3) whether counsel was ineffective for failing to move to quash the indictment on that basis. (CrandelTs motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The district court\u2019s determination that <em>Campbell v. Louisiana, </em>523 U.S. 392, 118 S.Ct. 1419, 140 L.Ed.2d 551 (1998) (white defendant has third-party standing to challenge exclusion of blacks from grand jury), was a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law that could not be applied retroactively under <em>Teague </em>is erroneous in the light of our subsequent decision in <em>Peterson v. Cain, </em>302 F.3d 508, 515 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1118, 123 S.Ct. 886, 154 L.Ed.2d 796 (2003). <em>Peterson </em>held the Supreme Court derived its <em>Campbell </em>decision from its earlier decisions in <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991), <em>Hobby v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 339, 104 S.Ct. 3093, 82 L.Ed.2d 260 (1984), <em>Rose v. Mitchell, </em>443 U.S. 545, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 61 L.Ed.2d 739 (1979), and <em>Peters v. Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972) (plurality opinion). <em>Peterson, </em>302 F.3d at 512-15. All of these decisions were rendered prior to when CrandelTs conviction became final. In short, <em>Campbell </em>is not a new rule of law and <em>Teague </em>does not bar CrandelTs due process and equal protection claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">As for CrandelTs claim that counsel was ineffective for fading to move to quash, the district court\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel ruling was based, in part, on <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>being a new rule of Constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">We, therefore, VACATE that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment on these issues and REMAND: (1) CrandelTs due process and equal protection claims based on the alleged racially discriminatory method of selecting grand jury forepersons in Bossier Parish; and (2) his ineffective assistance claim for counsel\u2019s failure to move to quash the indictment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">\n<em>VACATED and REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
