We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, <em>Zimmerman v. City of Oakland, </em>255 F.3d 734, 737 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">The district court properly dismissed Barkclay\u2019s claims against the Arizona state court judges because they were entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>absolute judicial immunity. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The Central Justice Court and West Justice Court were properly dismissed because the amended complaint failed to make any factual allegations against these entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Because Barkclay did not allege that her rights were violated by a custom or policy of the County of Maricopa or the County Board of Supervisors, the district court properly dismissed these parties. <em>See Brass v. County of Los Angeles, </em>328 F.3d 1192, 1198 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The district court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review Bark-clay\u2019s state court criminal actions. <em>See Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 54, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); <em>see also Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Barkclay\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Kona Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, </em>229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">All pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Barkclay\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b727-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
