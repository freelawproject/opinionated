We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-18\">The Sousas contend that they were denied a fair trial when the prosecutor implied that either they or their trial counsel had attempted to bribe a witness. To warrant habeas relief, prosecutorial misconduct must \u201cso infeet[] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). Here, any prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was cured by a thorough curative instruction. <em>See Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987) (finding that the Court \u201cnormally presume[s] that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it\u201d). Accordingly, the Washington state court\u2019s determination that the statements did not result in prejudice because of the carefully crafted instruction was neither contrary to, nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b735-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
