Jackman, Jr. Count one charged Jackman as a felon in possession of twenty firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1). Count two charged Jackman with violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871 by knowingly possessing a destructive device which was not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841. Jack-man challenges his conviction as to count two, contending that the prosecution failed to establish that he had the requisite intent. Count two, Jackman also asserts, should have been dismissed because the government failed to preserve exculpatory evidence and because there was prosecutorial misconduct. In addition, Jackman submits that the District Court erred in several respects in sentencing him. We do not agree and will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-19\">II. <em>Facts and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-20\">According to count two of the indictment, the destructive device consisted of \u201ca cardboard tube approximately 6 inches in length containing explosive powder, encased in metal roller bearings, with an ignition fuse[.]\u201d It is undisputed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>device, referred to as an improvised explosive device (\u201cIED\u201d), was made from a pest control device (\u201cPCD\u201d) sold on the commercial market to deter geese and other wildlife by making a loud noise when its fuse is ignited. The PCD had been altered by adding an explosive powder Pyrodex into an empty chamber and by gluing roller bearings to the outside of the PCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The IED was seized, pursuant to a warrant, from the basement of Jackman\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s home and placed in a \u201cfrag\u201d bag for safekeeping after law enforcement authorities detected the presence of a \u201cpowder line\u201d inside the device.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the request of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms (\u201cBATF\u201d), Officer Wessel with the Allegheny County Police Department removed the powder in the IED to render the device safe and so that it could be sent to a laboratory for analysis. The powder was removed by drilling into the end of the device opposite from the fuse. The components were sent to the BATF for analysis. Thereafter, the BATF returned the disassembled device, as well as the residue from the chamber to which the Pyrodex had been added. Photographs were taken of the device and its various components at different stages during its disassembly. The powder, subsequently identified as the explosive Pyrodex, however, was never weighed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Numerous pretrial matters, including a motion by the defense to determine Jackman\u2019s competency, caused trial to be delayed. The District Court ordered a psychiatrist, Dr. Bernstein, to conduct an examination and evaluation of Jackman. Pursuant to a request by separate counsel appointed to represent Jackman during the pendency of this motion, a second psychiatrist, Dr. Wettstein, was also direeted to examine and evaluate Jack-man. After a hearing on the motion to determine competency, the District Court found Jackman competent, granted the Public Defender\u2019s motion to withdraw and appointed defense counsel to represent Jackman.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The District Court ordered that trial be bifurcated, because a single trial on both counts one and two would have resulted in the jury being aware of Jackman\u2019s past criminal record. The court elected to first proceed to trial on count two. Before <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel had moved to dismiss count two of the indictment, contending that the government\u2019s failure to preserve certain evidence warranted dismissal. Photographs, counsel acknowledged, had been provided of the destructive device before it was disassembled, but the prosecution had neither preserved nor quantified the contents of the alleged explosive device. Counsel argued that the IED had been destroyed in bad faith because the government disassembled it before law enforcement authorities were even sure that the IED violated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">The prosecution denied that it had recklessly spoiled the evidence. It pointed out that the IED had been disassembled to render it safe. While the Pyrodex had been removed from the IED, the prosecution pointed out that defendant had access to photographs of the device in various stage of its disassembly, copies of the laboratory analyses, the remnants of the IED, as well as other components of the device for analysis. Exemplars of the PCD that was altered, the prosecution noted, were also available commercially for the defense to examine. The District Court denied the motion, citing the government\u2019s need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>render the device safe and to determine whether the device was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">At trial, BATF Explosives Enforcement Officer Lund, <em>inter alia, </em>testified that the underlying commercial PCD was not illegal. The IED seized from Jackman\u2019s residence was illegal because it was designed to fragment upon explosion and such fragmentation had the potential to cause injury. However, at the close of the evidence, Jackman again moved to dismiss the indictment as to count two based on spoliation of the evidence, and made several other objections. The District Court denied these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to count two. Thereafter, Jackman pled guilty to the firearms offense charged in count one. At sentencing, Jackman objected to the presentence report and sought several downward adjustments and departures. The District Court denied Jackman\u2019s motion and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 262 months at count one, to run concurrent with 120 months at count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Jackman filed a timely appeal. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we review Jackman\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">III. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence as to Possession of a Unregistered Destructive Device</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Jackman alleges that the prosecutors failed to demonstrate that Jackman\u2019s device was not made for a legitimate use, <em>i.e., </em>to scare geese. Having thus failed, the prosecution could not show that it had been redesigned for use as a weapon. With respect to Jackman\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence challenge, our review is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Helbling, </em>209 F.3d 226, 238 (3d Cir.2000). \u2018We determine whether there is substantial evidence that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government would allow a rational trier of fact to convict.\u201d <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Charles, </em>72 F.3d 401, 410 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">We have held that intent is not a required element for proving the existence of a \u201cdestructive device\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845. <em>See United States v. Urban, </em>140 F.3d 229, 234 (3d Cir.1998). Rather, \u201cthe question of the possessor\u2019s intent is relevant only when the objective characteristics of the device demonstrate that it may not be a weapon.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>152 F.3d 618, 627 (7th Cir.1998). Here the objective evidence before the jury indicated that the device found was a weapon, even if it was not intended as such. Expert testimony established the presence of explosive mixtures and explosives in the device, some of which were added to the commercially available device. Roller bearings were affixed by epoxy to the outside of the device and evenly spaced to provide for uniform fragmentation. This had the potential to cause injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Nonetheless, the prosecution <em>did </em>introduce circumstantial evidence of intent, negating Jackman\u2019s purported reason for fashioning the device. Jackman\u2019s girlfriend, with whom he was then living, testified that Jackman often fed cracked corn to geese at the pond, that the geese did not give off the odor that purportedly motivated him to build the device, and that Jackman had even told her that he could not hurt an animal. We believe this evidence, especially when considered in light of the substantial discretion afforded to the juries who actually see and hear the testimony of the parties and witnesses and can thereby more properly judge their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>credibility, is sufficient to support Jack-man\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">IV. <em>Spoliation of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Jackman challenges the prosecution\u2019s \u201cdestruction\u201d of the device in question. In <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984), the Supreme Court held that the government\u2019s duty under the due process clause to preserve evidence is limited to evidence that possesses both \u201can exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d Four years later, in <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988), the Supreme Court held that \u201cunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d Thus, under <em>Youngblood </em>and <em>Trombetta, </em>a defendant must show that the government \u201c(1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed the evidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and, which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable.\u201d <em>United States v. Femia, </em>9 F.3d 990, 993-94 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Accordingly, the \u201cpresence or absence of good or bad faith by the government will be dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 994. Bad faith, as <em>Youngblood </em>instructed, \u201cturn[s] on the police\u2019s knowledge of the exculpatory value of the evidence at the time it was lost or destroyed.\u201d 488 U.S. at 56 n. 1, 109 S.Ct. 333; <em>see Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 488, 104 S.Ct. 2528 (observing that the record did not contain any allegations of official animus toward the defendant or a conscious effort by the police to suppress the exculpatory evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Here, Jackman contends that the government\u2019s destruction of the cardboard tube by drilling into it and the failure to weigh the contents of the Pyrodex deprived him of the opportunity to test the evidence to determine that it was, in fact, a destructive device in violation of the law. The government\u2019s bad faith, according to Jackman, was evident from the fact that it \u201cdestroyed the potentially exculpatory evidence at a time when it did not even know whether the IED violated federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The legal conclusions underlying the District Court\u2019s denial of Jackman\u2019s motion to dismiss count two of the indictment based on the destruction of evidence are subject to plenary review. We review the factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Driscoll, </em>852 F.2d 84, 85 (3d Cir.1988); <em>see also United States v. Wright, </em>260 F.3d 568, 570 (6th Cir.2001) (review of motion to dismiss for failure to preserve exculpatory evidence subject to de novo review).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Jackman\u2019s argument is not persuasive. Under <em>Youngblood, </em>Jackman had to demonstrate bad faith, <em>i.e., </em>knowledge by the police \u201cof the exculpatory value of the evidence at the time it was ... destroyed.\u201d 488 U.S. at 56 n. 1, 109 S.Ct. 333. No such showing has been made. Instead, Jack-man simply relies on the sequence of events surrounding the IED\u2019s seizure and incapacitation to establish bad faith. This sequence of events, without more, fails to demonstrate bad faith, an official animus towards Jackman or even a conscious effort to frustrate Jackman\u2019s defense. Accordingly, the District Court appropriately denied Jackman\u2019s motion to dismiss count two of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Because the prosecution met its burden of proof by introducing evidence regarding the design of the destructive device and because it was not required to prove intent, <em>see supra, </em>\u00a7 III (citing <em>Urban, </em>140 F.3d at 234), Jackman cannot demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>that the evidence possessed an apparent exculpatory value. Moreover, Jackman fails to recognize that while the IED\u2019s intact cardboard tube and the weight of the Pyrodex were no longer available, there was ample evidence at his disposal for analysis. Such evidence included not only similar commercially available PCDs constructed of cardboard tubes, but also the remains of the IED after it was disassembled, the photographs of the IED and its components taken during various stages of its disassembly, and the commercially available PCDs, Pyrodex, epoxy and roller bearings. Because the PCD was commercially available, similar PCDs could have been analyzed to determine the strength of the cardboard tube, the dimensions of the empty chamber in the PCD, the volume of the empty chamber in the PCD, and the quantity of powder required to fill the empty chamber. As a result, Jackman cannot satisfy the third prong of the <em>Trombetta Youngblood </em>test, that is, that he was unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">V. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In her opening statement, the prosecutor stated that \u201cthe [it]ems themselves about which you will hear testimony ... are explosives or chemicals used to make explosives devices. Those are the types of things, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand, you may not necessarily get to see in the courtroom....\u201d Jackman alleges that this statement was prejudicial because it purportedly suggested to the jury that the Judge had already decided an element of the crime, specifically that these materials were explosives, to Jackman\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Viewing the prosecutor\u2019s comment in the \u201ccontext\u201d of the overall trial, <em>United States v. Zehrbach, </em>47 F.3d 1252, 1265 (3d Cir.1995), we believe that Jackman was not \u201cunfairly prejudiced\u201d by these remarks. <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). First, the inference that Jackman would have us believe the jury drew from the prosecutor\u2019s isolated statement is tenuous at best. One wonders whether such a thought even crossed a juror\u2019s mind. Nonetheless, Jack-man\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to explain \u201cthat the Court\u2019s policies are that we, [sic] whenever there is an allegation of something that is dangerous, whether it is or not, it can\u2019t be brought into the courtroom.\u201d Furthermore, Jackman\u2019s counsel himself referred to the powder in question as \u201cexplosive powder\u201d during the trial. In fact, Jackman essentially conceded the powders had \u201cexplosive\u201d qualities, but asserted that the powder was not present in sufficient <em>quantities </em>to actually create a harmful explosion. As noted <em>swpra, </em>there is no question that the prosecution produced sufficient evidence to prove the IED was a destructive device under \u00a7 5845(f). There was no prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">VI. <em>The District Court\u2019s Sentencing Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Finally, Jackman challenges certain aspects of the sentence imposed by the District Court. First, Jackman argues that the District Court erred in denying him several downward departures from the sentence called for by the Guidelines. He asserts he was entitled to a departure on account of his diminished mental capacity under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.13. Furthermore, he asserts that the Guidelines calculation significantly over-represented his criminal history, entitling him to the departure available under Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Where a district court is aware that the Guidelines grant it the authority to depart downward under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>stances, but exercises its discretion and chooses not to, \u201cwe have no jurisdiction to review its decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>269 F.3d 175, 179 (3d Cir.2001). The record reflects that the District Court was aware that Jackman had some mental issues, \u201csuggesting] that he be placed where he can receive mental health counseling\u201d in his sentencing order. Nonetheless, at sentencing, and in denying the departure available under \u00a7 5K2.13, the District Court specifically stated Jackman had not \u201csuccessfully borne the burden of establishing a significantly reduced mental capacity by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d In response to Jackman\u2019s counsel\u2019s assertion that the Guidelines overstated Jackman\u2019s criminal history, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\">Well, with respect to the criminal history, there were some minor offenses in there, but I counted, in the presentence report, seven convictions and twelve other \u2014 so-called other arrests as they are called in the presentence report, and five of those he was found guilty, some were dismissed, but certainly he\u2019s got a lengthy and numerous criminal history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA0\">Because the record demonstrates that both of these decisions were based on the District Court\u2019s view of the evidence before it that Jackman did not deserve these departures, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of Jackman\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Jackman also asserts that his case \u201cfall[s] outside the heartland of cases\u201d which have adequately been taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Responding to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Koon, </em>the Sentencing Commission adopted \u00a7 5K2.0, now explicitly recognizing this basis for departure. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.0, cmt. (2001). Unlike his other arguments, which are based on an assertion that the District Court erred in failing to grant a departure for which the Guidelines specifically provide, Jackman argues that the District Court erred in faffing to recognize that the specific facts of his case are so \u201catypical\u201d that the Guidelines as a whole do not cover the particulars of his case. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 99-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035. Jackman argues that his \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d belief that his actions were legal, caused by the combination of his purportedly diminished mental capacity and his receipt of a certificate from North Carolina supposedly restoring his rights of gun ownership, makes this an \u201cunusual\u201d case calling for a departure from the applicable Guideline. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has stated that, generally, \u201c[t]hese considerations are factual matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Although the District Court did not specifically discuss its ability to depart downward pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.0 in its sentencing colloquy, the District Court plainly rejected the suggestion that there was anything \u201catypical\u201d about Jack-man\u2019s case, precluding its ability to depart downward under the Guideline. <em>See id. </em>at 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035. As noted, the District Court did not believe that Jackman had \u201ca significantly reduced mental capacity.\u201d Furthermore, the District Court did not believe that the purported restoration of Jackman\u2019s rights was significant because, on its face, the certificate did not apply to an individual in Jackman\u2019s circumstances. To emphasize this point, the District Court specifically took time at the end of the sentencing hearing to read into the record the certificate from the State of North Carolina purportedly restoring Jackman\u2019s right to own firearms. This certificate contained a specific \u201cexception of the right to own, possess, receive, buy or otherwise acquire firearms\u201d placing felons on notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>that such rights may continue to be precluded for a period of five years. Jack-man\u2019s arrest occurred just over three years after the date on this certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Because the District Court rejected the \u201cparticular factor[s]\u201d that Jackman contends \u201cmake the case atypical,\u201d <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, the record reflects the District Court\u2019s belief that there was nothing unusual about Jack-man\u2019s case. Therefore, Jackman\u2019s case could not permit the application of the \u201cheartland\u201d exception to downward depart. Because these predicate findings are not clearly erroneous, the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant this departure will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Finally, Jackman argues that although his case went to trial on count two, after the jury convicted him, he accepted responsibility for and pled guilty to count one. Jackman contends the District Court erred in denying him the corresponding two-level reduction in his base offense level. We review the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>146 F.3d 161, 167 (3d Cir.1998). \u201cIn practice, the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard requires the appellate court to uphold any district court determination that falls within a broad range of permissible conclusions.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartman Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 400, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">After the jury convicted Jackman on count two, he pled guilty to count one. Nonetheless, the record indicates that Jackman pled guilty to count one not because of the sudden onset of a feeling of responsibility, but merely because he felt he could not win. In his final statement to the District Court, Jackman never accepted any responsibility for his conduct. He claimed that things had been \u201ctwisted\u201d against him and attributed his illegal possession of the firearms to the government\u2019s failure to inform him \u201cif a purchase I made puts me in violation of the law.\u201d The record indicates that the District Court\u2019s denial of that reduction was entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">VII. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">.
