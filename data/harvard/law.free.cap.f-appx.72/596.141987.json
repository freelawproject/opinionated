We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Gui v. I.N.S., </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir.2002). We review credibility findings for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1225. We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">Despite finding Singh\u2019s testimony consistent and his manner easy and unrehearsed, the IJ required Singh to provide corroborating documents. The IJ then found Singh not credible based on its conclusion that the documentary evidence did not verify his claims. Where allegations are otherwise unrefuted and credible, the IJ may not require corroboration of claims. <em>See id. </em>at 1227. Accordingly the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">We therefore grant the petition and remand for further proceedings on the merits of Singh\u2019s application. <em>See I.N.S. v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">PETITION GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
