We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case, we will not repeat it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-23\">Miller did not raise the following five issues in the district court: (1) that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to explain why he gave greater weight to the opinions of Drs. McRae and Brown than to the opinion of Dr. Williams; (2) that the ALJ failed to consider the complete opinions of state agency physicians, Drs. McRae and Brown; (3) that the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>erred in assessing the lay witness testimony of Mr. Miller; (4) that the ALJ did not consider Miller\u2019s non-severe foot and back impairments in his RFC analysis; and (5) that the ALJ failed fully to explain the basis for his RFC findings. She therefore has waived these arguments on appeal. <em>See Copeland v. Bowen, </em>861 F.2d 536, 540 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that courts of appeal will not consider arguments not raised in the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Because Miller adequately raised her remaining two claims \u2014 that the ALJ failed to make sufficient findings about the physical and mental demands of her past relevant work and that the ALJ\u2019s determination that she could perform unskilled work was error \u2014 in district court, these claims are properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits. <em>Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 855 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Miller argues that the ALJ, in his Residual Functional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) analysis, failed to \u201caccommodate\u201d his Psychiatric Review Technique Form (\u201cPRTF\u201d) finding that she <em>often </em>fails to complete tasks in a timely manner due to deficiencies of concentration, persistence, or pace. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">An RFC is \u201ca more detailed assessment\u201d of the PRTF. Social Security Rulings 96-8P. The ALJ concluded in his RFC analysis that Miller could perform simple, repetitive tasks that were not detailed or that did not require concentration in excess of two hours. This finding, however, does not address his PRTF finding. Miller\u2019s ability to perform routine, simple tasks does not mean that she has the ability to concentrate at work or complete projects on a timely basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Secondly, in evaluating a claim involving mental and/or emotional impairments, an ALJ must offer \u201ca precise description of the particular job duties which are likely to produce tension and anxiety, e.g. <em>speed, ... </em>[and] <em>working with other people. \u201d </em>Social Security Rulings 96-8P (emphasis added). The record indicated that Miller often had problems with maintaining a steady work pace. The ALJ noted this in his PRTF finding, and Dr. Brown \u2014 with whose opinion the ALJ \u201cfully\u201d agreed\u2014 also identified Miller\u2019s deficiency in pace in his functional capacity assessment. However, the ALJ failed to address this limitation in his analysis of Miller\u2019s ability to perform past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">Finally, the ALJ erred by finding that Miller is \u201ccapable of superficial contact and cooperation, but not close frequent interpersonal interaction\u201d and that \u201cshe can perform tasks which are not detailed or require concentration in excess of two hours at a time.\u201d These findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. In fact, Drs. Brown and McRae recommended that Miller limit herself to \u201csolitary settings\u201d and avoid most co-workers. Miller\u2019s own testimony indicates that she \u201clike[d] talking to the guests\u201d and that she had confrontations with coworkers and supervisors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles states that one of the job responsibilities of a motel maid is \u201cpersonal assistance to patrons.\u201d DOT 323.687-014. We therefore conclude that the ALJ\u2019s RFC findings were not supported by the record, and were at best speculative. <em>See </em>SSR 82-62 (stating that an ALJ\u2019s decision regarding the functional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>capacity to perform past work \u201cmust be developed fully ... clearly and explicitly ... presumptions, speculations and suppositions must not be used\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\">. Even though the AU discredited Miller\u2019s testimony regarding her physical impairments and their impact on her ability to work, he never discounted Miller\u2019s credibility with respect to her mental impairments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
