Sanabria asserts that the district court erred by not asking about racial prejudices during <em>voir dire </em>and by refusing to depart downward at sentencing for aberrant behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">We review the sufficiency of <em>voir dire </em>questions for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>819 F.2d 221, 223 (9th Cir.1987). The Constitution did not require a question about racial prejudices in this case because \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d did not exist indicating a likelihood of racial or ethnic prejudice. <em>Rosales-Lopez v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 189-90, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 68 L.Ed.2d 22 (1981). Similarly, there was no \u201creasonable probability that racial or ethnic prejudice\u201d influenced the jury simply because the defendant and defense counsel were members of a minority. <em>Id. </em>at 191. The Supreme Court has suggested that such circumstances might exist when the crime is one of \u201cviolence\u201d and the victim is of a different race than the perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>The facts of this case do not invoke these types of concerns. <em>Cf. United States v. Sarkisian, </em>197 F.3d 966, 979 (9th Cir. 1999). Moreover, the questions the district court did ask during <em>voir dire, </em>as well as the questions asked by defense counsel, adequately ensured the impartiality of the jury. <em>See id. </em>at 979-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Although a district court\u2019s erroneous determination that it lacks legal authority to depart downward is reviewable de novo, its discretionary decision not to depart downward is not reviewable. <em>United States v. Wetchie, </em>207 F.3d 632, 636 (9th Cir.2000). Here, the district court articulated why it chose not to depart downward (based on Sanabria\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for her actions and the need for general deterrence based on the size of the theft involving a public employee occupying a position of trust). The court\u2019s statement was sufficient to explain the decision not to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
