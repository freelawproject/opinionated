For the first time on appeal, Zamora argues that he was improperly sentenced under the penalty provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 (b)(1)(A)(viii) and 960(b)(1)(H) because those portions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 960 were rendered facially unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Zamora concedes that his argument is foreclosed by Fifth Circuit precedent, but seeks to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-22\">In <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 581-82 (5th Cir.2000), this court held that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) &amp; (b) and 846 were not unconstitutional. The reasoning in <em>Slaughter </em>applies by analogy to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 960 are similar in structure and content. As no decision overruling <em>Slaughter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>exists, Zamora\u2019s argument is indeed foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Because Zamora\u2019s argument is foreclosed, the Government has moved for a summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment. The motion is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
