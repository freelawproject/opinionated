R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Defendant Rafael Delgado-Morales appeals the sentence imposed after his plea of guilty to illegal reentry following prior deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Defendant contends the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score when sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of 57 months. In calculating his sentence, the district court awarded a total of six criminal history points \u2014 three points for his sentences on two related drug-trafficking convictions and three points for his sentence on a failure-to-appear conviction. Defendant argues the sentences on the three prior convictions should have been considered \u201crelated\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) because the underlying charges were consolidated for trial, and sentencing on the three convictions occurred at the same time. Thus, defendant asserts his criminal history score should have been three rather than six.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">Generally speaking, a district court\u2019s finding that prior sentences are \u201crelated\u201d or \u201cunrelated\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) is a factual determination that we review only for clear error. <em>See United States v. Alberty, </em>40 F.3d 1132, 1133 (10th Cir.1994). To the extent the district court\u2019s determination involves legal conclusions regarding the application and interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, including the meaning of the terms \u201crelated\u201d and \u201cunrelated,\u201d we exercise plenary review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">Section 4A1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines contains instructions for computing a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. In particular, subsection (2) provides that \u201c[pjrior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(2). In contrast, \u201c[pjrior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Application Note 3 explains when prior sentences are to be considered \u201crelated\u201d or \u201cunrelated\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-16\">Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Otherwise, prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that (A) occurred on the same occasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-17\"><em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">Defendant\u2019s drug-trafficking offenses occurred on November 4, 1989, when he hired a female to drive a van loaded with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>marijuana across the United States border from Mexico. The marijuana in the van was discovered at the point of entry by border patrol officers, and defendant was arrested that same day. After being released on bond on July 25,1990, defendant failed to appear for trial on the drug-trafficking charges. He was arrested on March 4, 1991, and charged with failure to appear. Although it is true, as noted by defendant, that all of the charges were consolidated for trial and sentencing, that factor is irrelevant since the underlying offenses were separated by an intervening arrest. Thus, as directed by Application Note 3, the district court properly determined that defendant\u2019s sentence on the failure-to-appear conviction was \u201cunrelated\u201d to his sentences on the drug-trafficking convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
