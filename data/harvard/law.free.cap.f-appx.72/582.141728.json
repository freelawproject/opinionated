(\u201cMaverik\u201d). We reverse and remand to the district court for further findings on whether the amount in controversy necessary for diversity jurisdiction has been satisfied. Because we reverse and remand on the jurisdictional issue, we do not reach the merits of the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">The parties are familiar with the facts and we recite them only as necessary for this disposition. Pit Stop and Maverik operate gasoline stations in Wendell, Idaho and compete against each other in the sale of retail gasoline. In 1999, Pit Stop sued Maverik in state court alleging that Maverik sold gasoline at \u201cless than cost\u201d (as defined by I.C. \u00a7 48-403) and engaged in unfair competition by pricing its gasoline lower than fair market value (in violation of I.C. \u00a7 48-102). Pit Stop sought \u201cdamages in such sum exceeding $10,000 [as] proven up at trial,\u201d injunctive relief against further violation of Idaho law, and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">Maverik removed the case asserting that the district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Pit Stop moved for remand back to state court, contending that damages did not satisfy the requisite amount in controversy. The district court denied the motion after estimating Pit Stop\u2019s damages at $20,000, trebling that amount pursuant to state law at the time,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>and forecasting attorneys\u2019 fees at over $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Pit Stop has failed to provide a clear picture of its damages since litigation began between the parties. In its complaint, Pit Stop alleged \u201cdamages in such sum exceeding $10,000 [as] may be proven up at trial.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Pit Stop indicated in open court that it intended to stipulate to an amount in controversy less than $75,000. However, it withdrew the stipulation on the same day and reserved the right to amend its complaint and seek higher damages. Finally, in its papers urging remand, Pit Stop conceded a \u201crough estimate\u201d of \u201cmonetary damages ... between $10,000 and $20,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Maverik also has failed to meet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to support jurisdiction, namely the actual damages at stake. <em>See Sanchez v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., </em>102 F.3d 398, 404 (9th Cir.1996). Maverik stated in its removal papers that \u201cbased on a preponderance of the evidence contained in Exhibit A ... it is more likely than not that the actual amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\u201d However, it appears that Maverik never attached any supporting documents (entitled \u201cExhibit A\u201d or otherwise) to substantiate its claim. Notwithstanding the absence of supporting documentation, the district court selected $20,000 as the operative figure to use in its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">It is difficult for us to justify, or to see how the district court could justify, pinpointing Pit Stop\u2019s damages at $20,000. The record is bereft of evidence to show the actual losses suffered by Pit Stop assuming its allegations against Maverick are true. Detailed evidence on actual losses is especially crucial in this case because incremental differences, once trebled, will have a significant impact on the amount in controversy. For instance, had the district court pinpointed Pit Stop\u2019s damages at $10,000, then it would have to assume that attorney\u2019s fees would surpass $45,000 to retain jurisdiction. Neither party submitted an affidavit to that effect and the sparse record provides even less guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Our analysis does not change even if we adopt Maverik\u2019s \u201cviewpoint\u201d to determine the amount in controversy. <em>See In re Ford Motor Co., </em>264 F.3d 952, 958 (9th Cir.2001) (court may use defendant\u2019s \u201cviewpoint\u201d of costs to determine amount in controversy if plaintiffs potential recovery is below the relevant amount). Other than a conclusory statement by its president that compliance \u201ccould easily exceed the amount of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000),\u201d Maverik has provided very little evidence to suggest its potential costs if Pit Stop prevailed. The district court posited that an analysis based on historic sales might provide a reliable estimate of these costs. However, without further development of the record, we cannot assess this hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">This court has a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d against removal and will reject federal jurisdiction \u201cif there is any doubt as to the right of removal.\u201d <em>Gaus v. Miles, Inc., </em>980 F.2d 564, 566 (9th Cir.1992) (citations omitted). Without further development of the record to determine Pit Stop\u2019s actual damages or Maverik\u2019s cost of compliance with an injunction, we cannot say that the district court properly retained jurisdiction over this case. Because we remand for additional findings on jurisdiction, we do not reach the issue of whether the district court properly granted summary judgment for Maverik.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b609-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-14\">. At the time Pit Stop filed its complaint, Idaho's Unfair Sales Act provided for treble damages. Although this particular provision was subsequently repealed, it still applies for the purpose of determining the amount in controversy. <em>Hill v. Blind Indus, and Servs. of Maryland, </em>179 F.3d 754, 757 (9th Cir.1999) (\"diversity jurisdiction is determined at the time the action commences, and a federal court is not divested of jurisdiction ... if the amount in controversy subsequently drops below the minimum jurisdictional level.\u201d) (citing <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v.
