The defendants moved for a change of venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). Magistrate Judge David Bernthal recommended granting the motion, but he analyzed it as if it had been filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) rather than \u00a7 1406(a). District Judge Michael McCuskey recognized that error and granted the motion pursuant to \u00a7 1406(a). Johnson then filed this <em>Bivens </em>action against Magistrate Judge Bernthal and Judge McCuskey, alleging that they violated his constitutional right to due process when Magistrate Judge Bernthal \u201cintentionally falsified\u201d his recommendation by citing \u00a7 1404(a) and when Judge McCuskey \u201ccovered up\u201d the error, which Johnson described as a \u201ccriminal violation.\u201d <em>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Johnson sought monetary damages as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The district court dismissed the case based on judicial immunity, and we affirm, though partially on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We will first address Johnson\u2019s claim for monetary damages. Judges are immune from lawsuits seeking monetary damages, <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Brokaw v. Mercer County, </em>235 F.3d 1000, 1015 (7th Cir. 2000), and that immunity extends even to acts made in bad faith or with malice, <em>Mireles, </em>502 U.S. at 11, <em>Brokaw, </em>235 F.3d at 1015. There are two circumstances, however, when a plaintiff can overcome judicial immunity. First, \u201ca judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, <em>i.e., </em>actions not taken in the judge\u2019s judicial capacity.\u201d <em>M\u00edreles, </em>502 U.S. at 11. Second, \u201ca judge is not immune for actions, though judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. The type of jurisdiction that the second circumstance refers to is subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>Homola v. McNamara, </em>59 F.3d 647, 651 (7th Cir.1995), and Johnson does not argue that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over his underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Instead, Johnson contends that criminal actions (and cover-ups of such actions) are nonjudicial acts for which judicial immunity does not apply. But the \u201ccriminal\u201d conduct that Johnson complains about is Magistrate Judge Bernthal\u2019s decision to apply a particular statute concerning venue. That decision plainly was made in the judge\u2019s capacity as a judicial officer, and Johnson\u2019s characterization of it as \u201ccriminal\u201d is patently frivolous. Moreover, even if Magistrate Judge Bernthal had acted in bad faith or with malice, absolute immunity would still bar this suit. <em>See Mireles, </em>502 U.S. at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Johnson\u2019s remaining arguments are similarly without merit. First, contrary to Johnson\u2019s contention, the rules regarding judicial immunity do not distinguish between lawsuits brought under <em>Bivens </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Antoine v. Byers &amp; Anderson, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 429, 433 n. 5, 113 S.Ct. 2167, 124 L.Ed.2d 391 (1993). Second, Johnson argues that magistrate judges are \u201cinferior judges\u201d who are not entitled to judicial immunity. But magistrate judges are federal judicial officers, 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631-36, and judicial immunity applies as equally to them as it does to federal district court judges. <em>See, e.g., Stern v. Halligan, </em>158 F.3d 729, 731 n. 1 (3d Cir.1998); <em>King v. Myers, </em>973 F.2d 354, 356 (4th Cir.1992); <em>Tanner v. Heise, </em>879 F.2d 572, 576-78 (9th Cir.1989). Finally, Johnson argues that Judge McCuskey\u2019s \u201csupervision\u201d of Magistrate Judge Bernthal is an administrative act that is not covered by judicial immunity. While it is true that judges are not entitled to judicial immunity for administrative acts, <em>Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 227-28, 108 S.Ct. 538, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988), Judge MeCuskey\u2019s review of Magistrate Judge Bernthal\u2019s recommendation is not such an act. The judge in <em>Forrester </em>demoted and discharged a probation officer, an act deemed administrative because it was a \u201cpersonnel deeision[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. In contrast, Judge MeCuskey\u2019s review of Magistrate Judge Bernthal\u2019s recommendation was a judicial act performed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), which states that when a party objects within ten days to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, a district court judge \u201cshall make a de novo determination of those portions of the ... recommendations to which objection is made.\u201d Thus, both judges were entitled to immunity from Johnson\u2019s claims for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We now turn to Johnson\u2019s claim for injunctive and \u201cdeclaratory\u201d relief. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that judicial immunity does not extend to injunctive relief, <em>Pulliam v. Allen, </em>466 U.S. 522, 541-42, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984); <em>Scruggs v. Moellering, </em>870 F.2d 376, 378 (7th Cir.1989), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Antoine v. Byers &amp; Anderson, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 429, 432 n. 3, 113 S.Ct. 2167, 124 L.Ed.2d 391 (1993), but at least two circuits have carved an exception to that rule for cases where the defendant is a federal judge (sued in a <em>Bivens </em>action) rather than a state judge (sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), <em>Bolin v. Story, 225 </em>F.3d 1234, 1239-42 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam); <em>Mullis v. United States Bankr. Ct. for the Dist. of Nev., </em>828 F.2d 1385, 1391-94 (9th Cir.1987). We found that exception to be \u201cof doubtful merit,\u201d <em>Scruggs, </em>870 F.2d at 378, but our doubt is now irrelevant because Congress has since amended \u00a7 1983 to provide that \u201cinjunctive relief shall not be granted\u201d in an action brought against \u201ca judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity ... unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d This amendment bars injunctive relief against both state and federal judges because \u201cfederal courts incorporate \u00a7 1983 law into <em>Bivens </em>actions.\u201d <em>Bolin, 225 </em>F.3d at 1242. Thus, the amendment to \u00a7 1983 limits the type of relief available to plaintiffs who sue judges to declaratory relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">But Johnson is not seeking declaratory relief in the true legal sense. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 57; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. In his complaint Johnson asks the district court to \u201cdeclare\u201d that Magistrate Judge Bernthal and Judge McCuskey acted improperly in various ways when deciding the motion for a change of venue. Declaratory judgments, however, are meant to define the legal rights and obligations of the parties in the anticipation of some future conduct. <em>See Bontkowski v. Smith, </em>305 F.3d 757, 761 (7th Cir.2002); <em>see generally </em>10B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2751 (3d ed.1998). For example, a party may seek a declaratory judgment to determine whether a particular contract term is binding and need not risk breaching the contract and await a suit. <em>See Bontkowski, </em>305 F.3d at 761 (explaining how a declaratory judgment may be used as \u201ca method of depriving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>defendant of delay as a weapon\u201d). Declaratory judgments are not meant simply to proclaim that one party is liable to another. <em>See Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, </em>27 F.3d 1545, 1553-54 (Fed.Cir. 1994) (en banc) (concluding that the plaintiffs prayer for a \u201cdeclaration\u201d of a regulatory taking was \u201cdifferent from a formal declaration under the Declaratory Judgment Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
