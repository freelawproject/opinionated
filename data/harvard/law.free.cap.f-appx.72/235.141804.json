The prior felony conviction involved the transportation of aliens, and the district court used it to increase Rodriguez\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-19\">Rodriguez argues that the district court erred when it increased his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii) because transporting undocumented aliens is not equivalent to alien smuggling for purposes of that guideline. Rodriguez correctly acknowledges that this issue if foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164 (5th Cir. 2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1811, 155 L.Ed.2d 689 (2003), which held that the term \u201csmuggling\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) includes \u201ctransporting\u201d aliens within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-26\">Rodriguez also argues that the district court erred when it looked beyond the indictment charging him with transporting aliens and considered information in his presentence report to increase his sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). This issue is likewise foreclosed. <em>United States v. Sanchez-Garcia, </em>319 F.3d 677, 678 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-27\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Rodriguez\u2019s motion to supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
