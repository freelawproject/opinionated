(Aplt. Br. at 4-7.) We examine this objection below. Second, Nelson asserts that the trial court improperly instructed the jury in stating that it was unlawful for a person knowingly or intentionally to distribute a controlled substance \u201coutside the usual course of medical practice <em>or </em>without legitimate purpose,\u201d when this instruction should have used the word \u201cand\u201d instead of \u201cor.\u201d (Aplt. Br. at 8.) But, based on an examination of the record, the trial court did properly use the word \u201cand\u201d in its instructions to the jury. (Jury Instructions, ROA, Doc. No. 34, KK 6, 7 (relating that it is unlawful for a person knowingly or intentionally to distribute a controlled substance \u201coutside the usual course of medical practice <em>and </em>without legitimate purpose\u201d) (emphasis added) [hereinafter Jury Instructions]); <em>see also </em>Conference with Counsel, ROA Vol. IV, Tr. at 405-07 (agreeing to use the word \u201cand\u201d in instructions to the jury). Accordingly, Nelson has no argument on appeal regarding the wording of the jury instructions, and we consider only his argument regarding the sufficiency of evidence to support his conviction. We find sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict and AFFIRM Nelson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">We review whether evidence is sufficient to support a jury\u2019s verdict <em>de novo. United States v. Lewis, </em>240 F.3d 866, 870 (10th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Jackson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>213 F.3d 1269, 1283 (10th Cir.2000)). <em>On </em>appeal, however, we ask only \u201cwhether, when considered in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id (citing <em>United States v. Hanzlicek, </em>187 F.3d 1228, 1239 (10th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">According to the evidence presented at trial, Nelson and his co-conspirators in Oklahoma City created a website called NationPharmacy.com through which consumers could supposedly obtain both prescription and non-prescription drugs. (Tr. 22-30.) However, almost all of the drugs distributed through the website were controlled substances, and the vast majority were hydrocodone, a powerful and addictive painkiller. (Tr. 61,103,159; Aple. Br. at 2.) Customers would select the drag of their choice from the website, fill out a short questionnaire that would be sent to Nelson to review, and he would sign a prescription for the medication to be filled at his co-conspirator\u2019s pharmacy. (Tr. at 22, 31-32, 102, 297.) Nelson traveled periodically to the pharmacy and signed hundreds to thousands of prescription forms at a time. (Tr. 62-65, 105.) The pharmacy paid him for each prescription written, and filled the orders at inflated prices. (Tr. 348; Aplt. Br. at 3.) At Nelson\u2019s direction, the $175,000 that he was paid for signing the prescriptions was wired to an account that he controlled outside the United States at the Bank of Antigua. (Tr. 345-48.) Nelson never once examined the patients for whom he signed prescriptions, and did not dispute that his actions in this regard were outside the bounds of accepted medical practice. (Tr. 139, 173, 179, 272, 335.) In mid-December 2000, the Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision suspended Nelson\u2019s license, and, in early March of 2001, the Oklahoma State Pharmacy Board shut down his co-conspirator\u2019s pharmacy. (Aple. Br. at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">After examining the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found Nelson guilty of conspiracy to prescribe prescription drags illegally and guilty of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of those sales outside the United States beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Lewis, </em>240 F.3d at 870. We therefore AFFIRM his conviction for these crimes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b863-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\">.
