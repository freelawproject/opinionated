Whether the <em>Ake </em>violation by Dr. Brooks in failing to delve into mitigation issues and to provide assistance to prepare a mitigation defense was harmless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">9. Whether the trial court, by forcing Hood to elect between his constitutional rights, created a constructive ineffective assistance of counsel requiring automatic reversal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">Texas prisoner # 000982, Hood was convicted of the 1989 capital murders of Ronald Williamson and Trade Lynn Wallace under Texas Penal Code section 19.03(a)(2) and was sentenced to death. <em>Hood v. State, </em>No. 71,167 (Tex.Crim.App. Nov. 24, 1993) (unpublished). His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-18\">Prior to his trial, Hood moved for the appointment of an independent psychiatrist to assist him in preparing a defense at sentencing, noting that a particular need existed because, in all likelihood, his present and future mental condition would be an issue at trial and, further, that the State would have access to its own expert.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the first hearing on the matter, the trial court ordered defense counsel to submit a list of psychiatrists from which the court would appoint one. The trial court reserved decision on whether the prosecution would be able to receive a copy of the psychiatric report.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-19\">The prosecution moved for a rehearing. At a hearing on that matter held early in June of 1990, the State requested that either a neutral psychiatrist be appointed and that the report be made available to both parties or that the prosecution\u2019s psychiatrist, if it chose to obtain one, have access to Hood. The defense objected, arguing that if Hood\u2019s psychiatric report were required to be shared with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>State, he would be forced to choose between his right to appointment of a psychiatrist and his right against self-incrimination, because sharing the report with the prosecution would be tantamount to communicating with the State. The trial court reserved ruling on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Immediately after the hearing, however, the trial judge met with counsel for both parties in chambers. The in-chambers conference was not recorded; however, the docket sheet indicates that the trial court granted the defense\u2019s motion as follows: \u201c(1) Psychiatrist appointed - information shared by both or (2)[two] psychiatrists [appointed], one of each side\u2019s choice; interview together - share information.\u201d The docket sheet then listed three psychiatrists, one of whom was \u201cDr. Brooks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Later that month, the trial judge signed an order granting Hood\u2019s motion in part and giving him the option of choosing between two alternatives. The first alternative ordered the appointment of Dr. Sidney Brooks to conduct a psychiatric examination to determine Hood\u2019s future dangerousness and assist the jury in determining the proper sentence. Under this alternative, Dr. Brooks was ordered to prepare and file a written report of his findings with the court, which report would be made available to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The second alternative ordered that each party designate in writing one psychiatrist of its choosing before July 13, 1990, for purposes of conducting a joint interview with Hood. Each psychiatrist would report only to the party that had designated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">This basic order specified that Hood was to file a written election of one of the two alternatives no later than July 13, 1990, and that if he failed to do so, his motion to appoint an independent psychiatrist would be denied. The order was signed for approval by counsel for Hood and for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Although no written election was ever made, Dr. Brooks did conduct an examination of Hood on July 6, 1990, and submitted his report to the trial court. Dr. Brooks diagnosed Hood as having antisocial personality disorder and concluded in relevant part that Hood \u201cha[d] demonstrated in the past and [was] likely to demonstrate in the future, particularly when subjected to provocative circumstances, a propensity to act out his aggressive instincts upon other persons and/or property.\u201d Dr. Brooks additionally diagnosed Hood with \u201c[n]europhysiological brain dysfunction with probable left temporal cortical and deep temporal limbic brain dysfunction\u201d and offered the opinion that \u201cbrain dysfunctional factors [were] inevitably important and contributory to Mr. Hood\u2019s personality dysfunction\u201d and \u201ccontribute[d] to the risk of behavioral dysfunction and future dangerousness.\u201d Dr. Brooks suggested that additional testing would assist in further evaluating and confirming those clinical findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Dr. Brooks was not called to testify at trial, however. According to the affidavit testimony introduced at Hood\u2019s state habeas proceeding by his trial co-counsel David Haynes, the defense had access to Dr. Brooks\u2019s report, but it did not contain the doctor\u2019s opinion on Hood\u2019s future dangerousness. During the penalty phase, counsel interviewed Dr. Brooks in a courthouse witness room in an effort to obtain his position on the issue of future dangerousness, but Dr. Brooks refused to state his opinion, except from the witness stand. According to Haynes\u2019 affidavit, defense counsel elected not to call Dr. Brooks because if he had testified that Hood was a future danger, it would have been disastrous to the defense. According to the affidavit testimony of Hood\u2019s trial co-coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>sel George Parker, the decision not to call Dr. Brooks was made \u201c[bjecause of [his] refusal to provide any information not contained in his report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">During the penalty phase, the prosecution called two expert witnesses, both of whom testified that Hood was a sociopath who would more likely than not be a continuing threat to society. Immediately before to the close of evidence at the penalty phase, defense counsel re-urged their pretrial motion and requested funding for an independent psychiatrist. Counsel for Hood argued that the State had the economic ability to hire two experts and that Hood had been denied such an opportunity, but the trial judge denied the motion. Based on the jury\u2019s answers to the special issues, the death penalty was assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Hood filed a state application for post-conviction relief raising, <em>inter alia,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the following grounds for relief: (1) The trial court\u2019s refusal to appoint an independent, confidential psychiatrist prior to and at trial violated his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and Hood had never waived his right to such an expert; (2) counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve and pursue Hood\u2019s rights under <em>Ake\\ </em>and (3) counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigation evidence. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cTCCA\u201d) denied the application with written order based on the following pertinent factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">1. Hood failed to choose in writing which psychiatric examination alternative he preferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">2. Hood agreed to cooperate with Dr. Brooks, even though counsel had advised him against it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">3. Hood impliedly elected the first option contained in the trial court\u2019s motion, both by his failure to make a written election and by cooperating with Dr. Brooks against the advice of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">4. Before Hood was examined by Dr. Brooks, his legal rights were explained to him and he appeared to understand them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">5. Hood waived appellate complaint about not having his own psychiatrist by failing to exercise the option offered by the trial judge of being examined by a psychiatrist of his own choosing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">6. The options set forth in the trial court\u2019s order satisfied <em>Ake.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">7. During the course of trial counsel\u2019s representation, Hood stopped communicating with them, insisting on communicating only through counsel\u2019s legal assistant, Janet Heitmiller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-16\">8. The unsuitability of this arrangement was made clear to Hood, but to no avail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-17\">9. Counsel met with Hood\u2019s parents to obtain mitigating evidence; however, counsel\u2019s efforts were hampered by a lack of cooperation from Hood and members of his family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-18\">10. Hood received effective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-19\">11. Hood failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different but for counsel\u2019s alleged deficiencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-20\">Hood subsequently filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition, raising the following issues: (1) whether his trial court\u2019s refusal to appoint an independent, confidential psychiatrist to examine Hood prior to and at trial violated his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights; (2) whether Hood waived his right to an independent psychiatric expert; (3) whether Hood was denied his Sixth and Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel at the punishment phase by counsel\u2019s failure to preserve and pursue Hood\u2019s rights under <em>Ake, </em>by not effectively communicating with Hood, by failing to request further medical testing so as to present a mitigation defense, and by allowing Hood to give a psychiatric interview to Dr. Brooks; (4) whether the trial court created constructive ineffective assistance of counsel by forcing Hood to abandon his rights under <em>Ake </em>so as to avoid self-incrimination; and (5) whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the punishment phase of trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments by failing to develop and present a mitigation defense and by delegating that responsibility to a legal assistant. The State moved for summary judgment, and the district court issued a memorandum opinion denying habeas relief for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Ake <em>Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>Future Dangerousness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The district court determined that the TCCA\u2019s finding on direct appeal that Hood had waived his <em>Ake </em>claims by submitting to an evaluation against the advice of counsel was untenable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court found that both the affidavit evidence and Dr. Brooks\u2019s report supported a finding that counsel misunderstood the court\u2019s order as <em>requiring </em>Hood to be examined by Dr. Brooks. In support of this finding, the district court pointed to the fact that the trial court coordinator had sent a copy of the order to Hood\u2019s trial counsel and to Dr. Brooks, along with a copy of a letter to Brooks which stated, \u201cEnclosed is a copy of the Court\u2019s Order Appointing Psychiatrist to Examine Defendant. Your contact at the sheriffs office will be Jim Hamilton, Medical Officer____\u201d Based on this letter, the district court ventured that it appeared that the court coordinator mistakenly concluded that Dr. Brooks had in fact been appointed by the trial court to examine Hood and, as a result of receiving copies of her letter with the court\u2019s order, both Hood\u2019s counsel and Dr. Brooks had the same misunderstanding. The district court found this mistake understandable, observing that the order was \u201csomewhat ambiguous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">Based on the affidavit testimony of Janet Heitmiller<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and information in Dr. Brooks\u2019s report, the district court found that Hood\u2019s counsel believed that he had no right to prevent Hood\u2019s interview with Dr. Brooks, and that if Hood\u2019s counsel had understood the order, Brooks would not have gone to the jail to interview Hood at all, absent an agreement in writing by Hood\u2019s counsel to the first alternative. The district court further found that neither the affidavit evidence nor Dr. Brooks\u2019s report established that Hood was ever informed of his right to refuse to be interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">In sum, the district court found that Hood\u2019s counsel, the court coordinator, and Dr. Brooks all mistakenly believed that Dr. Brooks had been appointed to examine Hood and that Hood had to submit; and, further, that this mistake was caused in part by the trial court coordinator\u2019s letter to Dr. Brooks and in part by the ambiguity of the order. The district court further found that there was no evidence to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>port the determination that counsel had waived the <em>Ake </em>claim by failing to elect in writing to pursue the order\u2019s second alternative, because the terms of the order contradicted this reasoning. Counsel never made a written election and, therefore, under the terms of the order, Dr. Brooks should not have examined Hood.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Having determined that the state court\u2019s determination was unreasonable in light of the record, the district court addressed the merits of Hood\u2019s <em>Ake </em>claim. The court assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the alternatives set forth in the trial court\u2019s order violated <em>Ake, </em>and found that Dr. Brooks\u2019s actions violated <em>Ake, </em>insofar as he (1) disobeyed the court\u2019s order to state in his report his opinion whether there was a probability that Hood would commit future criminal acts, and (2) refused to reveal his opinion on Hood\u2019s future dangerousness except from the witness stand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The district court then assessed whether these errors were (1) structural, requiring automatic reversal, or (2) trial errors, requiring reversal only if there was a showing of harm. Citing <em>White v. Johnson, </em>153 F.3d 197 (5th Cir.1998), the district court held that the errors were trial errors and should therefore be analyzed under the harmless error standard. Using <em>White </em>as a guide, the district court determined that the following non-psychiatric evidence of Hood\u2019s future dangerousness was so strong that his future dangerousness would have been a foregone conclusion in the jury\u2019s mind: (1) Hood had a juvenile conviction for breaking and entering and was jailed for violating probation; (2) while in jail, Hood attempted to draw attention to himself on three occasions by deliberately injuring himself or feigning injury; (3) at age 19, Hood entered into a sexual relationship with a 15-year old girl; (4) Hood\u2019s father had grabbed him from behind while Hood was arguing with his girlfriend\u2019s mother, and Hood struck his father and threatened to kill him; (5) Hood would force his 15-year old girlfriend to have sex with him when she would refuse; (6) Hood took his girlfriend to Texas from Indiana and told her mother that he would kill her if she refused to allow him to see her daughter; (7) after working at Taco Bell for only three days Hood was fired for fighting; (8) shortly before the murders, Hood raped a different 15-year old girl who was visiting him and threatened to kill her if she told any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>one; and (9) Hood was \u201cwritten up\u201d for fighting with another inmate while in prison awaiting trial on the murder charge. Based on the strength of this non-psychiatric evidence, the district court determined that any error in not allowing Hood to have the benefit of an independent, confidential psychiatric expert on the issue of future dangerousness, or any lack of help by Dr. Brooks in preparing a defense on this issue, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The district court next addressed Hood\u2019s claim that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance at the punishment phase. The district court rejected Hood\u2019s constructive ineffective assistance argument, in which he contended that the trial court\u2019s order rendered counsel\u2019s representation ineffective. The district court held that its conclusion that any <em>Ake </em>error was harmless precluded a determination that a deficiency in counsel\u2019s performance precipitated by the court\u2019s order was prejudicial under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court also rejected Hood\u2019s contention that counsel should have done more to preserve the right to an independent, confidential psychiatric expert. The district court found that as counsel had twice moved unsuccessfully for appointment of such an expert, their performance was not deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The district court nevertheless found that trial counsel\u2019s misreading of the trial court\u2019s order, and the incorrect advice given Hood based on the misreading, constituted deficient performance. The court added, however, that even if counsel had correctly read the order and advised Hood not to submit to Dr. Brooks\u2019s evaluation, the only remaining options for counsel were either to have Hood submit to a joint interview by psychiatrists for the state and defense, or to forgo any expert psychiatric assistance entirely. Thus, the district court held that because Hood failed to demonstrate that there was a probability that his sentencing would have been different but for counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the remaining alternatives, he failed to establish <em>Strickland </em>prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Regarding mitigation evidence, the district court rejected the contention that counsel\u2019s failure to communicate directly with Hood resulted in a failure to recognize the need to obtain additional medical testing and an additional expert and, therefore, constituted ineffective assistance. The district court found that the opinion Hood claimed might have been obtained from an additional expert - that his mental impairments contributed to his behavior - was already contained in Dr. Brooks\u2019s report. The district court identified the \u201creal problem\u201d as the trial court\u2019s failure to order Dr. Brooks, and Brooks\u2019s own refusal, to assist defense counsel in preparing and presenting their case in mitigation. The court reasoned that, because counsel should not have had to pursue an additional expert, the failure to do so did not constitute deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The district court determined, however, that counsel\u2019s decision to use his legal assistant, Ms. Heitmiller, to investigate Hood\u2019s background concerning issues of mitigation was deficient performance. This was because Ms. Heitmiller was not qualified to conduct such an investigation, and counsel had readily available the services of a trained, court-appointed investigator. The district court noted the following new mitigation evidence that was gathered post-trial: (1) Hood\u2019s family moved often because of financial and legal trouble; his father served jail time for theft, made no financial contribution to the family, and was under investigation for incest; (2) Hood\u2019s mother was raised in an abusive home and consequently was unemotional to her children and denied or tolerated her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>husband\u2019s abuse of Hood and his siblings; (3) Hood\u2019s father verbally and physically abused him; (4) Hood\u2019s parents sent him conflicting signals on moral issues; (5) Hood suffered brain damage at age three after being hit by a truck, impairing his intellectual and emotional development; (6) Hood was ridiculed by classmates because of his intellectual impairment; and (7) Hood manifested emotional and behavioral problems at a young age, and they appeared to worsen over time. Although it labeled this \u201ca close question,\u201d the district court nevertheless determined that there was not a reasonable probability that a juror would have voted against the death penalty in Hood\u2019s case and, therefore, that he had not shown <em>Strickland </em>prejudice. The district court based this determination on a comparison of Hood\u2019s facts with those of the petitioner in <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), finding that the cases were similar but concluding that Williams\u2019s demonstration of remorse after his crimes \u201crendered him more worthy of mercy\u201d than Hood. The court thus found that there was no likelihood that Hood\u2019s jury would have been swayed by the mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Hood\u2019s final ineffective assistance claim \u2014 that counsel was ineffective for not presenting the above-mentioned mitigating evidence to Dr. Brooks \u2014 was also rejected by the district court. It determined that even if counsel had performed competently by showing Dr. Brooks the mitigating evidence, there was still no reasonable probability that the result of the penalty-phase proceedings would have been different. The court so concluded because the trial judge\u2019s order did not direct Dr. Brooks to provide such assistance, and Dr. Brooks acted in conformity with what he believed the order required, <em>i.e. </em>an impartial psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Finally, the district court rejected Hood\u2019s contention that the cumulative effect of his trial errors rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. The district court found that the combination of the trial court\u2019s <em>Ake </em>error in not ordering Dr. Brooks to assist the defense on the issue of Hood\u2019s future dangerousness, and of counsel\u2019s failure to present more extensive evidence in mitigation, did not have a substantial or injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. The district court based this determination on \u201cthe very strong non-psychiatric evidence of future dangerousness, the double-edged nature of the mitigating evidence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Hood\u2019s lack of either remorse or rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Hood\u2019s petition for habeas relief. Hood filed a timely notice of appeal and moved to amend the judgment and, alternatively, for a new trial. He also moved for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The district court granted Hood a COA on the following issues: (1) Whether Hood\u2019s counsel\u2019s misreading of the trial court\u2019s order regarding the psychiatrist examination, and delegating to an untrained legal assistant the investigation into potential mitigating evidence, created a reasonable probability that the result of his punishment hearing would have been different had counsel\u2019s performance been adequate, and (2) whether the combination of the violations of Hood\u2019s rights under <em>Ake </em>and his counsel\u2019s deficient performance had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s decision, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. COA was denied on all other claims, and the district court denied Hood\u2019s post-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We may not grant a COA unless the applicant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cThe COA determination under \u00a7 2253(e) requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We look to the district court\u2019s application of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) to the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and asks whether the district court\u2019s resolution of those claims was debatable among jurists of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">ISSUE 1: <em>Whether the district court misapplied the </em>Brecht <em>harmless error standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Hood argues that in reviewing the harmlessness of the trial errors, the district court used the wrong standard when it assessed whether there was a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d that the result of the punishment phase would have been different but for the errors. Relying on <em>Brecht </em>and <em>Woods v. Johnson, </em>75 F.3d 1017, 1027 (5th Cir.1996), Hood contends that the district court was required to ask instead whether there was \u201c\u2018more than a mere possibility\u2019 \u201d that the error contributed to the verdict. Noting that the district court found the issue whether the penalty proceedings would have been different a \u201c \u2018close question,\u2019 \u201d Hood argues that he is entitled to relief under the \u201cmore than a mere possibility\u201d standard. He further contends that under the \u201cmore than a mere possibility\u201d standard, the cumulative impact of the trial errors requires a finding of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\"><em>Brecht </em>held that constitutional errors that do not require automatic reversal would be assessed on collateral review under the harmless error standard set forth in <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). 507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Under that standard, the error must have \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d for the petitioner to obtain habeas relief. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Woods, </em>we reasoned that, under <em>Brecht, </em>a defendant is not entitled to relief \u201cunless there is <em>more </em>than a mere reasonable possibility that [the constitutional trial error] contributed to the verdict.\u201d 75 F.3d at 1026. We noted further that the <em>Brecht </em>standard does not require the petitioner to prove by the more demanding \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard that, absent the error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 1027 (citing <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 436, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995)); <em>see also Barrientes v. Johnson, </em>221 F.3d 741, 756 (5th Cir.2000) (noting that the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard is more demanding than the <em>Brecht </em>harmless error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Hood asserts that the district court erroneously held him to the more demanding \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard when it (1) evaluated the harmlessness of the <em>Ake </em>errors, (2) evaluated the prejudice prong of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and (3) evaluated the effect of the cumulative error. The record, however, does not support Hood\u2019s assertion that the district court applied the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard when evaluating the <em>Ake </em>claims. Based on its summary of the non-psychiatric evidence of Hood\u2019s future dangerousness, the district court held that Hood\u2019s future dangerousness would have been a foregone conclusion in the mind of the jury, so that any <em>Ake </em>error was harmless. Further, the district court correctly identified the <em>Brecht </em>standard, and no where in this portion of its opinion does the court use the words \u201creasonable probability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Additionally, the <em>Brecht </em>standard was inapplicable to Hood\u2019s ineffective assistance claims. Instead, the district court was required to evaluate whether \u201cthere [was] a <em>reasonable probability </em>that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added). The court thus applied the appropriate standard when determining whether counsel\u2019s errors were prejudicial. The district court concluded that there was not a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result of Hood\u2019s penalty proceeding would have been different. <em>See also Barrientes, </em>221 F.3d at 756 (noting that <em>\u201cStrickland </em>claims utilize the more demanding \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Finally, the district court reviewed Hood\u2019s claim of cumulative error under the <em>Brecht </em>standard and determined that counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the psychiatric and the mitigating evidence would not have substantially or injuriously influenced the verdict. There is no support in the record for Hood\u2019s contention that the district court applied the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Based on the foregoing arguments, Hood has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s resolution of these constitutional claims was debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">ISSUE 2: <em>Whether the district court erroneously evaluated the </em>Ake <em>errors under the harmless error standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Hood insists that the district court erroneously classified the <em>Ake </em>errors as \u201ctrial\u201d errors (which are properly evaluated under the harmless error standard), when the errors were in fact \u201cstructural\u201d and, therefore, required automatic reversal. Relying on our decision in <em>White, </em>Hood contends that a defendant who makes a showing that his mental condition could have been a significant mitigating factor and then suffers an <em>Ake </em>error has suffered a structural error. He further notes that the TCCA has held that <em>Ake </em>error is not subject to a harmless error analysis and, further, that in <em>Ake, </em>the Supreme Court reversed and remanded without conducting a harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Whether a constitutional error is reviewed for harmless error depends on whether the error is characterized as \u201ctrial error\u201d or \u201cstructural error.\u201d <em>White, </em>153 F.3d at 201. \u201cTrial error\u201d occurs during the presentation of the case and is subject to a harmless error analysis because \u201cit \u2018may ... be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine [the effect it had on the trial].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 629, 113 S.Ct. 1710). \u201cStructural error,\u201d however, \u201c \u2018affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself\u201d and is therefore not subject to the harmless error analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 201-02 (quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">In <em>Ake, </em>the Supreme Court held in relevant part that when the state presents psychiatric evidence on the issue of a capital defendant\u2019s future dangerousness for purposes of establishing an aggravating factor to be considered at sentencing, due process requires that the defendant be afforded access to a psychiatric examination on relevant issues, to psychiatric testimony, and to assistance in preparation at the penalty phase. 470 U.S. at 83-84, 105 S.Ct. 1087. After determining that Ake suffered due process violations when he was denied the assistance of a psychiatrist, the Court reversed and remanded for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 105 S.Ct. 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">The Court has never held definitively, however, that <em>Ake </em>error is structural. <em>See Briseno v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 204, 210-11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>(5th Cir.2001) (recognizing same). Indeed, in <em>Tuggle v. Netherland, </em>516 U.S. 10, 14, 116 S.Ct. 283, 133 L.Ed.2d 251 (1995), the Court remanded for a determination \u201cwhether, or by what procedures, the sentence might be sustained or reimposed\u201d in light of an <em>Ake </em>error, specifically noting that neither the state court nor the Court of Appeals had addressed the applicability of the harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">A federal habeas petitioner must establish that he is entitled to relief under \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 381, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Consequently, the absence of Supreme Court authority on this issue, in addition to the fact that the district court\u2019s use of the harmless error analysis was not inconsistent with other Supreme Court precedent, precludes a finding that the district court\u2019s resolution of the constitutional claim was debatable. <em>Cf. Ledford v. Thomas, </em>275 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2001) (absence of Supreme Court precedent on point precluded finding that state court\u2019s adjudication involved an unreasonable application of federal law), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 927, 122 S.Ct. 2599, 153 L.Ed.2d 786 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Furthermore, because relief must be established under federal law, Hood\u2019s contention based on <em>Rey v. State, </em>897 S.W.2d 333, 346 (Tex.Crim.App.1995) (holding that <em>Ake </em>error cannot be evaluated for harm), that the TCCA has held <em>Ake </em>error to be structural, is irrelevant. Citing the absence of an explicit statement from the Supreme Court on this issue, we have concluded that Rey\u2019s holding has been overruled by <em>Cain v. State, </em>947 S.W.2d 262, 264 (Tex.Crim.App.1997),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which held that \u201c[ejxcept for certain federal constitutional errors <em>labeled by the United States Supreme Court as \u2018structural, \u2019 </em>no error ... is categorically immune to a harmless error analysis.\u201d <em>Briseno, </em>274 F.3d at 210-11 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>Cain, </em>947 S.W.2d at 264) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Finally, we have squarely addressed this issue and have held that <em>Ake </em>errors are subject to harmless error review. <em>White, </em>153 F.3d at 201 (\u201cThree other circuits have expressly concluded that <em>Ake </em>error is subject to harmless-error analysis, and we now join them.\u201d). Hood urges that <em>White </em>limited the application of harmless error review to cases in which a defendant failed to make a showing that his mental condition could have been a significant mitigating factor, leaving unanswered the question whether a defendant who makes a proper showing and then suffers an <em>Ake </em>violation has suffered a \u201ctrial\u201d or \u201cstructural\u201d error. Hood reads <em>White </em>too narrowly; but even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that <em>White </em>did not foreclose a determination that <em>Ake </em>error is structural when a defendant has established to the state trial court that his mental condition could have been a significant mitigating factor, Hood failed to make such a showing. Like White, Hood argued that he was entitled to the appointment of a psychiatrist only because the State intended to present its own psychiatric testimony; he made no showing that he was entitled to a psychiatrist on any other basis. <em>White, </em>153 F.3d at 204. <em>White </em>held such a showing insufficient to establish that any purported <em>Ake </em>error was structural. <em>See White, </em>153 F.3d at 203-04 (holding that showing of an entitlement to psychiatric assistance on the sole basis that the State intended to present expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>testimony was subject only to harmless error review.).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In light of the foregoing, Hood has not demonstrated an entitlement to a COA on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">ISSUES 3-8: <em>Whether the specified </em>Ake <em>errors require automatic reversal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Hood does not brief issues three through eight; he instead states that each is premised on his contention that the district court erroneously evaluated the <em>Ake </em>error under the harmless error standard. As just noted, however, Hood has not demonstrated that the propriety of the district court\u2019s application of the harmless error standard is debatable. Therefore, he has also failed to demonstrate entitlement to a COA on issues three through eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">ISSUE 9: <em>Whether the trial court, by forcing Hood to elect between his constitutional rights, created a constructive ineffective assistance of counsel requiring automatic reversal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Hood contends that the state trial court\u2019s order appointing a psychiatrist assured that defense counsel\u2019s assistance would be ineffective. He argues that the alternatives provided defeated the adversarial nature of the proceedings, inasmuch as the common thread to each alternative was that the State would receive full disclosure. Hood asserts that the district court\u2019s determination that he established no <em>Strickland </em>prejudice as a result of this error was based on the court\u2019s erroneous determination that the <em>Ake </em>errors were harmless trial errors rather than structural errors and, therefore, that he is necessarily entitled to a COA on this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">As a prefatory matter, we note that the issue whether Hood exhausted his \u201cconstructive\u201d ineffective assistance claim was raised in the district court. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Hood contended that \u201cthe facts and argument set forth in this Claim were presented to the State habeas court as part of Claims 1 and 2.\u201d The State argues, however, that Hood presented this claim for the first time in his federal habeas proceedings and that it was therefore procedurally barred. The district court did not address the State\u2019s procedural bar contention, instead disposing of the claim on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">A review of the state habeas application reveals that this \u201cconstructive\u201d ineffective assistance claim was not raised and therefore was not exhausted. <em>See Nobles v. Johnson, </em>127 F.3d 409, 420 (5th Cir.1997) (exhaustion requirement is not met merely because the facts necessary to support the federal claim were before the state court). When a claim is unexhausted and therefore procedurally barred, however, it may nevertheless be denied on the merits. <em>Smith v. Cockrell, </em>311 F.3d 661, 684 (5th Cir.2002). Hood would be precluded from raising his \u201cconstructive\u201d ineffective assistance claim in the state courts under Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ doctrine, because he has cited no cause for his failure to raise this claim in his state habeas application. It is therefore procedurally barred. <em>See Nobles, </em>127 F.3d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">Notwithstanding the applicability of procedural bar, however, we find that this claim fails on its merits, because it hinges on Hood\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a COA on the issue whether <em>Ake </em>errors are structural. As previously discussed, in the absence of clearly established Supreme Court law holding that <em>Ake </em>errors are structural, Hood cannot demonstrate an entitlement to a COA on that issue. Therefore, he is not entitled to a COA on his constructive ineffective assistance claim. In addition, <em>White </em>supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>district court\u2019s determination that, because the <em>Ake </em>error was harmless, Hood was precluded from establishing <em>Strickland </em>prejudice. <em>See </em>153 F.3d at 208; R. 2, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Hood has not established an entitlement to a COA on any of the issues raised herein, and, therefore, his motion to expand the COA grant is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-13\">. Hood does not brief issues 3-8, stating that they are premised on the contention set forth in Issue 2, that the <em>Ake </em>errors were structural, requiring automatic reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-14\">. At the time of Hood's offense, Texas law provided that to impose the death penalty, the jury had to make an affirmative finding that, <em>inter alia, </em>\"there [was] a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d TexCrim. Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 37.071(b)(2) (Vernon 1981 &amp; Supp.2003) (Historical and Statutory Notes). The jury was further instructed that in answering the special issues, it should consider any evidence that mitigated against imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\">. Only those claims that he chose to raise in his \u00a7 2254 petition are listed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">. On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the fact that Hood did not exercise the option afforded him by the trial court of having a psychiatrist of his own choosing that would report solely to him meant that he had waived his appellate complaint that he was denied an independent psychiatrist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b202-15\">. The district court noted Heitmiller\u2019s attestation that counsel instructed her to tell Hood not to answer any questions posed by Dr. Brooks about the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">. Although not relevant to the resolution of the instant motion to expand the COA grant, we nevertheless note that in interviews with Hood\u2019s habeas counsel, trial counsel stated that they saw both alternatives offered in the trial court\u2019s order as constitutionally impermissible and because they did not want to waive Hood's Fifth Amendment rights, they made a purposeful decision to make no election between the options offered by the trial court. Moreover, defense co-counsel Parker\u2019s affidavit states, \"The options provided by the Court, after being analyzed by Mr. Haynes and myself, were found to be options that in my opinion at the time only made Mr. Hood\u2019s situation worse if he were to exercise either option.\u201d These statements cast serious doubt on the district court\u2019s factual finding that counsel misread or misunderstood the order by reading only its first paragraph and, therefore, erroneously believed that Hood had to submit to an examination by Brooks. It is further noteworthy that habeas counsel did not argue that trial counsel (or Dr. Brooks or the court coordinator) misunderstood the order; counsel instead argued that Ms. Heitmiller erroneously informed Hood that he had to submit to the interview because the trial court had so ordered and that, for purposes of ineffective assistance, her actions were imputable to trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\">. The district court additionally found that Dr. Brooks had violated <em>Ake </em>by not delving into mitigation issues and by not providing assistance to prepare a mitigation defense; however, the court noted that Hood\u2019s <em>Ake </em>claim did not encompass the mitigation issue, and therefore refused to address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">. The district court recognized that the mitigating evidence of Hood\u2019s mental impairment would be a \"double-edged sword,\u201d because, despite reducing his moral culpability, it also would have increased the probability of his future dangerousness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\">. <em>Cain </em>was superseded by statute on other grounds by <em>Aguirre-Mata v.
