For the first time on appeal, Cervantes-Sarmiento argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case because it treats a prior conviction for a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not as an element of the offense. He contends that the unconstitutional portion of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 should be severed from the statute. He asks us to vacate his conviction and sentence, reform the judgment to reflect a conviction only under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and remand his case for resentencing under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47. Cervantes-Sarmiento acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been called into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the district court did not err in sentencing Cervantes-Sarmiento under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b982-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that his opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
