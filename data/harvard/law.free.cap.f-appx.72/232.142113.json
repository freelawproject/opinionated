Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000); <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000); and <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), Pena argues, for the first time on appeal, that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) can no longer constitutionally be construed to cover the intrastate possession of a firearm merely due to the fact that it traveled across state lines at some point in the past. Accordingly, Pena argues that the factual basis supporting his guilty plea, which established that the firearms he possessed in Texas were manufactured in another state or foreign country, was insufficient to establish the interstate commerce element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-23\">Pena raises his argument solely to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. As he acknowledges, his argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>is foreclosed by existing Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Cavazos, </em>288 F.3d 706, 712 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 910, 123 S.Ct. 253, 154 L.Ed.2d 189 (2002); <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1150, 122 S.Ct. 1113, 151 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2002); <em>United States v. Gresham, </em>118 F.3d 258, 264-65 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Kuban, </em>94 F.3d 971, 973 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242-43 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Because Pena\u2019s argument is foreclosed, the Government has moved for a summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment. The motion is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
