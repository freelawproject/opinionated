R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). They first contend that disqualification of the district judge was mandated because he was a member of the State Bar of Texas, a defendant. A district judge, however, does not have a substantial interest in the success of a suit simply because of his identification with a defendant bar association. <em>See Parrish v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Alabama State Bar, </em>524 F.2d 98, 104 (5th Cir.1975). The refusal to recuse was therefore not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Trevino v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 173, 178 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-21\">Furthermore, the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal was not erroneous. To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>allege, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity,\u201d demonstrating that at least two predicate acts of racketeering are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. <em>Tel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 1134, 1139-40 (5th Cir.1992). The Fosters complaint alleges only a closed-ended scheme to deprive them of their property rights. RICO, however, is not concerned with short-term criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1140. \u201cPredicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy [the continuity] requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
