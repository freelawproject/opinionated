Having carefully reviewed the record and Reese\u2019s arguments on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s findings, which are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Eckerson, </em>299 F.3d 913, 914 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (standard of review). The Bureau of Prisons offered uncontradicted written reports and hearing testimony of the Rochester Federal Medical Center\u2019s Chief of Psychiatry, who had treated Reese extensively over a considerable period of time, and thereby met its burden of proof concerning Reese\u2019s need for treatment in a suitable facility. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(d) (preponderance-of-evidence burden of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-20\">We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-32\">.
