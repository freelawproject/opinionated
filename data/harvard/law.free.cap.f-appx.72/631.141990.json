To make this determination, the Social Security Administration will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">...  evaluate which of [the claimant\u2019s] current physical and mental limitations ... would remain if [the claimant] stopped using drugs or alcohol and then [2] determine whether any or all of [the claimant\u2019s] remaining limitations would be disabling.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The claimant bears the burden of proving that her alcoholism or drug addiction is not a contributing factor material to the finding of disability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\n<em>Ingram\u2019s Severe Impairments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">A social security claimant may present three types of medical opinions to support her claim of disability: (1) opinions of those who treat the claimant (treating sources); (2) opinions of those who examine but do not treat the claimant (examining sources); and (3) opinions of those who neither examine nor treat the claimant (consulting or nonexamining sources).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ingram offered evidence from treating substance abuse counselors and evidence from three examining physicians: (1) Dr. Kent Reade, M.D., (2) Dr. Alan Breen, Ph.D., and (3) Dr. Richard Washburn, Ph.D. The Commissioner offered the report of Dr. Hugh Murray, M.D., a Department of Disability Services consultant who never examined or treated Ingram.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">The opinion of an examining physician is entitled to greater weight than the opinion of a nonexamining physician.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commissioner must provide \u201cclear and convincing reasons\u201d for rejecting the uncontradicted opinion of an examining or treating physician.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If contradicted by another doctor, the opinion of a treating or examining physician can only be rejected for specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Lastly, the opinion of a nonexamining physician cannot, by itself, constitute substantial evidence that justifies the rejection of the opinion of either an examining or treating physician.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">At step two of the five-step sequential process, the Commissioner was required to identify Ingram\u2019s \u201csevere impairments.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> An impairment, or combination of impairments, is severe if the condition(s) \u201csignificantly limit [one\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) considering Ingram\u2019s case identified her severe impairments as a personality disorder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a substance abuse disorder. Although Ingram has had \u201cother symptoms or conditions from time to time,\u201d the ALJ concluded that because those conditions were transient and did not result in significant limitations they were not severe.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Commissioner applied the wrong legal standards for identifying Ingram\u2019s severe impairments. The examining physicians\u2019 opinions indicate that Ingram suffers from dysthymia (a form of depression) and a panic disorder, both of which have a significant impact on her ability to work. Dr. Richard Washburn diagnosed Ingram with \u201cdisabling\u201d depression, and his opinion is substantiated by the notes of her treating counselors. No other physician indicated that Ingram either does not suffer from depression or that her depression is mild or has no significant impact on her ability to work.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commissioner failed to provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Dr. Washburn\u2019s diagnosis, and that rejection is utterly without support in the record. Additionally, Dr. Reade diagnosed Ingram with a panic disorder <em>and </em>residual PTSD. Although Dr. Washburn did not diagnose Ingram with a panic disorder distinct from PTSD, the opinion of examining physician Dr. Reade can only be rejected for specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Commissioner failed to give specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the panic disorder diagnosis, and the record does not suggest any legitimate reasons exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In drug and alcohol addiction cases, the question is whether the claimant would be still disabled if not dependent on drugs or alcohol. Thus, each and every impairment must be considered to determine if the combination of the remaining impairments is severe.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If a severe impairment is omitted at step two, it is impossible to perform the proper analysis for differentiating the effects of DAA from the effects of a claimant\u2019s other impairments. As the ALJ did not identify Ingram\u2019s dysthymia or panic disorder as severe impairments, he necessarily did not fully consider the effects of the combination of Ingram\u2019s severe impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The Commissioner erred by excluding Dr. Washburn\u2019s diagnosis of depression and Dr. Reade\u2019s diagnosis of a panic disorder from his step-two analysis of Ingram\u2019s \u201csevere impairments\u201d without providing specific, legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record. We find that the record fully supports a finding that Ingram suffers from depression and a panic disorder and that both disorders have more than a de minimus effect on her ability to work. There is no evidence to the contrary, and the Commissioner should have considered whether these disorders would persist if Ingram stopped using drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">\n<em>Error in Differentiating the Effects of DAA from Ingram\u2019s Other Impairments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The Commissioner also erred when separating the disabling effects of Ingram\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>DAA from the disabling effects of her other impairments. The first step in performing differentiating analysis in DAA cases is to determine which impairments would remain if the claimant stopped using drugs or alcohol.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Error in identifying a claimant\u2019s severe impairments necessarily corrupts the differentiating analysis because the Commissioner cannot consider whether each of the claimant\u2019s severe impairments would persist if she stopped using drugs or alcohol.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">If the testimony of the examining sources is properly credited, the record compels the conclusion that Ingram\u2019s PTSD, panic disorder, and personality disorder would persist if she stopped using alcohol or drugs.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Dr. Washburn examined Ingram when she had been sober for six weeks and concluded that she will continue to suffer from personality disorder and PTSD even if she receives treatment for her substance abuse.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Dr. Reade, who examined Ingram when she had been sober for 35 days, diagnosed her with drug and alcohol addiction in recent remission. Nevertheless, he concluded that her ability to respond appropriately and tolerate the pressures and expectations of a normal work setting was severely limited as a result of her anxiety, which Dr. Washburn indicated would not abate without targeted treatment. Dr. Reade rated Ingram\u2019s global illness as severe and indicated that her limitations were exacerbated but not caused by DAA, and thus would not necessarily dissipate after an extended period of sobriety. These findings directly contradict the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Ingram would only experience moderate limitations on her ability to deal with the public if she stopped using alcohol and drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Rather than address these opinions, the Commissioner searched the record for isolated statements which, when taken out of context, suggest that Ingram\u2019s DAA is material to her disability. For instance, the ALJ cited Dr. Washburn\u2019s report as evidence of Ingram\u2019s ability to work during periods of sobriety. That statement in Dr. Washburn\u2019s report, however, refers to Ingram\u2019s ability to work before she was brutally assaulted in Denver, Colorado-the event that triggered the onset of her PTSD. There is no evidence in the record that Ingram suffered from PTSD when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>she was able to work or that DAA is material to Ingram\u2019s PTSD.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Additionally, the ALJ emphasized the statements in the medical reports that demonstrate that Ingram has a tendency to relapse and under-report her substance abuse. This is evidence of Ingram\u2019s chemical dependency, but it is not evidence that her other impairments are not disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The ALJ also misrepresented the report of Dr. Breen. Pursuant to a referral by the Social Security Administration, Dr. Breen, unlike Dr. Washburn, only tested Ingram\u2019s memory and intelligence. Dr. Breen reported that those tests provided him with inadequate information with which to fully diagnose Ingram, and he felt it necessary to rule out depression/dysthymia, general anxiety disorder, PTSD, and a panic disorder as severe impairments. The ALJ acknowledged Dr. Breen\u2019s inability to fully diagnose Ingram, but stated that Dr. Breen found \u201cno striking evidence of impairment\u201d without clarifying that he only tested Ingram\u2019s memory and intelligence or that Dr. Breen suspected that Ingram suffered from myriad mental illnesses (a suspicion that independent clinical testing by Dr. Washburn confirmed).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Moreover, while Dr. Breen opined that Ingram\u2019s alcoholism contributed to her problems, this is not substantial evidence of the materiality of DAA. First, Dr. Breen was completely unable to assess whether Ingram would still be disabled if she stopped abusing alcohol because he was unable to diagnose the panoply of her impairments without further testing. Second, drug addiction and alcoholism inevitably contribute to other mental impairments, but that does not establish or even imply materiality, particularly where the examining physician was unable to make any firm diagnoses other than alcoholism.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> No reasonable mind considering the record as a whole would conclude Dr. Breen\u2019s report is evidence of the materiality of DAA to Ingram\u2019s limitations resulting from Ingram\u2019s other impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Similarly, no reasonable mind considering the record as a whole would conclude that Dr. Murray\u2019s report is substantial evidence of the materiality of DAA to Ingram\u2019s disability. Dr. Murray, who considered Ingram\u2019s medical records before any clinical testing was done to diagnose her mental impairments,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> concluded that if she were not addicted to drugs and alcohol she would experience only moderate limitations on her ability to deal with the public. The Commissioner credited this opinion and determined Ingram would not be prevented from engaging in substantial gainful activity were it not for DAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">It was legal error for the Commissioner to credit the opinion of non-examining physician Murray over the opinions of examining physicians Reade and Washburn. Moreover, the Commissioner failed to consider that Dr. Murray did not have the benefit Dr. Washburn\u2019s clinical testing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>diagnoses when preparing his report. Dr. Murray specifically stated in his report that the evidence he considered was insufficient to make a diagnosis or assess Ingram\u2019s abilities, and that the effects of Ingram\u2019s withdrawal from alcohol could not be conclusively distinguish from the effects of her other impairments, which he could only estimate. His speculations and estimations based upon incomplete medical testing are not substantial evidence of the materiality of DAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Viewing Dr. Murray\u2019s report in the context of the complete record, it is abundantly clear that the Commissioner erroneously credited his opinion over the opinions of examining physicians Drs. Reade and Washburn. If the examining physicians\u2019 opinions are properly credited, particularly the opinion of Dr. Washburn that Ingram will continue to suffer from disabling PTSD and personality disorder even if her substance abuse is successfully treated, there is no question that Ingram is entitled to SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">After examining the record as a whole and weighing the evidence that both supports and detracts from the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we conclude that the Commissioner improperly credited the testimony of a non-examining physician over the testimony of examining physicians. The Commissioner made no attempt to distinguished between the substance abuse contributing to the disability and the disability remaining after Ingram stopped using drugs and alcohol,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> as is evidenced by the utter lack of findings in this regard. The record as a whole compels the conclusion that Ingram would still be disabled if she did not suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">We have discretion to remand social security cases for additional evidence and findings or to award benefits.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We choose the latter course in this case because once the examining physicians\u2019 testimony is properly credited, particularly the testimony of Dr. Washburn, the record establishes that Ingram is entitled to benefits as a matter of law. Further proceedings would serve no useful purpose.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Social Security Administration and order the Commissioner to retroactively reinstate Ingram\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b658-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.

In contrast, the record does not compel the conclusion that Ingram\u2019s dysthymia would persist if she stopped using alcohol or drugs. Dr. Washburn did not specifically state that Ingram\u2019s dysthymia would not resolve even if she were successfully treated for DAA. Nevertheless, the ALJ should have identified dysthymia as a severe impairment and considered whether it would persist if Ingram stopped using alcohol or drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b662-11\">. Although the Social Security Administration\u2019s Program Operation Manual System (POMS) lacks the force of law, <em>see Christensen v.
