We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition de novo. <em>Angulo-Dominguez v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">In 1994, an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found Agadaga deportable for overstaying his student visa, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed. Agadaga petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s order, contending that the IJ erred by failing to inform him that he may have been eligible for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) based on the extreme hardship his deportation would cause his children who are U.S. citizens. This court denied Agadaga\u2019s petition because Agadaga could benefit from relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) only if he were eligible for an adjustment of status, which he was not. <em>Agadaga v. INS, </em>No. 95-70594, 1997 WL 334991 (9th Cir. June 12,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-22\">To the extent Agadaga\u2019s habeas petition raises the same contention he raised on direct review \u2014 that the IJ should have told him to apply for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) \u2014 the district court did not have jurisdiction over the claim. <em>Cfi Flores-Miramontes v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1133, 1143 (9th Cir.2000) (district court retains habeas corpus jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 where 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1252(a)(2) bars filing a petition for review; \u201c[i]f, however, the bar does not apply and a petition for review is the appropriate procedure for resolving the issue, the petition must be heard in the court of appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-23\">Agadaga\u2019s equal protection contention is unpersuasive because he has not shown that other petitioners ineligible for adjustment of status due to a visa overstay nevertheless obtained relief from deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). <em>See Freeman v. City of Santa Ana, </em>68 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b721-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
