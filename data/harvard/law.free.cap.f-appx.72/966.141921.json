Concluding that McCree failed to exhaust his administrative remedies through the grievance procedures at the Brownfield facility, the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The court further noted that \u201cto the extent Plaintiff is seeking damages for injuries resulting from his alleged slip and fall, Section 1983 is not a general tort statute and a claim of negligence will not support a federal civil rights action.\u201d The court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-18\">Although he discusses why he believes his civil rights were violated, McCree makes no argument concerning the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. An appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument on the issues that are raised so that this court may know what action of the district court is being complained of. <em>Al-Ra\u2019id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 31 (5th Cir.1995). There is no exemption for <em>pro se </em>litigants, although this court liberally construes their briefs. <em>Id. </em>Because McCree has briefed no argument with respect to the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to exhaust administrative remedies, he has waived any such argument. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). We need not address the court\u2019s alternative basis for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-19\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. MeCree\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
