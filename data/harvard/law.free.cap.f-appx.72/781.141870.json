R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s order upholding the denial of his application for social security disability and supplemental security income benefits. Plaintiff was born in 1952 and has a high school graduation equivalency diploma (GED). His past relevant work experience has included delivery driver, mechanic, and combination mechanic and welder, all described as medium to heavy, semiskilled and skilled work. Plaintiff claimed disability as of March 15, 1998, due to a bulging lumbar disc, mid-level back pain, and arthritis in his neck. Following a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied benefits at step five of the review process. <em>See Williams v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 748, 750-52 (10th Cir.1988) (discussing sequential evaluation process).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">Plaintiff claims the ALJ erred (1) in finding plaintiff retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform light work and (2) in failing to accord proper weight to the opinion of plaintiffs treating physician and substituting his (the ALJ\u2019s) medical opinion for that of the treating physician. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">We review the agency\u2019s decision \u201cto determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Doyal v. Barnhart, </em>331 F.3d 758, 760 (10th Cir.2003). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). However, \u201c[a] decision is not based on substantial evidence if it is overwhelmed by other evidence in the record or if there is a mere scintilla of evidence supporting it.\u201d <em>Bernal v. Bowen, </em>851 F.2d 297, 299 (10th Cir.1988). In addition, the agency\u2019s failure to either apply correct legal standards, or show us it has done so, is also grounds for reversal. <em>Winfrey v. Chater, </em>92 F.3d 1017, 1019 (10th Cir.1996). Finally, because evidence substantiality is based on the record taken as a whole, we will meticulously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>examine the record in order to determine if the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s decision is substantial, taking into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight. <em>Washington v. Shalala, </em>37 F.3d 1437, 1439 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Sequential Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In determining at step two that plaintiff has a severe impairment, the ALJ determined that the record evidence \u201csupports a finding that the claimant has chronic lower back pain and neck pain secondary to degenerative changes in the spine and herniated discs at L3-4, L4-5, L5-S1 with radiculopathy to the right leg,\u201d causing \u201csignificant vocationally relevant limitations.\u201d ApltApp. at 33. The ALJ determined at step three that plaintiffs impairments did not meet any of the listed impairments described in Appendix I of the Regulations (20 C.F.R., pt. 404, subpart P, app. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">At step four, the ALJ considered plaintiffs RFC, \u201ca term which describes the range of work activities the claimant can perform despite his impairments.\u201d Aplt. App. at 35. As part of this evaluation process, the ALJ recognized his obligation to consider subjective allegations, and to give careful consideration to the location, duration, frequency, and intensity of pain or other symptoms; precipitating and aggravating factors; type, dosage, effectiveness and side effects of medication; treatment, other than medication, for pain relief; functional restrictions; and plaintiffs daily activities. <em>Id. See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529(c)(3); 416.929(c)(3) (also listing any measures used to relieve pain or other symptoms). It is not enough, however, for the ALJ simply to recite the factors described in the regulations. Instead, the determination \u201cmust contain specific reasons for the finding on credibility, supported by the evidence in the case record\u201d and be \u201csufficiently specific\u201d to inform subsequent reviewers of both the weight the ALJ gave to a claimant\u2019s statements and the reasons for that weight. SSR 96-7p, 1996 WL 374186 at *4 (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Pain Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Here, the ALJ concluded there were \u201cminimal objective medical findings substantiating the claimant\u2019s subjective allegations to the extent alleged.\u201d Aplt.App. at 35. Specifically, the ALJ referred to an orthopedic consultation, which discusses an MRI finding showing some mild degenerative disc disease, but not reflecting compression pathology causing the radicular complaints as alleged by plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 36; 295. That same report, however, notes that plaintiff reported low back pain into the buttocks and both lower extremities, and that physical therapy had increased his back and leg pain. <em>Id. </em>at 295. Moreover, as noted by the ALJ, this MRI also showed a moderate-sized left lateral extrusion at L3-4 and minimum central extrusion of disc at the L4-5, L5-S1 disc space. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The radiology report also states that \u201cexiting left sided L3 nerve root compression could not be totally excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. In addition, plaintiffs treating physician (Dr. Wills) referred to this MRI as indicating \u201cpossible L3 nerve root compression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38,240.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Dr. Wills also noted the presence of \u201ccalcification of the cervical or dorsolumbar anterior and lateral ligaments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 239, herniated nucleus pulposis, <em>id. </em>at 240, muscle spasms, <em>id. </em>at 241, and resulting pain as evidenced by an elevation in plaintiffs blood pressure and pulse rate. <em>Id. </em>at 241. It is further undisputed that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>takes a muscle relaxant and two different pain killers on a daily basis. <em>Id. </em>at 124. He has consistently reported back pain to his treating physician, physical therapists, and others on a regular basis. <em>Id. </em>at 249, 251-256, 271, 275, 283-284, 295-308, 317. <em>See </em>SSR 96-7p, 1996 WL 374186 at *5-6 (noting that consistency of a claimant\u2019s statements, particularly statements made to treating or examining medical sources and other sources outlined in regulations, provides strong indication of individual\u2019s credibility). At one point, his physical therapist advised plaintiff to stop his exercises until the pain decreased. Aplt. App. at 300. Plaintiff has also reported his prescribed pain medication as not working. <em>Id. </em>at 254. There is no suggestion in any of the medical reports that plaintiff was exaggerating his symptoms. Although the ALJ mentioned some of this medical evidence, he nonetheless summarily concluded that plaintiff\u2019s \u201csubjective allegations appear exaggerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">In evaluating plaintiff\u2019s subjective claims of pain, an ALJ\u2019s findings on credibility \u201cshould be closely and affirmatively linked to substantial evidence and not just a conclusion in the guise of findings.\u201d <em>Kepler v. Chater, </em>68 F.3d 387, 391 (10th Cir.1995) (quotation omitted). In this case, we have only the conclusion that plaintiff was exaggerating his allegations without the requisite link to substantial evidence. Aplt. App. at 36. Having faded to properly assess plaintiffs credibility, in part by not giving \u201cspecific reasons for the weight given to [plaintiffs] statements,\u201d as supported by the record, <em>see </em>SSR 96-7, 1996 WL 374186 at *4, and by failing to adequately consider (or show us that he has considered) the other required factors, <em>id. </em>at *5-8, the ALJ did not provide the documentation necessary to give plaintiff a full and fair review of his claim and to ensure a well-reasoned decision. <em>Briggs ex rel. Briggs v. Massanari, </em>248 F.3d 1235, 1239 (10th Cir.2001) (citing SSR 96-7p). Consequently, the ALJ\u2019s determination of plaintiffs RFC is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">RFC Assessment Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Nor did the RFC finding contain the required complete function-by-function assessment based on all the relevant evidence. <em>See </em>SSR 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184 at *3-4. A proper RFC assessment \u201cmust address both the remaining exertional and nonexertional capabilities of the individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5. Each of the seven strength demands must be considered separately. <em>Id. </em>In this ease, after concluding plaintiff retained an RFC for light work, the ALJ made specific findings only as to the amount of weight plaintiff could lift or carry and did not separately address plaintiffs ability to sit, stand, walk, push, or pull, except to note plaintiffs need for \u201can assistive device in the dominant right hand for most ambulation,\u201d the need to avoid repetitive bending and torso twisting, and the need to only occasionally operate foot pedals and \u201cto intermittently alternate sitting and standing positions for a few minutes 1-2 times an hour.\u201d Aplt. App. at 36. There is no discussion of \u201cthe maximum amount of each work-related activity [plaintiff] can perform,\u201d nor is there any \u201cnarrative discussion describing how the evidence supports each conclusion, citing <em>specific </em>medical facts ... and nonmedical evidence.\u201d SSR 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184 at *7 (emphasis added). Also missing is any explanation of why the treating physician\u2019s statement regarding plaintiffs limitations was not adopted,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is required when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment conflicts with that opinion. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in addition to an inadequate consideration of plaintiff\u2019s credibility regarding subjective complaints of pain, the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding at the first phase of the step-four analysis did not even accurately reflect plaintiffs exertional limitations. <em>See Winfrey, </em>92 F.3d at 1023-24. Because the ALJ failed to make all the detailed findings required by the regulations and rulings at step four, his RFC conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence. On remand, the ALJ needs to reevaluate plaintiff\u2019s claim of disabling pain in light of the entire record and the requirements of SSR 96-7p. He also needs to properly reconsider plaintiff\u2019s ex-ertional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Treating Physician\u2019s Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Plaintiff also alleges that the ALJ erred in not according controlling weight to the opinion of his treating physician, Dr. Wills. As previously discussed, Dr. Wills\u2019 medical opinions were based on numerous treatment visits, as well as MRI and X-ray evidence. Moreover, \u201c[w]hen a treating physician\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with other medical evidence, the ALJ\u2019s task is to examine the other physician\u2019s reports to see if they outweigh the treating physician\u2019s report, not the other way around.\u201d <em>Goatcher v. United States Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., 52 </em>F.3d 288, 290 (10th Cir.1995) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">In declining to give Dr. Wills\u2019 opinion controlling weight, the ALJ was required to consider the factors outlined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d) and 416.927(d). <em>See also </em>SSR 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184 at *7 The ALJ did not do this. Instead, he determined that Dr. Wills\u2019 outline of plaintiffs \u201csignificant functional limitations\u201d was \u201cnot fully supported by the objective medical findings\u201d because the orthopedic consultant noted that the MRI \u201cdid not reflect compression causing radicular complaints as alleged by [plaintiff].\u201d Aplt. App. at 36; 295. In so doing, the ALJ failed to properly consider the findings and specific limitations outlined by Dr. Wills in her two medical source statements, Aplt. App. at 239-44; 319-21, and virtually ignored her three separate opinion letters detailing plaintiffs medical issues, including her opinion that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cextruded discs make it difficult for him to remain either seated or standing for prolonged periods of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38; <em>see also id. </em>at 238, 293. Moreover, as we have previously noted, the radiology report itself states that \u201c[e]xitmg left sided L3 nerve root compression could not be totally excluded,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 245, which is consistent with Dr. Wills\u2019 assessment of \u201cpossible L3 nerve root compression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 293. On remand, the ALJ will need to reconsider Dr. Wills\u2019 opinions and treatment notes under the rules and regulations for evaluating treating source opinions. <em>See also Doyal, </em>331 F.3d at 762-63 (describing factors for assessing whether physician\u2019s opinion entitled to controlling weight).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and the cause is REMANDED to the district court with directions to remand the action to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b808-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
