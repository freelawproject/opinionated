The district court construed Saunders\u2019 pleading as a motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and denied the motion as successive, noting that Saunders had not sought authorization from this court to file such a motion. This court may grant a certificate of appealability to appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion only if Saunders makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). Where, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the movant can demonstrate \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the [motion] states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and Saunders\u2019 informal brief and conclude that Saunders has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Pursuant to our decision in <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), we construe Saunders\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a second or successive motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), 2255 H8 (2000). Saunders\u2019 claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Saunders to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
