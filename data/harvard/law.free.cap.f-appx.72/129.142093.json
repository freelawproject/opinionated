Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and the dismissal without prejudice of their Louisiana tort claim. The Leonards argue that to hold a non-custodial plaintiff to the <em>Heck </em>\u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement effectively forecloses any mechanism of relief either on federal or state habeas review or under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-23\">The district court\u2019s Rule 12(c) dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, </em>224 F.3d 425, 440 n. 8 (5th Cir.2000). \u201c[T]he central issue is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint states a valid claim for relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-24\">In order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other actions, the unlawfulness of which \u201cwould render a conviction or sentence invalid,[] a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>rized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In <em>Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300 (5th Cir.2000), this court applied the <em>Heck </em>\u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement to a noncustodial plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 complaint which challenged his extended sentence. This court has not overruled <em>Randell </em>and the Supreme Court has not overruled the applicability of the <em>Heck </em>\u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement to custodial and noncustodial plaintiffs alike. <em>See In re Dyke, </em>943 F.2d 1435, 1442 (5th Cir.1991), abrogated on other grounds, <em>Patterson v. Shumate, </em>504 U.S. 753, 112 S.Ct. 2242, 119 L.Ed.2d 519 (1992) (noting that one panel of this court is bound by the precedent of previous panels absent an intervening Supreme Court case overruling that prior precedent). The Leonards have failed to demonstrate that John Leonard\u2019s extended sentence has been invalidated by one of the methods prescribed by <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">With respect to the magistrate judge\u2019s decision not to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the Leonards\u2019 state law claim, the Leonards have failed to brief the issue and therefore, it is waived on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224r-25 (5th Cir.1993). The judgment of the magistrate judge is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
