We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (repealed 1996) and we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-25\">As both parties conceded, the BIA undertook an independent analysis of Martinez\u2019s testimony and \u201cagreed with,\u201d but did not adopt, the IJ\u2019s decision that Martinez\u2019s description of past persecution was not credible. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000) (\u2018Where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s decision de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent the IJ\u2019s opinion is expressly adopted.\u201d). The adverse credibility determination resulted from Martinez\u2019s misrepresentation on his initial asylum application that he had been persecuted based on political belief, rather than sexual orientation. He explained the misrepresentation was due to a fear of facing further persecution if the government learned of his sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The BIA provided no \u201cspecific cogent reasons\u201d for rejecting this justification. <em>Valderrama v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir.2001). Moreover, \u201cmisrepresentations [that] are wholly consistent with [petitioner\u2019s] testimony and application for asylum\u201d do not support a negative credibility finding. <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 955 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also Paramasamy v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 1047, 1053 (9th Cir.2002). Because the BIA stated only that it was \u201cnot persuaded by respondent\u2019s explanations\u201d and provided no legitimate, let alone cogent, reason for rejecting Martinez\u2019s \u201cwholly consistent\u201d misrepresentation, we remand for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">KLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b591-8\">KLEINFELD, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">I respectfully dissent. The BIA rejected Martinez\u2019s credibility because \u201cthe claim the respondent presented before the asylum officer was inconsistent with the one he pursued at the hearing.\u201d He had fair notice from the IJ\u2019s decision of this reason for rejecting his credibility, and tried to explain it away in his appeal to the BIA, but the BIA was \u201cnot persuaded by the respondent\u2019s explanations for this discrepancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Martinez twice lied under oath to the INS. He invented a story about having been a member of a student-led political activist group. As he later admitted, this story was entirely untrue. Such \u201cmaterial misstatements of fact\u201d and \u201cgross inconsistencies\u201d in an application for asylum that \u201cinvolve[ ] the heart of the asylum claim\u201d may provide substantial evidence for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Ceballos-Castillo v. INS, </em>904 F.2d 519, 520 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">In <em>Ceballos, </em>we explicitly distinguished such falsehoods from the incidental falsehoods told in <em>Turcios v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1396 (9th Cir.1987). The majority relies on <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951 (9th Cir.1999) for the proposition that Martinez\u2019s previous lies are \u201cwholly consistent\u201d with his claim of fear of future persecution. <em>Akinmade, </em>relying on <em>Turcios, </em>addresses a different situation than that in the case at bar. Here, as in <em>Ceballos, </em>the asylum applicant did not lie about his country of origin or incidental details of his past, but rather completely invented the entire basis for his claim for asylum. His previous story cannot be \u201cwholly consistent\u201d with his current story, since he has admitted the previous story to be entirely false. Rather, this is the \u201c180 degree\u201d change that we held in <em>Ceballos-Castillo </em>to be substantial evidence for an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The IJ articulated a legitimate, cogent reason for his adverse credibility finding, namely the fact the Martinez lied to the INS in his prior application, and the BIA clearly adopted that reason as well, noting as it did that it was unpersuaded by Martinez\u2019s attempt to explain that reason away. The deferential standard of review requires that we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
