R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">Plaintiffs Sherrel \u201cFrank\u201d Cooke and Patricia Cooke were employed as team drivers by C. Bean Transport, Inc. (\u201cC.Bean\u201d). The Cookes filed this suit in federal district court against C. Bean, alleging that C. Bean violated the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2654, by: (1) not allowing them to take intermittent medical leave; (2) requiring Frank to provide a physician\u2019s note and to undergo an additional physical examination before permitting him to return to work; and (3) not allowing the Cookes to return to work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Cookes moved for summary judgment on their FMLA claims. The district court denied the Cookes\u2019 motion and granted C. Bean partial summary judgment, reasoning that C. Bean did not violate the FMLA by requiring Frank to undergo an additional physical examination before permitting him to return to work in accordance with Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The Cookes tried the remainder of their FMLA claims to a jury. At the close of the evidence, C. Bean moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the Cookes\u2019 FMLA claims. The district court granted C. Bean\u2019s motion as to the Cookes\u2019 FMLA claims based on an entitlement theory, concluding that the Cookes failed to present a proper FMLA claim under \u00a7 2615(a)(1) because they did not prove that they were denied medical leave. The district court, however, denied C. Bean\u2019s motion with respect to the Cookes\u2019 FMLA claims based on a retaliation theory. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2615(a)(2), 2615(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">During the jury instruction conference, the Cookes objected to Instruction 13 which read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><em>RETALIATION </em>\u2014 ESSENTIAL <em>ELEMENTS</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">Your verdict must be for the plaintiffs if plaintiffs prove all of the following elements by the greater weight of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">(1) Plaintiffs engaged in an FMLA protected activity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">(2) Defendant took an adverse employment action against Plaintiffs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">(3) The adverse employment action was taken because the plaintiffs engaged in legally protected activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-11\">In this case it is agreed that Plaintiffs engaged in an FMLA protected activity. Plaintiffs must prove that the defendant took an adverse employment action and that the adverse employment action was taken because of Plaintiffs having engaged in legally protected activity. The plaintiffs must prove, by the greater weight of the evidence, that the defendant intentionally retaliated against them because of their FMLA leave and that this was a motivating factor in the employment decision. A motivating factor, or motive, is a reason or desire that causes someone to take action. An act of retaliation is intentional if it is done consciously, voluntarily, and purposely, and not because of mistake, inadvertence, or accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\">In considering whether the plaintiffs have proven retaliation, you should also consider whether the defendant\u2019s explanation for its actions was legitimate and nondiseriminatory, or a pretext for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">The Cookes argued that Instruction 13 improperly informed the jury that intent was an element of their FMLA claims. The district court overruled the Cookes\u2019 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">The Cookes\u2019 also objected to Instruction 14 on essentially the same grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instruction 14 read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-17\">\n<em>LEGITIMATE BUSINESS REASON</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-18\">In deciding Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for retaliation, you must consider any legitimate, nonretaliatory reason or explanation proffered by Defendant for their decisions. If you find that Defendant has stated a valid reason for its decisions regarding Plaintiff\u2019s employment, then you must decide in favor of Defendant on Plaintiffs\u2019 retaliation claim, unless Plaintiffs prove by the greater weight of the evidence that the stated reason for Defendant\u2019s treatment of Plaintiffs was not the true reason, but only a \u201cpretext,\u201d or in other words, an \u201cexcuse\u201d for retal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>iating against Plaintiffs because of the exercise of their FMLA rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The district court overruled the Cookes\u2019 objection to Instruction 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">After a trial on the merits of the Cookes\u2019 remaining FMLA claims, a jury returned a verdict in favor of C. Bean.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The Cookes argue on appeal that the district court erred in giving Instructions 13 and 14. The majority of the Cookes\u2019 arguments on appeal, however, challenge the propriety of the dismissal of their FMLA claims based on an entitlement theory. This court, therefore, will construe the Cookes\u2019 appellate arguments as a challenge to the district court\u2019s grant of C. Bean\u2019s Rule 50 motion. This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to grant a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. Tyler v. RE/MAX Mountain States, Inc., </em>232 F.3d 808, 812 (10th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Plaintiffs may pursue FMLA claims under two separate theories, the retaliation theory and the entitlement theory. <em>Smith v. Diffee Ford-Lincolm-Mercury, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 955, 960 (10th Cir.2002). Under the entitlement theory, a plaintiff may recover \u201c[i]f an employer interferes with the FMLA-created right to medical leave or to reinstatement following the leave, ... regardless of the employer\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Cookes asserted that C. Bean failed to reinstate them after taking medical leave. Their FMLA claims, therefore, are based on an entitlement theory. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">In dismissing their FMLA claims, the district court reasoned that the only proper grounds for a claim based on the entitlement theory was the denial of leave.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Refusal to reinstate an employee after taking medical leave is also grounds for a FMLA claim based on an entitlement theory. <em>Id. </em>(noting that the FMLA creates a substantive right to reinstatement following leave and holding that a plaintiff can recover for the deprivation of such a right under the entitlement theory). Therefore, the district court erred in granting C. Bean\u2019s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">The Cookes also argue on appeal that C. Bean required Frank to submit to an additional medical exam prior to returning to work in violation of the FMLA. The Cookes, however, do not challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in their briefs on appeal. Even if this court were to construe the Cookes\u2019 arguments on appeal as a challenge of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, the Cookes\u2019 arguments fail. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the DOT regulations, \u201c[a]ny driver whose ability to perform his normal duties has been impaired by a physical or mental injury or disease\u201d must be medically examined and certified prior to operating a commercial motor vehicle. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.45. While, under the FMLA, a fitness-for-duty certification \u201cneed only be a simple statement of an employee\u2019s ability to return to work,\u201d employers may, in compliance with regulations issued by the DOT, impose more stringent requirements on certification of fitness. <em>See Porter v. United States Alumoweld Co., Inc., </em>125 F.3d 243, 247 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that an employer does not violate the FMLA by requiring an employee to submit to an ADA-required fitness-for-duty exam). Therefore, C. Bean\u2019s enforcement of DOT regulations by requiring Frank to submit to a DOT physical examination before returning to work does not violate the FMLA, and the district court did not err in granting C. Bean summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of C. Bean\u2019s Rule 50 motion as to the Cookes\u2019 entitlement claims is reversed. These claims are remanded for a new trial. Moreover, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the Cookes\u2019 claim pertaining to C. Bean\u2019s requirement that Frank submit to a physical examination prior to returning to work is affirmed. The Cookes\u2019 motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-18\">. The Cookes asserted these claims under both an entitlement and a retaliation theory. The Cookes also filed claims against C. Bean under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5, 12117. Those claims are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\">. The Cookes objected to the instruction, stating: \u201cI would \u2014 plaintiff would object to this in the \u2014 in that I don\u2019t believe that plaintiff\u2019s or defendant's basis for their \u2014 for what they have done, for their actions, necessarily requires that plaintiff\u2019s case be \u2014 or that plaintiff be denied relief. I think that what this does is it ties into the retaliation and looks at the intent. For that reason, we object.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\">. At the hearing on C. Bean's Rule 50 motion, the district court questioned the Cookes' counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">THE COURT: So, I mean, what \u2014 where in that period of time were [the Cookes] denied Family Medical Leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">MR. HAMBY: Well, I guess it really wasn't leave. Again, it's the right to return to work. So it's the flip side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\">THE COURT: Let me go back to the same question. Do you have a claim or are you making a claim or arguing a Rule 50 motion or are you requesting that the Court grant your Rule 50 motion in regard to a claim for denial of Family Medical Leave? MR. HAMBY: Okay. Are you talking about the time off? You are not talking about benefits under the Family Medical Leave Act? You are just talking about time off? THE COURT: That\u2019s what the Family Medical Leave Act is, is time off to \u2014 for an illness or to take care of someone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">Further, in granting C. Bean\u2019s Rule 50 motion on the Cookes' FMLA claims based on an entitlement theory, the district court stated, \"I'm granting the Rule 50 motion as it relates to 2615(A)(1), which is denial of medical leave, which comes under the strict liability standard.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b769-18\">. The Cookes do not challenge the propriety of the jury instructions with respect to their FMLA retaliation claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
