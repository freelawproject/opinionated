Jaimes-Aranda complains that his sentence was improperly enhanced pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) based on a prior conviction. He argues that the sentencing provision is unconstitutional. Jaimes-Aranda thus contends that his sentence should not exceed the maximum terms of imprisonment prescribed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Jaimes-Aranda acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
