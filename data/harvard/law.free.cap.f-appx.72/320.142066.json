This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division, Wilson was convicted of one count of a drug-trafficking conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Wilson to life imprisonment. This court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>United States v. Wil</em>son, No. 95-6023, 1996 WL 447657 (6th Cir. Aug.7, 1996). Thereafter, the district court denied a motion to vacate Wilson\u2019s sentence filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Wilson did not appeal that judgment, nor has he moved for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Wilson filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, alleging that he is entitled to relief because: 1) his sentence based upon a quantity of drugs not determined by a jury violates the principle enunciated in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and 2) his conviction and sentence were obtained in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. The district court dismissed the petition sua sponte as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">In his timely appeal, Wilson contends that: 1) the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective; 2) he is actually innocent; 3) the indictment charging him was constitutionally inadequate; and 4) the jury instructions impermissibly broadened the charges brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">Generally, this court reviews de novo a district court judgment dismissing a habeas corpus petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). A federal prisoner may challenge a conviction or imposition of sentence under \u00a7 2241 rather than by a motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 only under very unusual circumstances in which the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. The prisoner must prove that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, and the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective simply because a petitioner has been denied relief under \u00a7 2255 or denied permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 756-58. The remedy afforded under \u00a7 2241 is not an additional, alternative or supplemental remedy to that prescribed under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">Upon review, we conclude that Wilson makes neither a legitimate claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>would be cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition, nor a claim resting on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. The only claim that this court has recognized as cognizable under \u00a7 2241 is a claim of actual innocence based upon a new rule of law made retroactive by a Supreme Court case, such as the claim raised in the case of <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). <em>See Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756-57. Wilson\u2019s claims were not <em>Bailey </em>claims or those of actual innocence. His claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit, for the reasons set forth in the court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order of November 14, 2002.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
