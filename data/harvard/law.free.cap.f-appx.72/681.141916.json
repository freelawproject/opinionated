We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Lopez filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR \u2014 26) with the BIA and indicated on it that he would file a brief. Because he failed to file the brief, and also failed to set out adequate reasons for his appeal in his Notice of Appeal, the BIA summarily dismissed. Lopez did not raise the issue of the summary dismissal in his brief to this Court. Accordingly, we regard Lopez\u2019s failure as a waiver of his right to challenge the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1260 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">We do not consider Lopez\u2019s contentions regarding the IJ\u2019s underlying decision because these issues were not first considered by the BIA. <em>See Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b707-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
