However, \u201cBurglary of a Building\u201d as defined at Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02 does substantially correspond to generic burglary as required by <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), for the sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 161-62 (5th Cir.1992). As Stone\u2019s burglary offenses were separated by an intermediate period of non-criminal activity, they were correctly counted as separate offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). <em>United States v. Herbert, </em>860 F.2d 620, 622 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-16\">Stone also argues that the district court erred by not reducing her offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Given the highly deferential standard of review, the district court\u2019s ruling cannot be seen as without foundation. <em>Cf. United States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 264-65 (5th Cir.1998) (admission to facts of conduct insufficient to require reduction where some facet of culpability is denied).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">Finally, Stone argues that the district court erred by declining to downwardly depart on the mistaken assumption that it lacked the authority to do so. Courts are permitted to consider various factors in imposing a sentence, including the \u201cnature of the circumstances of the offense,\u201d \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d and \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), and (a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-18\">The record does not clearly reveal whether the district court properly understood its discretion to depart. The district judge, at the resentencing hearing, characterized Stone\u2019s sentence as \u201cterribly inequitable\u201d and \u201catrocious.\u201d The district judge, however, stated \u201cI don\u2019t see any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>way around it in the state of the present law\u201d and \u201cmy hands are tied.\u201d The Government argues that due to the history of this ease, the district court should have been aware that it could downward depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In light of the ambiguity, we remand the case for reconsideration of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Ortiz, </em>310 F.3d 792, 795-96 (5th Cir.2002). The only issue on remand is whether the district court recognized that it had the discretion to depart. If the district court was aware of its discretion but declined to exercise it, then the original sentence should stand. However, if the district court believed that it lacked the authority to depart, Stone should be resentenced with the district court\u2019s full awareness of its discretionary authority. We take no position on what decision the district court should make.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">REMANDED FOR RECONSIDERATION OF SENTENCE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
