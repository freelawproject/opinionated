Reviewing the summary judgment <em>de novo, Dickey v. Baptist Mem. Hosp.-North Miss., </em>146 F.3d 262, 264 (5th Cir.1998), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Mr. Moore spent an evening drinking on a riverboat casino operated by Horseshoe. He exited the casino and fell from a deck into the river. Several casino employees saw him and tried to save him by sounding a \u201cman overboard\u201d alarm, throwing him a life ring, and launching rescue boats. Despite their efforts, Mr. Moore tragically drowned. Autopsy reports placed his blood alcohol level at roughly 0.25, over twice the legal limit in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">The Louisiana legislature has declared that \u201cconsumption of intoxicating beverages, rather than the sale or serving or furnishing of such beverages, is the proximate cause of any injury, including death ..., inflicted by an intoxicated person upon himself____\u201d La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.1(A). This law \u201cunambiguously places the responsibility for the consequences of intoxication on the intoxicated person, and expressly disclaims \u2018dramshop\u2019 liability.\u201d <em>Mayo v. Hyatt Corp., </em>898 F.2d 47, 48 (5th Cir.1990); <em>see also Berg v. Zummo, </em>786 So.2d 708, 714 (La.2001) (same). Section 9:2800.1(A) therefore appears to give Horseshoe absolute immunity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-18\">Plaintiffs argue, however, that \u00a7 9:2800.1(B) creates an exception to this seeming rule of absolute immunity for injuries suffered on a vendor\u2019s premises. Section 9:2800.1(B) states that \u201cno person ... who sells or serves intoxicating beverages ... to a person over the age of lawful purchase thereof, shall be liable to such person or ... to [his] estate, successors, or survivors ... for any injury suffered <em>off the premises, </em>including wrongful death ..., because of the intoxication of the person____\u201d LaRev.Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.1(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-20\">Though the Supreme Court of Louisiana might recognize an exception to \u00a7 9:2800.1(A) for injuries suffered on a vendor\u2019s premises,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we need not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the question, because Mr. Moore\u2019s injury would not fit within any such exception. The injury Mr. Moore suffered, and for which plaintiffs have sued, is the drowning, not the fall. The drowning occurred in the river, which is off the premises of the casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Thus, the sole proximate cause of Mr. Moore\u2019s death was his own intoxication, not the casino\u2019s provision of alcohol. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.1(A) (stating that \u201cconsumption of intoxicating beverages ... is the proximate cause of any injury, including death ..., inflicted by an intoxicated person upon himself\u2019). \u201cThis complete failure of proof on an essential element of plaintiffs\u2019 case \u2018necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u2019\u201d Mayo, 898 F.2d at 49 (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-21\">. <em>Cf. Berg, </em>786 So.2d at 714 (recognizing that \u00a7 9:2800.1(B) creates an exception to \u00a7 9:2800.1(A) for serving alcohol to minors).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">. We also need not address whether a vendor may be liable, notwithstanding \u00a7 9:2800.1(A), for \"affirmative acts which increase the peril to an intoxicated person.\u201d <em>Mayo, </em>898 F.2d at 49 (quoting <em>Thrasher v. Leggett, </em>373 So.2d 494, 497 (La.1979)). In <em>Mayo, </em>we held that this is the \"sole duty of a seller of alcoholic beverages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Louisiana may have undermined this portion of <em>Mayo </em>by expressly noting but declining to adopt or reject it. <em>Berg, </em>786 So.2d at 714 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Even assuming <em>Mayo </em>properly interpreted Louisiana law, plaintiffs have not offered evidence of any affirmative acts increasing the peril to Mr. Moore. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Moore fell from a restricted-access deck not equipped with surveillance cameras. They do not assert that this particular deck was more likely to attract intoxicated patrons or less secure against falls than were other decks. Rather, they allege that the unmonitored nature of this deck increased the likelihood that possible rescuers would not notice if a patron fell overboard. Yet, the facts as stated in the complaint belie this theory: Plaintiff's acknowledge that, after Mr. Moore fell, a Horseshoe employee observed him \"[sjhortly thereafter\u201d and radioed to another employee, who arrived \u201ca few seconds later.\u201d The employees then took several reasonable but unsuccessful steps to save Mr. Moore\u2019s life.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
