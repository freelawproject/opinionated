In its partial dismissal order, the district court determined that several of Comeaux\u2019s claims duplicated those pending in another 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit, dismissed those claims as malicious, instructed Comeaux to file a shortened amended complaint and a signed motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and also instructed him not to file any additional pleadings. The district court dismissed Comeaux\u2019s suit for failure to comply with the court\u2019s orders under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), after he filed an amended complaint, a signed IFP motion, and a number of other pleadings, including a motion for injunctive relief and challenges to and an attempt to appeal the partial dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Comeaux\u2019s filings in addition to his amended complaint following the district court\u2019s explicit and clear instructions not to file any additional pleadings exhibited contumacious conduct. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Comeaux\u2019s suit for failure to comply with the court\u2019s orders under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). <em>See Long v. Simmons, </em>77 F.3d 878, 880 (5th Cir.1996); <em>McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 790, 792 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Also without merit are his arguments that (1) he should have been allowed to file an amended notice of appeal, (2) the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case once Comeaux filed a notice of appeal from the partial dismissal order, (3) the district court should have considered Comeaux\u2019s affidavits and granted his requests for injunctive relief and for the appointment of counsel, and (4) he was assessed too many filing fees for his district court action and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">With respect to the partial dismissal order, Comeaux was not entitled to notice before the dismissal of some of his claims as malicious: The district court could dismiss part of Comeaux\u2019s complaint as malicious, which counted as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), even though the case was ultimately dismissed for failure to comply with court orders. In addition, Comeaux has not shown that the claims dismissed as malicious did not duplicate previously filed claims. <em>See </em>28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) &amp; (b); <em>Carr v. Dvorin, </em>171 F.3d 115, 116 (2d Cir.1999); <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 463 (5th Cir.1998); Fed. R.App. P. 10(b); <em>United States v. Hinojosa, </em>958 F.2d 624, 632-33 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing some of Comeaux\u2019s claims as malicious or in dismissing his case for failure to comply \"with the court\u2019s orders. Comeaux\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is thus dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The dismissal of Comeaux\u2019s claims as malicious counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). The dismissal of Comeaux\u2019s appeal counts as an additional strike, <em>id., </em>and his appeal in case number 01-20584 was dismissed as frivolous, which counts as yet another strike. Comeaux has now accumulated three strikes. He may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
