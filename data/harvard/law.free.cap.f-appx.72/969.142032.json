Todd argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the City and Officers Brice and Lee. The grant of attorneys\u2019 fees in the final judgment is not appealable because it did not reduce the award to a sum certain. <em>See Southern Travel Club. Inc. v. Carnival Air Lines, Inc., </em>986 F.2d 125, 131 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
