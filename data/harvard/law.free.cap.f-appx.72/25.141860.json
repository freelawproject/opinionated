Bell contests the district court\u2019s mass-marketing enhancement. We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations concerning the application of the Sentencing Guidelines for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-24\">Bell argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level two levels because his passive conduct did not satisfy the requirements of the mass-marketing enhancement of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(3) (2000). That section provides that an offense committed through mass-marketing warrants a two-level increase in offense level. The guidelines commentary defines mass-marketing as \u201ca plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A) purchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or (C) to invest for financial profit.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2F1.1 comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-25\">From November 2000 to April 2001, Bell sold sports cards via online auction to 186 customers. He defrauded these customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>out of more than $150,000 by auctioning sports collectibles on the eBay website, which is visited by millions of people, and failing to ship the goods upon payment. This conduct falls squarely within the two-level enhancement for mass-marketing. <em>See United States v. Magnuson, </em>307 F.3d 333 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1008, 154 L.Ed.2d 925 (2003); <em>United States v. Pirello, </em>255 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1034, 122 S.Ct. 577, 151 L.Ed.2d 448 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We therefore affirm Bell\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions have been adequately presented in the written materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
