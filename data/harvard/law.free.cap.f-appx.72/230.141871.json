Rios argues that the district court erred in enhancing his current offense with his prior, uncounseled conviction of misdemeanor illegal entry, for which he received a sentence of probation. Rios argues in the alternative that his right to counsel was triggered in the prior conviction because imprisonment was an authorized punishment for misdemeanor illegal entry and that his waiver of his right to counsel was invalid. Rios acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Perez-Macias, </em>335 F.3d 421, 426 n. 11, 427-28 &amp; n. 14 (5th Cir.2003); however, he seeks to preserve these issues for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
