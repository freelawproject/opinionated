Glasgow now challenges that sentence, claiming that the government breached the plea agreement when it failed to move for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and that the district court abused its discretion in denying the government\u2019s motion for downward departure pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">By the terms of the plea agreement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the government agreed to recommend that Glasgow receive a sentence at the low end of the Guideline range in exchange for his cooperation. The government also agreed as follows: \u201cIn exchange for Mr. Glasgow\u2019s continued complete and truthful cooperation, the United States agrees to petition the District Court for Rule 35 relief. Naturally, it is the Court who will ultimately determine what relief, if any, has been earned by [ ] Glasgow.... [Fjinally, the United States may seek \u00a7 5K1.1 relief as opposed to Rule 35 relief - it just depends upon when Glasgow is sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">The government followed through on its promise. After Glasgow testified at his codefendant\u2019s trial, the government filed a Rule 35 motion on June 10, 2002. The government thus complied with the terms of the plea agreement. Nothing in the agreement itself or in the law suggests that the government was obliged to seek \u00a7 5K1.1 relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, nothing about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the circumstances of this case suggests that the government\u2019s choice to file a Rule 35 motion \u201crepresents an \u2018attempt by the government to influence the district court\u2019 to impose a harsher sentence than the one that the government agreed in the plea agreement to recommend.\u201d <em>United States v. Quack, </em>302 F.3d 1096, 1101 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing <em>United States v. Mondragon, </em>228 F.3d 978, 980-81 (9th Cir.2000)). Glasgow\u2019s claim of breach of the plea agreement thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Glasgow also maintains that the district court abused its discretion in denying the Rule 35 motion. We disagree. Rule 35(b) commits the decision to reduce a sentence for substantial assistance to the discretion of the district court; it says that the court \u201cmay,\u201d not \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmust,\u201d reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence if substantial assistance is found. Here, at the hearing on the government\u2019s Rule 35 motion, the district court provided an extensive and reasoned explanation for denying that motion \u2014 an explanation that, we note, turned not at all on the distinction between pre-sentencing and post-sentencing assistance. We cannot conclude, in light of that explanation, that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">. All references to the \"plea agreement\" refer both to the document so labeled, signed by the parties on March 21, 2002, and the separate letter dated February 7, 2002, addressed to Glasgow\u2019s attorney. The parties do not dispute that the terms of that letter are also part of Glasgow\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-14\">. As the government acknowledges, a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion would have been more appropriate in this case because the motion was based on Glasgow's cooperation rendered prior to his sentence; Rule 35 motions pertain to assistance rendered after sentencing. <em>See United States v. Quach, </em>302 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir.2002). However, as the government correctly notes, in this case the choice of nomenclature made no difference in the district court's consideration of the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
