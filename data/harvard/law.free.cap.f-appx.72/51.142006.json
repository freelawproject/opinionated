When he filed his petition, Naim was in Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) custody. He asked the district court to order the INS to release him because he is a United States citizen or national not subject to removal and alleging violations of his rights under the due-process and equal-protection clauses of the Constitution and violations of international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">Naim does not challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition in his appellate brief. Accordingly, he has abandoned any such challenge. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">In his brief, Naim asks this court for a petition for review of the order of removal, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5). However, he has not filed a timely petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(l)-(2). Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the brief as a petition for review. <em>See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
