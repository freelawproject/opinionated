We grant review on the first issue, do not reach the second, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">Ballengee, the claimant, worked as a coal miner for over 20 years, working first for Sterling Smokeless from 1972 to 1981. Thereafter, he worked for several different coal companies, last working for Green Mountain Energy, Incorporated from August 1990 to September 1993. In total, Ballengee worked for ten coal companies as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b969-18\">\n<em>Company Date of Employment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">Sterling Smokeless Coal Corp. 1972-81</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">PG <em>&amp; </em>H, Inc. 1982</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">Consolidated Coal Co. 1982</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">Barrett Fuel Corp. 1982</p>\n<p id=\"b969-24\">Maben Energy Corp. 1982-85</p>\n<p id=\"b969-25\">Riteway Coal, Inc. 1984r-85</p>\n<p id=\"b969-26\">Hendricks Mining, Inc. 1986-87</p>\n<p id=\"b969-27\">Hansford Smokeless Collieries, Inc. 1987</p>\n<p id=\"b969-28\">Stoney Coal Co. 1987-90</p>\n<p id=\"b969-29\">Green Mountain Energy, Inc. 1990-93</p>\n<p id=\"b969-30\">Of these, six companies each employed Ballengee for less than one year: PG &amp; H, Consolidated, Barrett, Riteway, Hendricks, and Hansford. But according to Ballengee, Maben Energy and the companies for whom he worked afterwards (Rite-way, Hendricks, Hansford, Stoney Coal, and Green Mountain) were \u201call the same company, it just had different names.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-31\">\u2022 After Ballengee quit working in 1993 on the advice of his doctors, he filed a claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>To obtain benefits under that Act, he was required to prove that he had pneumoconiosis; that it arose out of his coal mine employment; that he had a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition; and that pneumoconiosis was a contribu\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ing cause of his disability. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207 (4th Cir.2000); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.201-.204. Because Ballengee failed to prove total disability due to pneumoconiosis, his claim was denied. Ballengee did not request a hearing or otherwise contest the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Ballengee later filed a second or \u201cduplicate\u201d claim for benefits based allegedly on a material change in conditions. Green Mountain, Ballengee\u2019s most recent coal mine employer, was originally identified as the employer statutorily responsible for payment of Ballengee\u2019s benefits, but Green Mountain informed the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) that it, along with its parent company Adventure Resources, Incorporated and several other companies also owned by Adventure Resources, had filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and that it was uncertain whether Green Mountain could meet its obligation to pay the benefits. While the bankruptcy court allowed the unsecured claim of the federal Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which had been paying Ballengee\u2019s claims during the prolonged adjudication, other creditors\u2019 claims would exhaust any assets of the bankruptcy estate before the Trust Fund could be compensated or any of Ballengee\u2019s benefits paid. And although Green Mountain had participated, as of 1989, in a self-insured black lung benefits trust authorized by the Department of Labor and run by Adventure Resources, funding the trust with $705,556, the assets of that program had been exhausted by November 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Green Mountain accordingly was released from liability, and Sterling Smokeless was identified as the responsible operator. Upon that company\u2019s objections to the ALJ, the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cDirector\u201d) was ordered to show cause for holding Sterling Smokeless liable, given that several other coal mine operators had more recently employed Ballengee. The Director responded that all of Ballengee\u2019s coal mine employers, other than Sterling Smokeless, either had filed for bankruptcy with insufficient assets to pay Ballengee\u2019s benefits or had employed Ballengee for periods less than one year and, pursuant to applicable regulations, could not be the responsible operator. The Director also argued that no successor operator could be identified, on the basis that \u201c[t]o the best of the Director\u2019s knowledge ... the assets of Adventure Resources and its affiliates and subsidiaries have been and are being sold by the bankruptcy trustee free and clear of such successor liability.\u201d As evidence, the Director provided documents that identified Adventure Resources, several subsidiaries (including Barrett, Maben Energy, Hendricks, Hansford, Stoney Coal, and Green Mountain), and its principal H. Paul Kizer as active in bankruptcy proceedings. The Director also provided proofs of claims it had filed in those proceedings that acknowledged the inadequate assets of the bankruptcy estate, bankruptcy court orders authorizing the sale free and clear of all real property of Adventure Resources, and a Westlaw database printout of the corporate structures of certain of Ballengee\u2019s employers identifying Kizer as the primary officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Summarizing the Director\u2019s evidence as \u201cprovid[ing] at most a rather hazy and a limited view of a very complex corporate structure and its financial situation,\u201d the ALJ dismissed Sterling Smokeless from the case. The ALJ explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-8\">I am unable to conclude without resort to speculation that there are simply no assets sufficient to cover [Ballengee\u2019s] benefits in the possession of any entity which either employed [Ballengee] for a cumulative period of not less than one year subsequent to his employment with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Sterling Smokeless or which could be held liable as a successor operator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">With no other operator named, the ALJ held the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund responsible for continuation of Ballengee\u2019s benefit payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">On appeal by the Director, the Benefits Review Board vacated the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanded. The Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-7\">[T]he Director met his burden of providing evidence sufficient to demonstrate that all employers subsequent to Sterling are either incapable of assuming liability for the payment of benefits or employed [Ballengee] for less than one year and do not otherwise satisfy the definition of a responsible operator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-9\">Concerning the issue of whether Hansford and Hendricks were successor operators capable of assuming liability for payment of benefits, the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion that Hans-ford and Hendricks may possess assets with which to pay benefits is speculative, and thus, insufficient to support his inference that these companies could be held liable for benefits. Similarly, the record lacks evidence to bolster the administrative law judge\u2019s assumption that Hansford and Hendricks are successor operators to Green Mountain, Stoney or Maben [noting that Ballengee worked for Stoney Coal and Green Mountain after working for Hansford and Hendricks]. In contrast, the record contains evidence sufficient to support the Director\u2019s position that Hansford and Hendricks had filed for bankruptcy, and that the physical location of the mines where claimant worked for Hansford and Hendricks was different from the physical location of the mines where claimant worked when employed by Maben, Stoney, and Green Mountain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">The Board denied Sterling Smokeless\u2019 subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Bound by the Board\u2019s holding and presented with evidence of Sterling Smokeless\u2019 ability to pay, the ALJ issued a decision and order on September 29, 2000, that identified Sterling Smokeless as the responsible operator and considered the merits of Ballengee\u2019s claim. Awarding benefits, the ALJ found that Ballengee suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis, which qualified as a material change in conditions to permit his duplicate claim to proceed and, consequently, to invoke the irrebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis entitling him to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">On Sterling Smokeless\u2019 appeal, the Board affirmed and subsequently denied the request for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">On appeal before this court, Sterling Smokeless petitions for review of (1) its liability as responsible operator and (2) the merits of Ballengee\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">Sterling Smokeless\u2019 principal claim on appeal is that it is not the coal mine operator statutorily responsible for paying any award of benefits to Ballengee under the Black Lung Benefits Act. Among the various arguments it advances on this issue, it contends <em>first </em>that the Director breached his duty to ensure that Green Mountain\u2019s self-insurance program was sufficiently funded to pay benefits and, were it not for this failure, Green Mountain would be the responsible operator because it employed Ballengee more recently than Sterling Smokeless. As support for imposing liability on the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund in this instance, Sterling Smokeless relies on the principle embodied in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.495(a)(4) (2001), conceded to be a new regulation not controlling in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>case, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 725.2(c), which provides that the Trust Fund will assume liability where the Department of Labor has authorized self-insurance but at an inadequate level. <em>Second, </em>Sterling Smokeless contends that the Director failed to satisfy his obligation to investigate sufficiently whether Ballengee\u2019s employers other than Sterling Smokeless had the ability or responsibility to pay, arguing that liability does not attach to Sterling Smokeless if any of Ballengee\u2019s more recent employers qualify as the responsible operator. <em>Third, </em>Sterling Smokeless contends that the officers of Green Mountain and Adventure Resources\u2019 other affiliates failed to fund adequately the self-insurance program and, as a consequence, are personally obligated to pay any benefits due to Ballengee that their companies are unable to pay. <em>Finally, </em>Sterling Smokeless claims that it should be excused from liability on due process grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Ballengee\u2019s claim for benefits is governed by the Black Lung Benefits Act. That Act imposes liability on the coal industry for the payment of black lung benefits, and for claimants who worked as coal miners beyond January 1, 1970, the Act places liability on the individual \u201cresponsible operator\u201d \u2014 the coal mine operator that most recently employed the claimant for periods of employment of not less than one year. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.490(a) (2001); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 725.493(a)(1) (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But if that operator is \u201c[in]capable of assuming its liability for the payment of continuing benefits,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 725.492(a)(4), and there is no \u201csuccessor operator\u201d liable for the payment of benefits, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 725.493(a)(2), then the next most recent employer satisfying the definition \u201cshall be considered\u201d the responsible operator, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 725.493(a)(4). \u201c[I]f no responsible operator can be identified, benefits are paid by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 725.1(d) (2001). And under the regulations applicable to this case, <em>it is the Director\u2019s burden </em>to develop evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that a potentially responsible operator is incapable of assuming liability and consequently does not qualify as the responsible operator. <em>See Director, OWCP v. Trace Fork Coal Co., </em>67 F.3d 503, 507 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that the applicable regulations \u201cgive the Director, not [the designated responsible operator], the power to develop evidence on [the responsible operator] issue\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 506-07 (stating that \u201c[w]e review the factfindings of the ALJ to see if they are based on substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">We conclude in this case that the Director has failed to present sufficient evidence to identify Sterling Smokeless as the proper responsible operator. <em>See Trace Fork, </em>67 F.3d at 505, 507 (agreeing with the Benefits Review Board and the ALJ that the Director\u2019s evidence of a more recent employer\u2019s dissolution was insufficient to establish inability to pay benefits). Ballengee testified that Maben Energy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>and the companies for whom he worked afterwards were \u201call the same company, it just had different names.\u201d This indicates that some or all may have been successors to one another. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.493(a)(2)(i) (1999) (defining \u201csuccessor operator\u201d as one who receives a \u201cmine or mines or substantially all of the assets thereof\u2019 from another operator). And the Director\u2019s evidence supports this contention that some of Ballengee\u2019s employers were successors to one another. The Director submitted information obtained from a Westlaw database \u2014 from 1998\u2014 that listed Maben Energy and Stoney Coal as active corporations and at the same address. And the Director\u2019s exhibits on Ballengee\u2019s employment history list Barrett, Maben Energy, Hendricks, Hansford, Stoney Coal, and Green Mountain as sharing the same address and even the same payroll manager. While the Board was correct to note that Ballengee was assigned to several mines identified by different numbers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is no more speculative to assume from this evidence that the mines were at physically different locations than it is to assume that they were the same mine or mines but renumbered by a successor operator. Acknowledging the different numbers does not answer the lurking concern that a later employer of Ballengee may have succeeded to the assets of a prior employer of Ballengee. This is especially true given the extensive structure of Adventure Resources and its affiliates, once touted as \u201cthe largest independent coal producer in West Virginia and the 49th largest independent coal producer in the United States.\u201d <em>Adventure Resources, Inc. v. Holland, </em>193 B.R. 787, 791 (S.D.W.V.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>ajfd in part &amp; rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>137 F.3d 786 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">As to ability to pay, not all of Adventure Resources\u2019 affiliates filed for bankruptcy. Although the Director indicated that Barrett, Maben Energy, Hendricks, Hansford, Stoney Coal, and Green Mountain had all filed bankruptcy proceedings, that information \u2014 contained in a letter from Adventure Resources \u2014 does not satisfy the Director\u2019s burden. Indeed, the bankruptcy action (a liquidation proceeding) identifies as bankrupt only four of the companies for whom Ballengee worked and notably missing are Hendricks and Hansford. <em>See Adventure Resources, Inc. v. Holland, </em>137 F.3d 786 (4th Cir.1998) (listing Barrett, Maben Energy, Stoney Coal, and Green Mountain among the debtors in bankruptcy). Indeed, the bankruptcy court noted that at least eight affiliates, although participating in the bankruptcy action, had not themselves filed for bankruptcy. <em>See Adventure Resources, </em>193 B.R. at 791 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">From all of this, we conclude that the Board had insufficient evidence to identify Sterling Smokeless as the responsible operator because the evidence in the record is insufficient to show that all of Ballengee\u2019s employers, subsequent to Sterling Smokeless, are unqualified to assume liability as the responsible operator. Accordingly, we remand this ease for the development of further evidence on the ability of Ballengee\u2019s more recent employers to pay. Because of this remand, we need not address Sterling Smokeless\u2019 other arguments on the responsible operator issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">Given our conclusion on the responsible operator issue, we also refrain from ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>establish a material change in conditions pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(c) (1999) to permit the duplicate claim to proceed or to establish complicated pneumoconiosis pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304 (2000) to entitle Ballengee to benefits. In the event that an employer other than Sterling Smokeless is designated Ballengee\u2019s responsible operator, that employer should have the opportunity to dispute Ballengee\u2019s claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Accordingly, we grant Sterling Smokeless\u2019 petition for review of the decision of the Benefits Review Board on the responsible operator issue and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">\n<em>THE PETITION FOR REVIEW IS GRANTED AND THE CASE REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-5\">.
