We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). Because the IJ\u2019s decision was based on legitimate articulable findings questioning Baroi\u2019s credibility and was supported by specific, cogent reasons, <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th Cir.1994), we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Sova Baroi submitted an asylum application prepared by someone else. During her interviews with asylum officers, she answered questions in accord with the application. When confronted with contradictory evidence at her deportation hearing, Sova admitted that the application was false, and that she lied to asylum officers in order to be consistent with the false application. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Sova Baroi was not credible because of her admitted history of being dishonest. <em>See Sarvia-Quintanilla v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1387, 1393 (9th Cir.1985) (giving the petitioner\u2019s testimony \u201cvery little weight\u201d because of a pattern of dishonesty).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Moreover, there were internal inconsistencies in Sova Baroi\u2019s testimony concerning when she received a copy of her asylum application and she offered no explanation when given an opportunity to explain the inconsistencies. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1068 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Further, Sova Baroi\u2019s testimony was contradicted by her daughter\u2019s testimony regarding events following Sova\u2019s alleged rape. <em>See Lata, </em>204 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b708-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-20\">. When Sova Baroi first applied for asylum, her children Sandra and Stephen were included as derivative applicants. Her daughter, Sandra, aged out, and therefore filed a separate application. Sandra\u2019s application depends on the same facts as her mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
