His appeal has been referred to a panel of this court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon review, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">In 1999, Callan was convicted of tampering with a vessel in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2275. On June 30, 1999, he was sentenced to thirty months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. That sentence was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Callan, </em>22 Fed.Appx. 434 (6th Cir.2001) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1004, 122 S.Ct. 1577, 152 L.Ed.2d 496 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">In his Rule 60 motion, Callan primarily alleged that the charges against him should have been tried as an admiralty matter, rather than a criminal case. The district court denied this motion on February 25, 2002. The court subsequently denied Callan\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and he now appeals. He has filed motions seeking a writ of mandamus and other miscellaneous relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">An appeal from the denial of a Rule 60 motion does not bring the underlying judgment up for review. <em>Hood v. Hood, </em>59 F.3d 40, 42 (6th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (collecting cases). We examine the district court\u2019s denial of a motion under Rule 60 for an abuse of discretion on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Callan\u2019s motion because it was filed under a rule of civil procedure that is not applicable in a criminal proceeding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 <em>and </em>81; <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998). Indeed, Callan now states that he wishes to \u201cdismiss\u201d the references to Rule 60 from his pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">Instead, Callan argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over his criminal case and that his case should have been resolved as a civil matter in admiralty. He relies on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, which defines the \u201cspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d as that phrase is used in Title 18. Thus, Callan apparently argues that criminal jurisdiction for his conduct rests with the State of Kentucky where the vessel was docked, rather than with the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">This argument is unpersuasive because Callan was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2275, a criminal statute that does not include the phrase \u201cspecial maritime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d His argument is also refuted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3281, which gives the federal district courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d Thus, the district court had jurisdiction over Callan\u2019s criminal case. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>263 F.3d 645, 655-56 (6th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1007, 122 S.Ct. 1584, 152 L.Ed.2d 502 (2002); <em>United States v. Mundt, </em>29 F.3d 233, 237 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Accordingly, all pending motions are denied and the district court\u2019s denial of Callan\u2019s Rule 60 motion is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
