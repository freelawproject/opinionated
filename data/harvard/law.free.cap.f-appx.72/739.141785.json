R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-25\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Wendel R. Wardell, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the civil rights complaint he brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Wardell also seeks permission from this court to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-26\">In his complaint, Wardell alleged that defendants have denied him his constitutional right to access the courts. The district court concluded that Wardell\u2019s complaint was frivolous and dismissed it <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. We review the dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>al of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Schlicher v. Thomas, </em>111 F.3d 777, 779 (10th Cir.1997). Like the district court, we note that Wardell has not alleged any fact \u201cdemonstrat[ing] that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 354-55, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (holding further that the legal claim affected must be one that either directly or collaterally attacks plaintiffs conviction or sentence, or one that challenges the conditions of his confinement). We reject Wardell\u2019s argument that he is under no obligation to allege sufficient facts in his complaint to support his claim. We further note that Wardell does not contend on appeal that the district court should have provided him with an opportunity to amend his complaint and Wardell did not file a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) or for relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b) after his complaint was dismissed. <em>See Curley v. Perry, </em>246 F.3d 1278, 1284 (10th Cir.2001) (discussing post-judgment procedural safeguards available to litigants whose complaints have been dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In light of the district court\u2019s clear and concise order and the absence of any reasoned argument in Wardell\u2019s appellate brief, this court concludes that Warden\u2019s appeal is frivolous. Because Warden\u2019s appeal is frivolous, his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is denied and his appeal is dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Warden\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Our dismissal of Wardell\u2019s appeal also counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Thus, Wardell has now accumulated two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999). Wardell is hereby warned that if he accrues one more strike, he wfil be precluded from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any further civ\u00fc proceedings unless he is under \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Wardell is further notified that despite this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, he remains obhgated to continue making partial payments until his appeUate filing fee is paid in fuU. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\">. This court has indicated in an unpublished disposition that changes in the PLRA may now dictate that determinations of frivolousness under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) are subject to a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>Basham v. Uphoff, </em>No. 98-8013, 1998 WL 847689, at *4 n. 2 (10th Cir. Dec.8, 1998) (unpublished disposition). It is unnecessary to resolve this question here because there is no reversible error under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
