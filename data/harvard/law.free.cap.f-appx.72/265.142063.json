This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">In 2000, Tate pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Tate was sentenced to serve 126 months of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. This court affirmed Tate\u2019s conviction and sentence on appeal. <em>United, States v. Tate, </em>39 Fed.Appx. 178 (6th Cir. May 15, 2002) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">On August 9, 2002, Cockrell and Young filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 2254, even though Tate is a federal prisoner and should proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The petition alleged that Tate was denied effective assistance of counsel during the criminal proceedings that culminated in his guilty plea. Cockrell, Tate\u2019s friend, and Young, Tate\u2019s mother, filed the petition as putative next friends of Tate.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">The district court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Cockrell and Young lacked standing to proceed on Tate\u2019s behalf. Cockrell and Young filed a motion to reconsider, which the district court denied. Cockrell and Young have filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s disposition of a habeas corpus petition. <em>Payton v. Brigano, </em>256 F.3d 405, 407-08 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">A petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be in writing and \u201csigned and verified by the person for whose relief it is intended or by someone acting in his behalf.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242. In order to act on a prisoner\u2019s behalf, a putative next friend must demonstrate that the prisoner is unable to prosecute the case on his own behalf due to \u201cinaccessibility, mental incompetence, or other disability\u201d and that the next friend is \u201ctruly dedicated to the best interests of the person on whose behalf he seeks to litigate.\u201d <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 163-64, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990); <em>see also West v. Bell, </em>242 F.3d 338, 341 (6th Cir. 2001); <em>Franklin v. Francis, </em>144 F.3d 429, 432 (6th Cir.1998). The putative next friend must clearly establish \u201cthe propriety of his status\u201d in order to \u201cjustify the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Whitmore, </em>495 U.S. at 164. Standing to proceed as next friend on behalf of a prisoner \u201cis by no means granted automatically to whomever seeks to pursue an action on behalf of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Cockrell and Young\u2019s habeas corpus petition based upon their lack of standing to proceed on Tate\u2019s behalf. Cockrell and Young did not satisfy the requirements to qualify for next Mend status. First, they did not assert, or provide any evidence, that Tate is incompetent or otherwise incapable of pursuing the instant action on his own behalf. Second, Cockrell and Young did not demonstrate that they are truly dedicated to Tate\u2019s best interests. Even assuming that Young, Tate\u2019s mother, is acting in Tate\u2019s best interests, <em>see Franklin, </em>144 F.3d at 432, the failure of Cockrell and Young to demonstrate Tate\u2019s incompetence or incapacity is fatal to their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.
