Baker, proceeding pro se, appeals a district court judgment dismissing his civil rights complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">On October 23, 2000, Baker filed a complaint against Attorney Michael A. Smith. Smith had been appointed on September 26, 1996, to represent Baker on appeal from a Wayne County, Michigan, Probate Court order terminating his parental rights to his son, Andre. Baker subsequently filed an amended complaint to add Wayne County Probate Court Judge Freddie G. Burton, Jr., as a defendant. Judge Burton presided over the probate court proceedings involving Andre and on July 11, 1996, entered an order terminating Baker\u2019s parental rights and awarding permanent custody of Andre to the probate court. Judge Burton appointed Smith to represent Baker on appeal from the July 11,1996, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">Baker alleged that the defendants violated, and conspired to violate, his constitutional rights. Baker alleged that Smith violated his rights by not taking \u201cany legal action on [his] behalf\u2019 and by not representing him on appeal from the probate court order despite the court appointment. Baker alleged that Judge Burton failed \u201cin his administrative capacities to exercise proper guidance, direction and control in the processing of [his] appeal and/or appellate packet from July 11, 1996 thru October 29, 1996.\u201d As relief, Baker sought return of Andre to his care and custody, the state probate proceedings to \u201cbe <em>de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>dared a mis-trial, </em>\u201d and monetary relief in the amount of $1,500,000 from Judge Burton and $500,000 from Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Judge Burton filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and Smith filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Baker replied. A magistrate judge filed a report in which she recommended that the defendants\u2019 motions be granted. Over Baker\u2019s objections, the district court accepted and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granted the defendants\u2019 motions. The district court subsequently denied Baker\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Baker now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a suit pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>James v. Meow Media, Inc., </em>300 F.3d 683, 689 (6th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1159, 123 S.Ct. 967, 154 L.Ed.2d 893 (2003); <em>Columbia Natural Res., Inc. v. Tatum, </em>58 F.3d 1101, 1109 (6th Cir.1995). When considering a Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \u201c[t]he district court must construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept all of the factual allegations as true, and determine whether the plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Tatum, </em>58 F.3d at 1109; <em>accord James, </em>300 F.3d at 689. We also review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Kincaid v. Gibson, </em>236 F.3d 342, 346 (6th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence presented shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Baker\u2019s complaint. The district court properly granted Judge Burton\u2019s motion to dismiss because Judge Burton is entitled to judicial immunity from suit for monetary damages. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 355-56, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). The district court properly granted Smith\u2019s motion for summary judgment because, as a private attorney, Smith is not a state actor subject to liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 155, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978); <em>Catz v. Chalker, </em>142 F.3d 279, 289 (6th Cir.1998). Although private citizens acting in concert with state officials may be subject to \u00a7 1983 liability, <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27-28, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980), Baker offered no factual support or evidence upon which a conspiracy could be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Furthermore, Baker\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed because it is time-barred. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws Aim. \u00a7 600.5805(9) (West Group 2002); <em>Carroll v. Wilkerson, </em>782 F.2d 44, 45 (6th Cir. 1986). Baker complains of events that occurred prior to June 1997. Baker\u2019s complaint, however, was filed on October 23, 2000, well beyond the expiration of the applicable three-year limitations period. Because Baker has failed to articulate any continual unlawful acts or omissions occurring after May 1997, his continuing violation theory fails. <em>See McCune v. City of Grand Rapids, </em>842 F.2d 903, 905 (6th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
