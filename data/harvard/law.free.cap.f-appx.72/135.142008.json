He argues that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level increase in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on his prior robbery conviction. He argues that the Sentencing Commission intended that the 16-level increase should be applied only to those crimes of violence that are also aggravated felonies under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Under the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) and its commentary, a 16-level increase applies if the defendant has a prior conviction for a crime of violence, which expressly includes robbery. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) and comment. (n.l(B)(ii)). Neither \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) nor the comment refers to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) or provides that a crime of violence must also be an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing the 16-level increase based on Reyna-Breceda\u2019s prior robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">For the first time on appeal, Reyna-Breceda also argues that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (2) are unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). ReynaBreceda\u2019s argument is foreclosed. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
