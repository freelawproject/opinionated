SFHA cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in directing judgment as a matter of law (\u201cJMOL\u201d) for Honeywell on its 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim and in awarding Honeywell restitution for unjust enrichment. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with instructions. The parties are familiar with the factual background and history of the case, and we recount only those facts necessary to our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">\n<em>I. Admission of extrinsic evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">The district court did not err in determining that the writing at issue, entitled \u201cAddendum,\u201d was not an integration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The writing contains no integration clause repudiating prior understandings, and ample evidence indicates that the parties both understood, prior to signing the writing, that SFHA only intended to enter into a contract funded by third-party financing, and that SFHA\u2019s ability to pay Honeywell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>was wholly dependent on securing such financing. The trial court was permitted to consider this evidence in determining whether the writing is integrated. <em>Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage &amp; Rigging Co., </em>69 Cal.2d 38, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641, 645 (1968). The evidence demonstrates that the parties did not intend the writing to be the complete embodiment of their agreement. <em>See Masterson v. Sine, </em>68 Cal.2d 222, 65 Cal.Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561, 563-65 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">We review the admission of parol evidence for abuse of discretion, <em>U.S. Cellular Inv. Co. v. GTE Mobilnet, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 929, 938 (9th Cir.2002), and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of the financing condition. Because the writing was not an integration, extrinsic evidence of a consistent additional term was relevant to show the content of the agreement. <em>See </em>Cal.Code Civ. P. \u00a7 1856(b). The financing condition was a \u201cmatter on which the document [was] silent and which [was] not inconsistent with its terms.\u201d <em>Masterson, </em>65 Cal.Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d at 563. The terms of payment in the writing provided only that funds were to be deposited in, and withdrawn from, an escrow account, and gave no indication of the source of the funds. <em>See Severance v. Knight-Counihan Co., </em>29 Cal.2d 561, 177 P.2d 4, 5 (1947) (\u201cThe fact that the contract depended upon a condition precedent could be shown by parol evidence, since the contract did not include express provisions inconsistent with the condition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Honeywell correctly points out that, because integration is a question for the court, the evidence of integration should have been heard outside the presence of the jury. <em>See Brawthen v. H&amp;R Block, Inc., </em>28 Cal.App.3d 131, 104 Cal.Rptr. 486, 491 (1972). Nonetheless, because the evidence relevant to integration was also relevant to the existence of the financing condition, and thus admissible once the court determined that the writing was not integrated, Honeywell suffered no prejudice from the procedure employed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\n<em>II. Sufficiency of the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The district court did not err in rejecting Honeywell\u2019s motion for JMOL\u2014 a decision we review de novo \u2014 because \u201cthe evidence presented at trial [did not] permit[] only one reasonable conclusion\u201d on the question of the existence of a financing condition precedent. <em>Santos v. Gates, </em>287 F.3d 846, 851 (9th Cir.2002). The jury was entitled to consider the parties\u2019 entire course of negotiations from the point at which SFHA issued its Request for Proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d), which included evidence that the RFP itself asked only for project proposals that required no up-front payments; that Honeywell, in multiple presentations to SFHA, represented that its proposal met this requirement, and that it had the ability to secure financing; that the Partnering Agreement between the parties referred only to a project that required \u201c[n]o up-front capital\u201d; that, at an SFHA meeting during which Honeywell representatives were present, an SFHA employee represented that the project would not require SFHA to make any payments to Honeywell because Honeywell would provide the financing; that, at another meeting, a Honeywell representative stated that the project would require \u201cno up-front costs\u201d to SFHA; that, in written correspondence relating to the writing (the Addendum), Honeywell represented that \u201c[n]o up front capital will be required to implement the improvements because the generated savings (guaranteed by Honeywell) serve as the funding source\u201d; that, through its Determination &amp; Order, SFHA only authorized a contract that had \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>fiscal impact to\u201d SFHA and understood that the project would \u201cnot require any initial capital expenditures from the SFHA and [that] all costs must be amortized by the savings produced\u201d; and that, in its first response to an interrogatory from SFHA in this litigation, Honeywell stated that \u201cthe parties agreed that the cost for the energy project would be paid through a financing plan.\u201d The evidence was more than sufficient to allow the jury to infer that Honeywell officials with contracting authority had agreed to a financing condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The financing condition was not satisfied, as a matter of law, by the fact that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) granted SFHA a freeze of its Allowable Utility Compensation Level (\u201cAUCL\u201d), because the terms of payment in the writing required far more capital up front than could be expected from the AUCL freeze. The financing condition was not waived, as a matter of law, by SFHA\u2019s notices to proceed with the project, because substantial evidence suggests that, at that time, both parties expected the financing to materialize, that SFHA may have been relying on Honeywell to secure the funds for the contract payments, and that Honeywell knew full well the state of the discussions over financing. The financing condition was not excused, as a matter of law, by SFHA\u2019s alleged lack of effort to obtain financing, because substantial evidence demonstrates that it was Honeywell\u2019s, not SFHA\u2019s, responsibility to obtain financing, and that financing failed only because of HUD\u2019s takeover of SFHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\n<em>III. Formulation of jury instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Honeywell has waived any error in the formulation of jury instructions by failing to object before the district court. Honeywell never indicated to the district court that it wanted instructions that \u201cit was the SFHA\u2019s burden to prove the alleged condition precedent through clear and unambiguous contract provisions,\u201d and that \u201cthe evidence concerning the affirmative defense of a condition precedent had to be strictly construed against the SFHA.\u201d Honeywell cannot now raise the objection here. <em>See Hammer v. Gross, </em>932 F.2d 842, 847 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">\n<em>IV. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The district court erred in granting JMOL on Honeywell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim because no federal law creates rights on behalf of energy contractors in Honeywell\u2019s position. The only federal statute at issue here is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437g (1996), but that statute is not \u201c \u2018phrased in terms of the persons benefited,\u2019 \u201d <em>Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 </em>U.S. 273, 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002) (quoting <em>Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 692 n. 13, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)), and because the statute was not \u201cintended to benefit the plaintiffs,\u201d it does not create enforceable rights. <em>Legal Servs. of N. Cal., Inc. v. Arnett, </em>114 F.3d 135, 138 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Honeywell also relies on a federal regulation, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 990.107(f) (1996), which does require public housing authorities to pay energy contractors 50% of the savings generated by retrofitting projects. But we recently held that only statutes, not regulations, may create enforceable rights, <em>see Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, </em>335 F.3d 932, 942\u201443 (9th Cir.2003), and so reliance on this regulation is misplaced. Even if regulations could create enforceable rights, as the dissent in <em>Save Our Valley </em>forcefully argues, <em>see id. </em>at 958-60 (Berzon, J., dissenting), we would still hold that the regulation here does not do so because, like the regulation in <em>Save Our Valley, </em>its focus is \u201con the fund recipient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>and its methods of operating the funded program, not any individual affected thereby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 963-64. Honeywell has no viable \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">\n<em>V Allegedly inconsistent verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The district court did not err in determining that the verdict on the breach of contract claim was not inconsistent. Because the jury gave two answers that were legally sufficient to decide the two claims in the case, in addition to two factual findings, the verdict was a general verdict with interrogatories, to be evaluated under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49(b). Because it was \u201creasonably possible to resolve the apparent inconsistency between the answers and the verdict,\u201d the district court properly entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict that SFHA did not breach its contract. <em>See Wilks v. Reyes, </em>5 F.3d 412, 415 (9th Cir.1993). Although there was a valid contract, the jury found a financing condition to that contract\u2019s payment terms, and thus could have found that SFHA did not breach the contract in failing to pay Honeywell. The payment terms in the Addendum did not specify who was to deposit the contract price in the escrow account, and the jury could have reasonably concluded that SFHA breached no duty in failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In light of our conclusion that the \u00a7 1983 claim was not based on any enforceable federal rights, we need not determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict on this claim was inconsistent with its other answers, as the district court found.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\n<em>VI. Equitable relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The district court did not err in awarding equitable relief to Honeywell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the general rule under California law is that public entities are not subject to unjust enrichment claims, <em>see Lundeen Coatings Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Water &amp; Power, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 816, 283 Cal.Rptr. 551, 559 n. 9 (1991), that rule is based on the need to protect public entities from obligations under contracts beyond their legal authority. <em>See Miller v. McKinnon, </em>20 Cal.2d 83, 124 P.2d 34, 37 (1942). Furthermore, although a party who has performed work \u201chas no right of action to recover in quantum meruit the reasonable value thereof\u2019 from a public entity, <em>id., </em>in this case the measure of recovery was not the reasonable value of Honeywell\u2019s work but rather a portion of the cash benefits retained by SFHA as a direct result of Honeywell\u2019s work. We doubt that the California courts would bar recovery under these circumstances. Nor is Honeywell barred from recovery by unclean hands. Honeywell\u2019s conduct does not justify SFHA\u2019s behavior in applying for the AUCL freeze on the basis of the Honeywell contract, receiving the benefits of the AUCL freeze and substantial savings from Honeywell\u2019s energy efficiency improvements, and then keeping the full amount of the savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">In fact, it seems likely that, under California law, Honeywell may be entitled to the full amount of the cash benefit obtained (and retained) by SFHA as a result of its work, rather than simply 50%. <em>See Unilogic, Inc. v. Burroughs Corp., </em>10 Cal.App.4th 612,12 Cal.Rptr.2d 741, 750 (1992) (holding that \u201cthe amount of restitution based upon an unjust enrichment theory depends upon the degree to which [the defendant] was enriched\u201d); <em>see also </em>Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 155 (1937). Although we do not reach this issue because Honeywell has not appealed the equitable award, we invite the district court to reconsider whether Honeywell is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>more than 50% of the AUCL freeze savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\n<em>Conclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law with respect to the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim and REMAND with instructions to dismiss this claim. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in all other respects. Each party shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-11\">.

Co., </em>611 F.2d 261, 264 (9th Cir. 1979), or on what standard of review to apply. Regardless of whether we treat this issue as one of law to be reviewed de novo, or as one of fact to be reviewed for substantial evidence, we find no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\">.
