For the first time on appeal, Leonides-Jaimes argues that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level sixteen levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii), based on a determination that his prior convictions for conspiring to transport and transporting aliens within the United States were alien smuggling offenses. In <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164, 167-68 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1811, 155 L.Ed.2d 689 (2003), this court held that the term \u201calien smuggling offense,\u201d as used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) includes the offense of transporting aliens within the United States. Accordingly, the district court did not err in sentencing Leonides-Jaimes under that guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-26\">Leonides-Jaimes also argues, for the first time on appeal, that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats a prior conviction for a felony or aggravated felony as a sentencing factor and not an element of an offense under 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Leonides-Jaimes\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule that decision. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The district court did not err in sentencing Leonides-Jaimes under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Leonides-Jaimes concedes that both of his appellate arguments are foreclosed. He raises the issues solely to preserve them for possible further review. Because Leonides-Jaimes\u2019s arguments are foreclosed, the district court has filed a motion requesting summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment. The motion is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b984-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
