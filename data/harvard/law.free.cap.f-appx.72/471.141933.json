INS, </em>9 Fed.Appx. 532 (7th Cir. 2001) (unpublished order). In the Board\u2019s denial of the motion, it found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the petitioners established neither changed conditions demonstrating their eligibility for asylum much less a prima facie case that they would face torture if deported. The Ivanovs have once again appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion, <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992), and the law is very clear that the motion may only be granted if the alien establishes changed circumstances based on new material evidence that was not available and, furthermore, which the alien \u201ccould not by the exercise of due diligence\u201d have discovered earlier. <em>Krougliak v. INS, </em>289 F.3d 457, 460 (7th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In support of their motion to reopen, the Ivanovs submitted a number of recent newspaper articles and other documents, which the BIA found illustrated the ongoing tensions between the government of Bulgaria and UMOIlinden <em>a political organization formed to promote the rights of Macedonians living in Bulgaria. </em>The BIA also found that the Ivanovs failed to present sufficient evidence of their membership in UMO-Ilinden, either at their original hearing or accompanying their motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">Because we are of the opinion that the BIA\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, we hold that the Board properly exercised its discretion in concluding that the alleged changed circumstances UMO-Ilinden faces failed to alter the Ivanovs\u2019 eligibility for asylum or establish a prima facie case for protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>under CAT. <em>See Man v. INS, </em>69 F.3d 835, 837 (7th Cir.1995) (\u201c[We] will not disturb the BIA\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.\u201d).
