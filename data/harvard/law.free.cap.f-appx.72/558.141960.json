We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000). The BIA\u2019s factual findings may only be reversed if the evidence compels a different result. <em>Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 891 (9th Cir.2002). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Macias contends that he failed to appear at his April 8, 1999 asylum hearing because he was exhausted from sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, anxiety and depression arising from a recent break-up with his partner of three years, and the day before his hearing he took Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication which causes drowsiness. Macias provided a letter from his physician who treated him on April 7, 1999. The physician stated that Macias suffered from \u201can acute situational depression with a significant anxiety component exacerbated by sleep deprivation and extreme fatigue.\u201d The physician prescribed Xanax, and indicated that the medication would help Macias sleep without overly sedating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The BIA concluded that Macias failed to show exceptional circumstances because according to Macias\u2019s physician, complete sedation is not a side-effect of Xanax, and because Macias was able to go to work despite his depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We conclude that Macias demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at his hearing. <em>Cf. Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 892 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
