We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). Reviewing de novo, <em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Williams contends that his Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free counsel was violated because the trial court denied his request for new counsel after his court-appointed attorney disclosed that he had accepted future employment with the prosecutor\u2019s office and made a comment indicating that Williams\u2019s case was a \u201cfinancial burden.\u201d The California Court of Appeal rejected this claim, reasoning that counsel\u2019s future employment did not create an actual conflict and that, when read in context, counsel\u2019s comment regarding the financial burden indicated only his commitment to Williams\u2019s case. Moreover, the court concluded that counsel\u2019s performance at trial indicated that he was not affected by any conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">We cannot say that the California court\u2019s conclusions were contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law as clearly established by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348-50, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980) (indicating that a habeas petitioner who objected to a potential conflict at trial may obtain relief only by showing (1) that the trial court failed to conduct an adequate inquiry; or (2) that counsel \u201cactively represented conflicting interests\u201d); <em>see also Garcia v. Bunnell, </em>33 F.3d 1193, 1199 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that defense counsel\u2019s acceptance of a job offer from the prosecutor\u2019s office did not create an actual conflict of interest). Thus, the district court properly denied Williams\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
