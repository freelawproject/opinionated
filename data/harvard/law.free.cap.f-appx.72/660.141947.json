Because Barrueta-Macedo\u2019s prior felony qualified for a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d guideline enhancement despite that the term of imprisonment imposed for that prior felony was less than one year, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Barrueta-Macedo was indicted in a one-count indictment charging him with illegal re-entry after deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, with a sentencing enhancement pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) for a prior felony. It is undisputed that Barrueta-Macedo had a prior conviction of two counts of \u201caggravated assault with a deadly weapon and injury to a child,\u201d a felony for which he was sentenced to ten years probation. On May 7, 2002, Barrueta-Macedo pleaded guilty to the federal indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement, which included a four-level Sentencing Guideline enhancement for Barrueta-Macedo\u2019s prior felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) found that Barrueta-Macedo\u2019s \u201caggravated assault\u201d conviction qualified as a felony \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guideline as amended in 2001. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2001). It therefore assessed a 16-level enhancement and indicated that the plea agreement was inapplicable because it was conditioned on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) or (E) applying, rather than (b)(1)(A). Barrueta-Macedo did not file any objections to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">At the sentencing hearing, Barrueta-Macedo never challenged the guideline calculation, but instead relied upon the plea agreement. The district court rejected the plea agreement and held that Barrueta-Macedo would be sentenced \u201cas if it\u2019s an aggravated felony.\u201d The district court stated, \u201cwhether you call it an aggravated felony or a felony with violence, whatever you want to call it. It gives you 16 levels of enhancement every time you come back.\u201d Barrueta-Macedo received a sentence of 27 months imprisonment and 36 months supervised release. This sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) for an enhancement based upon a prior \u201cfelony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">The Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Upshaw, </em>226 F.3d 1101, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000). Where a defendant raises an argument for the first time on appeal, however, his challenge is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Sandoval-Venegas, </em>292 F.3d 1101, 1109 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">On appeal, Barrueta-Macedo argues that the district court erred because his prior offense could not qualify for a 16-level enhancement because it was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the statute. Because Barrueta-Macedo did not raise this argument below, object to the PSR, or challenge the guideline calculation at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>sentencing hearing, his argument is subject only to plain-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Barrueta-Macedo concedes that he had a prior felony conviction for an \u201caggravated assault.\u201d Thus the question on appeal is whether the district court erred in imposing a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under the amended guideline where defendant\u2019s prior offense did not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the statute because defendant received no jail time. Under Section \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), an aggravated felony was defined as including as \u201ca crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment\u201d is at least one year. It is undisputed that Barrueta-Macedo received no jail time for his prior \u201caggravated assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Barrueta-Macedo\u2019s prior \u201caggravated assault\u201d was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2001). This was true whether or not Barrueta-Maeedo\u2019s prior felony was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>United States v. Pimentel-Flores, </em>339 F.3d 959 (9th Cir.2003). Therefore, the term of imprisonment imposed for Barrueta-Macedo\u2019s prior offense was irrelevant. The application note defining a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the guideline explicitly included \u201caggravated assault\u201d felonies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(ii). As such, a 16-level enhancement was therefore appropriate even though Barrueta-Macedo\u2019s prior offense was not a statutory \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Barreuta-Macedo\u2019s sentence is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
