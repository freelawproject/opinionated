R.Civ.P. 8. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-27\">We review a dismissal for failure to comply with Rule 8 for abuse of discretion. <em>Carrigan v. California State Legislature, </em>263 F.2d 560, 565-66 (9th Cir.1959). Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 8(e)(1) requires that \u201c[e]ach averment of a pleading ... be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-28\">Tucker\u2019s Third Amended Complaint appears to allege denial of access to courts and retaliation by prison officials and to claim relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It is not clear, however, how the defendants allegedly violated Tucker\u2019s constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>rights or how the defendants\u2019 actions caused Tucker injury. The complaint details Tucker\u2019s history of litigation in his numerous other pending or past lawsuits, including day-to-day events associated with pursuing those lawsuits, but the complaint does not articulate or identify actions by the defendants which result in alleged constitutional violations. Any factual elements in Tucker\u2019s Third Amended Complaint which might support a cause of action are difficult to discern and are scattered throughout the complaint, rather than composed into a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim.\u201d <em>See Sparling v. Hoffman Constr. Co., </em>864 F.2d 635, 640 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The district court gave Tucker three opportunities to amend his complaint and warned Tucker that his Third Amended Complaint would be his last opportunity to amend. The district court referred Tucker to Fed.R.Civ.P. 84, which provides for an Appendix of Forms that demonstrates the type of simplicity and brevity Rule 8 contemplates. <em>See McHenry v. Renne, </em>84 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.1996). The district court also provided an example of a short, plain statement of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Furthermore, the district court gave specific instructions on how Tucker could amend his complaint to satisfy Rule 8. The district court instructed Tucker to tell the court in short, plain statements: (1) the constitutional right that Tucker believes was violated; (2) the name of the defendant who violated the right; (3) exactly what the defendant did or failed to do; (4) how the action or inaction of the defendant is connected to the violation of Tucker\u2019s constitutional right; and (5) what specific injury Tucker suffered because of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Despite the district court\u2019s guidance and detailed instructions, Tucker failed to amend his complaint to cure its deficiencies. Tucker\u2019s Third Amended Complaint did not provide a short and plain statement of the claim. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Tucker\u2019s complaint for failure to comply with Rule 8. <em>Carrigan, </em>263 F.2d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
