Hinkson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea was unauthorized. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 32(e)(2000). Hinkson\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of that motion is frivolous because it lacks issues of arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for IFP is DENIED. <em>See Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986). Because, in denying Hinkson\u2019s IFP motion, we have determined that the instant appeal is frivolous, the appeal must be DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
