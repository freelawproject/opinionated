Stalder and Johnny Creed appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to dismiss a civil rights complaint filed against them by Harold J. Vincent, Louisiana state prisoner # 73128. The appellants contend that they were entitled to a dismissal based on the defense of qualified immunity because Vincent failed to allege specific facts to support his claim that his transfer to the Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) was in retaliation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>his exercising his right of access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Vincent\u2019s allegations were sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity. Viewing Vincent\u2019s allegations as true, they reflect that he was suddenly transferred to Angola after being incarcerated at the David Wade Correctional Center (Wade) for eleven years and that the transfer occurred shortly after Vincent refused the warden\u2019s demand to end his involvement in the grand jury\u2019s investigation of the Wade facility. His allegations further reflect that Stalder and Creed were required to approve the transfer and, thus, it can be inferred that they were advised of the reason for the transfer or would have questioned the reason for the sudden change in Vincent\u2019s security status. The allegations concerning the circumstances surrounding Vincent\u2019s transfer raise a plausible inference that it was in retaliation for his exercising his right of access to the courts, a clearly established constitutional right. <em>See McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). The district court did not err in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss based on the insufficiency of Vincent\u2019s allegations to defeat their defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">Vincent\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED because he has demonstrated his ability to provide himself with adequate representation on appeal. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1028-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
