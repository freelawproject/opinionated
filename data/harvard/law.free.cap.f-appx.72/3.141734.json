For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The district court dismissed Walker\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition on the ground that Walker filed it in the wrong court. Section 2241 petitions must be filed in the district of incarceration. <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 332 (4th Cir.2000). Walker is incarcerated in Kansas, but filed his \u00a7 2241 petition in the Western District of North Carolina. Although the district court is correct to the extent that Walker\u2019s petition can be properly considered as arising under \u00a7 2241, we find that the claims raised in Walker\u2019s petition are more properly considered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255; <em>Swain v. Pressley, </em>430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977); <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 329-30 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">We note that at the time Walker filed his petition in the district court, his direct criminal appeal was still pending in this court. Thus, a \u00a7 2255 motion would have been premature at that time. Because we recently issued a decision on direct appeal, Walker\u2019s \u00a7 2255-type claims are now ripe for disposition. Before construing Walker\u2019s case as one arising under \u00a7 2255, however, Walker is entitled to notice and opportunity to respond under our decision in <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Accordingly, because we find that Walker seeks to raise claims that are more properly considered under \u00a7 2255, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for further proceedings. On remand, the district court should give Walker the notice required under <em>Emmanuel, </em>consider his claims under \u00a7 2255 (barring any objection from Walker), and provide him a reasonable amount of time to amend the motion to reflect any additional claims for relief. <em>See id. </em>at 649-50. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
