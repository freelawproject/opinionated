Moreland alleged that the doctor was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs and that the wardens ignored Moreland\u2019s requests for proper medical treatment. Moreland also timely petitioned the court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 (1982). A magistrate considered More-land\u2019s petition and recommended that Moreland\u2019s complaint be filed because he satisfied the financial requirements for IFP status, but the magistrate also recommended that the complaint be immediately dismissed as frivolous under section 1915(d). The magistrate found that More-land's claim was essentially a medical malpractice claim and that the suit presented little chance of success on the merits as a civil rights action. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendations; we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Moreland\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-18\">The federal IFP statute is designed to ensure that all litigants, regardless of wealth, have reasonable access to the courts. But once a district court grants leave to proceed IFP, section 1915(d) allows the court to dismiss the complaint prior to service of process if the court is \u201csatisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), to spare defendants the inconvenience and expense of answering a meritless complaint. <em>See Phillips v. Mashburn, </em>746 F.2d 782, 784 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Woodall v. Foti, </em>648 F.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981). Because section 1915(d) \u201cis a broad grant of discretion to the courts regarding management of IFP actions,\u201d we review the dismissal of Moreland\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>for abuse of discretion. <em>Harris v. Menendez, </em>817 F.2d 737, 741 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">A lawsuit is frivolous if \u201c \u2018the plaintiffs realistic chances of ultimate success are slight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 740 (quoting <em>Jones v. Bales, </em>58 F.R.D. 453, 464 (N.D.Ga.1972), <em>aff'd adopting district court opinion, </em>480 F.2d 805 (5th Cir.1973)). This standard, well established in this Circuit, is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), in which the Court said that a frivolous complaint is one that lacks an arguable basis in law or fact. \u201cArguable means capable of being convincingly argued. An action or claim in which \u2018the plaintiff\u2019s realistic chances of ultimate success are slight\u2019 is not one capable of being convincingly argued.\u201d <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 740 n. 5 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">The <em>Neitzke </em>Court held that a complaint that fails to state a claim is not invariably frivolous. <em>Neitzke, </em>109 S.Ct. at 1832. We accept that it is possible, although unusual, for a complaint that fails to state a claim to nonetheless have an arguable basis in law and a fairly good chance of succeeding on its merits. But a complaint\u2019s failure to state a claim is evidence \u2014 perhaps even strong evidence \u2014 of its frivolousness; <em>Neitzke </em>says nothing to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">Regardless of whether a complaint states a claim, determining when an action is frivolous calls on the district court to exercise its discretion. <em>See Kinney v. Plymouth Rock Squab Co., </em>236 U.S. 43, 45, 35 S.Ct. 236, 237, 59 L.Ed. 457 (1915) (court had no duty to grant IFP request, but had authority to do so when \u201cthe case was found not to be frivolous; that is, was considered to be sufficiently meritorious to justify the allowance of the request\u201d); <em>Ex parte Abdu, </em>247 U.S. 27, 30, 38 S.Ct. 447, 448, 62 L.Ed. 966 (1918) (right to proceed IFP not absolute, but dependent on exercise of discretion by appellate court); <em>Washington-Southern Navigation Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia Steamboat Co., </em>263 U.S. 629, 634-35, 44 S.Ct. 220, 222, 68 L.Ed. 480 (1924) (Court allowed indigent seamen right to proceed under admiralty law because under IFP statute \u201clitigants [were dependent] upon the judicial discretion theretofore incident to leave to sue <em>in forma pauperis\u201d). </em>\u201c[Djrawing from his years of experience in reading complaints and living lawsuits from start to finish,\u201d a district judge is uniquely qualified to decide the likelihood that a lawsuit will succeed on its merits. <em>Spencer v. Rhodes, </em>656 F.Supp. 458, 461 (E.D.N.C.), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>826 F.2d 1061 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">The district court determined that Moreland\u2019s complaint set forth no constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Failure to state a claim might signal frivolousness, but we think the complaint does state a constitutional claim. Moreland\u2019s pro se complaint alleges a significant and uncomfortable health problem, repeated efforts to obtain treatment, and a total lack of treatment for the problem; he says defendants were indifferent to his medical needs and invokes the eighth amendment. He also alleges that his condition can be (and in the past has been) successfully treated. Few lapses of medical care rise to the level of a constitutional violation, but the eighth amendment\u2019s proscription of the \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u201d is violated when a defendant\u2019s acts or omissions are \u201csufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). A mere failure to exercise ordinary care in conducting an examination or inadvertence with regard to the provision of medical care may constitute medical malpractice, but is insufficient to support a section 1983 claim of a constitutional violation. <em>See Estelle, </em>419 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. at 292; <em>Hamm v. Dekalb County, </em>774 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th Cir.1985). Still, we are convinced that Moreland alleged enough to take his case arguably beyond an allegation of medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-11\">While the law allows substantial discretion in dismissing actions under the authority of section 1915(d), if a complaint presents an arguable basis in law and asserts something other than fanciful factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>allegations, the district court may not dismiss an action until the court has conducted a \u201csufficient inquiry\u201d to determine whether the plaintiffs realistic chances of ultimate success are slight. <em>Menendez, </em>817 F.2d at 740. Here, the action was dismissed without conducting an inquiry although the complaint presents an arguable basis in law and contains unfanciful facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">Because we believe a district judge, on this record, could not properly conclude that Moreland\u2019s chances of ultimate success in this civil rights action are slight, we find an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Moreland\u2019s action. We vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
