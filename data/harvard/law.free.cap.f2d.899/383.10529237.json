Steve Smith, the Trustee of the Estate of Shearn Moody, Jr. (\u201cTrustee\u201d). Revie failed to comply with the order. On appeal, the district court sustained the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Revie had possession or control of the coin and ordered Revie to pay the Trustee the value of the coin, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-20\">This dispute centers around the whereabouts of a valuable four-dollar gold coin, minted in 1879. These coins, of which there are only ten to fifteen in existence, are so rare as to have a \u201cpedigree\u201d and are worth between $75,000 and $88,000. Re-vie, the bankrupt\u2019s former administrative assistant, had the 1879 Coin in question under his custody and control for approximately two years, until June of 1985 when he claims to have last seen it in a file cabinet stored in a room adjacent to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">Revie\u2019s office was located on the second floor of a residence in Galveston, Texas. In August of 1985, the Trustee and several assistants entered that residence to review the contents of Revie\u2019s office area, including the room in which the 1879 Coin was kept. They found the area was properly safeguarded, but did not find the 1879 Coin. Subsequently, the Trustee initiated this suit against Revie to turnover the 1879 Coin alleged to be in his possession. Alternatively, the Trustee sought to recover the fair market value of the 1879 Coin, based upon a theory of conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">After a hearing, the bankruptcy court found; (1) that the debtor owned the 1879 Coin; (2) that Revie was the last to have custody and control of the coin; (3) that no one who had access to the office knew of the existence or presence of the coin; (4) that there were no burglaries of the house during the relevant time period; and (5) that the coin did not disappear during or after the Trustee\u2019s entry into the office area.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-23\">Additionally, the court found that Revie had concealed the existence of the coin from Jane Ford, the original counsel for the debtor. Ford testified that, in listing assets, Revie had claimed that the estate included a collection of miscellaneous coins, valued at $25,000. In October of 1984, Ford and a Mr. Peterson, the original trustee of the estate, inquired about the coin collection. In response, Revie produced a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>few bent coins of little value, claiming that those coins comprised the entire collection \u2014 except for another gold coin, the Gol-iad coin, which had been lost in the mail and was the subject of a lawsuit against the United States Postal Service. However, in December of 1984 or January of 1985, he produced the 1879 Coin in a federal district court, during the suit regarding the Goliad coin.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">After considering all of the evidence, the bankruptcy court found incredible Revie\u2019s claims that he did not have the 1879 Coin and did not know what happened to it. Accordingly, it ordered him to turnover the coin to the Trustee. Revie failed to do so. On appeal, the district court found that the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings were not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and that there was a legal basis for requiring Revie to pay the Trustee the value of the coin under either 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542(a) or the alternative theory of conversion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court ordered Revie to pay $88,000, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. Revie appeals, claiming that the evidence does not support the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings and that the district court was without jurisdiction to order the relief granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">A. Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The district court entered a judgment for damages against Revie under section 542(a) of the bankruptcy code and the alternative theory of conversion under Texas law. Because we find sufficient evidence to support the conversion claim, we need not reach the question of relief granted under section 542(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The unauthorized and unlawful assumption and exercise of dominion or control over the personal property of another, to the exclusion of or inconsistent with the owner\u2019s rights is recognized in Texas as a conversion. <em>Bankers Life Ins. Co. v. Scurlock Oil Co., </em>447 F.2d 997, 1004 (5th Cir. 1971) (applying Texas law); <em>Bishop v. Geno Designs, Inc., </em>631 S.W.2d 581, 584 (Tex.App.\u2014Tyler 1982, no writ). \u201cConversion may be direct or constructive....\u201d <em>Killian v. Trans Union Leasing Corp., </em>657 S.W.2d 189, 192 (Tex.App.\u2014San Antonio 1983, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.). The wrongful intent to convert another\u2019s property is not an essential element; the defendant need only intend to do an act amounting to conversion. <em>McVea v. Verkins, </em>587 S.W.2d 526, 531 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1979, no writ). \u201c[A] good faith but unauthorized retention of property can be a conversion.\u201d <em>Geders v. Aircraft Engine &amp; Accessory Co., </em>599 S.W.2d 646, 651 (Tex. Civ.App.\u2014Dallas 1980, no writ). Thus, in a suit for conversion, a plaintiff must show only that the defendant wrongfully exercised dominion or control over the property to the exclusion of, or inconsistent with, the plaintiff\u2019s rights, the identity of the property converted, and the value of the property at the time of conversion. <em>See Bishop, </em>631 S.W.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">The bankruptcy court found that Revie was in possession, custody, or control of the coin. That finding must be left undisturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>See Wilson v. Huffman (In re Missionary Baptist Found. of Am.), </em>818 F.2d 1135, 1142 (5th Cir.1987). Given Revie\u2019s misrepresentations regarding the coin and the evidence indicating that he was the only person who had access to and knowledge of the existence of the 1879 Coin, we accept, as did the district court, the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Revie had possession or control of the 1879 Coin at the time of those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">Accepting the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions regarding possession and valuation, the district court found the elements of conversion established when Revie failed to turn the 1879 Coin over to the Trustee. Specifically, the district court found that his inaction amounted to an exercise of control inconsistent with the Trustee\u2019s rights. Revie argues only with the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>lying factual finding regarding possession. Because we do not believe that determination was clearly erroneous, we find that the Trustee was entitled to damages proximately caused by the conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">B. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Revie, however, contends that because the district court was acting as a court of review, it was without jurisdiction to grant any relief beyond the bankruptcy court\u2019s Turnover Order. This argument ignores the jurisdictional bases of the district court\u2019s authority over bankruptcy proceedings. District courts \u201chave original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). Although a district court may refer title 11 cases to bankruptcy judges, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 157(a), it may withdraw, in whole or in part, any title 11 case referred to the bankruptcy court on its own motion or on timely motion of any party for good cause, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 157(d). <em>See Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, </em>777 F.2d 992, 998 (5th Cir.1985). \u201cThe cumulative effect of the grant of original jurisdiction to the district court and its right to withdraw the reference in a bankruptcy ease or related matter ... leaves little doubt that the district court may exercise jurisdiction broadly....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">On August 26, 1986 reference of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy case and all related adversary proceedings, including the suit against Revie, was withdrawn from the bankruptcy court to the district court. While the court apparently considered itself to be acting as an appellate court with regard to the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings, it also was entitled to exercise its original jurisdiction. <em>See In re Powelson, </em>878 F.2d 976, 979-80 &amp; 980 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1989). As an exercise of original jurisdiction, we believe the court had authority to reshape the Trustee\u2019s relief and award damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\">. Although an appeal of the Turnover Order was originally dismissed on the ground that it was an interlocutory order, this court reversed and remanded, finding that the order was final and therefore appealable. <em>Smith v. Revie (In re Moody), </em>817 F.2d 365 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
