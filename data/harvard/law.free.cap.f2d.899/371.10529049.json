The district court denied Aragon\u00e9s\u2019 motion for a declaration that the Sentencing Guidelines are unlawful. Aragon\u00e9s appeals. We affirm as to Aragon\u00e9s and affirm in part and vacate and remand in part as to Hurtado.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\n<em>Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">On December 2, 1988, federal agents knocked on the door of a residence in Houston, Texas. Hurtado came to the door. An agent told Hurtado that they suspected she had large amounts of currency and/or drugs inside the house and asked permission to search it. Hurtado denied the presence of any such items and asked why the agents suspected her. The agent told Hur-tado that they had searched another residence and found evidence of illegal drug activity and that they had reason to believe she was associated with the people who lived there. One of the individuals at the other residence was co-defendant Ara-gon\u00e9s. Hurtado replied that she was merely an acquaintance of those people. After an agent informed Hurtado that her passport had been found at the other residence, she allowed the six agents into her home and told them they could search it.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Hurtado and two agents sat at the dining-room table. Hurtado explained that she understood English and could speak it but could not read it very well. Speaking Spanish, one of the agents summarized a consent-to-search form. The form advises suspects that they have the right to refuse to submit to a search. Another agent instructed the interpreting agent to read the form to Hurtado line-by-line, which he did. Hurtado asked the agent to give the form to her daughter, Alexandria Rengifo (Ren-gifo), who read the form and confirmed what the agent had said. Rengifo later testified that the agent did not translate the form very well but that she did not correct him. Hurtado told the agents that she understood what had been explained to her and gave them permission to search the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">An agent asked Hurtado if there were large amounts of currency, guns, or illegal drugs in the house. She denied the presence of any such items. The agent then asked her if there was any cocaine in the house. She stood up, began crying, and pointed to a kitchen closet. An agent reread the consent form to Hurtado, and Hurtado signed it. The agents found 100 kilograms of cocaine in the closet and 3 additional kilograms of cocaine in a bedroom. An agent then read Hurtado the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and placed her under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Hurtado moved to suppress the cocaine on the ground that her consent to search was involuntary. She also moved to suppress her response to the agent\u2019s question about the presence of cocaine in her home, arguing that she should first have been given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Hurtado testified at the suppression hearing that she has the equivalent of a seventh-grade education in the Colombian schools and had not been aware of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. She also testified that she allowed the agents in her home and consented to the search only because she felt she had no other choice. Hurtado conceded that the agents did not threaten her with physical violence and that the agents brandished no weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The district court denied Hurtado\u2019s motion to suppress. Hurtado was tried before the court on stipulated facts and found guilty. The court sentenced Hurtado to 180 months of incarceration, 5 years of supervised release, and $150 in special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Co-defendant Aragon\u00e9s pleaded guilty to conspiracy to aid and abet the distribution of cocaine and aiding and abetting the laundering of money obtained from unlawful activity. He moved for a declaration that the Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful. The motion was denied. The district court sentenced Aragon\u00e9s to 180 months of incarceration, 5 years of supervised release, and $100 in special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Hurtado and Aragon\u00e9s appeal, raising various grounds for relief. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>district court did not evaluate the voluntariness of Hurtado\u2019s consent to search under the evidentiary standard applicable in this circuit, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part as to Hurtado. We affirm in all respects as to Aragon\u00e9s.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>A. Hurtado\u2019s Consent to Search.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Hurtado argued at the suppression hearing that she did not freely and voluntarily consent to the search of her residence, despite having signed the consent-to-search form. She testified that she allowed the agents to conduct the search only because she felt she had no other choice. She claimed that the agents\u2019 presence in her home, their persistent questioning, the interpreting agent\u2019s imperfect translation of the consent-to-search form, and her limited education and knowledge of her constitutional rights combined to render her consent involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The voluntariness of an individual\u2019s consent to search is a question of fact that is determined by examining the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d 748, 754 (5th Cir.1988). Under the controlling decisions of this circuit, the government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that consent to search was freely and voluntarily obtained. <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 754; <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>746 F.2d 247, 249 (5th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1021, 105 S.Ct. 2032, 85 L.Ed.2d 314 (1985); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>722 F.2d 179, 182 (5th Cir.1983) (citing <em>Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968)). A district-court finding that the defendant voluntarily consented to a search cannot be overturned on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Gonzales, </em>842 F.2d at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In the present case, the district court determined that \u201c[t]he totality of the circumstances shows that Mrs. Hurtado\u2019s consent to search was given knowingly, freely, and voluntarily.\u201d However, the court incorrectly made its finding based on the preponderance of the evidence standard. We have examined the record and cannot unequivocally conclude that the government proved by clear and convincing evidence that Hurtado\u2019s consent to the search was voluntary. The government may well have carried its burden. We are therefore compelled to reverse and remand to the district court so that factfinder can make a determination based on the clear and convincing evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">The United States Supreme Court has indicated that the voluntariness of an individual\u2019s consent to search need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 177 &amp; n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 988, 996, &amp; n. 14, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974); <em>see also Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 176, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2779, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987); <em>but see Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548-49 &amp; n. 12, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 1792 &amp; n. 12, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968) (footnoting several lower court opinions arguably applying the clear and convincing standard). The Court has also adopted the preponderance standard for determining the voluntariness of a custodial confession, <em>Lego v. Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S.Ct. 619, 626, 30 L.Ed.2d 618 (1972), a situation in which the danger of government coercion is as great, if not greater, as in the search-and-seizure context.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">At least five of the Circuit Courts of Appeals have followed the Supreme Court\u2019s lead and adopted the preponderance standard for determining the voluntariness of an individual\u2019s consent to search. <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>869 F.2d 417, 419 (8th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Sebetich, </em>776 F.2d 412, 424 (3d Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1017,108 S.Ct. 725, 98 L.Ed.2d 673 (1988); <em>United States v. Calvente, </em>722 F.2d 1019, 1023 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1021, 105 S.Ct. 2030, 85 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985); <em>United States v. O\u2019Looney, </em>544 F.2d 385, 388 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1023, 97 S.Ct. 642, 50 L.Ed.2d 625 (1976); <em>see also United States v. Block, </em>590 F.2d 535, 539 (4th Cir.1978) (authority to consent to search). Three circuits apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>a \u201cclear and positive\u201d evidence standard, <em>United States v. Recalde, </em>761 F.2d 1448, 1453 (10th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>641 F.2d 425, 429 (6th Cir.1981); <em>Judd v. United States, </em>190 F.2d 649, 651 (D.C.Cir.1951), and three other circuits have applied standards more stringent than the preponderance standard based on the particular circumstances of the case, <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>690 F.2d 869, 875 (11th Cir.1982) (airport stop); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Jaramillo, </em>637 F.2d 1094, 1099 (7th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 862, 101 S.Ct. 166, 66 L.Ed.2d 79 (1980) (consent after illegal detention); <em>Gorman v. United States, </em>380 F.2d 158, 163 (1st Cir.1967) (consent after arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In light of the Supreme Court authority noted above and the conflicts among the Circuits in legally similar situations, en banc reconsideration of the government\u2019s burden of proof would appear to be warranted. If the preponderance standard were applied to this case, we would readily conclude that the district court\u2019s finding of voluntariness was not clearly erroneous. However, we are not at liberty to overturn prior panel precedent. <em>See Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., </em>818 F.2d 423, 425-26 (5th Cir.1987). We therefore are required to vacate and remand to the district court for a determination based on the clear and convincing evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\n<em>B. Hurtado\u2019s Incriminating Statement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Hurtado also contends that the district court should have suppressed her response to the agent\u2019s question about the presence of cocaine in her home because she was not first given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Hurtado claims she was \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes because six agents were interrogating her in a small room of her home. She argues that a reasonable person in her position would not have felt free to leave or to ask the agents to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The current test for determining whether an individual is \u201cin custody\u201d and therefore entitled to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning is found in <em>United States v. Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d 593 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 306, 102 L.Ed.2d 325 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">A suspect is ... \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes when placed under formal arrest or when a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood the situation to constitute a restraint on freedom of movement of the degree which the law associates with formal arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">In this case, Hurtado invited the agents into her home and did not ask them to leave after learning of her right to refuse them permission to search. She admitted that the agents never brandished any weapons and that they did not threaten, coerce, or physically restrain her in any way. She also admitted that no one told her she was under arrest or that she could not leave. Hurtado\u2019s sixteen-year-old daughter was present with her. The fact that the agents were in Hurtado\u2019s home asking probing questions does not by itself indicate a degree of restraint normally associated with formal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">The only articulated support for Hurtado\u2019s claim is that she was nervous and surprised. Hurtado\u2019s apprehension was certainly understandable considering the large amounts of cocaine hidden in her home. However, the psychological pressure Hurtado experienced because she feared the agents might discover her illegal drug activities is irrelevant to the \u201cin custody\u201d determination. <em>See Bengivenga, </em>845 F.2d at 596. We conclude that Hurtado was not \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes when she pointed to the closet containing the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">\n<em>C. Hurtado\u2019s Sentence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Hurtado\u2019s final argument is that the district court should have given her a two-point reduction in her base-offense level under the Guidelines because of her minor role in the offenses. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 3B1.2(a). Her claim to have played only a minor role is based on the contention that the only thing she did was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to safeguard the cocaine. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">An individual must be \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than the average participant in the crime to receive a two-level reduction for being a minor participant. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2(a), application note 3; <em>United States v. Velasquez, </em>890 F.2d 717, 720 (5th Cir.1989). In this case, Hurtado was in possession and control of a large amount of cocaine in her home. The stipulated testimony also shows that Hurtado\u2019s name and handwriting were found in documents connected with cocaine trafficking. The district court\u2019s finding that Hurtado was not substantially less culpable than the average participant in the offenses is therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\n<em>Aragon\u00e9s\u2019 Attacks on the Sentencing Guidelines.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Co-defendant Aragon\u00e9s advances numerous arguments in support of his contention that the Sentencing Guidelines violate due process, that the Sentencing Commission failed to follow its statutory mandate, and that the General Accounting Office study of the potential impact of the Guidelines was a sham. He contends that the Sentencing Guidelines must therefore be struck down in their entirety. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">All of Aragon\u00e9s\u2019 arguments, save two, were expressly rejected in <em>United States v. White, </em>869 F.2d 822 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 3172, 104 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1989). We need not review them here. The two remaining arguments concern the Sentencing Commission\u2019s compliance with its statutory mandate. Ara-gon\u00e9s contends that the Commission violated the mandate by making the imposition of minimum fines and minimum terms of supervised release mandatory under the Guidelines. He maintains that the enabling legislation required the Commission to leave the imposition of fines and supervised release within the sound discretion of the sentencing court. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Aragon\u00e9s does not have standing to challenge the imposition of fines under the Guidelines. The district court did not fine Aragon\u00e9s because he had no assets. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 5E4.2(f). The special assessments imposed on Aragon\u00e9s are not \u201cfines\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines and were levied pursuant to statute. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5E4.3; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">We reject Aragon\u00e9s\u2019 argument that the Commission violated its statutory mandate by requiring the imposition of minimum terms of supervised release for felony convictions. The Commission was given broad authority to implement Congress\u2019 specific goals and policies. <em>White, </em>869 F.2d at 827. Congress directed the Commission to consider such factors as the nature and circumstances of the offense, the need to deter and rehabilitate offenders, and the importance of protecting the public, in establishing guidelines for the imposition of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), 3553(a)(2)(B), (C) &amp; (D), 3583(c). The Commission\u2019s decision to mandate minimum terms of supervised release for felony convictions is entirely consistent with these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">The Guidelines are also consistent with Congress\u2019 goal of reducing, but not eliminating, the discretion of district judges so as to produce greater uniformity in sentencing. <em>See White, </em>869 F.2d at 825. District judges generally must impose supervised release for felony offenders. However, they may forbear imposing supervised release when the circumstances warrant such a departure from the Guidelines. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 5D3.1(a) &amp; application note 1. We conclude that \u201cthe Commission acted well within its broad grant of authority and pursuant to congressional goals and principles\u201d in requiring mandatory minimum terms of supervised release for felony offenders. <em>White </em>869 F.2d at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">The judgment as to Hurtado is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the district court for a determination of whether the government proved by clear and convincing evidence that Hurtado voluntarily consented to the search of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>residence.
