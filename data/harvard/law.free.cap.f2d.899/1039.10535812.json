Newton, a lawyer, to appear before the grand jury and bring the financial documents related to an unidentified client, \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d The government requested \u201c[a]ny and all documents and records relating to the delivery, receipt and disbursement of cashier\u2019s check number 668917 in the amount of $30,200 dated 10/7/87, payable to [Jjerald W. Newton, including but not limited to, cash receipts journal, cash disbursements journal, general ledger, invoices or other books of original entry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Newton moved to quash the subpoena claiming that the subpoena sought information protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. John Doe, the client, moved to intervene and to quash the grand jury subpoena citing similar grounds and alleging that the subpoena violated his sixth amendment right to assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">In response to the motions, the government filed two sealed evidentiary submissions containing grand jury evidence protected from disclosure under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motions to quash, including an <em>in camera </em>presentation to determine the existence of the attorney-client relationship and to establish the confidential nature of the communications between Newton and John Doe. The government responded by presenting testimony <em>in camera </em>to establish the applicability of the crime-fraud exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">On December 11, 1989, the district court denied the motions to quash the subpoena, ruling that the \u201cnecessary particularized showing of the asserted attorney-client privilege\u201d had not been established. The district court further found that even if the attorney-client privilege existed, the government \u201cfulfilled its consequent burden of making the requisite showings pursuant to the two-pronged test establishing the \u2018crime-fraud\u2019 exception.\u201d (Citing <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation (Schroeder), </em>842 F.2d 1223 (11th Cir.1987)). The district court granted John Doe\u2019s motion to intervene and denied his motion to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">On March 7, 1990, the district court granted Newton use immunity and ordered him to testify and produce documents under the terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6002-6003. Later that day, Newton appeared before the grand jury in his personal capacity and as custodian of records for Jerald W. Newton, P.A. Newton refused to answer certain questions or to produce subpoenaed documents, claiming the attorney-client privilege. The government subsequently filed a motion requesting that the district court issue an order to show cause why Newton should not be held in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-14\">At a compulsion hearing on March 8, 1990, the district court ordered Newton to appear before the grand jury and provide complete answers to the questions and to produce the subpoenaed documents ruled on in the December 11, 1989 order on the motions to quash. When Newton stated that he would continue to refuse to answer those questions or provide the requested documents, the district court adjudged Newton to be in direct and continuing contempt for failure to obey the compulsion order. By agreement of the parties, the district court stayed execution of the contempt order pending the determination of this appeal. Newton filed a notice of appeal from the contempt order, and John Doe filed a notice of appeal from the compulsion order. This consolidated appeal follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Newton contends that the identity of John Doe falls within the attorney-client privilege, pursuant to the \u201clast link\u201d doctrine. Because the government is unaware of the identity of John Doe, the issuer of the check, and unaware of the identity of the third party who sent the check, Newton argues that the government cannot establish the existence of the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. According to Newton, the identity of his client is further protected by his obligation under the California Business and Professions Code, \u00a7 6068(e) to maintain the confidences and secrets of his client. Relying upon the ninth and tenth amendments reserving certain powers to the people and to the states, Newton, a member of the California bar, argues that the federal government may not interfere with the regulation of lawyers in California by requiring him to disclose information that the state of California deems privileged. Newton also contends that his refusal to testify is supported by the sixth amendment to the Constitution because the government was required to offer evidence of the necessity of obtaining the information requested and because the subpoena places Newton in an adversarial position against his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">The government contends that the attorney-client privilege does not protect the information it seeks from Newton. The government contends that even if the attorney-client privilege applies, the district court properly found that the crime-fraud exception negates the privilege. The government also contends that the remaining constitutional claims are insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">The issues in this case are (1) whether the district court properly ruled that the attorney-client privilege does not protect the information sought, and (2) whether the information sought is otherwise protected under either the sixth, ninth, or tenth amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-13\">Because it involves a mixed question of law and fact, our standard of review for the district court\u2019s determination of the applicability of the attorney-client privilege is plenary. <em>See United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir.) <em>(in banc), cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-14\">I. Attorney-Client Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"A7fp\">\u201cThe attorney-client privilege exists to protect confidential communications between client and lawyer made for the purpose of securing legal advice.... \u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena of Slaughter, </em>694 F.2d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.1982). This court\u2019s leading case on the attorney-client privilege is <em>United States v. Jones, </em>517 F.2d 666 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Jones </em>holds that a claim of attorney-client privilege requires proof of the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-15\">(1) the asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client; (2) the person to whom the communication was made (a) is [the] member of a bar of a court, or his subordinate and (b) in connection with this communication is acting as a lawyer; (3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed (a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or (ii) legal services or (iii) assistance in some legal proceeding, and not (d) for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-16\"><em>Jones, </em>517 F.2d at 670 (quoting <em>United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>89 F.Supp. 357, 358-59 (D.Mass.1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-17\">The identity of a client and the receipt of fees from a client normally are not privileged. <em>Jones, </em>517 F.2d at 671. In <em>Jones, </em>the court held that the identity of an unknown client is protected by the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>ney-client privilege where disclosure of the identity would also reveal the privileged motive for the client to seek legal advice. <em>Jones, </em>517 F.2d at 674-75. The government sought the names of unidentified clients who had paid substantial attorney\u2019s fees for certain <em>known </em>clients. Because the large amounts of the fee payments might incriminate the unidentified clients, the court found that \u201cthe income tax aspects of the government\u2019s inquiry demonstrate a strong independent motive for why the unidentified clients could be expected to (1) seek legal advice, and (2) reasonably anticipate that their names would be kept confidential.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>517 F.2d at 674. <em>See Baird v. Koerner, </em>279 F.2d at 633 (client identities not discoverable where disclosure of names would disclose motive [advice regarding underpayment of taxes] for retaining counsel). <em>See also United States v. Hodge and Zweig, </em>548 F.2d 1347, 1353 (9th Cir.1977) (privilege exists \u201cwhere the person invoking the privilege can show that a strong probability exists that disclosure of such information would implicate that client in the very criminal activity for which legal advice was sought.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\">This exception to the normal rule that a client\u2019s identity is not privileged falls within what is known as the \u201clast link\u201d doctrine. Under the \u201clast link\u201d doctrine, the identity of a client may become privileged because \u201cit may well be the link that could form the chain of testimony necessary to convict an individual of a federal crime.\u201d <em>Baird v. Koerner, </em>279 F.2d 623, 633 (9th Cir.1960). Since <em>Jones, </em>this court has consistently held that the \u201clast link\u201d doctrine is only applicable to rare situations \u201cwhere the disclosure of fee information would give the identity of a previously undisclosed client/suspect.\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena of Slaughter, </em>694 F.2d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.1982). In essence, the last link doctrine extends the protection of the attorney-client privilege to nonprivileged information \u2014 the identity of the client \u2014 when \u201cdisclosure of that identity would disclose <em>other, </em>privileged communications (e.g., motive or strategy) and when the incriminating nature of the privileged communications has created in the client a reasonable expectation that the information would be kept confidential.\u201d <em>Rabin v. United States, </em>896 F.2d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.1990) (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">The government is unaware of the identity of Newton\u2019s client and the third-party issuer of the $30,200 cashier\u2019s check. In addition to requesting the name of the unidentified client, the government seeks the name of the third-party check issuer, any information the client communicated to the lawyer concerning payment of the cashier\u2019s check, and any information the client communicated to the lawyer concerning two \u201cother\u201d individuals. Newton argues that his client\u2019s identity will provide the last link necessary to indict the client. According to Newton, disclosure of the client\u2019s name will provide additional privileged information about the client\u2019s relationship with the third-party issuer of the check, and possibly the client\u2019s relationship with the target of the government\u2019s money laundering investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">We hold that the district court properly ruled that the attorney-client privilege does not protect information concerning the client\u2019s name and the fees paid. On this record, we are not persuaded that disclosure of this usually nonprivileged information will reveal other privileged information. In fact, the appellant raises interesting legal arguments, but failed to establish in the district court the necessary facts to support the arguments. Because we hold that the attorney-client privilege does not apply to the information regarding client identity and fees, we do not reach the crime-fraud exception issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">According to Newton, his client hired him in 1987 in connection with the client\u2019s indictment in a separate criminal matter. Thus, the client did not seek Newton\u2019s legal advice reasonably anticipating that his name would be kept confidential. In this case, disclosure of the client\u2019s identity will also reveal the fact of prior indictments or criminal record. Such records are public documents and thus not privileged. Disclosure of the client\u2019s identity also will link the client to the still unidentified third per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>son who arranged for the payment of the attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The mere fact that \u201cJohn Doe\u2019s\u201d attorney\u2019s fees were paid by an unidentified third person, however, does not disclose privileged communications, motive, or strategy. On the record in this case, disclosure of the client\u2019s identity will merely reveal the client\u2019s name, and thus the identity is not protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Similarly, this circuit has consistently held that information concerning payment of attorney\u2019s fees is not generally privileged. <em>United States v. Sims, </em>845 F.2d 1564, 1568 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 395, 102 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena of Slaughter, </em>694 F.2d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.1982). Such information is privileged only if \u201cmore than simple fee information will necessarily come to light by compliance with the order, thereby uncovering privileged information.\u201d <em>Slaughter, </em>694 F.2d at 1260. We therefore hold that Newton\u2019s client\u2019s name and the fees paid are not protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">II. Ninth and Tenth Amendment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">Newton argues that disclosure of the information regarding client identity and fees would also breach the California state bar rules of confidentiality in violation of the ninth and tenth amendments to the United States Constitution. This argument fails because questions of attorney-client privilege in this circuit are governed by federal common law. \u201cUnder F.R. Crim.P. 26, the principles of the common law, \u2018as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience,\u2019 govern over state law in matters of evidence, which includes privileges.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>517 F.2d at 670. A state\u2019s attorney-client privilege rules cannot prevent compelled disclosure where federal law precludes applicability of the common law privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-9\">III. Sixth Amendment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">Newton also argues that the order to compel his testimony violates his client\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel. He argues that the sixth amendment compels the government to make a preliminary showing that the information is essential and cannot be acquired through another source. This court has repeatedly rejected the argument that the sixth amendment requires the government to make a preliminary showing of relevance and need before a lawyer can be compelled to appear before a grand jury. <em>Eg. United States v. Sims, </em>845 F.2d 1564, 1569 (11th Cir.1988); <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation (Harvey), </em>769 F.2d 1485, 1487 (11th Cir.1985). We again decline to do so, despite contrary rulings in other circuits. <em>See, e.g., In re Special Grand Jury Number 81-1 (Harvey), </em>676 F.2d 1005, <em>vacated </em>697 F.2d 112, 113 (4th Cir. 1982) (opinion vacated because Harvey became a fugitive).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-14\">Newton also argues that requiring disclosure in this case would violate his client\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel of choice. Doe, however, has counsel at this time. Furthermore, nothing in the record indicates that, should disclosure be required, the relationship between Doe and Newton would be severed. Nor can we conclude from the record that, should the relationship be severed, Doe will be unable to secure other counsel. In virtually identical circumstances, this court held that such a sixth amendment claim was not ripe for adjudication. <em>See Rabin v. United States (In re Grand Jury Proceedings), </em>896 F.2d 1267, 1277 (11th Cir.1990). We therefore hold that Newton\u2019s \u201csixth amendment right to counsel of choice\u201d claim is not yet ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-16\">The district court properly found that the attorney-client privilege does not protect the client\u2019s identity or the fees paid \u2014 information which is generally nonprivileged\u2014 unless such information will reveal other, privileged information. Likewise, such information is not protected from disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>under the sixth, ninth, or tenth amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Having found that the district court properly ruled on the issues regarding client identity and fees, we remand this case to the district court to allow it to fully and separately address issues regarding other questions and documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding of contempt and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">.The government requested information along the following lines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-14\">1.
