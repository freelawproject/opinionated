Exactly seventeen years and nine months later, on March 12, 1996, the Grand Jury for Baltimore County indicted Petitioner, John Derry, along with three co-defendants, on charges of murder, kidnaping and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with Schwandtner\u2019s apparent homicide. At the close of a suppression hearing held prior to trial, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of an audio-cassette recording of a February 4, 1996 conversation between himself and a police informant based upon the court\u2019s finding that the recording equipment used by the informant was never affixed with a State Police registration number pursuant to \u00a7 10-411(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The relevant facts adduced at the suppression hearing follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">During 1995, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was using one Charles Wilhelm as a paid informant in a number of federal criminal investigations. In the course of those investigations, Wilhelm provided the F.B.I. with information implicating himself and Petitioner in a 1978 homicide in Baltimore County. The federal agents contacted Detective Michael Downes, a Baltimore County Police Officer assigned to work with the F.B.I., and apprised him of the information they had received. In an effort to obtain more information about the homicide, law enforcement officials decided to intercept and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>record certain conversations between Derry and Wilhelm. Accordingly, on December 22, 1995, Baltimore County Police executed a written agreement with Wilhelm in which the latter agreed to participate in and assist with the investigation of the 1978 homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Sometime before Wilhelm conducted the interceptions, Detective Downes contacted the Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to ensure compliance with the Maryland wiretap provisions. He was advised that any recording equipment to be used in connection with the investigation should be registered with the Maryland State Police. To this end, he contacted Detective Jack Cover, a member of the Baltimore County Police Department\u2019s Intelligence Unit and the officer responsible for completing the registration of the Department\u2019s wiretapping and electronic surveillance equipment pursuant to \u00a7 10-411. Cover told Downes that he \u201cshould get the serial numbers, model numbers off the equipment to be used and give it to him and have him register the equipment, as is his duty, with the State Police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Although the F.B.I. owned the recording equipment that was to be used to investigate Petitioner\u2019s role in the 1978 homicide, it was Wilhelm who retained possession of the individual devices, since he had been using them in connection with his participation in the federal investigations. Some time in mid-January, 1996, the F.B.I. agreed to provide the manufacturers\u2019 serial numbers needed to identify and register the individual devices with the Maryland State Police. On January 15, 1996, the F.B.I. informed the Baltimore County Police Department of the serial numbers associated with the electronic recording equipment Wilhelm was using. Detective Downes immediately contacted Detective Cover and asked him to register four pieces of equipment: \u201ca large recorder, ... a Panasonic video camera and the ensuing recording device, and ... a small mini-cassette, Panasonic, that Mr. Wilhelm had on his person.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That same day, Detective Cover told Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Downes that the equipment had been registered, effective January 15,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">At some point during the ensuing weeks, F.B.I. technicians installed a video camera and VCR recorder, two of the recording devices registered by Detective Cover, in the back of a sub shop owned by Wilhelm in order that he might intercept and record a meeting arranged with Derry for February 3, 1996. According to plan, Wilhelm video-taped that meeting himself, by means of a remote control device that he kept on his person. The following day, Wilhelm tape recorded a second conversation with Derry during a get-together in Wilhelm\u2019s home. It was during that conversation, on February 4, 1996, that Petitioner allegedly confessed to his involvement in the 1978 murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The device used by Wilhelm to intercept and record this crucial communication was the Panasonic Recorder, Model Rn 36, that Wilhelm had kept hidden in his pocket during the conversation. Again, the micro-cassette recorder used on February 4th to record Petitioner\u2019s admissions had been registered with the State Police as of that date. Petitioner moved to suppress, contending that the issued serial number for the registered device had never been \u201caffixed or indicated\u201d on the device in question within the meaning of \u00a7 10-411(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The trial court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the February 4, 1996 recording, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">Obviously, to me, sure, there was a serial number on the equipment. It was the manufacturer\u2019s serial number. It is not the number contemplated by the statute, and that, I think, is what turns the trick in favor of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">There is no way that that equipment was ever marked with the Maryland State Police issued number BA1786. It was never affixed to the item of equipment, nor as far as I know, any of the other equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">So it seems to me it is absolutely fatal to the State\u2019s introduction of this tape. It doesn\u2019t come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">It passes on every other standard, every other question we examined it on, but it doesn\u2019t come in because it was not registered pursuant to 10-411, Sub-section C, end of case.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The State filed an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, invoking \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3) as its authority to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether the State had the right to file such an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>under Maryland law was not argued by either party before the intermediate appellate court, nor did the court, in its unreported opinion, address the issue in any other way than to acknowledge that the State\u2019s appeal was interlocutory, along with a footnote citing to and quoting \u00a7 12-302(c)(3). The Court of Special Appeals held that the resolution of the State\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s grant of suppression was controlled by <em>Battaglia v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 349, 705 A.2d 36 (1998), a decision unavailable to the Circuit Court at the time of its ruling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <em>Battaglia </em>court had determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">the registration requirement outlined in \u00a7 10-411, as the State contends, is a provision intended to facilitate administrative goals. We find nothing within the legislative history or the language of the Act to indicate that the General Assembly intended violations of this provision to result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the suppression of evidence. Therefore, the State was not required to prove that the device was registered, and the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence. It goes without saying that every device obtained to intercept and record wire, oral, and electronic communications is to be registered pursuant to Maryland law. Whether the device was registered, however, does not affect the admission of the recorded communication as evidence. Admissibility is governed by \u00a7 10-408. Thus, because the registration requirement does not affect the admission of evidence, the party seeking to introduce the recording is not required to prove the device is registered pursuant to \u00a7 10-411 before having the recording admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 356, 705 A.2d at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In direct reliance on <em>Battaglia, </em>the Court of Special Appeals rejected Petitioner\u2019s claim that the cassette recording of his February 4, 1996 conversation with Wilhelm was suppressed correctly by the trial court based upon the State\u2019s failure to comply with the affixation requirement of \u00a7 10-411(c). Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, ruling that \u201c[u]nder <em>Battaglia, </em>the recording of [DerryJ\u2019s conversation is admissible.\u201d We granted Derry\u2019s petition for certiorari, which presented the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">Did the suppression court correctly grant Derry\u2019s motion to suppress a tape recorded conversation based on its finding that the device used for the interception and recording was not properly registered in compliance with Section 10-411 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">After oral argument before this Court and subsequent to our initial conferencing of the suppression issue upon which we granted certiorari, it became clear that there was a genuine issue as to whether the State is authorized to appeal the suppression of an intercepted communication at an interlocutory stage of the trial proceedings where the suppression was ordered pursuant to the Maryland Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act (hereinafter referred to by its full name, or \u201cthe Wiretap Act,\u201d \u201cthe Maryland Act,\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>this issue had not yet been raised or argued during judicial review of the present case was of no weight given that the existence <em>vel non </em>of the State\u2019s right of appeal directly involves the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court of Special Appeals in hearing and deciding this case in the first place. As we stated in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>287 Md. 524, 527-28, 413 A.2d 1337, 1339 (1980), \u201cthe lack of [subject matter] jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including initially on appeal.\u201d Moreover, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction need not be raised by a party, but may be raised by a court <em>sua sponte. See Duffy v. Conaway, </em>295 Md. 242, 254-55 n. 8, 455 A.2d 955, 961 n. 8 (1983) (reiterating that subject matter \u201cjurisdiction is a matter which, if noticed, will be addressed by a court even though it was not raised by any of the parties\u201d (citing <em>Biro v. Schombert, </em>285 Md. 290, 293, 402 A.2d 71 (1979); <em>Smith v. Taylor, </em>285 Md. 143, 147, 400 A.2d 1130 (1979); <em>State v. McCray, </em>267 Md. 111, 126, 297 A.2d 265 (1972))). We therefore rescheduled this case for supplemental briefing and reargument by Petitioner and the State concerning the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Whether the State is authorized under the language of Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Section 12-302(c)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or under any other law, to appeal from an order of a circuit court, entered pursuant to Sections 10-405 and l(M08(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, suppressing the contents of a wire, oral, or electronic communication on the ground that the communication was intercepted in violation of the Maryland Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">If the answer to this question is negative, the Court of Special Appeals lacked jurisdiction over the instant case. The consequences of such would be that our grant of certiorari would be rendered improvident and that we would be compelled to dismiss the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">With the refocusing of our inquiry upon the threshold issue of appellate subject matter jurisdiction, the case before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>us essentially boils down to a question of statutory interpretation involving two separate provisions of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, namely \u00a7 10-408(i) within the Wiretap Act, and \u00a7 12-302(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Of utmost importance is the fact that the Circuit Court\u2019s order of suppression was grounded solely upon the Wiretap Act. Although, as noted earlier, Petitioner offered other bases for his motion to suppress, including some constitutional claims, the suppression hearing focused entirely upon the statutory provisions under the Act. Again, however, the State did not rely upon the Wiretap Act in filing its interlocutory appeal of the suppression court\u2019s decision, but instead invoked \u00a7 12-302(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">As this Court repeatedly has made clear, the paramount goal of statutory interpretation is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>353 Md. 683, 694, 728 A.2d 698, 703 (1999); <em>Blondell v. Baltimore Police, </em>341 Md. 680, 690, 672 A.2d 639, 644 (1996). The legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself, through its very own words. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>353 Md. 596, 606, 728 A.2d 180, 184 (1999); <em>Marriott Employees v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997). As a rule, we view the words of a statute in ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood. <em>See Sacchet v. Blan, </em>353 Md. 87, 92, 724 A.2d 667, 669 (1999); <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995). If the words of a statute clearly and unambiguously delineate the legislative intent, ours is an ephemeral enterprise: we need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads. <em>See Marriott Employees, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d at 458. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Even so, we do not view the plain language of a statute in a vacuum. As we have often reiterated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body. The Court will look at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\"><em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999) (quoting <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992) and omitting citations).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Our construction of the two statutes involved in the present case need not venture far beyond their text. Despite a theoretically arguable ambiguity in one of the statutes, we believe the plain language of each unmistakably manifests its legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Both Petitioner and the State acknowledge that although the Wiretap Act expressly allows for the exclusion of evidence, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-405 and 10-408(i), it provides no right of appeal of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress. The only explicit provision for an appeal under the Act states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">In addition to any other right to appeal, <em>the State shall have the right to appeal from, the denial of an application for an order of approval, </em>if the prosecuting attorney shall certify to the judge or other official denying the application that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the date the order was entered and shall be diligently prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apj\">\u00a7 10\u2014408(i)(3) (emphasis added). The Act thus lacks any express provision authorizing the State to appeal a trial court\u2019s grant of suppression pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10\u2014408(i)(l) and (2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>329 Md. 494, 505, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>620 A.2d 886, 892 (1993). (\u201cThis Court has regularly held that where the Legislature in a statute expressly authorizes a particular action under certain circumstances, the statute ordinarily should be construed as not allowing the action under other circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Nor could such a right of appeal reasonably be implied in light of certain legislative history leading up to the Wiretap Act\u2019s original passage in 1977. At one point during its drafting, \u00a7 10\u2014408(i)(3) included the following provision: \u201c[T]he State shall have the right to appeal from <em>an order granting a motion to suppress made under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, or </em>the denial of an application for an order of approval.... \u201d The italicized text, however, was excised entirely from the statute before its enactment. <em>See </em>1977 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 692, \u00a7 3, at 2815. Hence, its explicit language and the unmistakable intention implicit in its legislative history irrefutably indicate that \u00a7 10\u2014408(i) of the Wiretap Act in no way enables the State to appeal immediately the suppression of evidence based thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Unfortunately for the State, it can fare no better under \u00a7 12-302(c)(3) which empowers the State to file an interlocutory appeal of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress evidence, yet only in certain criminal cases and under strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>limited circumstances. The statute, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u00a7 12-302. Right of appeal from final judgments\u2014Exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u00edj\u00ed <em>% % %</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">(c) in a criminal case, the State may appeal as provided in this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">iH <em>% % </em>:ji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">(3) (i) in a case involving a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 643B of Article 27, and in cases under \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 286A of Article 27, <em>the State may appeal from a decision of a trial court that excludes evidence offered by the State or requires the return of property alleged to have been seized in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Maryland, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights. </em>[Emphasis added.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The crux of the proper construction of this statute lies in the meaning of the text we have italicized immediately above. Both parties recognize that our analysis depends principally upon whether the phrase \u201calleged to have been seized in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Maryland, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights\u201d modifies both \u201cevidence offered by the State\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d or, conversely, qualifies only the latter term. It is, of course, predictable that the parties stand on opposite sides of these two possible interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Petitioner asserts that the plain language of \u00a7 12-302(c)(3)(i) unambiguously restricts the State\u2019s authority to appeal a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence to those cases in which, <em>inter alia, </em>the court\u2019s exclusion is based upon a \u201cviolation of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Maryland, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The State counters that its license to appeal a suppression order is much broader in the criminal cases specified. Seizing. upon \u00a7 12\u2014802(c)(3)(i)\u2019s employment of the conjunction \u201cor,\u201d the State argues that the key phrase regarding state and federal constitutional violations, by virtue of its disjunctive separation from \u201ca decision of a trial court that excludes evidence offered by the State,\u201d <em>id., </em>limits only the State\u2019s authority to appeal a court\u2019s decision that \u201crequires the return of property,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We agree with Petitioner. The General Assembly patently intended that the limitation of interlocutory appeals to issues of constitutional magnitude apply to a trial court decision that <em>either </em>\u201cexcludes evidence\u201d or \u201crequires the return of property.\u201d The disjunction focused upon by the State between these two phrases relates only to their representing the two distinct subject matters of a criminal defendant\u2019s pretrial motion(s) whose granting by the court may possibly be appealed by the State on an interlocutory basis. The trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence or requirement that property be returned are conjoined, however, in the respect that the court\u2019s finding of a constitutional violation is a necessary precondition to the availability to the State of an interlocutory appeal in the specified criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">As a purely textual matter, \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3)(i)\u2019s limitation of interlocutory appeals to decisions of constitutional law could certainly apply exclusively to return of property cases. We can see no sensible reason, however, why the Legislature would have embraced such an intention. Decisions requiring the return of property appear to embody no significant legal distinction from judgments of evidentiary exclusion so as to restrict the availability of interlocutory appeal for the former more so than for the latter. Moreover, it cannot be doubted, first, that the number of criminal prosecutions involving a court-ordered return of property is far lower than those in which the court issues a pretrial order excluding evidence and, second, that a court\u2019s requiring the State to return property would very, if not most, often be based on constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>principles,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> while a trial court may exclude evidence on a myriad of non-constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Hence, to the extent that a concern for judicial economy partially underlies \u00a7 12-302(c), return of property decisions would not appear to warrant a more stringent limitation of immediate access to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Reading \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3), to permit the State to challenge by interlocutory appeal only constitutionally based exclusions of evidence is more consonant with the long-time unavailability of interlocutory appeals that served as precedent to the statute\u2019s original passage in 1982. Prior to that year, Maryland law afforded the State no opportunity to pursue an interlocutory appeal in a criminal case. It was against this backdrop that the General Assembly determined to create a right of interlocutory appeal for the State in only a limited number of criminal prosecutions while explicitly restricting this right in other ways. Because, again, evidentiary rulings arise innumerably during litigation between the State and criminal defendants, bestowing upon the prosecution the right to challenge every such ruling, even with the proviso that all other prerequisites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>within \u00a7 12-302(c)(3) must be satisfied, would reflect an expansiveness directly contrary to the Legislature\u2019s ostensibly cautionary approach. We therefore believe the more reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3) is that its limitation to constitutional issues, like all other limitations within the statute, applies to every exercise by the State of its right to interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Although we find that the language of \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3)(i) reveals a legislative intent to deny the State a right of interlocutory appeal of a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence on non-constitutional grounds, the legislative history brought to this Court\u2019s attention by the State only confirms, rather than dispels, the correctness of our determination. The State points out that within the Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s bill file on Senate Bill 39, the 1982 legislative proposal to create \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3), <em>see </em>1982 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 493, there appears a summary explaining the effect of the proposed amendment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">The bill allows the State to appeal from a pretrial ruling by the Court to <em>exclude evidence obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. </em>The bill is aimed at those cases in which the Judge excludes a defendant\u2019s confession, physical evidence (such as drugs), or any evidence which is at the heart of the State\u2019s case.

This passage strongly refutes the State\u2019s position before this Court that \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3)(i) was aimed at allowing the State an interlocutory appeal of <em>any </em>exclusion of evidence critical to the prosecution. On the contrary, the legislative history of \u00a7 12-302(c)(3) makes all the more evident that through its enactment the General Assembly sought to subject to immediate judicial review at the State\u2019s request only constitutionally based suppressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The State offers an alternative rationale for maintaining its right to an interlocutory appeal of the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of suppression. It contends that if, as we hold, \u00a7 \u2019 12-302(c)(3)(i) requires in part that a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence be based on state or federal constitutional grounds in order for the State\u2019s right to file an interlocutory appeal to vest, a suppression based upon the Wiretap Act suffices for such purposes because of its \u201cconstitutional underpinnings.\u201d Specifically, the State argues,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">The ultimate purpose of the statutory scheme established by Maryland\u2019s Wiretap Act is to protect constitutional privacy interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">i|; \u00edH \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Because suppression under the Wiretap Act is designed to further important constitutional interests, the grant of a suppression motion under the Act should be construed to fall within the ambit of Section 12\u2014302(c)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\"><em>% </em>ifc jjj</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">The harsh remedy of suppression of reliable evidence is presumably available under the Act only because of the constitutional underpinnings of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Supplemental Brief of Respondent at 8-9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">We reject this argument. It is true that specific provisions of the Wiretap Act purposely contain minimum protections of the constitutional rights to privacy of Maryland citizens. This Court has itself made such an observation on earlier occasions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bailey, </em>289 Md. 143, 153-54, 422 A.2d 1021, 1027 (1980). Yet we have likewise explained.that a good many of the provisions in the Act were intended to safeguard the privacy of certain communications in this State in ways more substantial than ensured by the United States and Maryland Constitutions or by the federal statutory precursor to the Wiretap Act, namely Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which was passed in 1968, <em>see </em>Pub.L. No.90-351, tit. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 801-04, 82 Stat. 197, and codified at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>that time as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 (hereinafter \u201cTitle III\u201d). <em>See Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 69, 591 A.2d 481, 483 (1991); <em>Wood v. State, </em>290 Md. 579, 583, 431 A.2d 93, 95 (1981); <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>289 Md. 635, 641, 426 A.2d 916, 920 (1981). <em>See also </em>Richard P. Gilbert, <em>A Diagnosis, Dissection, and Prognosis of Maryland\u2019s New Wiretap and Electronic Surveillance Law, </em>8 U. Balt. L.Rev. 183, 220-21 (1979) (stating that the Wiretap Act \u201cas written guarantees to the people of Maryland, insofar as the state, itself, is concerned, greater protection from surreptitious eavesdropping and wiretapping than that afforded the people by the Congress.\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For instance, while it is both constitutionally permissible, <em>see Lopez v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 427, 438-40, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 1387-89, 10 L.Ed.2d 462 (1963),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as well as lawful under Title III, <em>see </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c) and (d), to intercept and record a conversation as long as at least one party consents to such and the purpose for such is not otherwise unlawful, the Maryland Act generally requires the prior consent of all parties to a conversation in order for any interception or recording thereof to be lawful, <em>see </em>\u00a7 10\u2014402(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It may be the case that \u00a7 10-411, the provision of the Wiretap Act originally in question in the present case, was also designed to further the goals of protecting individual persons\u2019 privacy interests. However true that may be, \u00a7 10-411, as the State concedes, was not itself designed to ensure <em>constitutional </em>rights to privacy. The Wiretap Act\u2019s inclusion of provisions furthering interests and rights not constitutional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ly required undermines the State\u2019s alternative argument in this case. Because the Act does not merely codify constitutional requirements in the area of communications privacy, violations of certain of its provisions, like \u00a7 10-411, constitute statutory transgressions and nothing more. As we have already determined, a suppression decision pendent upon a violation of statutory law alone cannot trigger the State\u2019s right to interlocutory appeal under \u00a7 12-302(c)(3).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Furthermore, as discussed earlier, prior to enacting the Wiretap Act in 1977, the Legislature deliberately struck from \u00a7 10-408(i) the right of the State to appeal instantly a suppression of evidence based upon a violation thereunder. If, in passing \u00a7 12-302 in 1982, the General Assembly were intending to reverse its legislative judgment five years earlier that the State should not be afforded the right to immediately appeal the granting of a motion to suppress based upon the Wiretap Act, we do not believe it would have done so in such an oblique and cryptic manner. We thus do not, as the State would have us, view \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(3)(i) as abstrusely filling in supposed \u201cgaps\u201d in the interlocutory review of court-ordered suppressions of intercepted communications when those \u201cgaps\u201d were intentionally left open by the Wiretap Act itself. Again, interlocutory appeals have always been, and still remain, the exception rather than the rule. It is not the province of this Court, but that of the Legislature, if it deems such action appropriate, to add to the limited list of those decisions subject to interlocutory judicial review a trial court\u2019s suppression of evidence under the Wiretap Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In light of our decision that, as a matter of procedure, the State did not have the right to file an interlocutory appeal of the grant of suppression in this case, there technically is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>substantive matter before this Court. We nevertheless are compelled to address a critical threshold issue underlying the State\u2019s original appeal. Although not decided by the trial court nor argued by either party during each\u2019s respective appeal, this issue warrants our attention given the absence heretofore of any ruling by this Court concerning \u00a7 10-411<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and in light of certain pronouncements by the Court of Special Appeals -with respect to this statutory provision. In short, the State is <em>not </em>compelled by Maryland law, contrary to existing precedent in force in courts below, to register <em>\u201cevery </em>device obtained to intercept and record wire, oral, and electronic communications,\u201d <em>Battaglia v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 349, 356, 705 A.2d 36, 40 (1998) (emphasis added). Rather, law enforcement agencies and officials in Maryland are required to register only those devices \u201cwhose design renders them <em>primarily </em>useful for the purpose of the <em>surreptitious </em>interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications which are owned by them or possessed by or in the control of the agency, their employees or agents.\u201d \u00a7 10-411(a) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We note for guidance in future cases involving evidence of a communication obtained through wiretapping or electronic surveillance that the applicability of \u00a7 10-411 to the particular equipment used to intercept and record that communication is an important threshold inquiry for Maryland trial courts to consider in deciding a motion to suppress filed pursuant to the Wiretap Act. For instance, in the present case, it is questionable whether the Panasonic micro-cassette recorder, model number Rn 36, used by Wilhelm to intercept and record Petitioner\u2019s inculpatory statements, is the type of device that must be registered under \u00a7 10-411. It may in fact fall outside the class of devices circumscribed by the Legislature in initially passing the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act of 1977. In other words, the device used by Wilhelm may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>an item whose design renders it <em>primarily useful for surreptitious interception. </em>If so, the State never had any duties under \u00a7 10-411 with respect to the recorder in the first place.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Petitioner asserts that \u201cthere can be no misinterpretation of the legislative intent of the requirement of the registration of <em>every </em>device obtained to intercept and record wire, oral, and electronic communications.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Petitioner\u2019s position is grounded on the same general misconception expressed in <em>Battaglia </em>that <em>all </em>devices capable of intercepting or recording wire, oral, or electronic communications are circumscribed by Maryland\u2019s wiretap and electronic surveillance law. Under such a regime, law enforcement agencies and officials in Maryland could not even possess, let alone use in their investigations, <em>any </em>intercepting or recording device without registering it with the State Police within ten days of coming into its possession. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10\u2014403(b)(4) (requiring police authorities to register all covered recording devices with the State Police in accordance with \u00a7 10-411 in order to render their mere possession of such devices lawful under the statute). Were such the law, untold numbers of clerks, secretaries, and officers in police departments throughout this State would b\u00e9 forbidden to keep at their desks run-of-the-mill stereo/tape recorders unless they register them. Such results could hardly have been the intent of the General Assembly in passing the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As noted earlier, Maryland\u2019s Wiretap Act was closely modeled on Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Streets Act, passed by the United States Congress in 1968.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In proscribing the possession, manufacture, assembly and sale of certain electronic surveillance devices, the Wiretap Act employs virtually the exact same definition as the federal statute, aside from the commercial or mail nexus constitutionally required for the federal regulation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And although Title III does not contain a provision requiring the registration of intercepting and recording devices used by police authorities in their investigation of crime, the registration requirement in the Maryland Act tracks almost identically the language of the federal statute as it relates to defining such devices.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Various federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the type of device whose design renders it \u201cprimarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2512(l)(b) may well prove instructive as to the appropriate interpretation of the identical language found in \u00a7 10-411(a), directly reflecting the latter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>purposeful borrowing from Title III. <em>See Kassap v. Seitz, </em>315 Md. 155, 164-65, 553 A.2d 714, 718 (1989) (explaining that because \u201c[w]e have often recognized that the Act finds its genesis in and is substantially patterned after Title III ... we have on occasion sought guidance from federal cases interpreting or applying Title III\u201d (citing <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 15, 21-24, 537 A.2d 612, 614, 616-18 (1988) and other cases)). <em>Cf. Beatty v. Trailmaster, </em>330 Md. 726, 738 n. 8, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 n. 8 (1993) (reiterating that where Maryland rule is derived from federal rule, judicial interpretations of federal rule are persuasive as to meaning and proper application of Maryland rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The federal Courts of Appeal that have been called upon to construe the meaning of the phrase \u201cprimarily useful for ... surreptitious interception\u201d have made clear that its language contemplates a fairly narrow range of intercepting and recording devices. For example, in <em>United States v. Shriver, </em>989 F.2d 898 (7th Cir.1992), in considering Title Ill\u2019s application to modified or \u201ccloned\u201d satellite television descramblers, the Seventh Circuit explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0S\">Congress expanded the scope of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 2512 in 1986 to include electronic communications. Congress, though, left untouched the rest of the statute, including the terms \u201csurreptitiously\u201d and \u201cprimarily\u201d that are found in both \u00a7 2512(l)(a) and (b). Therefore, as it exists today, \u00a7 2512 still pertains to only a small category of electronic devices the designs of which render them sufficiently invasive or devious in purpose to warrant criminal prosecution....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGk\"><em>Id. </em>at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We also draw attention to a particularly insightful passage from the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Schweihs, </em>569 F.2d 965 (5th Cir.1978), where the unanimous three-judge panel reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">Section 2512(l)(b) is narrowly drawn. It renders criminally liable \u201cany person who willfully ... possesses ... any electronic ... device, knowing or having reason to know that the design of such device renders it primarily useful for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire or oral communications.... \u201d This statutory language reflects a careful and studied congressional decision to leave untouched the production, distribution, and possession of electronic equipment designed for regular use in varied nonsurreptitious activities, even though the equipment is capable of being used in a surreptitious manner, and yet to ban a narrow category of devices which by virtue of their design characteristics are <em>primarily </em>useful for eavesdropping and wiretapping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">The statute\u2019s legislative history reveals that Congress intended to ban such devices as martini olive transmitters, spike mikes, and microphones disguised as wristwatches and fountain pens, without prohibiting possession of a legitimate electronic device merely because it is small or may be used for wiretapping or eavesdropping. \u201cTo be prohibited, the device ... [must] possess attributes that give predominance to the surreptitious character of its use, such as the spike in the case of the spike mike or the disguised shape in the case of the martini olive transmitter____\u201d S.Rep.

State, </em>323 Md. 65, 69, 591 A.2d 481, 483 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>284 Md. 625, 627-28, 399 A.2d 597, 599 (1979). Although the Maryland Act was modeled on the federal statute and closely tracks its provisions, the Maryland Legislature made several of the provisions of the Act more restrictive than their federal counterparts. <em>See Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 69, 591 A.2d at 483; <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>289 Md. 635, 641, 426 A.2d 916, 920 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">. In <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 427, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 10 L.Ed.2d 462 (1963), the United States Supreme Court considered a challenge under the Fourth Amendment to the admissibility of a tape-recording of a conversation between the defendant and a government agent that was made by the agent by use of a device planted on his person. In rejecting this constitutional challenge, the Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">Once it is plain that [the government agent] could properly testify about his conversation with [the defendant], the constitutional claim relating to the recording of that conversation emerges in proper perspective. The Court has in the past sustained instances of \"electronic eavesdropping\u201d against constitutional challenge, when devices have been used to enable government agents to overhear conversations which would have been beyond the reach of the human ear. See, e.g., <em>Olmstead v. United States, </em>277 U.S. 438, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944; <em>Goldman v. United States, </em>316 U.S. 129, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322. It has been insisted only that the electronic device not be planted by an unlawful physical invasion of a constitutionally protected area. <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>[365 U.S. 505, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734]. The validity of these decisions is not in question here. Indeed this case involves no \u201ceavesdropping\u201d whatever in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>proper sense of that term. The Government did not use an electronic device to listen in on conversations it could not otherwise have heard. Instead, the device was used only to obtain the most reliable evidence possible of a conversation in which the Government's own agent was a participant and which that agent was fully entitled to disclose. And the device was not planted by means of an unlawful physical invasion of petitioner\u2019s premises under circumstances which would violate the Fourth Amendment. It was carried in and out by an agent who was there with petitioner's assent, and it neither saw nor heard more than the agent himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">Stripped to its essentials, petitioner\u2019s argument amounts to saying that he has a constitutional right to rely on possible flaws in the agent's memory, or to challenge the agent's credibility without being beset by corroborating evidence that is not susceptible of impeachment. For no other argument can justify excluding an accurate version of a conversation that the agent could testify to from memory. We think the risk that petitioner took in offering a bribe to [the government agent] fairly included the risk that the offer would be accurately reproduced in court, whether by faultless memory or mechanical recording.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">When we look for the overriding considerations that might require the exclusion of the highly useful evidence involved here, we find nothing. There has been no invasion of constitutionally protected rights, and no violation of federal law or rules of procedure. Indeed, there has not even been any electronic eavesdropping on a private conversation which government agents could not otherwise have overheard. There has, in short, been no act of any kind which could justify the creation of an exclusionary rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 438-40, 83 S.Ct. at 1387-89 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">. As the issue is not before us, we need not decide whether a trial court's decision to suppress, if hinged explicitly and exclusively upon a statutory violation that would simultaneously comprise a constitutional violation, would fall within the ambit of \u00a7 12-302(c)(3)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">. In one prior case we mentioned \u00a7 10-411 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. <em>See Kassap v. Seitz, </em>315 Md. 155, 161 n. 3, 553 A.2d 714, 716 n. 3 (1989). Our reference to the statute in that case, however, was simply to note that the registration requirement thereunder had apparently been satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\">. Despite the possibility that the Panasonic micro-cassette recorder used by Wilhelm to intercept and record his February 4, 1996 conversation with Petitioner may not fall within the definition of devices whose usage by law enforcement officials and agents is subject to compliance with \u00a7 10-411 in order to be lawful, it must be remembered that the State never raised this issue before the Circuit Court, or, for that matter, at any time on appeal. Were we to consider the merits of the petition for certiorari, we would therefore be compelled to assume that the device used to intercept and record Petitioner\u2019s incriminating statements was subject to \u00a7 10-41 l's requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b434-6\">. <em>See supra </em>note 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 10-403(a)(l), which subjects to felony prosecution, fine and imprisonment any person who, unless expressly excepted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">manufactures, assembles, possesses, or sells any electronic, mechanical, or other device, knowing or having reason to know that <em>the design of the device renders it primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications </em>....

As can readily be seen, the only differences between the pertinent wording of Title Ill's and the Wiretap Act\u2019s general ban of primarily surreptitious interception devices, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2512(l)(b) and \u00a7 10-403(a)(1), respectively, and the language of Maryland\u2019s registration requirement for police usage of such devices, in \u00a7 10-411(a), are stylistic rather than substantive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b436-10\">. Insofar as the present case has not required us to address the merits of whether a violation of \u00a7 10-411 may be the basis for a trial court\u2019s suppression of evidence under the Wiretap Act, we express no opinion on the correctness of the holding by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Battaglia v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 349, 356, 705 A.2d 36, 40 (1998), that whether an electronic surveillance device used to intercept and record a communication complies with \u00a7 10-41 l\u2019s registration requirement \"does not affect the admission of the recorded communication as evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
