That the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, in consequence of his neglect to proceed against <em>Russell. </em>Unless due diligence was used to recover the money from <em>Russell, </em>the principal debtor, the secondary liability of <em>Hoblitzell </em>did not attach. His engagement was not absolute, but conditional. It was a contract of indemnity, to save harmless, and no more; and he could only be held responsible, upon the insufficiency of the means of the principal to pay the debt, being ascertained by a diligent prosecution of every legal remedy against him. Act 1763, <em>ch. </em>23, <em>sec. </em>9. 3 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>235. The obten tion by <em>Russell </em>of a personal dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>charge is not evidence of insolvency. A party who has been discharged is not a competent witness for his trustee, because of his interest in the surplus of his estate, and of course the law presumes there may be a surplus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">The assignor of a bond is only answerable when the exercise of due diligence has failed to recover the money from the principal debtor, and the <em>onus </em>of the proof is upon the plaintiff. 2 <em>Hen. and Munf. </em>114. <em>(note </em>) 16 <em>Serg. and Lowb. </em>29. This suit is upon the assignment of the bonds which fell due in 1824 and 1825, and upon them suits were never brought against the obligor, and no fact is stated, which furnishes a legal excuse for not doing so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">2. The money should have been recovered from <em>Ander</em>son, the obligee, against whom a suit might have been instituted in the name of Hoblitzell, for the use of <em>Lewis. </em>It was a <em>Pennsylvania </em>contract, and consequently it is no answer to say, that the plaintiff is excused from proceeding against him because he resided in that State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">This cause comes before the court upon a case stated, and no inferences of fact are to be made but such as are inevitable. 2 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>119, 320. 3 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">On the appeal of <em>Lewis </em>they insisted, that the verdict was conclusive upon the question of the application of payments.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-9\"><em>Price, </em>for <em>Lewis.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-10\">On the bond which became due in April, 1823, suit was instituted to the first term thereafter against <em>Russell, </em>soon after which he petitioned for the benefit of the insolvent laws, and obtained a personal discharge. And he petitioned again in 1830, having no property which could be made liable for this debt. A suit therefore would have been fruitless, and need not have been brought. The inability to pay a debt, is a matter to be inferred from circumstances,, and need not be expressly proved. The plaintiff had already sued <em>Russell, </em>on the bond of 1823, and recovered a judgment, from which nothing could be <em>realized; </em>why then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00a1should they encounter the expense and trouble of securing \u2022the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">2. Proceedings against <em>Anderson </em>were not necessary to \u2019fix the liability of <em>Hoblitzell. </em>The assignment by <em>Anderson </em>\"to <em>Hoblitzell, </em>was a naked assignment, and created no liability from the former to the latter, but if it did, there could \u2019be no obligation on <em>Lewis </em>to go to <em>Pennsylvania </em>in pursuit of him. The cases in <em>Virginia, </em>upon the subject of the \u00a1responsibility of the assignor to the assignee, were -decided upon the principle of treating sealed notes, as negotiable instruments. 3 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>242. There was no obligation on <em>Ringgold </em>to go to <em>Pennsylvania </em>to proceed upon the mortgage, though he had a <em>right </em>to do so if he chose. 'The money received by him there from the proceeds of the mortgaged premises, he had a right to apply to the debt most in jeopardy, and that was the bond of 1823. 6 <em>Cranch, </em>27, 28. 5 <em>Taunt. </em>601. 1 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>203. And besides, as that bond first became payable, it should have been first paid. 1 <em>Bay. </em>497.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-7\">Chambers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlXd\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">It is clear that the assignment of <em>Hoblitzell </em>to <em>Lewis, </em>by the express terms of which, he made himself responsible for the ultimate payment of the debt assigned, would subject <em>Hoblitzell </em>to an action at the suit of <em>Lewis, </em>in the event of <em>Lewis\u2019 </em>diligent prosecution against those who stood before <em>Hoblitzell </em>in the order of liability, or by showing an excuse for, or in other words, the inutility of such prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">We think that <em>Ringgold, </em>being in point of fact the equitable assignee of <em>Lewis, </em>the suit might well be instituted in the name of <em>Lewis </em>for his use. Much argument has been urged on one hand to sustain, and on the other to resist the proposition, that the obligation of <em>Hoblitzell </em>did not arise until an effort had been made to enforce the demand against <em>Anderson, </em>as well as against the mortgaged premises. Upon this proposition it will be unnecessary for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>express an opinion, as our decision will be given upon grounds not involving its justness.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">It cannot be controverted, that before the liability of <em>HobUtzell </em>could accrue, it was necessary to use due diligence against Russell, or to account for the want of it, by proof of his entire inability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">That no suit has been instituted against him on these bonds is admitted, and therefore due diligence is disclaimed ; but it is said, that \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d set forth in the case stated, prove an excuse, by shewing his inability to pay. The parts of the record to which we are referred, and in which alone, any thing can be found, having any reference to this subject, are first, the certificate of the clerk of <em>Frederick </em>county court, in these words: \u201cI hereby certify that it appears on the docket of August court, 1824, that <em>Robert G. Russell, </em>has had a personal release under the insolvent laws of this State, and that he again applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this State, on the 13th of March, 1830. That his day for appearance is on the second Monday of December, 1830, and by his schedule, has made return of no property, except what is in the constable\u2019s hands, taken under distress for rent. Test, <em>John Schley, </em>Clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\"><em>Next, </em>the statement of <em>Swearingen\u2019s </em>proceedings as agent of <em>Ringgold, </em>the assignee, who \u201ccaused a suit to be instituted in 1823, in <em>Alleghany </em>county, against <em>Hoblitzell,\u201d </em>which was an action upon the assignment of another bond, and in which action the plaintiff was non-suited; and another suit in <em>Frederick </em>county against <em>Russell, </em>in 1823, which was an action upon another bond, and upon which bond judgment was obtained, and no proceeding by execution issued \u2014 \u201cAnd went to <em>Bedford, Pennsylvania, </em>and employed counsel to proceed on the mortgage, and against <em>Anderson. </em>That he resorted to all the efforts aforesaid, wishing to obtain all the money from <em>Anderson, </em>rather than resort to <em>Hoblitzell; </em>and that he directed his lawyers to proceed as fast as possible in the business aforesaid,\u201d which we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>asked to connect with a prior part of the case stated. \u201cThat nothing was ever received from said <em>Russell, </em>on either of said bonds, except from the sale of the mortgaged premises in Bedford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We have no means of determining the date of the clerk\u2019s certificate, except that it speaks of the application in March, 1830, in the past tense, and not so of the day for appearing in <em>December, </em>nor is the purpose avowed for which it was introduced. We \u00e1re also left to conjecture to which of the two applications it intends to attach the \u201cschedule\u201d spoken of. It would seem to be a part of the proceedings of 1830, as the certificate says, the property returned thereby \u201cis\u201d in the hands of the constable. The certificate therefore proves nothing in regard to the property held by <em>Russell, </em>when the \u201cpersonal discharge\u201d was obtained, nor does it deny that he returned a schedule, or if any, to what amount. He might have had ample estate to pay all his debts in the year 1824, 1825, and 1826, and to the institution of this suit, and it might have appeared even on the face of his schedule, returned when he obtained the personal release, that he had large and ample funds, and yet every word in the certificate be literally true.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The proceedings of <em>Swearingen, </em>the agent, and every thing stated in regard to them, are as inconclusive as the certificate, and the history of his acts and directions may be strictly given in the statement, and yet leave it entirely possible that <em>Russell </em>was solvent, and the additional fact that nothing was received from <em>Russell, </em>does not supply the chasm, or constitute the conclusive proof of inability to pay on the part of <em>Russell, </em>which alone can avail the party, in a special verdict or case stated. The circumstances might probably have induced a jury to infer the insolvency of <em>Russell, </em>although we cannot but think it would have been prudent to aid them by some little evidence from individuals, who residing in the vicinity and acquainted with his pecuniary condition, might speak to the fact of his haying property, in terms at least as satisfactory as these ^circumstances\u201d do.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The cases in this court are full in regard to this matter. In <em>Reeside vs. </em>Fisher, 2 <em>Harr. and Johns, </em>320, the <em>Replevin </em>was issued and served on the 4th of March, 1824. The defendant justified as deputy <em>Marshall </em>under a seizure made in virtue of a <em>fieri facias, </em>which issued on the 18th of December, 1823, and was returnable on the first Tuesday'of March, 1824. These facts appeared in a case stated, and the court would not <em>infer </em>that the property thus seized, remained in the defendant\u2019s hands, as deputy <em>Marshall, </em>the case stated, not expressly asserting it; because it might be that the goods had been sold, and left in the defendant\u2019s hands by the purchaser, or that the debt had been paid, and the goods permitted to remain by the owner, consistently with any thing appearing on the statement. In <em>Hysinger vs. Baltzell, </em>3 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>158, the court would have imputed <em>laches, </em>if it had been alleged in the case stated, \u201cthat the defendant was in <em>Baltimore </em>for two days, and that the plaintiffs <em>knew </em>he was there for that space of time,\u201d but it being only stated, that the defendant was in <em>Baltimore, </em>purchased goods from the plaintiffs, and remained there two days, the court thought it consistent with the statement, that the purchase of goods might have been immediately before the defendant left <em>Baltimore, </em>and therefore without enabling the plaintiffs to sue out a writ with effect, the omission to do which, was charged as <em>laches.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The pervading error in the case at bar is, that the \u201cevidence of facts,\u201d is set out instead of the facts themselves. The statement furnishes little else but evidence. If all the facts upon which the law is claimed, cannot be agreed, a jury should be called. As the judgment of the county court should have been for the defendants on the facts as stated, and cannot be complained of by the plaintiff, but is erroneous as to the defendant below, <em>we affirm the judgment on the appeal of Lewis use of Ringgold\u2019s Adm\u2019r, and reverse it, and order a procedendo in the case in which Hoblitzell\u2019s Adm\u2019s are the appellants.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
