There was no stipulation in the deed, that the mortgagor should continue in possession of the property until forfeiture ; but the proof was, that the defendant (the mortgagee) permitted the negroes to remain in the mortgagor\u2019s possession, from the date of the mortgage, until some time in November, 1831, when he took possession of them in the night, in the absence of the mortgagee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">Upon this evidence the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they should find from the evidence, that the plaintiff remained in the possession of the negroes in question, with the consent of the defendant, from the time of the execution of the mortgage until they were taken from his possession by the defendant; and if they should further find from the testimony, that said negroes were taken from the plaintiff by the defendant, without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent, and without a previous demand; that then such taking made the defendant a trespasser, and that they must find a verdict for the plaintiff. This instruction the court (Key and Dorsey, A. J\u2019s) refused to give. The plaintiff excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he prosecuted the present appeal.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

The parties therefore must stand upon their legal rights, according to the terms used in the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Courts of equity consider a mortgage as a mere security for money. But this is not the light in which it is viewed in courts of law, which as Mr. <em>Justice Bailey </em>observes, in 1 <em>Dow. and Ry. </em>873, generally know nothing about mortgagor and mortgagee. They look solely to the estate conveyed by the instrument, and consider the mortgagor in possession, unless under the circumstances above mentioned, as the mortgagee\u2019s tenant, and strictly within the definition of a tenant at will; not to be sure, entitled to all the privileges of a tenant at will, or answerable for the burthens of such an estate, but liable to have his possession defeated in the same manner. Upon the execution of the mortgage the legal estate becomes immediately vested in the mortgagee, and the right of possession follows as a consequence, subject only to the occupancy of the mortgagor, which is only tacitly permitted until the will of the mortgagee is determined. It is said in 1 <em>Pow. Mortg. </em>171, that as soon as an estate in mortgage is created, the mortgagee may enter into posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>sion, but as the payment of interest is the principal object of the mortgagee, he seldom avails himself of that right, unless obliged so to do to secure the payment of the interest, or with a view to compel the repayment of the money. This right of possession is always subject to any agreements which may be made in relation thereto, and mortgages do generally contain clauses, giving the right of possession as against the mortgagee until forfeiture; but where the parties are entirely silent as it regards the possession, the right thereto follows the legal estate, and vests in the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The above doctrine appears also generally to correspond with the decisions in the different states, although there is certainly some conflict of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">It is said in 2 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>43, that after the creation of the estate upon condition, the mortgagee has presently the same right to enter <em>in pais </em>and take the profits, or by judgment and execution in a writ of entry, that he would have if the estate were absolute, subject to account for the profits if the mortgagor perform the condition, or redeem. In <em>New Hampshire, Maine </em>and Pennsylvania, the same doctrines appear to prevail; and in 4 <em>Rand. </em>248, it is said, that a mortgagee is entitled to an estate as tenant in fee, or for a term of years, as the case may be, or to an absolute estate in personal property, as regards the title, subject to any agreement as to possession, and defeasible at law by the performance of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In <em>New York </em>a different doctrine prevails, and a mortgagor may there maintain trespass against a mortgagee. Even the action of ejectment by a mortgagee is abolished, and the mortgagee is driven to rely upon a special contract for possession, if he wishes it, or to the remedy by foreclosure and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Upon the whole, although there may be cases in which a court of law, as well as a court as equity, would treat the mortgagor as the substantial owner of the estate, yet we are satisfied, that unless there be some agreement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the parties, the mortgagee is entitled to possession when he chooses to exercise the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">This privilege appears to be essential to the protection of the property mortgaged, and without such right the security would in many cases be entirely fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
