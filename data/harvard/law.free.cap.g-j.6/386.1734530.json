That they the defendants returned to the house of the witness, after twelve o\u2019clock on the same night. They said on their return, that they had been to <em>Mrs. Hall\u2019s </em>house, but that they did not find <em>Kilbourn. </em>They went and returned in sleighs. <em>James Blakeney, </em>one of the defendants, on the return of the defendants, stated, that he and defendant <em>Hall, </em>got into the house, that they gave the door a kick, and got in.

That <em>Thomas L.

That while they were crying and beating at the doors, and before they got into the house, the plaintiff and the witness crie,d murder ! And that some of the persons without, cried out \u201cyes, (with an oath) we will murder you all as soon as we get in !\u201d Before they entered into the house, some of them threw a club against the plaintiff\u2019s bed-room window, and broke out several pains of glass. That the plaintiff and the witness were very much frightened. That <em>Thomas L.

That witness found an axe at the front door the next morning, and saw that six or seven of the palings of the fence around the house had been broken by the defendants, or some of them, in one place, and five or six in another.

And gave in evidence by the grantee <em>Grafton, </em>that he, <em>Grafton, </em>attended to the business of said <em>William, Hall Spicer, </em>the grantor in said deed of trust, before his death. That he was requested to take the deed of trust, because of the infirmity of the old man, and the habits of intemperance of his daughter, the plaintiff. That he, <em>Graf</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>ton, </em>went into full possession of the whole of the property at the said grantor\u2019s death.

G. Kilbourn, </em>upon the complaint of <em>Mark Grafton. That the loarrant and complaint are lost, thinks they were lost in June last. </em>The defendants offered by said <em>Worthington </em>to give parol evidence of the contents of said complaint, which was made on oath, and reduced to writing upon the same paper with the warrant, and also parol evidence of the warrant itself. To which evidence, the plaintiff, by her counsel objected, but the court over-ruled the objection; and the said witness testified, that he thought it was on <em>Friday </em>before <em>Christmas, </em>that <em>Mr. Grafton </em>made oath that he had good cause to fear, and was afraid that a certain <em>E. G. Kilbourn </em>of <em>Baltimore </em>county, would do his person, and property, which he had in trust from <em>William Hall, </em>deceased, as by the deed of trust is expressed, certain injury, and craved the protection of the law; that on the same piece of paper, which contained the said oath reduced to writing, then followed the warrant to arrest <em>Kilbourn, </em>directed to any sworn constable, returnable forthwith, before said <em>Worthington, </em>at <em>Smyser\u2019s </em>tavern. <em>Kilbourn </em>appeared and applied for for a continuance until the 30th, when <em>Grafton </em>appeared ; thinks he witness required <em>Kilbourn </em>to enter into a recognizance; does not recollect in what amount, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>thinks he told him the amount must be in proportion to the character of the offence; that <em>Kilbourn </em>did not'enter into a recognizance; and not wishing to commit him, took his recognizance in $100, that he should appear next day a <em>Mallony's; </em>on the 31st, he, <em>Worthington, </em>appeared at <em>M allonyms, </em>and waited until he heard that <em>Kilbourn </em>and <em>Mrs. Hall </em>had gone to town; that afterwards on the second or fourth of January following, after the meeting at <em>Mallonyms, </em>that said warrant which had been returned by <em>Adam Sharer </em>on the 30th December, 1831, when <em>Kilbourn </em>appeared as above mentioned, was altered, so that it was directed to - <em>Duncan, </em>or any sworn constable, and without any other alteration, it was delivered to defendant, <em>Thomas L. Hall; </em>that two or three days after the alleged trespass, he <em>Worthington, </em>went upon the place to value the property; that he particularly examined the property to see what injury had been done; as he had heard that considerable injury had been done; that he did not examine the palings, nor the windows; that he delivered the said warrant, when it first issued, to <em>Mark Grafton, </em>and it was then addressed to any sworn constable; that he was applied <em>to </em>by <em>Thomas L. Hall, </em>to go to the place to appraise the property, could not see any glass broken in the bed room; there was no return day in the warrant as it first issued \u2014 it was returnable forthwith. Said <em>Worthington </em>further testified, that his recollection, respecting the oath of <em>Grafton </em>first made before him, may not be as distinct as he could wish; that when he was going on, administering the oath, when he came to the part expressing his, (Grafton\u2019s) fear to his person, that <em>Grafton </em>stopped him, and objected, but afterwards thinks, upon some remarks made by him, witness, that he consented to include, fear of his person, and he distinctly recollects, that he did make oath to bis personal fear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">.The plaintiff then gave in evidence by <em>Elbridge G.

That witness does well recollect the substance of the original warrant, and the complaint therein recited, independently of the said copy, and he is confident that there was not in the orignal, any thing expressed about <em>Grafton\u2019s </em>fear to his person, but only to the property which he held in trust from <em>William Hall.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-10\">He further proved, that <em>Grafton </em>agreed with the plaintiff, that she should continue to hold the farm and trust property of which she was then in possession, <em>for five </em>years from the 21st of April, 1831, for the use and support of herself and and children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ai6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The plaintiff, further to support the issue on her part, gave in evidence by <em>Adam Sharer, </em>a witness, that he as constable had a warrant issued by <em>Walter Worthington, </em>for the arrest of <em>E.

That he is confident there was not in the complaint on the warrant any thing about the fear of <em>Grafton </em>to his person. That <em>this </em>circumstance, <em>and also </em>the circumstance of the warrant having a return day, and its being made returnable specially before <em>Walter Worthington, </em>are reasons why he recollects the contents of said warrant. That <em>Kilbourn </em>appeared at <em>Smyser\u2019s </em>on the 29th of December, 1831, the return day of the warrant, but Mr. <em>Worthington </em>was not there. That on the next day, the 30th, Mr. <em>Worthington </em>was at <em>SmyseAs, </em>with <em>Grafton </em>and -others.

That he, <em>Worthington, </em>then wrote on the back of the warrant, \u201ccontinued until the 30th, returnable forthwith,\u201d and gave it to witness, and requested him to go and bring <em>Kilbourn </em>on the warrant, which witness did, he, <em>Kilbourn, </em>making no objection to going; that <em>Kilbourn </em>appeared before <em>Worthington, </em>who read the warrant over to him, and demanded of <em>Kilbourn, </em>to enter into a recognizance to the amount of $2400, with securities, which <em>Kilbourn </em>would not do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Upon the whole evidence, the plaintiff, by her counsel, prays the opinion and instruction of the court to the jury as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">1st. If the jury believe that <em>Mrs. </em>Hall, the plaintiff, was in the actual possession of the house and premises, upon which the acts were committed by the defendants as given in evidence, and at the time when they were committed, then such possession is sufficient in law, to entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action, notwithstanding the deed of trust from <em>William Hall </em>(otherwise called <em>William Hall </em>Spicer,) to <em>Mark Grafton.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">2d.

If the jury should believe that a warrant was issued to arrest <em>Kilbourn, </em>that he might give surety to keep the peace, although the complaint as spread on the face of the warrant is defective, yet if the jury believe that an oath was made by <em>Grafton, </em>upon which it was grounded, that he was fearful of damage to his person, and should also find, that <em>Duncan, </em>one of the defendants, acted as constable to serve said warrant, and that the other defendants were summoned by him to assist in the service of the warrant, and that the acts complained of were only such as were peaceful and necessary in their efforts to execute it, and were unaccompanied with violence, either to the person or property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>of the plaintiff, then the said last mentioned defendants cannot be found guilty of a trespass, although the said <em>Kilbourn </em>was not in the house of the plaintiff, or was not found by the said defendants at the time of said trespass.

The authority conferred by him upon Hall, the defendant, was a legitimate exercise of this power. It was an authority to manage the estate for <em>Grafton, </em>and not to turn <em>Mrs. Hall </em>out of possession, and his right to do this latter act, therefore, is not the question to be decided.

Whether it was valid or not, depends .upon whether the magistrate who issued it had jurisdiction over the subject. If he had, the form of the proceeding is altogether immaterial. <em>Grafton\u2019s </em>affidavit of personal danger gave the jurisdiction, and authorised the magistrate to issue the warrant; and there is no authority for saying that it should disclose upon its face the proof upon which it issued. 1 <em>Chitty Cr.

If, however, it was good upon its face, and the officer who had it, and those who aided him, were not aware of the misconduct, or mistake of the justice who issued it, they must surely he protected, and such is the instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>of the court. If a different rule prevailed, and ministerial officers charged with the service of process, and their assistants, were responsible for the mistakes of judges and justices, no man would be found willing to execute the laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-5\">The question of violence, was for the jury, and was properly submitted by the court to them. If the defendants had reason to believe that <em>Kilbourn </em>was in the house, they were justified in forcing their way in.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b412-6\">Chambers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQ1k\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">At the trial of this case the plaintiff\u2019s counsel made twelve points, upon which the court was asked to instruct the jury. They were all rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The court then instructed the jury upon the seventh, <em>eighth </em>and <em>ninth </em>points, modifying the prayer of the plaintiff as is particularly stated in the exception, and then further instructed the jury in their own terms on several of the questions arising in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">However, it may be proper as a general rule, that the court shall adopt the language of a motion for instruction as preferred by counsel, yet if this court can perceive that full .and substantial justice has been done to the party, by declaring the law accurately, and in terms explicit and intelligible to the jury, upon the points raised by the counsel, it is no ground for reversing the opinion that such instructions were not given in the words of the motion or prayer. It is sufficient that other language was employed by the court less subject to misconception, or that the prayer was gratified with sueh accompanying explanations as were necessary for a full and fair comprehension' of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The exception professes to set out all the testimony in the cause, and the instructions were asked \u201cupon the whole evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The first instruction moved for, it has been said in argument, was intended to raise the question whether the agreement as proved by Grafton, between the plaintiff and himself, constituted the plaintiff a tenant at will, or tenant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>year to year, of the house and farm on which the trespass is alleged to have been committed. We do not perceive that the prayer did raise this question, it calls upon the court to say to the jury, that if the plaintiff was in aetual possession of the house and premises, then such possession was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to maintain her action. It did not assume that any of the evidence relating to a trespass was to be believed, that any act of violence against that possession, or that any specific wrong, was perpetrated. The words \u201cupon which the acts were committed by defendants, as given in evidence,\u201d are used, but they are used as descriptive of the house and premises, and are the only words used to identify the <em>locus in quo. </em>The jury might believe the plaintiff to have been in possession, and yet not believe the witnesses who gave evidence of the trespass. It was therefore in effect to ask the court to say that the trespass was sufficiently proved, if the jury believed the plaintiff to have been in possession of the premises, which the court properly refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The court, however, after rejecting the prayer, do instruct the jury, that if they believe that the plaintiff made no other agreement, in relation to the occupation of the premises, than that which <em>Grafton </em>swears to, then he could terminate all the possessory right of the plaintiff by an entry with the view to occupy the premises without notice, and also, \u201cthat if the defendant, <em>Hall, </em>entered into possession of the premises by the authority of <em>Grafton, </em>and that the plaintiff, by agreement with <em>Grafton </em>occupied the house and premises at the will of <em>Grafton, </em>then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover against <em>Hail\u201d </em>\u2014 And again they say, \u201cif <em>Grafton </em>made no other agreement than that which he proves, and the defendant, <em>Hall, </em>had authority from <em>Grafton, </em>his first entry is no trespass; and having thus taken possession, his <em>second </em>entry is justified unless he abandoned tho possession between the time of the first and second entry.\u201d They proceed to say in their subsequent instructions, in regard to the defence taken by those defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>who justified under <em>Hall\u2019s </em>authority, that it must \u201cdepend upon the fact whether <em>Hall </em>has made out his justification that he was in possession under authority from <em>GraftonP </em>These opinions \u00e1re grounded we think in a misconception of the nature of the tenancy of the plaintiff, and of the effect of the agreement between <em>Grafton </em>and the plaintiff, as sworn to by <em>Grafton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The inclination of the courts has long been against that construction of a demise which will create an estate at will. The interests of. agriculture, and the importance to lessees of land, of certainty and security in their occupation, are opposed to such estates, and they scarcely, if at all, exist in fact. We do not think the circumstances of this case, or the intention of the parties justify such an interpretation of the relations existing between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>Grafton </em>took possession of the premises, as trustee under the deed. He put the plaintiff in possession, entitled to the fee simple interest in one undivided fifth part, of which she could dispose at her will and pleasure. There are no rights of control or management reserved by the deed to <em>Grafton, </em>no authority to remove her from the possession of the portion secured to her after the death of her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The consideration of the deed is the natural love, and affection which the grantor had for his daughter, the plaintiff, and her children. The object avowed in the deed is to make provision for them after his decease, and the means adopted is to convey to Grafton, in trust, to permit the grantor during his life, to take the rents and profits, and after his decease, in trust for the plaintiff and her four children, by name, and their heirs, as tenants in common, without an intimation that <em>Grafton </em>is to interpose the slightest obstacle to the complete enjoyment of the property, or the possession of it by them. Assuming then that the case is not within the statute of <em>Henry VIII. </em>and the use not executed \u2014 upon which subject we do not intend to decide\u2014 there is nothing to prevent the full and entire enjoyment of one-fifth part of the premises by the plaintiff, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>deed, unless she has contracted to part with her interest and property in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">To ascertain whether she did so contract with Grafton, it may be proper to consider the circumstances under which his agreement with the plaintiff was made. He was the guardian of the children, and their trustee. By the terms of the agreement, she was to clothe and feed the children j she was to lease the other farm on which she was residing, and to occupy these premises \u201cwith the object and intention expressed at the time, that she and the children should eat, and wear each his, and her fifth part of the proceeds of the property.\u201d She took possession of the premises in April or May, 1829, and continued to reside upon, and cultivate it to the time of the alleged trespass, and nothing is stated to shew that she did not feed and clothe the children. The right reserved by <em>Grafton </em>was \u201cat all times to manage and control the trust property by himself and agents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We think it clear this right of management and control was to be exercised during the plaintiff\u2019s possession, and that it was not a right to dispossess her at pleasure, but a right of supervision and general direction as to the course of cultivation, and general conduct of the property. The obligation to furnish food and clothing for her children, was one of daily expense ; many months must elapse from the period when she took possession, before the farm could yield a crop of any kind. Could she have intended to subject herself to be removed at any moment, after pitching a crop, and cultivating it, and before it should be harvested, at any any season of the year, at any hour of the day or night. It would be, we think, in direct violation of the intention avowed, as <em>Grafton </em>swears, at the time of the agreement. He acted in reference to some supposed rights vested in him as trustee, to superintend the property, but could not be authorised by any thing in the agreement, to go or send an agent at midnight to break open the doors, destroy the windows, injure the enclosures, and lock up the clothes of the plaintiff, and treat her with rudeness. These are acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>sworn to have been committed by the defendants, and as it was not possible for the court to ascertain whether the jury could, or would not give credit to the witness, who testified to them, they must be regarded as a part of the case in reference to which the court have said the plaintifF cannot recover in the case assumed in their instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"Asm\">It is the province of the court to determine the legal effect of contracts, and we think in this case, the legal eiFect of the agreement sworn to by Grafton, as made between himself and the plaintifF, taken in connexion with the deed of trust, was not to create a tenancy at will, as the court have assumed, as the foundation of the several opinions we have referred to \u2014 but a tenancy from year to year, in that part of the premises which was secured to the children by the deed, leaving the plaintiff in the full enjoyment of her absolute right of property in her fifth part.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The second point upon which the plaintifF asked the in-, struction of the court was, \u201cthat the paper purporting to be a power of attorney from <em>Grafton </em>to <em>Hall </em>did not authorise any of the defendants to commit the acts complained of in the declaration, or of which evidence has been given to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Considering the expressions, \u201cacts complained of in the declaration, or of which evidence has been given,\u201d to be understood as referring to the acts of violence and injury to the premises, and the insult to the person of the plaintiff sworn to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, we have disposed of this question by what has been already said, from which it follows that the court erred in not giving the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The third point relates to the warrant issued by the magistrate against <em>Kilbourn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The prayer is that if the jury believe the tenor or substance of the complaint as reduced to writing upon said warrant, or upon the paper containing or prefixed to said warrant, was as follows, then setting out in <em>lime verba </em>the affidavit on which the warrant issued, that then the warrant was not a legal warrant, and would not \u2019justify the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ants. This application manifestly and erroneously assumes that the regularity of the complaint, which is the oath of the person at whose instance the warrant issues, must determine the authority of the officer who executes the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Now if the warrant were in due form, that is, if it commanded the constable to arrest the party, to give security for the peace upon complaint made, the officer who executed it had no reason to inquire what were the particulars of the complaint, or whether any were made at all. It was his duty to execute the warrant, because upon its face it disclosed a case of which the magistrate could take cognizance. The warrant is not set out in the evidence, and therefore this court cannot express an opinion upon its sufficiency, but we think the court properly rejected the prayer to declare the warrant illegal, and not sufficient to justify the constable, solely because the complaint was not such as to justify the magistrate in issuing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The <em>fourth </em>prayer assumed the legality of the warrant, and asked the court to instruct the jury that it did not authorise the constable and his assistants to break the door of plaintiff\u2019s house, if <em>Kilbourn </em>was not then in the house. This instruction we think ought to have been given. The court in their subsequent instructions, make this question to depend upon the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The defendants justified upon two grounds, one the right of possession, derived under the deed and agreement between <em>Grafton </em>and the plaintiff,- \u2014 the other, the authority to enter upon the premises, and arrest <em>Kilbourn </em>under the warrant. The plaintiff in this prayer appears to have sought from the court an opinion as to the authority of the constable to break the door of the house occupied at the time by the plaintiff as her dwelling, in his pursuit of <em>Kilbourn, </em>against whom the warrant was directed. The constable in execution of a warrant to arrest a party, breaks another\u2019s house at his peril. If it shall prove that the party is not in the house, the officer is a trespasser. If Mrs. <em>Hall </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>actually occupying the house at the time with her family, it was to this purpose her castle, and whatever controverted rights of possession there might be in relation to it, the officer derived no justification from that circumstance. We think the court should have so instructed the jury, as not to make the authority of the constable, under the warrant, dependent upon the collateral fact of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The <em>fifth </em>point made by the plaintiff was, that before the defendants could be justified in breaking the door in executing the'warrant, the constable should have demanded entrance. We think this instruction should have been given as prayed, and we do not concur in the qualification after-wards given by the court, which excused the demand, if <em>Mrs. Hall </em>knew the purpose for which they came.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The <em>sixth </em>point relates also to the manner of executing the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Although the prayer does not distinctly assume as a preliminary hypothesis, that the jury should believe the plaintiff to have been in possession, yet as the whole evidence is referred to in the introductory part of the exception, and there does not appear to have been any conflict in the testimony upon that fact, we feel bound to consider it as implied. The court in their instructions upon this subject, have united its consideration with various other matters. It is clear that a legal warrant would not have authorized the officer charged with its execution to commit the acts enumerated in the prayer, and we think the court should distinctly have said so to the jury, and that if <em>Kilbourn </em>was not in the house, the breaking open the door was not justified, although it may have been done with as little mischief or inconvenience as possible to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The <em>seventh </em>instruction prayed for was that the deed of trust conferred no right on <em>Grafton, </em>or any one acting under his authority, to dispossess the plaintiff of the trust property, if the jury believed the plaintiff was in possession either by the agreement of <em>Grafton, </em>or by his permission, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We Lave before expressed the opinion, that under the circumstances of this case the plaintiff had an absolute interest in one undivided fifth part of the premises, and was tenant from year to year, of the residue, and that <em>Grafton </em>had no authority in person, or by agent, to enter and dispossess the plaintiff at pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We cannot therefore concur in the modification of this prayer made by the court. It follows in like manner, from what has been said, that the <em>eighth </em>instruction should have been given, as prayed, without the modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The <em>ninth </em>instruction moved for by plaintiff relates to the re-entry of <em>Ilall </em>the defendant, after a previous entry, which is assumed to have been lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In the view taken by this court, no such legal effect would ensue from the first entry of <em>Hail, </em>the defendant, as to dispossess the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">If Hail, the defendant, did take possession in fact adversely to the possession of the plaintiff, and in her absence, he was a trespasser; and if the plaintiff afterwards returned to the premises, and finding them unoccupied by <em>Hall, </em>quietly repossessed herself of them, the defendant, <em>Hall, </em>could derive no sanction for a second entry, from the fact of his having previously entered. If the entries were made for the purpose of disturbing the plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment of the property, or in a violent manner, or for any other purpose than to discharge the right of supervision reserved by <em>Grafton\u2019s </em>contract, it was not in pursuance of any authority given either by the deed or the agreement. We do not concur, therefore, in the modification of the court to the <em>ninth </em>prayer. The <em>tenth </em>point has been abandoned by the appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The <em>eleventh </em>prayer asked the court to say, that if the jury believed the warrant to have been received and served by Sharer, and returned by the magistrate, and that <em>Kilbourn </em>had been produced before the magistrate who had \"taken his recognizance, then the warrant, was <em>functus </em>officio, and could not again be re-issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AD96\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The law anxiously regards the security of a ministerial officer in serving process directed to him by a competent jurisdiction. It may well happen that a magistrate issuing a warrant may act illegally and subject himself to an action or to a prosecution, while the constable executing the warrant illegally issued, will be justified. The evidence is contradictory, in regard to the return day in the warrant in this case. The magistrate swears there was no day of the month named in it as the return day, but that it was returnable forthwith. If a warrant be issued by a magistrate and delivered to a constable who executes and returns it, and produces the body of the party who is recognized or discharged, and before the return day the magistrate directs the same warrant to another constable, who without knowledge of the previous arrest, again arrests the party, we think he would be justified, although the magistrate's conduct would be illegal. The plaintiff, in stating the case upon which the prayer is founded, does not enumerate the circumstances under which the warrant was re-issued, except only that it had been previously issued, and served by another constable, and that the party had been taken and recognized. These particular facts might exist, and yet other circumstances might, also exist, which would justify the second officer who executed the warrant, and we think the motion was properly refused. The <em>twelfth </em>instruction was asked upon the ground that parol evidence could not be given of the warrant. It was traced to the hands of the magistrate who proved its loss, and we can discover no ground of distinction between this case, and the every day case of a lost paper, and therefore concur in the opinion which rejected this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
