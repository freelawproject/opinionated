Whether the stay of execution upon the judgment against C, was so entered with the consent of R as executor of M; and 2nd. Whether the stay of execution entered upon the judgment against R as executor of M, was entered with the consent of the executors of P.

Upon the issue to the first plea of <em>plene administravit, </em>the plaintiff read to the jury the inventory of the personal estate of <em>Matthias Hammond, </em>returned by his executor <em>Resin, </em>and four accounts settled by him with the Orphans court; the last of which passed on the 25th of Biarch, 1831, exhibited a large balance in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">The defendants then read to the jury the letters testamentary, which had been granted the said <em>Resin </em>on the estate of <em>Matthias Hammond, </em>dated September 21st, 1819, and proved that on the 26th of August, 1820, the said <em>Resin, </em>in puruarice of the order of the Orphans court, gave the usual notice to the creditors of his testator, to exhibit their claims on or before the 26th day of February, then next. And they further proved, that in conformity with an order of the said court, passed on the 27th of February, 1821, on the petition of the said <em>Resin Hammond, </em>appointing two persons to make distribution of the personal estate of the said <em>Matthias Hammond </em>amongst his representatives, that the same was distributed, and the proportion allotted to each duly delivered over to the person entitled. And the plaintiff offered no evidence, that the said <em>Resin Hammond </em>had had any notice of the aforesaid claim of <em>Barber </em>the plaintiff, on which the judgment in the declaration in this cause mentioned was rendered, before the date of the said judgment on the 21st of April, 1823; but he proved by the records of the Orphans court, that when the distribution before mentioned of the personal estate of <em>Matthias Hammond </em>was returned to that court, that the following order was passed. \u201cMarch 6th, 1821. Ordered by the court, that this distribution be confirmed, provided the residue of the personal property be sufficient to pay the debts.\u201d The plaintiff then proved, that subsequently to the order of the court for the distribution of the personal property of the said <em>Matthias Hammond, </em>and after the alleged distribution thereof by them, to wit, at April term, 1823, the judgment by <em>Barber </em>against <em>Resin </em>the executor of <em>Matthias </em>Hammond, was obtained as stated in the pleadings in this cause. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the plaintiff further proved, that at the time of the application of <em>Rezin </em>Hammond, and the order of the court thereon, for the distribution of the personal estate of <em>Matthias, </em>the said Rezin, his executor, had passed no account whereby it could appear that all the claims against the deceased} known by, or notified to his executor, had been paid, retained for, or settled. That an account of the funeral charges had not been allowed by, or exhibited to the said Orphans court, nor had any commission been allowed to the said executor. And the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended, that the said proof was inadmissible to prove under any issue in this cause, that the said <em>Rezin Hammond </em>as executor as aforesaid, had fully administered the assets of his testator, and had no assets to discharge the aforesaid judgment in favor of the said <em>Barber, </em>and prayed the court to instruct the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">1. That if the said executor had paid away the assets in a due course of administration, before this claim was notified or exhibited to him, he ought to have pleaded the same to the action by <em>Barber </em>against him as executor, and that the confession of the judgment in that action, was an admission that he had assets in his hands sufficient to pay the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\">2. That the distribution of the assets among the personal representatives of the testator, furnished no defence to the executor in the former, nor to the defendants in the present suit, forasmuch as the persons who are alleged to have made the distribution, had no legal authority to make the same, it not being made as directed by the act of 1798, <em>ch. </em>101, or any law of this state; or in pursuance of any authority conferred by law upon the Orphans court, in making distribution of the surplus of a deceased estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-7\">And 3.

The inference of consent, is fairly deducible from the existence of the judgment against him. He must be presumed to have consented that the judgment against him should be binding on himself, and available to the plaintiff; and he must also be presumed to have known in what manner and upon what terms, the judgment against his principal was rendered. These judgments were both confessed by the same attorney, and the defendants in each case are bound by his act, in which he is to be presumed to have acted by the authority of his clients. <em>Roscoe Ev. </em>19, 30, 171. 1 <em>Johns. Dig. </em>82. 2 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>977. 4 <em>Campb. </em>133. 2 <em>Powel on Mortg. </em>583. 3 <em>Atk. </em>34, 35. 4 <em>Russel, </em>142. 3 <em>Eng. Ch. Rep. </em>603. 5 <em>Ib. </em>271. It is the duty of an attorney to disclose every thing to his client, which can influence his discretion, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, he is to be supposed to have done so. 3 <em>Mason, </em>418. The facts connected with these judgments show most clearly, that they were the result of one common consent and concert of action throughout, and every fair intendment should be made to support them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-9\">The prayer of the plaintiff upon the facts was, that the jury <em>might </em>find the assent of <em>Rezin </em>Hammond, not that they <em>must </em>do so; and the court in refusing the prayer, necessarily created an impression on the minds of the jury, that it was not competent for them to find such assent. By refusing the prayer, the court decided upon the sufficiency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the evidence, though its province was merely to decide its admissibility. If admissible at all, the court usurped the authority of the jury by deciding upon the effect of the proof. 5 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>478. 6 <em>Ib. </em>478. 7 <em>Ib. </em>36. 1 <em>Harr. and </em>Gill, 109, 321. 2 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>190. 2 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>404, 419.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\">Upon the 5th and 8th pleas he insisted, that it was material to show, that <em>Rezin, </em>who was one of the executors of <em>Philip Hammond, </em>and the sole executor of <em>Matthias, </em>consented to the stay. This evidence was admissible to prove the whole issue upon the 4th plea, and supplied a material fact involved in the 5th and 8th pleas, and consequently was admissible under the issues growing out of those pleas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\">The questions arising upon the demurrers to the plaintiffs replication to the 6th and 7th pleas are not before this court; the defendants not having appealed; but if they were, this court would not affirm the judgment, though it might be of opinion that the demurrers should have been ruled good, as by so doing the plaintiff would be denied the privilege of amending his replications.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-7\"><em>Brewer </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-8\">1. The first question is, whether the circumstances of this case are such, as would have justified the jury in inferring the consent of <em>Rezin Hammond </em>the surety, to the time given to <em>Gantt </em>the principal debtor. It is true the client is bound by the acts of his attorney, and consequently <em>Rezin Hammond </em>cannot gainsay the judgment against him, but it by <em>no </em>means follows that he consented to the judgment against <em>Gantt. </em>He is bound by the act of his attorney in his own case, but not by the act of the same attorney, in reference to judgments against other persons. 1 <em>Camp. </em>140. If <em>Rezin Hammond </em>did consent to the stay of execution in the judgment against <em>Gantt, </em>that fact must have been in the knowledge of <em>Watkins, </em>the attorney, and as he was not called by the plaintiff, and is not shown to have been inaccessible to him, the presumption is against the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of the fact sought to be established. But the court did not reject the evidence, although it refused to instruct the jury that they might find the assent of <em>Rezin. </em>The court did not say, that the jury should not make the inference. It merely expressed an opinion on the subject, and in doing so, did not trench upon the just authority of the jury. <em>Showers\u2019 Par. Cas. </em>111. 9 <em>Petersd. </em>142. <em>Sir Thos. Ray. </em>404. If the court usurped the authority of the jury, it was the result of the course pursued by the plaintiff. It was he who asked for an instruction, and not the defendants, who made no objection to the admissibility of the proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">The prayer of the plaintiff in this exception, is confined altogether to the issue upon the 4th plea, in relation to the assent of <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>to the time given to <em>Gantt. </em>Nothing is said about the consent, alleged to have been given by the executors of <em>Philip Hammond, </em>to the stay given to <em>Rezin, </em>which is the subject of the 5th and 8th pleas, which have no connection whatever with the 4th. If then the court erred in the particular instruction given; still, as there could have been no recovery in this case, without proving the consent of the defendants, the executors of <em>Philip Hammond; </em>and as no proof whatever was offered of such consent, it would be futile to send the record back for a new trial. 3 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>472.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">The jury found for the defendants upon the 5th and 8th pleas, which go to the merits of the controversy; and therefore, though the plaintiff may have been entitled to the instruction he prayed for upon the 4th plea, still the judgment will not be reversed, as that would be giving the plaintiff an opportunity of disputing the same merits before another jury. The assent of <em>Rezin, </em>as one of the executors of <em>Philip), </em>would not be binding on the other executors. 1 <em>Strange, </em>20. 2 <em>Ves. and Beam. </em>51. And besides, there is nothing in this exception to show that <em>Philip Hammond </em>was dead, when the judgments were renderded against <em>Rezin </em>and <em>Gantt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>If however, the defendants are wrong in the points growing out of the exception, still this court will not send the record back if it should be with the defendants, upon the demurrers, as they present independent and substantial grounds of defence, and present an insuperable bar to the final success of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\">The question on the demurrer is, whether the giving a bond for the payment of debts and legacies, precludes all inquiry, at all times, and under all circumstances, in relation to assets. If it can have any such offeet at all, it must be or.ly when the suit is brought on the bond itself, and not as here, where it is introduced collaterally, to rebut a defence set up by the plea. In a case like the present, where the executor is not the residuary legatee, and has paid over the <em>residuum to </em>the such legatee, in obedience to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, it would be the extreme of hardship to deny him the benefit of the plea of <em>plene administravit.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-6\"><em>Magruder, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\">Executors who have given a bond for the payment of debts and legacies, cannot pleadpZene <em>administravit, </em>whether the suit is on the bond itself, or on any obligation of their testator. The act of Assembly which has not been repealed, forbids proceedings in the first instance upon the bond. Before the bond can be sued, there must be proceedings on the original cause of action, against the executors as such; and as, if they elect to give a bond for the payment of debts and legacies, they are not required to settle accounts with the Orphans court, the creditor may not be able to recover his whole elaim, if the plea of <em>plene administravit </em>may be filed. This must unavoidably be the result, if the plea of <em>plene administravit </em>is good, except where the suit is on the bond itself, as is contended on the other side. It has been said that there is nothing to show that <em>Philip Hammond </em>was dead, at the time the judgment against <em>Rezin </em>was rendered. If ihis be so, then the plea that the execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>tors of <em>Philip </em>did not assent to the stay is not material, and the issue of course an immaterial one. The proof offered on the part of the plaintiff, was in support of the issue to the 4th plea, and should have been admitted, though it may have been inadmissible in support of the other issues; and if the county court erred in rejecting the prayer, this court cannot refuse to send the case back upon a speculation, that the plaintiff has no proof in support of the other issues. After the opinion of the court upon the 4th issue, which was fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, he would not have been suffered to offer evidence in support of the other issues.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b174-5\">Buchanan, Ch.

To the 6th and 7th there were replications, and demurrers to the replications, which were overruled by the court; and the questions presented by those demurrers not being brought up by the exception taken at the trial, they are not now properly before this court, though attempted to be raised in the argument by the counsel for the appellees. Issues were joined on the <em>three </em>first pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">To the 4th, 5th, and 8th pleas there are replications, rejoinders and issues, making the 4th, 5th, and 6th issues. The 4th plea alleges, that the judgment against <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>as the executor of <em>Matthias Hammond, </em>was for a debt due from <em>Gantt, </em>for which <em>Matthias Hammond </em>was only the surety of <em>Gantt, </em>and sets out the judgment against <em>Gantt, </em>with the stay of execution for three years. The replication to that plea alleges, that the stay of execution given to <em>Gantt, </em>was with the consent of <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>as executor of <em>Matthias Hammond, </em>and the rejoinder denies the consent of <em>Rezin Hammond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The 5th and 8th pleas are substantially the same, and set out and rely upon the judgment against <em>Rezin Hammond, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>as the executor of <em>Matthias, </em>and the stay of execution entered upon that judgment. The replications to these pleas allege, that the stay of execution given to <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>was with the consent of the appellees as the executors of <em>Philip Hamond, </em>and the rejoinders deny their consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The questions then presented to the jury upon the trial of those three issues, were on the first, whether the stay of execution entered upon the judgment against <em>Gantt, </em>was so entered with the consent of <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>as the executor of <em>Matthias; </em>and on the other two, whether the stay of execution entered upon the judgment against <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>as the executor of <em>Matthias, </em>was so entered with the consent of the appellees as executors of <em>Philip Hammond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The entry of the stay of execution on the judgment against <em>Gantt, </em>was a giving of time to him, which if done in the life-time of <em>Matthias Hammond, </em>his surety, without his knowledge and consent, would have operated as a discharge of <em>Matthias; </em>and being done after his death, if without the knowledge and consent of <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>his executor, it equally discharges <em>Rezin, </em>and consequently <em>Philip Hammond, </em>his surety in his testamentary bond, if living, and being dead, his executors as such, the appellees in this case. It was necessary therefore, for the appellant to sustain the 4th issue on his part, that is, that the time given to <em>Gantt, </em>by the entry on the docket of a stay of execution for three years.upon the judgment against him, was with the consent of <em>Rezin Hammond, </em>as the executor of <em>Matthias. </em>To prove such assent, and whether the jury was at liberty to infer it or not, from the evidence in the record, was the question submitted to the court at the trial; and is the only question presented to us by the bill of exception : the prayer preferred to the court by the appellant\u2019s counsel being, for its <em>instruction to the jury, that from the facts stated, they might infer the consent of Rezin Hammond, to the stay being given to Gantt, as stated in the replication. </em>Not that they were <em>bound </em>to infer the consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of <em>llezin Hammond, </em>but <em>might </em>infer it. That is, that the jury might, or might not infer it, from the evidence submitted to them as the judges of the effect of that evidence;\u2014 which instruction the court refused to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The appellant had a right to have the jury instructed with reference to their proper sphere of action; to have them told what was legitimately within their province, as the triers of the issue submitted for their decision, and that is, what was asked; that they might understand their duty and know that they were at liberty to infer from the evidence before them, the fact that was put in issue, if they should be of opinion, that the evidence was such as to afford the just and rational inference of that fact: and we think that the court erred in refusing to give the instruction asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The consent of <em>Regin Hammond </em>to the stay being given to <em>Gantt, </em>as alleged in the replication, was as competent to be proved by circumstantial, as by positive evidence. The same in that particular, as any thing else that may be proved by circumstantial testimony. The circumstances relied upon for that purpose in this case, that the suits and judgments against <em>Gantt </em>and <em>Resin Hammond, </em>as the exeecutor of <em>Matthias, </em>the surety of <em>Gantt, </em>and the stay of execution entered upon each judgment were on the same day \u2014 that they were amicable proceedings \u2014 that they were in the same court, and for the same cause of action \u2014 that they stand together upon the docket, the latter immediately following the former in order \u2014 that the stay of execution in each case is for the same time \u2014 that the judgments were voluntarily confessed, and at the first term \u2014 that the attorney for <em>Gantt, </em>and the attorney for <em>Hammond </em>was the same person \u2014 that the gentleman who was the attorney for the appellant in the suit against <em>Gantt, </em>was also the appellant\u2019s attorney in the suit against <em>Hammond: </em>and that the order to the clerk written and signed by them, as the attornies for the respective parties, on the declaration in each ease, to file it and enter judgment with a slay of execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>for three years is in the same words, as they tend to show a conventional arrangement between the parties, the result of their relative condition in respect to the cause of action, consummated through the agency of their respective attornies, who were the same in both cases, and must be presumed to have known the views of their respective clients, and to have done their duty towards them, were circumstances pertinent to, and tending to prove the issue on the part of the appellant, from which <em>the </em>jury, whose province, it was to weigh and balance the testimony, should have been left to infer, or not, the consent of <em>Hammond </em>to the stay of execution being given to Gantt, according as their judgment might direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">If instead of an unqualified refusal to give the instruction prayed, which may have misled the jury, and induced the belief that they were not at liberty to infer <em>the </em>consent of <em>Hammond, </em>the court had informed them, that the whole case was before them upon the evidence, which it was for them to weigh, and that they might infer the consent of <em>Hammond, </em>or not, as they might, or might not believe such inference to be warranted by the evidence, or had instructed them in any form not calculated to mislead them one way or the other,, but leaving them free and at large to weigh the testimony, and to make such inferences from it as they should believe it to warrant, such a direction would have been free from objection. But it seems to us that the unqualified refusal, in the presence and hearing of the jury, of the instruction asked for, if not equivalent to a direction that they were <em>not </em>at liberty to infer the consent of <em>Hammond, </em>or that the evidence was not of a character to justify that inference, was at least calculated to make one or the other impression upon their minds, and thus to mislead them.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">It has been urged that as the finding of the jury, on the 5th and 8th issues, was in favor of the appellees, the judgment ought not to be reversed, and the case sent back undqr a <em>procedendo, </em>even although the court erred in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>give the particular direction prayed, on the supposed ground, that the appellant cannot on another trial succeed against the defence relied upon in those issues, and therefore that he could gain nothing by the case being sent back, and would only be subjected to the costs of another trial. But we are not prepared to say from the state of the case as presented to us, that such would be the consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
