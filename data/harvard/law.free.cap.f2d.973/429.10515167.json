Appellant Alphagraphics Franchising, Inc. (\u201cAlphagraphics\u201d), another guarantor of the loan, claims that the SBA caused the deterioration of collateral securing the loan by willfully failing to maintain it. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-32\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-33\">When, in the summer of 1987, Kenneth Babbit defaulted on his loan from South<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>western Commercial Capital (\u201cSouthwestern\u201d), the SBA, which had guaranteed the loan, purchased the note from Southwestern.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The SBA conducted an auction of some of the collateral securing the loan in August of 1988, but did not sell two significant assets (production copiers) until the following May, nearly two years after Bab-bit defaulted on the loan. The SBA made a demand on Alphagraphics Franchising, Inc. (\u201cAlphagraphics\u201d), another guarantor of the Southwestern-Babbit note, to recover the deficiency. Under the terms of the guaranty, Alphagraphics\u2019 liability for the debt (as guarantor) declined over time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of the demand, Alphagraphics\u2019 liability was limited to 50% of the principal, interest, and other sums payable under the note, up to a maximum of $125,000. Because Alphagraphics refused to make any payment, the SBA brought this lawsuit to recover on the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Alphagraphics defended on the ground that the SBA failed to sell off collateral (specifically, the two photocopy machines) in a timely fashion and did not properly maintain the machines during the interim. Under the guaranty, the lender (originally Southwestern but later the SBA by virtue of its purchase of the note) was not responsible for any \u201cdeterioration, waste, or loss by fire, theft or otherwise of any of the collateral, unless such deterioration, waste, or loss be caused by <em>the willful act or willful failure to act </em>of [the SBA].\u201d According to Alphagraphics, the SBA sold the machines for a lower price than the machines could have fetched had they been sold sooner or maintained in the interim. Such conduct, in Alphagraphics\u2019 view, amounted to \u201cdeterioration ... caused by the ... willful failure to act of [the SBA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The district court granted the SBA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Alphagraphics had not tendered any evidence establishing that the SBA\u2019s delay in selling the machines, and failure to maintain them, was \u201cwillful\u201d as required by the guaranty. It entered judgment for the SBA in the amount of $137,500: $125,000 under the guaranty plus a 10% surcharge ($12,500) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3011. Alpha-graphics appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">We must review the record to determine whether a material issue of fact was in genuine dispute regarding the SBA\u2019s failure to maintain the machines pending their delayed sale. <em>See International Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally\u2019s, Inc., </em>939 F.2d 1257, 1265 (5th Cir.1991) (summary judgment appropriate only if there are no genuine disputes as to material facts). Cognizant that our review of the record is plenary, <em>id.., </em>Alphagraphics directs our attention to record evidence establishing that the SBA\u2019s failure to act (i.e., maintain the machines) necessarily caused a decline in the ultimate sale price of the collateral. <em>(See </em>R. 144-46, 162, 163) Although that evidence does, in fact, establish causation \u2014 that the decline in price of the machines is attributable to the SBA\u2019s failure to maintain them\u2014 it falls short of establishing the requisite intent: that the \u201cdeterioration\u201d of the machines was caused by the SBA\u2019s <em>\u201cwillful </em>failure to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">In construing an identical provision, this court suggested but did not decide \u201cthat the term \u2018willful\u2019 applied in the context of deterioration of the collateral refers to an act done with \u2018an intent to bring about the deterioration of the property.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>United States v. Proctor, </em>504 F.2d 954, 957 (5th Cir.1974) (quoting <em>United States v. Houff, </em>202 F.Supp. 471, 479-80 (W.D.1962)). The Tenth Circuit, construing the same provision, has adopted that view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0d\">This court has defined \u201cwillful\u201d in a civil context as an \u201cintentional misdeed or such gross neglect of a <em>known duty </em>as to be the equivalent thereof.\u201d Any legal <em>duty </em>on the part of the SBA to protect the collateral from \u201cdeterioration, waste, loss by fire, theft or otherwise,\u201d however, was expressly waived in the guaranty agreement. Therefore, in order to establish a \u201cwillful act or willful failure to act,\u201d by the SBA under the guaranty agreement, a guarantor must allege more than \u201cgross neglect of a known duty.\u201d ... [It] must allege \u201ca purpose by the SBA to diminish the value of the security in order to intentionally injure the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><em>United States v. New Mexico Landscaping, Inc., </em>785 F.2d 843, 847-48 (10th Cir.1986) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We now do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Under the terms of <em>this </em>guaranty, Alpha-graphics waived its right to hold the lender (ultimately the SBA) liable for the deterioration of the collateral. <em>See New Mexico Landscaping, </em>785 F.2d at 847. The SBA was not responsible for the deterioration of the machines unless it failed to maintain them with the intent to cause harm to the collateral. <em>See id. </em>at 847-48. There being no evidence in this record to that effect, we conclude that the district court correctly entered summary judgment on that ground.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">We also find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of the 10% surcharge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3011, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">\u00a7 3011. Assessment of surcharge on a debt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">(a) Surcharge authorized. \u2014 In an action or proceeding under Subchapter B or C, and subject to subsection (b), the United States is entitled to recover a surcharge of 10% of the amount of the debt in connection with the recovery of the debt, to cover the cost of processing and handling the litigation and enforcement under this chapter of the claim for such debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Alphagraphics contends that the provision cannot apply to it because it was a guarantor, not a debtor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the statute does not limit recovery by the SBA to debtors alone. It provides for a 10% surcharge \u201cin connection with the recovery of the debt.\u201d The term \u201cdebt\u201d is defined as \u201can amount that is owing to the United States on account of a direct loan, <em>or loan </em>insured or <em>guaranteed by the United States.\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3002(3)(A). The Southwestern-Babbit note was \u201cguaranteed by the United States,\u201d <em>id., </em>and, thus, the SBA could recover the 10% surcharge from Alphagraph-ics \u201cto cover the cost of processing and handling the litigation and enforcement ... of the claim for such debt.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3011.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">With these words, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the SBA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-18\">.
