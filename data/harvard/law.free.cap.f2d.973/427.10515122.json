The district court denied the motion, and Camarena appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">Maria Dolores Camarena was indicted on 58 counts of unlawfully structuring currency transactions with domestic financial institutions for the purpose of evading the currency reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313(a). The indictment charged that Camarena\u2019s conduct was part of a pattern of illegal activity involving $545,-900 over a 12-month period, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5324(1) and (3) and 5322(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">After a jury trial, Camarena was convicted on all 58 counts and sentenced to a prison term of five years for each count, to be served concurrently, and a fine of $250,-000. The district court suspended all but six months of the prison sentence and placed Camarena on unsupervised probation for a period of five years. Camarena\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Camarena, </em>863 F.2d 880 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1106, 109 S.Ct. 3158, 104 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">Following Camarena\u2019s direct appeal, she filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Camarena\u2019s motion put at issue the constitutionality of the currency reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313(a). According to Camarena, application of the statute violated her privilege against self-incrimination. The district court ordered the government to show cause why Camare-na\u2019s motion should not be granted. Subsequently, the district court denied Camare-na\u2019s motion, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-17\">The statute and regulations require financial institutions, such as banks, to report currency transactions, not individuals such as the Petitioner. Consequently, there is no way in which the statute and regulations can violate her personal privilege against self-incrimination. <em>United States v. Mickens, </em>926 F.2d 1323, 1331 (2d Cir.1991) [, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 940, 117 L.Ed.2d 111 (1992)]. Furthermore, the information financial institutions are required to report under Section 5313(a) does not necessarily implicate anyone in the commission of a crime. <em>United States v. Mickens, supra </em>at 1331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-20\">Record on Appeal, vol. 1 at 5, No. 91-8562 (5th Cir. filed Oct. 28, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b488-22\">This court has not addressed the question whether the currency reporting statutes violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The Second, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have, however, considered this question and they have all rejected the argument that the currency reporting statutes violate the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Mickens, </em>926 F.2d at 1331; <em>United States v. Hoyland, </em>914 F.2d 1125, 1130 (9th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Kaatz, </em>705 F.2d 1237, 1242 (10th Cir.1983); <em>see also United States v. Kimball, </em>711 F.Supp. 1031, 1032-34 (D.Nev.1989); <em>United States v. Bucey, </em>691 F.Supp. 1077, 1084 (N.D.Ill.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Although this circuit has not yet decided the issue whether the currency reporting statutes violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, we find the above-cited decisions well-reasoned and, accordingly, we hold that the currency reporting statutes do not violate Camarena\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
