INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Plaintiffs and appellants Karan and Stan Eriksson were the parents of Mia Eriksson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mia was an avid horse rider and equestrian competitor. Defendant and respondent Kristi Nunnink was Mia\u2019s riding coach. In November 2006, Mia participated in an equestrian competition at Galway Downs (Galway) in Temecula. She was 17 years old at the time. Although Mia\u2019s horse was recently injured in another competition, Nunnink persuaded Mia\u2019s mother, Karan, that the horse was fit to ride in the Galway event. Based on Nunnink\u2019s representations, Karan allowed Mia to compete. During the cross-country portion of the competition, Mia\u2019s horse tripped over a hurdle. With the Erikssons looking on, Mia fell off the horse and the horse fell on Mia, causing Mia\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The Erikssons sued Nunnink for wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress. They alleged that Nunnink \u201cincreased the risk [of harm] reasonably assumed by\u201d Mia when she allowed Mia to ride a horse that \u201cwas unfit to ride because of prior falls and lack of practice\u201d and concealed this condition from the Erikssons. Nunnink moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. After the entry of judgment, the Erikssons appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Nunnink\u2019s motion was based on the doctrines of primary assumption of the risk and express contractual assumption of the risk. More specifically, Nunnink argued that the risk of death or serious injury to the horse rider is inherent in the sport of cross-country jumping and, alternatively, that Mia and Karan signed a preaccident release, releasing Nunnink from any and all liability. Based on these arguments, Nunnink contended that the facts \u201cshow that [she] neither owed nor breached any duty, legally causing\u201d the accident involving Mia. The trial court granted the motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">As to primary assumption of the risk, i.e., the element of duty, Nunnink failed to set forth facts in her separate statement of undisputed facts negating the Erikssons\u2019 allegation that Nunnink increased the risk of injury to Mia by allowing her to ride a horse that was \u201cunfit to ride because of prior falls and lack of practice.\u201d Nunnink also failed to meet her burden of production as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>relates to the element of breach of duty. As to express contractual assumption of the risk, Nunnink again failed to meet her burden of production that she was not grossly negligent. We further conclude that, even if Nunnink met her initial burden, triable issues of fact exist as to duty, breach of duty, and gross negligence. As for causation, if Nunnink\u2019s undisputed statement of facts addressed the issue, the Erikssons have demonstrated a triable issue of fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">II. FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Mia began riding horses at age six and had trainers and coaches from that time on. She began competing at age 13 or 14. By the time of her death at age 17, she had participated in 25 to 30 \u201ceventing\u201d competitions and other horse shows. The sport of eventing involves three days of competition, including dressage, cross-country, and show jumping. Dressage is considered the least risky; cross-country the most dangerous. In 2006, Mia participated in eight such competitions in which she finished as high as fifth place and as low as 18th place. She competed approximately eight times in 2005 and five or six times in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Mia trained for eventing at Tahoe Meadows, a 25-acre equestrian facility owned by the Erikssons. Nunnink was her coach. Nunnink has been a professional trainer of horse riders for equestrian competitions for 25 years. She gave Mia three horse riding lessons each week, each lasting from one to three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Mia\u2019s preferred horse for eventing was Koryography, or \u201cKory,\u201d a gelding owned by the Erikssons. In 2006, Kory was approximately seven years old. The regular care and feeding of Kory was performed by \u201cAlfredo, the on-site person\u201d at Tahoe Meadows, with Mia providing additional care. At competitions, Mia would equip, or \u201ctack,\u201d Kory herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Nunnink considered herself to be Mia\u2019s coach, as distinguished from a trainer of Mia\u2019s horse. Although Nunnink was not responsible for Kory\u2019s regular care and feeding, Karan testified that she was \u201ccompletely responsible for the horse\u201d and was required \u201cto make sure the horse was fit and ready to go\u201d before an event. Nunnink attended all of Mia\u2019s eventing competitions, and would walk the courses with Mia and help her warm up for the events. Nunnink states that she was \u201cpersonally familiar\u201d with Kory and his \u201ctendencies, abilities, and capacity of responding to Mia[\u2019s] commands . . . .\u201d She also stated she would \u201chave said something\u201d if she felt that Mia\u2019s horse should not be competing.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>On May 21, 2006, Mia and Karan signed a document titled \u201cRELEASE OF LIABILITY,\u201d in favor of Nunnink. The relevant terms of this agreement will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">From the beginning of 2006, one of Mia\u2019s competitive goals for the year was to compete in a \u201ctwo star\u201d eventing competition at Galway. The event was to be held on November 3 through 5, 2006. It would be the first two star event Mia ever attempted. A two star event is more difficult than a one star event in that it has more jumps, the jumps are higher and wider, the speed is faster, and the course is longer. It was the highest level in terms of difficulty, size, and speed that Mia had attempted. Mia and Karan submitted an entry form for the event early in 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In September 2006, Mia competed in an event at Twin Rivers. There, according to Karan, \u201cKory rapped a fence really severely,\u201d resulting in a \u201cbig bruise.\u201d A veterinarian examined Kory and said \u201cthe horse could be iced and if he trotted out okay in the momingf,] she could jump him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">After Twin Rivers, according to Karan, Nunnink was worried about the cross-country course at Galway and \u201cdidn\u2019t like how Kory was going.\u201d Nunnink \u201cwanted Mia to have more mileage\u201d prior to Galway. Because of these concerns, Nunnink entered Mia in a three-day competition in Fresno known as \u201cRam Tap.\u201d Karan and Nunnink agreed that if Kory \u201chad trouble\u201d at Ram Tap, \u201cthat was the end of the season.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The Ram Tap event took place on October 20 through October 22, 2006\u2014two weeks before the Galway competition. Mia, riding Kory, completed the dressage portion of the event. On the second day, Kory tripped on a hay bale during the cross-country course and fell to his knees, causing the horse\u2019s head and nose to hit the ground. A veterinarian examined Kory and found that the horse suffered a concussion, an abrasion on his forehead, swelling and a hematoma on the pectoral area, a minor contusion in the chest, and small abrasions on his pectoral region. The veterinarian prescribed medication to reduce inflammation and recommended the use of ice to reduce swelling. Kory was withdrawn from the remainder of the Ram Tap competition. The next day, the veterinarian examined Kory again and found that the swelling had improved and made the following note: \u201ccomplete exam\u2014 normal.\u201d The veterinarian also noted that Kory\u2019s next show was in two weeks. The veterinarian prescribed additional medicine, stated that the horse should be closely monitored for signs of head trauma, and instructed the Erikssons to follow up with their regular veterinarian.</p>\n<p id=\"AHJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Based upon the \u201ctrouble\u201d Kory experienced at Ram Tap, Karan believed that Kory was a \u201clame\u201d horse and that Mia\u2019s eventing season was over. In her declaration, Karan stated, \u201cit had been decided after the fall at Ram Tap . . . that [Mia] would not be competing in the cross-country\u201d at Galway. Accordingly, Kory\u2019s shoes were changed, he \u201cwas removed from feed,\u201d and they \u201cdid all the normal stuff that you do when a horse is done.\u201d Kory did not practice any jumps during the week after Ram Tap. As far as Karan was concerned, \u201ceverybody was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Although Mia was not to compete, Karan gave Mia permission to go to Galway because it was the end of the eventing season and Mia wanted to go to the parties and be with friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Karan testified to being misled about Mia\u2019s intentions at Galway: \u201cthere was,\u201d she said, \u201ca little plot going on here\u201d between Mia and Nunnink. Nunnink told Karan that they were \u201cjust going to throw the horse in the trailer so that it can get walked down there [at Galway].\u201d Mia and Kory then travelled by car and trailer to Galway on Monday or Tuesday prior to the event. Nunnink arrived on Thursday, November 2, 2006. After Nunnink, Mia, and Kory arrived at Galway, Nunnink called Karan and said that Kory was \u201cgoing smoothly\u201d and they were \u201cjust going to ride dressage.\u201d Although Karan expressed concern because Kory still \u201chad a huge wound thing going on,\u201d she agreed to allow Mia to perform the dressage portion of the competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The Galway course was designed, erected, maintained, and sanctioned by the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Eventing Association. According to the rules applicable to the Galway event, each horse is checked by a veterinarian upon arrival and again prior to the dressage event. The first check, according to the rules, is \u201cto establish first each horse\u2019s identity and veterinary history (vaccination, etc.) and second, each horse\u2019s state of health (but not its soundness).\u201d According to an event official, the \u201cprimary reason for that examination is to make sure the horse is not sick and going to infect the other horses in the bam. It\u2019s basically you don\u2019t want an ill horse to contaminate other horses.\u201d There is no evidence in the record regarding the performance or results of this check on Kory.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The second examination takes place before a committee comprised of the event\u2019s ground jury and a veterinarian. For this examination, the competitors, with horse in hand, trot the horse in front of and away from the committee. According to the mies, \u201c[t]he committee has the right and the duty to eliminate from the competition any horse that they judge is unfit, whether on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>account of lameness, lack of condition or for any other reason. In a doubtful case the Ground Jury may direct that the horse be put in an officially supervised holding area for examination by the Associate Veterinarian.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kory was not excluded from the competition by either of these examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">On Friday, November 3, 2006, Mia and Kory performed the dressage event at Galway. Mia scored 72.20. In dressage, a lower score is better than a higher score. This score placed Mia 41st out of 45 contestants.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Mia called Karan after the dressage event and said they were \u201cgoing to run\u201d the cross-country event the next day. Karan testified at her deposition that she told Mia, \u201cabsolutely not. We had [an] agreement with [Nunnink] well prior to this [that] the horse was not going to run any more at the end of this year. . . . The horse was hurt at Ram Tap and we had [an] agreement. . . . I said you are not running. I withdraw any permission to run.\u201d She told Mia to have Nunnink call her.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Karan spoke with Nunnink later that day. At her deposition, Karan described the conversation as follows: \u201cI said [to Nunnink] there is no way she can run. When we do events, we go down ahead of time, we stay there, we feed her. We make sure she\u2019s sleeping. She\u2019s just down there having a good time.\u201d Nunnink told Karan that Mia \u201cdid really well. She got a 50 in dressage. The horse is good to go. He\u2019s going to go tomorrow.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Karan told Nunnink, \u201cabsolutely not. I\u2019m on my way down there.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Karan arrived at Galway late that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The next morning, Saturday, November 4, 2006, Karan spoke to Nunnink twice, once in a bam and later in the warmup ring. At the bam, Nunnink told Karan not to worry, that Kory was \u201cfine, he\u2019s great, you know, he\u2019s good.\u201d She warned Karan not to \u201cget Mia upset\u201d and not to \u201cget everybody all rattled.\u201d Karan asked Nunnink if Kory \u201cis schooled,\u201d and Nunnink told her, \u201cyeah, we\u2019ve been jumping [(i.e., practicing)] all week. He\u2019s good.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Later, at the warmup ring, Karan asked Nunnink \u201cif she was, you know, absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>certain and she said, you know, I\u2019m the coach, shut up. It\u2019s fine. Get out of here. You\u2019re making everybody nervous.\u201d Nunnink also assured Karan that if Kory did not look good, she would \u201cpull him\u201d from the competition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Karan did not tell Mia that she was not allowed to ride in the competition because, according to Karan, Nunnink \u201chad already made the decision that she was going to ride.\u201d Nor did she inform any Galway event official that Mia was not permitted to compete in the event. Karan explained that she did not overrule Nunnink\u2019s decision and allowed Mia to compete because she \u201crelied on [Nunnink\u2019s] expertise as a trainer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">That morning, Nunnink and Mia walked and examined the entire course. In Nunnink\u2019s declaration, she stated that the course was \u201cvery challenging,\u201d yet one in which Mia \u201chad the necessary training, capabilities, and experience to negotiate with her horse, Koryography\u201d; the obstacles, jumps, and fences were \u201cvery obvious and plain to view, and quite negotiable . . . .\u201d Mia walked the course an additional time before the competition. Each walk took approximately one hour or one hour 15 minutes. According to Nunnink, Mia practiced and warmed up with Kory on the official practice course without apparent difficulty. No one, including Mia, complained to Nunnink that Kory was behaving in a manner that suggested the horse would be a danger to Mia in the competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The cross-country course at Galway includes numerous hurdles, or fences, over which the horse must jump. Each is numbered. (A pair of fences placed close together is identified by a single number and an \u201cA\u201d for the first fence in the pair and a \u201cB\u201d for the second.) Under the competition rules applicable at Galway, if a horse stops, or refuses to jump a fence four times, the rider is immediately and automatically disqualified from the competition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In a declaration submitted in support of her motion for summary judgment, Nunnink states that Mia \u201cwas an experienced equestrian competitor . . . and had demonstrated that she was capable of responsibly competing\u201d at Galway. Nunnink based this on her \u201cown observation in light of [her] expertise in riding, training, and observation of such events over more than 25 years.\u201d She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>further states that, based upon her own riding of Kory, her training of Mia on the horse, and observing the horse being put through the type of skills required for the Galway event, Kory was capable of successfully competing in the Galway event.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Shortly after Mia began her run on the Galway cross-country course, Nunnink became concerned. At fence 10A, Kory made his third stop. By this time, it was obvious to Nunnink that Mia and Kory \u201cwere not having a good day and things were not going well.\u201d According to Karan, the hematoma that Kory had developed at Ram Tap was \u201cclearly agitating him\u201d during the run. Nunnink was surprised that Mia did not pull out of the competition and \u201ccall it a day.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Kory made a fourth refusal at fence 17B, disqualifying Mia. Nevertheless, Mia continued. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Course officials began looking for a safe location to intervene. The fence judge at fence 20 was directed to stop Mia. Mia did not get there. At fence 19, Kory balked, then tripped over the hurdle. Mia was sent over Kory\u2019s head and onto the ground. Kory then fell and landed on Mia, injuring her. Mia was taken to a hospital, where she died later that day as a result of her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Two or three months after Mia\u2019s death, Nunnink was at Tahoe Meadows. She was with Sue Pipal, an acquaintance or friend of Karan. As they looked at Kory, Nunnink stated, \u201cout of the blue,\u201d \u201c \u2018Karan told me not to let Mia ride.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">When Nunnink was asked at her deposition for her opinion as to what caused the fall, Nunnink answered: \u201cObviously the horse and Mia did something wrong. It just seemed to me that the horse didn\u2019t want to go out that day, and Mia kept encouraging him, and at some point he\u2014he made a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">m. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The Erikssons sued Nunnink and other parties in May 2008. They alleged \u25a0two causes of action against Nunnink: the third cause of action for negligence and the seventh cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Erikssons alleged that Nunnink \u201ccoached, supervised, and provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>services for the event which substantially increased the risk reasonably assumed by [Mia] because, among other things, the course was made more dangerous in order to make the competition more thrilling to spectators, thereby significantly increasing the risk of severe injury or death or negligently violated the established and recognized standards of care for protection of riders and horses imposed on and assumed by the various individuals pursuant to the promulgations, regulations, rules and practices and procedures of the sport\u2019s governing bodies; <em>and the horse that [Mia\\ rode was unfit to ride because of prior falls and lack of practice and this unfit condition was concealed from [the </em>Erikssons] . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) According to the complaint, Mia\u2019s death was caused by \u201cthe combined negligence and fault of each of the defendants . . . , <em>which increased the risk of her serious injury or death and was not assumed by her or [the Erikssons] prior to the injury. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In support of their negligent infliction of emotional distress claim, the Erikssons alleged that they \u201cwere in the audience watching their daughter while she participated in the subject event . . . [and] observed their daughter and her horse fall while attempting to jump one of the fences and the horse fall onto and crush [Mia], causing her to suffer fatal injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Nunnink answered the complaint in June 2008. In February 2009, she filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that, as to her, the complaint \u201chas no merit, as there is no triable issue as to any material fact to put before a jury . . . .\u201d More particularly, she argued (1) she had no duty to Mia; (2) she breached no duty owed to Mia; (3) nothing Nunnink did or failed to do legally caused any damage to Mia; (4) recovery is barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk; and (5) the Erikssons expressly, in writing, agreed to hold Nunnink harmless from any claim arising from Mia\u2019s use of Nunnink\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Following a hearing, the court granted the motion. In the judgment, the court stated: \u201cThere was no showing of competent evidence fulfilling the requisite elements of duty, breach of duty, and legal causation on the part of [Nunnink], legally causing the subject incident. . . , and the action is barred by the primary assumption of the risk doctrine.\u201d The Erikssons appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">A. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Evidentiary </em>Ruling<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>B. <em>Legal Principles Concerning Nunnink\u2019s Duty and the Doctrine of Primary Assumption of the Risk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Both causes of action asserted against Nunnink are based upon Nunnink\u2019s alleged negligence toward Mia.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An essential element of an action for negligence is the existence of a duty of care to the plaintiff. <em>(Bily </em>v. <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 397 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 51, 834 P.2d 745].) The existence and scope of a defendant\u2019s duty is an issue of law to be decided by the court. <em>(Avila v. Citrus Community College Dist. </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 148, 161 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 131 P.3d 383]; <em>Laabs v. Southern California Edison Co. </em>(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1272 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 241] [Fourth Dist., Div. Two].) As such, it is generally amenable to resolution by summary judgment. <em>(Kahn v. East Side Union High School Dist. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 990, 1004 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 103, 75 P.3d 30] <em>(Kahn); Garcia v. W&amp;W Community Development, Inc. </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1044-1045 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 394] [Fourth Dist., Div. Two].)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">As a general rule, all persons have a duty to use ordinary care to prevent others from being injured as a result of their conduct. <em>(Rowland v. Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 112 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561]; see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714.) Courts have, however, made exceptions to this general rule based on public policy considerations. <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Navegar, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, <em>All </em>[110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116].) Indeed, the determination that a duty exists in a particular situation is ultimately \u201c \u2018an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dillon v. Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728, 734 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912].) This determination must be made on a case-by-case basis. <em>(John B. v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1193 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 316, 137 P.3d 153].)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">One exception to the general rule of due care frequently applied in cases involving sports is the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk. <em>(McGarry v. Sax </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 983, 999 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 519].) The seminal case in the area is <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296, 313 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696] <em>(Knight). Knight </em>involved an action by a participant in a touch football game who was injured by the defendant, another participant. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 300-301.) In affirming summary judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the defendant, the court explained: \u201cAlthough defendants generally have no legal duty to eliminate (or protect a plaintiff against) risks inherent in the sport itself, it is well established that defendants generally do have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport. Thus, although a ski resort has no duty to remove moguls from a ski run, it clearly does have a duty to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe, working condition so as not to expose skiers to an increased risk of harm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 315-316.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><em>Knight </em>emphasized the consequences, from a public policy perspective, of imposing a duty of care on participants in a sporting event: \u201c[I]n the heat of an active sporting event like baseball or football, a participant\u2019s normal energetic conduct often includes accidentally careless behavior. The courts have concluded that vigorous participation in such sporting events likely would be chilled if legal liability were to be imposed on a participant on the basis of his or her ordinary careless conduct. The cases have recognized that, in such a sport, even when a participant\u2019s conduct violates a rule of the game and may subject the violator to internal sanctions prescribed by the sport itself, imposition of <em>legal liability </em>for such conduct might well alter fundamentally the nature of the sport by deterring participants from vigorously engaging in activity that falls close to, but on the permissible side of, a prescribed rule.\u201d <em>(Knight, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 318-319.) The court held that a <em>participant in a sport owes no duty to protect a coparticipant </em>from \u201cordinary careless conduct committed during the sport\u201d; rather, the participant breaches a duty of care and is subject to liability only if he or she \u201cintentionally injures another player or engages in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 318, 320, fh. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">After establishing the nature and scope of the duty owed to the plaintiff, the <em>Knight </em>court proceeded to consider whether the defendant breached this duty as a matter of law. <em>(Knight, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 320.) Based on the evidence submitted by the parties, the court declared \u201cthat defendant was, at most, careless or negligent in knocking over plaintiff, stepping on her hand, and injuring her finger.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As such, the conduct was \u201cnot even closely comparable to the kind of conduct\u2014conduct so reckless as to be totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport\u2014that is a prerequisite to the imposition of legal liability upon a participant in such a sport.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 320-321.) Accordingly, the defendant did not breach any legal duty of care owed to the plaintiff and summary judgment was properly granted. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Shortly after <em>Knight, </em>the issue of primary assumption of the risk was addressed in two decisions involving the liability of equestrian coaches: <em>Tan </em>v. <em>Goddard </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1528 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 89] <em>(Tan) </em>and <em>Galardi v. Seahorse Riding Club </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 817 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 270] <em>(Galardi). </em>In <em>Tan, </em>the plaintiff, Joo Leong Tan, was a student at the defendant\u2019s school for training horse jockeys. <em>(Tan, supra, </em>at p. 1530.) One of the school\u2019s horse trainers, Bill Davis, told Tan that one of the horses, Faraway Falcon, had injured its left foot and that Tan \u201cshould ride the horse easily \u2018to see how it was.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1531.) Tan found that Faraway Falcon did not walk or behave normally. <em>(Ibid.) </em>He reported this to the trainer and asked whether the horse was fit to ride. The trainer assured him it was and gave Tan instructions on where and how to ride the horse. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Tan followed the instructions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Later, with the knowledge that the horse \u201cwas still \u2018off,\u2019 \u201d the trainer instructed Tan to jog the horse on the school\u2019s outer track in a direction opposite from that in which horses are normally ridden. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The outer track was very rocky. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Tan followed the instructor\u2019s direction. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The horse \u201cwent down on the track,\u201d injuring Tan. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">After discussing <em>Knight, </em>the <em>Tan </em>court found it distinguishable. \u201cOur case,\u201d the court began, \u201cis different. Here, we do not deal with the relationship between coparticipants in a sport, or with the duty that an operator may or may not owe to a spectator. Instead, we deal with the duty of a coach or trainer to a student who has entrusted himself to the former\u2019s tutelage. There are precedents reaching back for most of this century that find an absence of duty to coparticipants and, often, to spectators, but the law is otherwise as applied to coaches and instructors. For them, the general rule is that coaches and instructors owe a duty of due care to persons in their charge. [Citations.] The coach or instructor is not, of course, an insurer [citation], and a student may be held to notice that which is obvious and to ask appropriate questions [citation]. But all of the authorities that comment on the issue have recognized the existence of a duty of care. [][] As we have noted, the <em>Knight </em>court makes several references to the role of the defendant in relation to the sport or activity as being an important aspect of the inquiry about duty. If the role is that of coparticipant, there generally is no duty with respect to ordinary negligence. But here we are dealing not with a sports participant, but with an instructor who is training a student how to become a participant. [][] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>According to his testimony and declaration, Tan placed himself in the hands of the jockey school\u2019s riding trainer. He did what the instructor, Davis, told him to do. Davis was not a coparticipant in sport with Tan, but was charged with instructing him how to ride a horse. It was Davis who assigned Faraway Falcon to Tan to ride, knowing that the horse was \u2018off\u2019 due to an injury; it was Davis who told Tan to jog the horse on the outer track on the school\u2019s premises; and it was he who knew, or should have known, of the rocky condition of that track.\u201d <em>(Tan, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1534\u20141535.) The court concluded that <em>\u201cDavis\u2019s role as riding instructor to Tan was such that he owed Tan a duty of ordinary care to see to it that the horse he assigned Tan to ride was safe to ride under the conditions he prescribed for that activity. His failure to do so is analogous to the example, cited in Knight, of the duty of the ski resort operator to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe </em>condition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1535-1536, some italics added, citing <em>Knight, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">In <em>Galardi, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 817, the plaintiff, Leslie Galardi, was an accomplished equestrian who had, for years, appeared in horse shows involving performance jumps and obstacles of various types. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 819-820.) She was preparing for an upcoming show with her horse, Tomboy, at the defendant\u2019s riding club. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 820.) With Galardi\u2019s knowledge, an instructor at the club twice raised the height of two jumps without lengthening the distance between them. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trainer then asked Galardi to ride through the course backward. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The horse successfully jumped the first jump but landed too close to the second jump. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The horse popped up into the air and knocked down the second jump, causing Galardi to fall and sustain injuries. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The <em>Galardi </em>court applied \u201cthe analytical framework established by the Supreme Court\u201d in <em>Knight </em>by looking \u201cboth to the <em>nature </em>of the sport and to the <em>roles and relationship </em>of the parties.\u201d <em>(Galardi, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 822.) In reversing summary judgment, the court explained: \u201cClearly, the sport of horse jumping has the inherent risk that both horse and rider will fall and suffer injury. The basic competitive character of the sport involves engaging increasingly higher jumps and at shorter intervals until at some point the competitors can no longer clear the obstacles without substantial contact. Collisions with the jumps and ensuing falls are thus an integral part of the sport. Riders may also fall from the horse as the result of other conditions such as a balking or stumbling mount. Such risks were clearly among those which plaintiff here knowingly encountered during her training, when the jumps were raised, intervals became more hazardous, and directions were reversed, [f] However, the occasion of plaintiff\u2019s fall and injury was not during competition with other riders. Instead, she had placed her training in the hands of defendants, who were employed to instruct and coach her. Their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>responsibilities were directly to plaintiff. While other riders, as coparticipants, would not have any special duty of care to plaintiff during competition to ensure she did not fall, defendants certainly had a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to plaintiff and to take care that the jumping array was not beyond the capability of horse and rider. Of course, the risk of injury, inherent in plaintiff\u2019s activity, cannot be eliminated and in fact creates the challenge which defines the sport. The complaint and evidence presented in the trial court created a question of fact concerning whether defendants, who, we may infer, had knowledge and experience concerning the sport of horse jumping superior to that of plaintiff, negligently deployed the jumps at unsafe heights or intervals and thereby breached the duty owed to plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 822-823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Three years later, in a case involving alleged instructor liability for a judo student\u2019s injury, the court in <em>Bushnell v. Japanese-American Religious &amp; Cultural Center </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 525 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 671] <em>(Bushnell), </em>offered an explanation of <em>Tan </em>and <em>Galardi. </em>In <em>Bushnell, </em>the plaintiff, Gary Bushnell, was injured while performing a judo maneuver during practice with his instructor. He sued his instructor\u2019s club. Summary judgment was granted for the club based upon <em>Knight. (Bushnell, supra, </em>at p. 528.) The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the <em>Knight </em>standard applied in the student-instructor context. The court explained: \u201cThat an instructor might ask a student to do more than the student can manage is an inherent risk of the activity. Absent evidence of recklessness, or other risk-increasing conduct, liability should not be imposed simply because an instructor asked the student to take action beyond what, with hindsight, is found to have been the student\u2019s abilities. To hold otherwise would discourage instructors from requiring students to stretch, and thus to learn, and would have a generally deleterious effect on the sport as a whole.\u201d <em>(Bushnell, supra, </em>at p. 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In so holding, the <em>Bushnell </em>court concluded that the decisions reached in <em>Tan </em>and <em>Galardi </em>\u201care wholly compatible with our understanding of the principles enunciated in <em>Knight </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Bushnell, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 532.) Regarding <em>Tan, </em>the court stated: \u201cThe court in <em>Tan </em>held that the riding instructor \u2018owed Tan a duty of ordinary care to see to it that the horse he assigned Tan to ride was safe to ride under the conditions he prescribed for that activity. His failure to do so is analogous to the example cited in <em>Knight, </em>of the duty of the ski resort operator to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe condition.\u2019 [Citation.] The <em>Tan </em>court thus simply reaffirmed that the party who controls the activity (such as a ski resort operator or the owner of a baseball stadium) may have a duty of care to provide a safe environment such that the activity can be performed without unnecessary risk. Nothing in <em>Tan </em>supports the argument that, absent reckless conduct or an intention to cause injury, an instructor who asks a student to take on a challenge in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>better his or her skills will be liable for injuries resulting from the student\u2019s failure to meet that challenge. <em>Failing to provide a fit animal and a safe track increased the risk to the plaintiff beyond that inherent in the activity and liability might attach for requiring the plaintiff to take on the increased risk. To look at the situation another way, requiring the defendant to provide a safe horse and track could have no chilling effect on the activity itself, nor would it interfere with the ability of the instructor to teach the student new or better skills.\u201d (Bushnell, supra, </em>at p. 533, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The California Supreme Court first considered how <em>Knight </em>applied in a student-coach scenario in <em>Kahn, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 990.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff, a high school swimming student, broke her neck when she dove from a starting block into a shallow racing pool. She alleged her injury was caused by the defendant coach\u2019s failure to instruct her on how to dive safely into the shallow pool and the coach\u2019s insistence that she dive at a swim meet despite her objections, her lack of expertise, her fear of diving, and the coach\u2019s promise to exempt her from diving. <em>(Kahn, supra, </em>at p. 995.) The <em>Kahn </em>court summarized its analysis at the outset: \u201c[W]e recognize that the relationship of a sports instructor or coach to a student or athlete is different from the relationship between coparticipants in a sport. But because a significant part of an instructor\u2019s or coach\u2019s role is to challenge or \u2018push\u2019 a student or athlete to advance in his or her skill level and to undertake more difficult tasks, and because the fulfillment of such a role could be improperly chilled by too stringent a standard of potential legal liability, we conclude that the same general standard should apply in cases in which an instructor\u2019s alleged liability rests primarily on a claim that he or she challenged the player to perform beyond his or her capacity or failed to provide adequate instruction or supervision before directing or permitting a student to perform a particular maneuver that has resulted in injury to the student. A sports instructor may be found to have breached a duty of care to a student or athlete only if the instructor intentionally injures the student or engages in conduct that is reckless in the sense that it is \u2018totally outside the range of the ordinary activity\u2019 [citation] involved in teaching or coaching the sport.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 996.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Applying this standard to its facts, the <em>Kahn </em>court held that summary judgment was improper. \u201c[T]he following factors indicated a triable issue with respect to whether the coach\u2019s behavior was reckless: the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>training in the shallow-water dive disclosed by plaintiff\u2019s evidence, especially in the face of the sequenced training recommended in the Red Cross manual submitted by plaintiff; the coach\u2019s awareness of plaintiff\u2019s deep-seated fear of such diving; his conduct in lulling her into a false sense of security through a promise that she would not be required to dive, thereby eliminating any motivation on her part to learn to dive safely; his last-minute breach of that promise under the pressure of a competitive meet; and his threat to remove her from the team or at least the meet if she refused to dive.\u201d <em>(Kahn, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1012.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">In the course of its analysis, the court discussed <em>Bushnell, </em>including its treatment of <em>Tan </em>and <em>Galardi. {Kahn, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 1006-1008.) <em>Tan </em>and <em>Galardi, </em>the <em>Kahn </em>court stated, \u201ccould be explained on the ground that the instructors\u2019 conduct arguably <em>was </em>reckless, in the view of the <em>Bushnell </em>court, but were unsupportable to the extent they suggested that liability would follow when a coach or instructor merely urged the student to follow a desirable sequence of training and execute, a maneuver that turned out to be beyond the student\u2019s capacity.\u201d <em>{Kahn, supra, </em>at pp. 1007-1008; see also <em>Kane v. National Ski Patrol System, Inc. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 204, 212 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 600] <em>[Tan </em>and <em>Galardi </em>are consistent with <em>Knight </em>because \u201cthe instructors\u2019 conduct was analogous to the example of the defective rope tow discussed in\u201d <em>Knight\\.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Lastly, in <em>Wattenbarger v. Cincinnati Reds, Inc. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 746 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 732], the 17-year-old plaintiff, Jeffrey Wattenbarger, attended a supervised tryout for the Cincinnati Reds. \u201cThe last part of the tryout was conducted under conditions simulating an actual game. The pitchers, including plaintiff, each took a turn throwing to several batters. Before his turn, plaintiff threw a number of warmup pitches to get his arm ready. On his third pitch to a batter, plaintiff felt his arm \u2018pop\u2019 but experienced no particular pain. He stepped off the pitcher\u2019s mound and informed the Reds\u2019 personnel.. . that his arm had popped. Receiving no response, plaintiff returned to the mound and threw another pitch. He immediately experienced severe pain in his arm and quit pitching.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 750, fn. omitted.) He suffered a tearing away of bone and tendon due to triceps contraction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 753.) After explaining that an arm injury such as the one suffered by Wattenbarger is a risk inherent in pitching, the court concluded that the Cincinnati Reds owed a duty to Wattenbarger not to increase the risks inherent in the game of baseball. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 755.) The court likened this duty to a duty not to increase the risk of injury by supplying \u201cfaulty equipment such as batting helmets or catching gear.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded: \u201c[Defendants owed a duty of care to protect participants from aggravating injuries during the tryout. This would include preexisting injuries known to defendants as well as those occurring during the tryout. Thus, primary assumption of risk is inapplicable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>[f] Because issues of fact exist as to whether defendants were aware of plaintiff\u2019s injury, whether they encouraged or permitted him to throw a fourth pitch, and whether this final pitch caused injury, summary judgment was improperly granted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 756, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The following principles can be distilled from the above cases: To the extent a duty is alleged against a coach for \u201cpushing\u201d and/or \u201cchallenging\u201d a student to improve and advance, the plaintiff must show that the coach intended to cause the student\u2019s injury or engaged in reckless conduct\u2014that is, conduct totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in teaching or coaching the sport. <em>(Kahn, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1011.) Furthermore, a coach has a duty of ordinary care not to increase the risk of injury to a student by encouraging or allowing the student to participate in the sport when he or she is physically unfit to participate or by allowing the student to use unsafe equipment or instruments. <em>(Tan, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1535-1536; <em>Wattenbarger v. Cincinnati Reds, Inc., supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 755.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">These principles are in line with the underlying policy of not creating a \u201cchilling effect on the activity itself, nor . . . interfering] with the ability of the instructor to teach the student new or better skills.\u201d <em>(Bushnell, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 533.) In accordance with <em>Knight </em>and <em>Kahn, </em>we must be concerned with the possibility that subjecting an equestrian coach to liability will \u201calter the nature of an active sport or chill vigorous participation in the activity.\u201d <em>(Kahn, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1011.) If, for example, a coach could be liable for encouraging a student to enter a two star equestrian event when the student was not ready for the challenge, the coach might be reluctant to push the student to that next level of skill. As we understand the Erikssons\u2019 complaint, however, this is not the basis for their claim. Rather, they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>asserting that Nunnink increased the risk inherent in the sport by sending Mia out to compete in a difficult cross-country course on a horse that was unfit, and that she concealed from or misrepresented the horse\u2019s condition to Karan (whose permission Mia needed to compete). As such, the case is distinguishable from cases such as <em>Bushnell </em>and <em>Kane, </em>in which instructors were sued, and found not liable, for challenging their students to improve their skills. (See <em>Bushnell, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 534; <em>Kane v. National Ski Patrol System, Inc., supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 214.) This case is more analogous to <em>Tan, </em>in which the riding coach knowingly assigned an injured horse to the plaintiff to ride on a rocky track. <em>(Tan, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1535.) There, the defendant had a duty \u201cto see to it that the horse he assigned Tan to ride was safe to ride under the conditions he prescribed for that activity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It is also analogous to <em>Wattenbarger, </em>where the plaintiff was allowed to throw a fourth pitch after injuring his arm. Whether this is characterized as \u201ca duty of ordinary care,\u201d as the <em>Tan </em>court described it, or as a duty not to increase \u201cthe risk to the plaintiff beyond that inherent in the activity,\u201d as the <em>Bushnell </em>court interpreted <em>Tan, </em>the duty is the same: Nunnink had a duty not to unreasonably increase the risk inherent in the cross-country event by allowing Mia to ride a horse that was not fit. We see no undesirable chilling effect on the sport of eventing flowing from the imposition of such a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In clarifying the duty Nunnink owed to Mia in light of the foregoing, we begin, as <em>Knight </em>and <em>Kahn </em>direct, by considering the nature of the activity that Mia was engaged in when she was injured. Here, Mia was competing in an equestrian cross-country event, which requires the horse and rider to jump over fences and other obstacles. The more difficult the jumps, the more challenging the course. There is no dispute in this case that inherent in this activity is the risk of falling off or being thrown by a horse during the competition, causing injury to the rider. These inherent risks highlight the importance of having a healthy and fit horse when engaging in the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Regarding the relationship of the parties to the activity and defendant\u2019s role in the activity, the parties dispute whether Nunnink is considered a \u201ccoach\u201d or a \u201ctrainer.\u201d Regardless of how she is characterized, there is substantial evidence that Nunnink\u2019s role encompassed the authority and responsibility to determine whether Mia\u2019s horse was fit for competition. According to Karan, Nunnink was \u201ccompletely responsible for the horse\u201d and was required \u201cto make sure the horse was fit and ready to go\u201d before an event. Karan further testified that following Ram Tap Nunnink told her that the horse was very lame and that it needed tack walking and that Nunnink was going to take the horse home with her. Additionally, there was evidence that Nunnink assured Karan that if Kory did not look good, she would \u201cpull him\u201d from the competition. Indeed, in the release Nunnink relies on, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>reserved for herself the authority to refuse to permit Mia to use a horse that is \u201cnot in proper health or deemed dangerous or undesirable by [Nunnink].\u201d Lastly, Nunnink testified she would \u201chave said something\u201d if she felt that Mia\u2019s horse should not be competing.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The conversations between Nunnink and Karan regarding Mia\u2019s participation at Galway also reveal a relationship in which Karan relied on Nunnink\u2019s expertise with respect to that decision and Nunnink asserted her authority to make the decision. For example, although Karan believed that Kory was \u201clame\u201d after the Ram Tap fall and expressed her concerns to Nunnink about Kory\u2019s condition, Nunnink repeatedly assured her that Kory was good to go; when Karan persisted, Nunnink finally told her: \u201cI\u2019m the coach, shut up. It\u2019s fine. Get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Clearly there is credible evidence that Nunnink had some responsibility for the fitness of the horse and had the ability to control whether the horse participated in the cross-country event.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Given this background, we now address whether Nunnink met her prima facie burden of production that she owed no duty to Mia based on primary assumption of the risk and that she did not breach that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">C. <em>Nunnink Failed to Meet Her Initial Burden of Production as It Relates to Duty and Breach of Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\"><em>A </em>trial court properly grants summary judgment when there are no triable issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

As explained in <em>Teselle, </em>this is accomplished through the undisputed statement of material facts. \u201cThe purpose [of summary judgment] is carried out in [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c, subdivision (b)(1) by requiring the moving party to include in the moving papers \u2018a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts which the moving party contends are undisputed . . .

Wells Fargo Bank </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Under the present facts, it was incumbent on Nunnink to set forth in her separate statement of undisputed facts a clear statement negating the element of duty. This could be done in two ways. Nunnink could have set forth an undisputed fact that established (1) she had no control over or responsibility as to whether Mia and Kory participated in the cross-country portion of the Galway competition, or (2) Kory was not unfit for that competition. As we explain below, she did neither; as a result, she failed to negate the Erikssons\u2019 material allegation as it relates to duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">In Nunnink\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts, there is no undisputed fact negating Nunnink\u2019s control or responsibility as to whether Mia and Kory participated in the cross-country event. In regard to the unfitness of the horse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>the undisputed fact that comes closest to addressing the issue is undisputed fact No. 13, which states: \u201cAt no time before Mia Eriksson began her cross-country course run did anyone, including Mia Eriksson, ever complain that her horse was not behaving characteristically or in a manner that would suggest that Kory would present a danger to Mia Eriksson were she to ride that horse in the eventing competition, and she received a very good score of 50 in the dressage portion of the competition, on the previous day . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The import of this \u201cundisputed fact\u201d is that no one <em>complained </em>to Nunnink that the horse was unfit for the competition. It does not say that the horse was fit for the event or that she did not allow Mia to tide an unfit horse in the event. Thus, it does not address the issue of duty and primary assumption of the risk. Nor does it directly address whether she breached this duty of ordinary care. Under our facts, to establish that she did not breach her duty of care, she must establish that she did not know or should not have reasonably known that the horse was unfit. The distinction between \u201cno one complained to her\u201d and \u201cI did not know nor should I have reasonably known\u201d is significant. The Erikssons could very well admit that no one complained to Nunnink about the fitness of the horse, yet Nunnink, based on her own expertise, could still have known or had reason to know that the horse was unfit. Thus, the \u201cundisputed fact,\u201d as phrased, does not put the issue to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Summary judgment is a \u201cdrastic remedy.\u201d <em>(Mateel Environmental Justice Foundation </em>v. <em>Edmund A. Gray Co. </em>(2003) 115 Cal.App.4th 8, 17 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 486].) As stated in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Metalclad Insulation Corp. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 284, 289-290 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 331]: \u201cThe defendant must demonstrate that under <em>no hypothesis </em>is there a material factual issue requiring trial. [Citation.] If the defendant does not meet this burden, the motion must be denied.\u201d (Italics added.) Within the context of summary judgments, lawyers can place great care into the drafting of authorities, separate statement of undisputed facts, and declarations proffered in support thereof. Words mean something; what is stated or not stated has significance. Nunnink failed in her statement of undisputed facts to lay to rest the Erikssons\u2019 allegation that the horse was unfit or that Nunnink knew or should have known of the unfitness. Because of this, Nunnink did not meet her burden to demonstrate that, as a matter of law, there were no triable issues of fact relative to her duty of care and breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">D. <em>Regardless of the Deficiencies in Nunnink\u2019s Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts, Triable Issues Exist as to Duty and Breach of Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In her arguments on appeal, Nunnink relies on evidence that is not encompassed by her separate statement of undisputed facts. However, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>we look beyond the separate statement and consider the additional evidence discussed in the briefs, the evidence submitted reveals triable issues of material fact relative to duty and breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">As previously discussed, there is evidence of Nunnink\u2019s responsibility for determining Kory\u2019s fitness for competition, as well as her control over whether Mia and Kory participated in cross-country jumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On appeal, in support of the proposition that Kory was not unfit to compete, Nunnink relies heavily on evidence of the Ram Tap veterinarian report and the rules applicable at Galway that the horses undergo two inspections. Based upon this evidence, she asserts that Kory was \u201ccleared by three veterinarians.\u201d This overstates the evidence. The Ram Tap veterinarian noted that Kory suffered a concussion and other injuries. She prescribed medication for Kory, advised the Erikssons to monitor Kory closely for head trauma, and instructed them to have a followup with their regular veterinarian. There is no evidence that the followup visit occurred. Nunnink\u2019s assertion that the veterinarian \u201ccleared\u201d Kory for the Galway competition appears to be based on the following note in the Ram Tap veterinarian\u2019s report: \u201cNext show 2 wks.\u201d This note immediately precedes the instructions, \u201cMonitor close for signs of head trauma\u201d and \u201cFollow up w/Regular Vet.\u201d Viewing the report in its entirety, the reference to the next show in two weeks cannot reasonably be construed as clearing Kory for competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The second veterinarian check relied upon by Nunnink was purportedly performed upon Kory\u2019s arrival at Galway. According to the rules applicable at Galway, this check is merely \u201cto establish first each horse\u2019s identity and veterinary history (vaccination, etc.) and second, each horse\u2019s state of health <em>(but not its soundness).\u201d </em>(Italics added.) As a Galway official testified, this check is to make sure that \u201cthe horse is not sick and going to infect the other horses . . . .\u201d There is no direct evidence in the record that this check on Kory\u2019s health actually occurred. Even if we infer from the existence of the rule and the fact that Kory was permitted to compete that the check took place, there is no evidence that the veterinarian went beyond the duties specified in the rules and checked on Kory\u2019s \u201csoundness\u201d for competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The third veterinarian check relied on by Nunnink is the \u201cFirst Horse Inspection\u201d that occurred prior to dressage. As explained above, each horse is trotted out by the rider prior to dressage in front of a committee comprised of the event\u2019s ground jury and a veterinarian. Under the rules, the \u201ccommittee has the right and the duty to eliminate from the competition any horse that they judge is unfit, whether on account of lameness, lack of condition or for any other reason.\u201d Although our record includes the rules requiring this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>inspection, there is no evidence submitted by any of the parties that this inspection actually occurred and included the required veterinarian. If we infer that it took place, it appears that the \u201cinspection\u201d involves only a visual observation of the horse from a distance, not a medical examination. Moreover, there is no evidence that a veterinarian on the committee who supposedly observed Kory knew about Kory\u2019s recent fall or that the veterinarian did anything to determine whether Kory was fit to compete in the cross-country event.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">When the evidence and the circumstances surrounding the three veterinarians are examined, they provide only weak evidence that <em>any </em>veterinarian, let alone three, actually considered Kory\u2019s fitness to compete in the cross-country event in light of his recent fall and injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Nunnink also relies upon a statement in her declaration that she was familiar with Kory and, in November 2006, \u201crecognized that horse as capable of successfully competing in the Galway Downs 3-day Event . . . .\u201d This statement, like the statement regarding the absence of complaints about Kory\u2019s behavior discussed above, does not directly address Kory\u2019s fitness for the cross-country event. Even an injured, unfit horse may be capable of successfully competing; and yet, sending a rider out on such a horse will nevertheless increase the risk of injury inherent in the sport.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Reviewing the record as a whole, the evidence, viewed favorably to the Erikssons, reveals the following: Nunnink has been a professional trainer of horse riders for equestrian competitions for 25 years. In September 2006, Mia competed in an event at Twin Rivers. There, according to Karan, \u201cKory rapped a fence really severely,\u201d resulting in a \u201cbig bruise.\u201d After Twin Rivers, according to Karan, Nunnink was worried about the cross-country course at Galway and \u201cdidn\u2019t like how Kory was going.\u201d After receiving a bruise at Twin Rivers, Nunnink was worried about Kory and believed the horse needed some more experience, or \u201cmileage,\u201d prior to the Galway event; Mia therefore entered the Ram Tap competition. On the second day at Ram Tap, Kory tripped on a hay bale during the cross-country course and fell to his knees, causing the horse\u2019s head and nose to hit the ground. A veterinarian examined Kory and found that the horse suffered a concussion, an abrasion on his forehead, swelling and a hematoma on the pectoral area, a minor contusion in the chest, and small abrasions on his pectoral region. The veterinarian prescribed bute (phenylbutazone) and antibiotics to reduce inflammation and recommended the use of ice to reduce swelling. Kory was withdrawn from the remainder of the Ram Tap competition. The veterinarian prescribed additional medicine, stated that the horse should be closely monitored for signs of head trauma, and instructed the Erikssons to follow up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>with their regular veterinarian. Kory remained on the medications up to the time of Galway. Kory did not practice any jumps during the week after Ram Tap. Based upon the \u201ctrouble\u201d Kory experienced at Ram Tap, Karan believed that Kory was a \u201clame\u201d horse and that Mia\u2019s eventing season was over. She was told by Nunnink that the horse was very lame after Ram Tap. She was further told that the horse needed tack walking and that Nunnink was going to take him home with her. Kory\u2019s injuries had not fully healed and caused him agitation during the cross-country run. Kory was not fit or prepared to run the cross-country course. This last point is based in part on the video evidence of the Ram Tap incident and Mia\u2019s last ride. The Ram Tap video depicts a significant fall involving the entire front portion of Kory\u2019s body. And, in viewing the Galway video, even aside from the trip at fence 19 that took Mia\u2019s life, Kory appears to be having great difficulty maneuvering a number of jumps. As Nunnink admitted, it is obvious from early on in the run that \u201cthings were not going well.\u201d All told, there is sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to whether, on the day of the incident, Kory was fit to undertake the cross-country course, whether Nunnink allowed or encouraged Mia to ride, and whether Nunnink knew or should have known of Kory\u2019s unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">E. <em>Triable Issues Exist as to Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">As explained earlier, due process dictates that we limit review to the facts set forth in Nunnink\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts. Here, Nunnink posited no undisputed fact relative to the issue of causation. The closest statement is undisputed fact No. 22, wherein Nunnink sets forth: \u201c[Mia\u2019s] own athletic, recreational and sporting activity of competitive equestrian riding brought her to incur fatal injuries on November 4, 2006.\u201d Assuming that this is sufficient to cover the area of \u201clegal causation,\u201d there clearly exists a triable issue as to whether the fitness of the horse was a contributing factor to Mia\u2019s failure to clear fence 19.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">F. <em>Express Written Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">As an additional ground for summary judgment, Nunnink contends the Erikssons\u2019 claims are barred by the \u201cRELEASE OF LIABILITY\u201d signed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Mia and Karan in May 2006. As noted above, the trial court did not base its ruling on this ground. Because we hold that summary judgment was improper based on the issue of duty, breach, or causation, we must address the effect of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The release agreement provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">\u201cThis RELEASE OF LIABILITY is made and entered into ... by and between KRISTI NUNNINK, hereinafter designated \u2018Trainer\u2019; and the below signed, hereinafter designated, \u2018Rider.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">\u201cIn return for the use today, and on all future dates, of the property, facilities and services provided by Trainer, the Rider, their heirs, assigns and legal representatives, her[e]by expressly agree to the following; [][]...

For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, even if the release is unambiguous and enforceable as to a claim of ordinary negligence, it does not preclude the Erikssons\u2019 actions against Nunnink to the extent they are based upon aggravated misconduct by Nunnink.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">In <em>City of Santa Barbara </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, 754 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095] <em>(Santa </em>Barbara), the court considered whether a release agreement that purported to release the City of Santa Barbara and others (the releasees) from any loss \u201c \u2018caused by any negligent act or omission of the releasees or otherwise\u2019 \u201d precluded liability arising from the city\u2019s gross negligence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 750-752 &amp; fn. 3.) The court explained that \u201cfuture . . . liability for \u2018ordinary\u2019 or \u2018simple\u2019 negligence generally may be released . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 758.) Such releases have been frequently upheld in the context of sports and recreation programs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 759; see, e.g., <em>Benedek v. PLC Santa Monica </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1356-1357 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].) However, \u201can agreement made in the context of sports or recreational programs or services, purporting to release liability for future gross negligence, generally is unenforceable as a matter of public policy.\u201d <em>(Santa Barbara, supra, </em>at p. 751.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The principal rationale for refusing to enforce releases of liability for future gross negligence is that public policy should \u201c \u2018discourage\u2019 (or at least not facilitate) \u2018aggravated wrongs.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Santa Barbara, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 762; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 776.) Thus, the Supreme Court approved of the rule adopted in a majority of states that \u201can agreement that would remove a party\u2019s obligation to adhere to even a minimal standard of care, thereby sheltering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>aggravated misconduct, is unenforceable as against public policy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 762; see also <em>id. </em>at p. <em>Ill, </em>fn. 54; <em>Allan v. Snow Summit, Inc., supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Again, we address Nunnink\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts for purposes of determining whether she met her initial burden of production. While our record does not contain a copy of Nunnink\u2019s answer, we assume she asserted the existence of the \u201cRELEASE\u201d as an affirmative defense. <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Ferrel </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 578, 579 [177 P.2d 973] [\u201ca release is an affirmative defense which must be specially pleaded\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In <em>Bacon v. Southern Cal. Edison Co. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 854, 858 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 16], the court, in discussing the defendant\u2019s burden of proof at summary judgment relative to an affirmative defense, stated: \u201cIf the moving defendant argues that it has a complete defense to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, the defendant has the initial burden to show that undisputed facts support each element of the affirmative defense. Once it does so, the burden shifts to plaintiff to show an issue of fact concerning at least one element of the defense. [Citation.] If, in anticipation of an affirmative defense, the complaint alleges facts to refute it, the pleadings themselves create \u2018a material issue which defendant] would have ... to refute in order to obtain summary [judgment].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d With respect to the issue of whether a release is valid as to gross negligence, the court in <em>Santa Barbara </em>stated: \u201cOur holding simply imposes a limitation on the defense that is provided by a release. A plaintiff is not required to anticipate such a defense [citation]; instead, the defendant bears the burden of raising the defense and establishing the validity of a release <em>as applied to the case at hand.\u201d (Santa Barbara, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 780, fn. 58, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Here, the Erikssons\u2019 complaint set forth the material factual allegation that Nunnink unreasonably increased the inherent risk of injury in horse jumping by allowing Mia to ride an unfit horse. The Erikssons further alleged that Nunnink concealed the horse\u2019s unfitness from Karan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whether pled in anticipation of Nunnink\u2019s assertion of the defense of the release, as discussed in <em>Bacon, </em>or simply as facts of the case at hand, as in <em>Santa Barbara, </em>it was incumbent upon Nunnink, as part of her burden of production, to submit undisputed facts negating these material factual allegations, which could well equate to gross negligence. This she did not do.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>\u201cGross negligence,\u201d as defined in <em>Santa Barbara, </em>means either a want of even scant care or an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct. <em>(Santa Barbara, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 754.) It \u201cconnotes such a lack of care as may be presumed to indicate a passive and indifferent attitude toward results . . . .\u201d <em>(Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 714, 729 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 506, 968 P.2d 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Here, Nunnink was an experienced eventing coach. She was fully aware of all the incidents involving Kory and the injuries he received. Thus, as earlier stated, triable issues exist as to the reasonableness of her conduct in allowing Mia and Kory to participate in the cross-country portion of the Galway event. Placing the disputed facts as to the unfitness of Kory in conjunction with disputed facts as to Nunnink\u2019s knowledge and the representations she made to Karan, triable issues exist as to the presence of gross negligence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Erikssons, Nunnink knew or should have known that Kory was unfit to jump. And, in spite of this knowledge, she affirmatively misrepresented facts relative to the condition of Kory that led to Mia\u2019s participation in the cross-country event.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Evidence from the record, again in the light most favorable to the Erikssons, shows that Nunnink told Karan that they were \u201cjust going to throw the horse in the trailer so that it [could] get walked [at Galway].\u201d After Nunnink arrived at Galway, she called Karan and said that Kory was \u201cgoing smoothly\u201d and they were \u201cjust going to ride dressage.\u201d The next day, Nunnink told Karan that Mia did really well in dressage, with a score of 50. She further indicated that Kory had been jumping all week and was good to go. On the day of the cross-country jumping, Karan spoke to Nunnink twice, once in a bam and later in the warmup ring. At the bam, Nunnink told Karan not to worry, that Kory was \u201cfine, he\u2019s great, you know, he\u2019s good.\u201d She also assured Karan that if Kory did not look good, she would \u201cpull him\u201d from the competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Given all of these facts, triable issues exist as to whether Nunnink\u2019s conduct was grossly negligent and therefore outside the scope of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>V.

To avoid confusion, we will refer to Mia Eriksson as Mia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\"> In the nonpublished portion of the opinion we reject an argument by Nunnink that an evidentiary ruling had the effect of striking virtually all of the Erikssons\u2019 evidence submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\"> The entry form signed by Mia and Karan states: \u201cI am fully aware and acknowledge that horse sports and the Competition involve inherent dangerous risks of accident, loss, and serious bodily injury including broken bones, head trauma, pain, suffering, or death . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> The rules further provide: \u201cAt any other time during the competition, any individual member of the Ground Jury has the right and the duty to eliminate any horse, which in his opinion is lame or unfit to continue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\"> In a declaration submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Karan states: \u201cDuring the telephone call, [Nunnink] repeatedly assured me that the horse was doing very well despite its recent fall and injuries, that it had been jumping during the week and it was \u2018good to go.\u2019 She told me that Mia had done well in the dressage and had gotten a \u201850.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\"> Nunnink testified that she did not have a telephone conversation with Karan on that day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\"> Karan testified that she later discovered that Kory \u201cwas not jumped and [Nunnink] made this more dangerous than it needed to be.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\"> At another point in her deposition testimony, Karan described these conversations more generally: \u201cI spoke to her twice, once in the bam and once down in the warmup ring. Expressed my concern. I told her I didn\u2019t want the horse to go and in each case she said he\u2019s good to go. He\u2019s good to go. We\u2019re going to go. So in her professional opinion he was good to go.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\"> Nunnink states that she also had her own \u201cbam rules,\u201d which dictated that a rider must cease competing once she had two stops in a competition. However, according to Karan, Nunnink did not have such a mle and, indeed, \u201chad a practice of telling Mia to keep riding despite the number of refusals. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b784-10\"> Competition rules barred a rider\u2019s trainer and parents from communicating with the rider during the event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\"> Nunnink speculated that Mia \u201cwas fueled up on adrenalin and not thinking very clearly and probably was not cognizant at that time that she had had four stops.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAfg\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 826.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\"> The first cause of action, labeled \u201cNegligence,\u201d is for wrongful death. The cause of action is authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 377.60, which permits a \u201ccause of action for the death of a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.\u201d Under this statute, \u201crecovery is authorized when death results from either a negligent or an intentional wrongful act.\u201d (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal.

(Knight, <em>supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 321 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) Nevertheless, the lead opinion has generally been cited by courts without notation of it as a plurality decision. As the Supreme Court subsequently and unanimously stated, the \u201cbasic principles of <em>Knight</em>'s lead opinion [is] the controlling law.\u201d <em>(Cheong </em>v. <em>Antablin </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1063, 1067 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 946 P.2d 817].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> In 1997, the Supreme Court in <em>Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 456 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 936 P.2d 70] cited <em>Tan </em>and <em>Galardi, </em>among other cases, for the proposition that \u201ca coach or sport instructor owes a duty to a student not to increase the risks inherent in the learning process undertaken by the student.\u201d <em>(Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co., supra, </em>at p. 482.) The <em>Parsons </em>case, however, did not involve the liability of a coach or instructor for the injuries suffered by a student, and its statement on that issue was therefore dictum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\"> We agree with the <em>Bushnell </em>court\u2019s characterization of <em>Galardi. </em>As stated: \u201cTo the extent that the court found that the defendants <em>had failed to provide a safe environment </em>for the plaintiff, we agree that liability might attach because the defendants thereby increased the risk inherent in the activity. If, however, the court found that liability might attach because the defendants were negligent in asking the plaintiff to take on new challenges in order to improve her skills, we do <em>not </em>agree that liability might attach, at least in the absence of evidence that the instructor acted recklessly or with an intent to cause injury. In other words, to the extent that a necessary or desirable part of the plaintiff\u2019s training was to ask her to take higher and higher jumps or take the jumps in various orders, the defendants should not be held liable simply because they were the plaintiff\u2019s instructors and it turned out that the plaintiff, or her horse, could not make the jump. If, however, the alteration in the course was such that it was reckless to ask the plaintiff to run it (i.e., the course was now unsafe), the instructors breached their duty to use due care not to increase the risks over and above those inherent in the sport, and liability should attach. The question, as always, is whether the imposition of liability would chill vigorous participation in the activity.\u201d <em>(Bushnell, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at pp. 533-534, first italics added; see also <em>Allan v. Snow Summit, Inc. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1369-1371 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 813] [Fourth Disk, Div.

We believe the error in his argument, however, is that he placed the burden on the Erikssons to establish duty rather than acknowledging that it was Nunnink\u2019s obligation to affirmatively negate the existence of a duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\"> Relative to the present motion, the record contains facts supportive of the allegation that Nunnink misrepresented certain facts to Karan as to the fitness of the horse. These facts will be discussed more fully as relates to their impact on the validity and enforceability of the release. These same facts are also relevant to whether triable issues of fact exist as to duty and breach of duty. While, under our facts, we believe liability may be imposed upon a determination that Nunnink negligently increased the risk of harm by allowing Mia to ride an unfit horse, facts as to the affirmative misrepresentations create triable issues as to whether her culpability rises to the level of recklessness. On the issue of causation, they are also relevant in determining whether Karan would have pulled Mia out of the event save and except for the facts misrepresented by Nunnink.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> Here, as in <em>Santa Barbara, </em>there was no cause of action alleging \u201cgross negligence\u201d against Nunnink. As indicated in <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Whitewater Voyages, Inc. </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 758, 766, footnote 9 [276 Cal.Rptr. 672]: \u201cIn reality, California does not recognize a distinct cause of action for \u2018gross negligence\u2019 independent of a statutory basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\"> Other than an undisputed fact that Nunnink did not \u201cown, possess, or control the premises\u201d on which the incident occurred, the only undisputed fact directed toward the release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>was undisputed fact No. 20, wherein the following is stated: \u201cOver five months before the November 4, 2006 date of Mia Eriksson\u2019s subject accident and her riding in the Galway Downs 3-day eventing competition, on May 21, 2006 Mia and her mother, <em>viz., </em>plaintiff KARAN [ERIKKSON], signed a clear, \u2018RELEASE OF LIABILITY\u2019 for any injuries or death that might occur to Mia Eriksson as a result of the \u2018use of Trainer [Kristi Nunnink]\u2019s services\u2019 that would include the Galway Downs 3-day Eventing competition, on behalf of Mia Eriksson, since she was still 17 years old and a minor, noting that they expressly assumed the risk of any such injuries or death.\u201d Clearly, this undisputed fact is directed solely to the existence of the release. It does not address the issue of whether Nunnink\u2019s conduct was grossly negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\"> See <em>Kahn, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at page 998, wherein the plaintiff alleged that the defendant broke his promise to her that she would not have to dive at swim meets.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
