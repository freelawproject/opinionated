We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">The underlying facts are not disputed. An amended complaint was filed on August 18, 2008, charging defendant with second degree burglary in violation of Penal Code section 459<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (count one) and grand theft in violation of section 487, subdivision (a) (count two). The amended complaint further alleged that defendant had a prior strike conviction in 2000 for a serious or violent felony within the meaning of the three strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and served a prior prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of burglary and grand theft. Defendant waived his right to a jury determination of the truth of the prior conviction and prior prison term enhancement allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The court held a bench trial on the enhancement allegations. The court admitted into evidence certified copies of records showing defendant was previously convicted in 2000 of violating Vehicle Code section 23104, subdivision (b)\u2014reckless driving that proximately causes great bodily injury\u2014with a prior conviction for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The People argued that defendant\u2019s prior conviction was for a serious felony within the meaning of section 1192.8, and thus constituted a strike under the three strikes law. Defense counsel disagreed, arguing the People failed to prove the prior conviction was for a serious felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The following documents were submitted by the People to prove the prior conviction: (1) handwritten minute orders; (2) a fingerprint form; (3) minute orders from defendant\u2019s plea; (4) an abstract of judgment and order of probation; (5) an amended complaint filed December 7, 1999, charging defendant with reckless driving that \u201cdid proximately cause great bodily injury to\u201d three victims, including a 12-year-old child; (6) a reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing at which defendant\u2019s plea was taken,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (7) a section 969b packet from California\u2019s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The reporter\u2019s transcript of defendant\u2019s plea hearing includes the following as the factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea: \u201cOn the date stated in the complaint, in the County of Sacramento, the defendant drove his vehicle upon a highway with willful[] and wanton disregard for the safety of other persons, did drive his vehicle recklessly, did approximately [sz'c] cause great bodily injury upon Susan and John Houk, H-O-U-K, within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7 . . . .\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel agreed to the description of the crime, asking only that the minor victim be included in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Defense counsel argued the People failed to prove the prior conviction was a serious felony because they failed to prove the victims were not accomplices to defendant\u2019s crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The People responded that because one of the victims was a minor, the record of conviction proved there was at least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>victim who was statutorily incapable of being an accomplice, absent clear and convincing evidence he knew of the wrongful act at the time it was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The trial court was not persuaded by defendant\u2019s argument. The court determined the prosecution proved defendant\u2019s prior 2000 conviction was a serious felony. The court also found true the allegation that defendant served a term in prison for the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The court then sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of three years eight months: (1) the low term of 16 months for count one, doubled for the strike; (2) the low term of 16 months for count two, doubled for the strike and stayed pursuant to section 654; and (3) an additional one year for defendant\u2019s prior prison term, pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Defendant timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">I. The Record Contains Insufficient Evidence to Support a Finding That Defendant\u2019s Prior Conviction Was for a Serious Felony</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to prove his 2000 conviction for reckless driving, which proximately caused great bodily injury, was for a serious felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Defendant\u2019s 2000 conviction was determined by the court to be a qualifying \u201cserious\u201d prior felony conviction, requiring his sentence in the current proceeding to be doubled. (\u00a7 1170.12, subds. (b)(1), (c)(1).) Section 1192.8 defines a \u201cserious\u201d felony as including \u201cany violation of . . . subdivision (b) of Section 23104 ... of the Vehicle Code, when any of these offenses involve the <em>personal infliction </em>of great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1192.8, subd. (a), italics added.) The People had the burden to prove each of the elements of this definition beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People v. Henley </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 555, 562 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 123].)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">We review defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s serious felony finding in accordance with the usual rules on appeal applicable to claims of insufficient evidence. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103] <em>(Ochoa); People </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 276, 279 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 234].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201c \u2018The proper test for determining a claim of insufficiency of evidence in a criminal case is whether, on the entire record, a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citations.] On appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the People and must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ochoa, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 1206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The prosecution is entitled to go beyond the least adjudicated elements of the prior offense and use the entire record to prove the prior conviction was for a serious or violent felony. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 253, 261-262 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 949 P.2d 31]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 352 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150].) When, however, the record fails to disclose the facts of the prior crime, the court must presume the prior conviction was for the least offense punishable under the statute. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 262; <em>People v. Bueno </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1503, 1508 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Vehicle Code section 23104 is violated whenever reckless driving of a vehicle <em>\u201cproximately causes great bodily injury </em>to a person other than the driver . . . .\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23104, subd. (b), italics added.) With nothing more than defendant\u2019s bare plea, we must assume defendant\u2019s reckless driving proximately caused injury to another person. (See <em>People v. Bueno, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 1508.) But the fact that defendant proximately caused great bodily injury to another person does not establish that defendant <em>personally inflicted </em>great bodily injury to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u201c[T]he statutory term \u2018personally inflict\u2019 has a distinct meaning, which is something different than proximate cause. <em>(People v. Cole </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 568 [183 Cal.Rptr. 350, 645 P.2d 1182] . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 341, 348 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 567] <em>(Rodriguez).) </em>Case law establishes that proof a defendant proximately caused great bodily injury does not constitute proof the defendant personally inflicted such injury. <em>(People v. Bland </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 313, 337 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d 1107]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 574, 580 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 805]; <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 347-348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The Supreme Court considered whether section 12022.53, subdivision (d) requires that a defendant personally inflict great bodily injury or death. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bland, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 333-338.) The court noted that \u201cSection 12022.53[, subdivision ](d) requires that the defendant \u2018intentionally and <em>personally </em>discharged a firearm\u2019 (italics added), but only that he \u2018proximately caused\u2019 the great bodily injury or death.\u201d <em>(Bland, </em>at p. 336.) The court observed, \u201c[p]roximately causing and personally inflicting harm are two different things.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Two, emphasized the distinction between proximately causing and personally inflicting great bodily injury. <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 347-348.) There, the court considered whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for resisting a police officer and proximately causing serious bodily injury (\u00a7 148.10) constituted a serious felony. The court explained that defendant Rodriguez\u2019s prior felony conviction would constitute a serious felony only if he personally inflicted great bodily injury in the prior case. <em>(Rodriguez, </em>at pp. 347-348.) The court held that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury it could find the prior conviction constituted a serious felony if it found Rodriguez had proximately caused great bodily injury in the prior case, stating: \u201cTo \u2018personally inflict\u2019 an injury is to directly cause an injury, not just to proximately cause it. The instruction was wrong because it allowed the jury to find against Rodriguez if the officer\u2019s injury was a \u2018direct, natural and probable consequence\u2019 of Rodriguez\u2019s action, even if Rodriguez did not personally inflict the injury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The Court of Appeal, Fifth Appellate District, again recognized this distinction in <em>People v. Guzman </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 761, 763 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 885]. There, the court rejected Guzman\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that he personally inflicted great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7) while driving under the influence of alcohol and causing bodily injury to another person (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)) and driving with a 0.08 percent blood-alcohol level or more and causing bodily injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (b)). Guzman made an unsafe left turn in front of one vehicle and collided with another vehicle. His passenger was seriously injured. <em>(Guzman, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In analyzing Guzman\u2019s claim, the court acknowledged that in order for the great bodily injury enhancement to apply, \u201cthe defendant must directly cause an injury, not just proximately cause it.\u201d <em>(People v. Guzman, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 764, citing <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 347.) The court concluded, however, that Guzman\u2019s turn into oncoming traffic was a \u201cvolitional act\u201d and the direct cause of the collision. Thus, Guzman personally inflicted the injury on his passenger. <em>(Guzman, </em>at p. 764.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">' Here, accordingly, defendant\u2019s admission that he, and not an accomplice, drove recklessly and proximately caused great bodily injury, is insufficient to prove his prior conviction was for a serious felony. The People must also prove defendant \u201cdirectly, personally, himself inflict[ed] the injuries]\u201d to his victims. <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 349.) While the bare facts of his plea establish that defendant\u2019s reckless driving was a volitional act, we are still left to speculate on the precise cause of the victims\u2019 injuries. Unlike in <em>Guzman, </em>where the trial court expressly determined that Guzman made an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>unsafe left turn in front of one vehicle and collided with another, directly causing injury to his victim, here we have no facts describing the cause of the victims\u2019 injuries. It could be that the victims were injured when another driver swerved to avoid defendant and that driver\u2019s vehicle collided with the victims. In such a case, the other driver\u2019s volitional act of swerving out of defendant\u2019s path would be the direct cause of the victims\u2019 injuries, though defendant\u2019s reckless driving would still be the proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">It also is not sufficient that defendant admitted he \u201cdid approximately [ric] cause great bodily injury . . . within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7. \u201d Section 12022.7 does not define \u201cproximately causing great bodily injury.\u201d Indeed, the term \u201cproximately cause\u201d appears nowhere in the statute. What is defined in section 12022.7 is \u201cgreat bodily injury,\u201d which is defined as a significant or substantial physical injury. (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (f).) Thus, in defendant\u2019s admission that he \u201cdid approximately <em>[sic\\ </em>cause great bodily injury upon [the victims], within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7, \u201d the phrase \u201cwithin the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7\u201d can refer only to the term \u201cgreat bodily injury,\u201d not \u201cproximately cause.\u201d Any other interpretation would be without foundation in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Defendant\u2019s bare plea to violating Vehicle Code section 23104, subdivision (b) does not prove he personally inflicted great bodily injury on his victims. Without additional facts regarding the crime, there is insufficient evidence that defendant\u2019s prior conviction was for a serious felony within the meaning of Penal Code section 1192.8. We shall remand the case to the trial court with directions that the People be afforded the opportunity to present sufficient evidence that defendant was previously convicted of a serious felony.  <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barragan </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 236, 239 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 76, 83 P.3d 480] [\u201c[R]etrial of a strike allegation is permissible where a trier of fact finds the allegation to be true, but an appellate court reverses that finding for insufficient evidence.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">II.-IVA<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The judgment is reversed to the extent it is based on the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant was previously convicted of a serious felony. The People shall have 60 days after the remittitur is filed in which to give notice of their intent to seek retrial of the prior serious felony conviction allegation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>If the People give such notice, the court shall hold a new trial on the prior serious felony allegation. If the People fail to give such notice, the court shall resentence defendant in accordance with this opinion, including the award of additional section 4019 credits as discussed in the unpublished portion of this opinion. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The sentencing minute orders and amended abstract of judgment are ordered corrected to include the additional one year in state prison imposed as a result of defendant\u2019s prior prison term pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b).
