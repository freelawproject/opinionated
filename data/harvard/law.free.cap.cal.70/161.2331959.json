To that extent they are nuisances, and the person over whose land they extend may cut them off, or have his action for damages and an abatement of the nuisance; but he cannot cut down the trees, nor remove the branches thereof except so far as they overhang his soil.

The complaint alleged in effect that the trees had been allowed to grow to such a size that they had caused damage to the land of the plaintiff by lessening its value, and by reason of their dense shade, falling leaves, and protruding roots, and had broken down the division fence between his land and that of the defendant, so that stock belonging to the latter were enabled to trespass upon his land. The defendant demurred to the complaint, on the grounds that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; that several causes of action were improperly joined and not separately stated, and that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ambiguous, unintelligible, and uncertain, because it did not specifically state the amount of damage resulting from either the shade, the falling leaves, or the decrease in value of the land. The demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff declining to amend, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant. The further, facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>Henry Starr, </em>and <em>A. P. Catlin, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-6\">The trees were a nuisance. (Civil Code, sec. 3501; <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Nye, </em>99 Mass. 582; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>108 Mass. 261; Wood on Nuisance, secs. 103-106, 865; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Metzler., </em>51 Cal. 142.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-7\"><em>Freeman, Bates &amp; Rankin, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\">The remedy of plaintiff was by cutting off the overhanging branches and protruding roots. <em>(Countryman </em>v. <em>Lighthill, </em>24 Hun, 407.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b194-9\">McKinstry, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8kg\">The court below sustained a demurrer to the complaint. <em>\u201c </em>Trees whose branches extend over the land of another are not nuisances, except to the extent to which -the branches overhang the adjoining land. To that extent they <em>are </em>nuisances, and the person over whose land they extend may cut them off or have his action for damages, and an abatement of the nuisance against the owner or occupant of the land on which they grow, but he may not cut down the <em>tree, </em>neither can he cut the branches thereof beyond the extent to which they overhang his soil.\u201d (Wood on Nuisances, sec. 112, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>107 Mass. 234; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>16 Serg. &amp; R. 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">So, it' would seem, he may have abated the roots projecting into his soil, at least if he has suffered actual damage thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">The general demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The defendant also demurred on the ground of the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>joinder of actions. There is only one count in the complaint. There is no direct averment therein that the trees have so grown as that any portion of the trunks are on plaintiff\u2019s land. The averments as to the trunks having so grown as to break the dividing fence, and thus let in hogs which have destroyed plaintiff\u2019s crops, may be rejected as surplusage, and not to be treated as a statement of a separate cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">While we are compelled to hold that the complaint is not subject to general demurrer, nor to a demurrer for misjoinder of actions, we think that it is ambiguous and uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Myrick, J., and Ross, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
