When Moran-Paz was searched in response to a call claiming he entered a bar with a pistol, law enforcement authorities seized the pistol and approximately .247 grams of powder cocaine. Because possession of that amount of powder cocaine is a felony in North Carolina, the district court increased Moran-Paz\u2019s offense level by four levels pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2001). On appeal, MoranPaz contends the court erred because there was no evidence that his possession of the firearm was \u201cin connection with\u201d his possession of the small \u201cuser amount\u201d of powder cocaine. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-24\">The Government bears the burden of proving the facts necessary to establish the applicability of an enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) and we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001). A finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court \u201cis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-25\">In this case, the district court determined that Moran-Paz possessed the gun to protect his person and his property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>that his property included the small amount of cocaine, and thus that he possessed the gun to protect, among other things, the cocaine. There is no evidence to the contrary, and this factual finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Regans, </em>125 F.3d 685, 686-87 (8th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
