We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Freeman\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-24\">Parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court's final judgment, when the United States is a party, to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-25\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on November 30, 2001. Freeman\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on February 8, 2002, under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Because Freeman failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
