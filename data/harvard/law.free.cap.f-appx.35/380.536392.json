We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a), (b)(1) (2001); <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). We accordingly affirm the Board\u2019s order. We grant Respondent\u2019s motion for leave to file answering brief out of time, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
