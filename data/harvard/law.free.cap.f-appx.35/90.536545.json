City of Jacksonville, </em>No. CA-00-120-7F1 (E.D.N.C. July 17, 2001). Thompson claims Appellee wrongfully terminated her based upon her race and sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001). After careful review of the record and the district court\u2019s order, we reject Thompson\u2019s claims as meritless. Thompson has conceded that her claim \u201cdoes not dovetail neatly with the <em>McDonnell Douglas [Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973),] framework or its Fourth Circuit progeny.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7.) Moreover, even giving Thompson the benefit of all permissible inferences, she has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact showing that Appellee\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for her termination were pretextual. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
