For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The district court, acting sua sponte, determined from the face of Robinson\u2019s petition that his action was barred by the one-year limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(d) (West Supp.2001), and dismissed the action without giving Robinson notice or an opportunity to respond. Our recent decision in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002), issued after the district court\u2019s opinion, now requires the district court to provide such a warning \u201cunless it is indisputably clear from the materials presented to the district court that the petition is untimely and cannot be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 2244(d)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Because it is not \u201cindisputably clear\u201d on the present record that Robinson cannot salvage his petition, we grant Robinson\u2019s motions for a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand to the district court to provide Robinson with the notice and opportunity to respond to which he is now entitled pursuant to <em>Hill. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
