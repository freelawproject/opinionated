Butler appeals from the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(e) motion without prejudice and denying his motion for reconsideration. A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if no amendment of the complaint could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, we must determine whether Butler could save his motion by merely amending and refiling. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Because Butler\u2019s motion was dismissed without prejudice, Butler could file either another Rule 41(e) motion, amended in accordance with the district court\u2019s instructions, and/or a motion for authorization from this court to file a successive 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001) motion attacking his underlying conviction. In fact, after Butler\u2019s motion was denied, he filed an amended Rule 41(e) motion in district court. Therefore, the district court\u2019s orders are not appealable. Accordingly, we deny premission to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under <em>Domino Sugar. </em>We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
