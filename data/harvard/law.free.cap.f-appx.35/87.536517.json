R.App. P. 4(b), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Rucker\u2019s notice of appeal was dated April 22, 2001, and filed on May 2, 2001. Because Rucker failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
