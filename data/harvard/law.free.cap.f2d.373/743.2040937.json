Respondent\u2019s mark, however, does not fall within this pattern. Considering re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>spondent\u2019s mark as a whole, it seems clear that the term \u201cDan\u201d is merely a portion of a unitary term, \u201cDansk Form\u201d, which creates a commercial impression signally different than \u201cDan\u201d, per se, or petitioner\u2019s pleaded registered marks. Respondent\u2019s mark immediately suggests or describes its goods as being of Danish form or style rather than as products produced by or emanating from petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">We find nothing in the record or the decisions <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relied on by appellant to convince us that the board erred in holding as it did. Granted the obvious similarities here, as is generally true in such appeals, we think that when the marks are viewed in their entirety on the respective fabrics, their differences will preclude the likelihood that purchasers will be confused, misled or deceived as to the source of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-14\">. \u201cDan River,\u201d \u201cDan Star,\u201d \u201cDanstar,\u201d and \u201cDansport.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-24\">.
