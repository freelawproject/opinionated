The signals picked up by the external receiving coils correspond to measured conditions in the patient\u2019s digestive tract, such as the pH factor. Basically, appellant\u2019s invention resides in the use of a plurality \u2019of receiving coils, preferably two or three, with non-parallel axes. This solves the problem inherent in the fact that the endoradiosonde, while traveling through the digestive tract, may become so oriented that the inductive coupling between the transmitting and receiving coils may at times be zero, when only one coil of each type is used, with the result being that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>no signal is picked up by the receiver system.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Generic claim 1 is illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">1. A receiver arrangement for use with a swallowable pill-type transmitter having a transmitting coil, said receiver arrangement comprising, in combination: a plurality of receiving coils having non-parallel axes; receiver output means; and circuit means interposed between said plurality of receiving coils and said output means for connecting to the latter the particular receiving coil having, at any given instant, the highest coupling with the transmitting coil, and therefore capable of feeding thi strongest signal to said output means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6N\">Dependent claims 2 and 3 ar~ directed to specific embodiments having three receiving coils with axes in mutually perpendicular planes, and two coils-with nonparallel, non-perpendicular axes, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The references relied on are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">Martin 1.719.896 July 9, 1929</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjT\">Moore 1,849,632 March 15, 1932</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac3\">Fisher 1,855,184 April 26, 1932</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK_\">Grimes 2,250,370 July 22, 1941</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE3\">McDonald 2,551,805 May 8, 1951</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtkV\">Crosby 2,720,583 October 11, 1955</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akt\">Bieganski 3.051.896 August 28, 1962</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMq\">(filed May 6, 1958)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-20\">Bieganski, the primary reference, describes an external system for use with a \u201cradio pill,\u201d or endoradiosonde, located in the gastrointestinal tract. The reference discloses that \u201c[a] loop antenna may be used to provide the inductive coupling between the pill circuit and the resonant circuit of the apparatus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-21\">The secondary references disclose, inter alia, various arrangements of loop antennas and diversity reception systems utilizing a plurality of such antennae, and switches connecting the antennas receiving the strongest signals to the output means.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-22\">Martin, for example, shows \u201ca receiving circuit which takes advantage of the difference in the space absorption charr acteristics of two loop antennae * . * * placed with their axes perpendicular to each other.\u201d The patent further discloses that \u201cthe signal from three antennae at one point may be combined, as would be obtained by the use of two crossed loops and a vertical antenna.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-24\">Fisher, describes a radio receiving system which includes two loop antennas, and states that \u201c[b]est results are secured by maintaining an angular relation between the planes of [the two loop antennas], although this angular relation is generally somewhat less than 90 degrees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-25\">The examiner\u2019s position is that it would be obvious to modify the loop antenna system disclosed by Bieganski in light of the secondary references, particularly Martin and Fisher. The examiner concisely, stated his reasoning in the final rejection as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-26\">In summation, a loop antenna arrangement in connection with a swallowable pill-type transmitter is old in the art [Bieganski]; a loop antenna diversity system is old in the art [Martin, Fisher, and the other secondary references of record] ; thus a loop antenna diversity receiver system can find one application in connection with a swallowable pill-type transmitter, and such an application would be obvious to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>one possessing ordinary skill in the art.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In affirming the examiner, the board adopted his position as its own. Appellant states the issue here as \u201cwhether it is obvious, within the meaning and spirit of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, to apply the diversity principle known in the radio art to the swallowable transmitter art.\u201d We agree with the Patent Office tribunal that it is obvious. We think that Bieganski\u2019s disclosure of a \u201cloop antenna\u201d system would cause the ordinarily skilled artisan to resort to the loop antenna art for details as to the design and arrangement of such devices. In that art the Patent Office classifies at least some of the numerous patents describing the diversity principle, which relates to the use of switches and a plurality of antennas with nonparallel axes in order to insure reception of the strongest signals emitted by a radio transmitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Appellant argues that Bieganski\u2019s use of the term \u201cloop antenna\u201d is confusing and \u201ctechnically inaccurate because the arrangement shown in Bieganski involves the use of coils which are inductively or magnetically coupled with each other.\u201d In response to this argument, the examiner pointed out the disclosure in Grimes that \u201ca loop antenna is primarily responsive only to the magnetic component of the desired electromagnetic wave signal,\u201d which shows that a loop antenna is, in effect, a magnetically coupled, or inductive, coil. Also, while the inductive coil <em>shown </em>by Bieganski may not, in strict terminology, be a loop antenna, we note the reference disclosure that the depicted inductor \u201cmay actually be a loop antenna in order to provide inductive coupling * * Thus the patent specification clearly discloses a loop antenna system, even if the drawings are not considered to show one.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The MacKay article in the January 3, 1958, engineering edition of \u201cElectronics,\u201d entitled \u201cPill Telemeters from Digestive Tract,\u201d is also pertinent here in its disclosure that the \u201c[s]ignal is picked up by antenna loop connected to receiver.\u201d It is evident that both Bieganski and MacKay describe the use of loop antenna systems together with endoradiosondes.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Appellant cites the MacKay article and a 1959 German publication entitled \u201cNachrichtentechnik,\u201d Vol. 9, p. 452, as evidence that the problem of orientation of the main axis of the pill-type transmitter relative to the receiving antenna is one which was recognized to exist in the prior art. We agree that this is relevant evidence, and that the proposals disclosed by MacKay for modifying the transmitter design are also relevant evidence of the unobviousness of appellant\u2019s solution of the problem by modification of the receiver system. See Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">However, the prior art recognition that the essence of the problem is orientation of the transmitter axis in relation to that of a single antenna clearly suggests, we think, that the problem might be solved satisfactorily by redesigning <em>either </em>the pill-type transmitter or the antenna reception system. Since both the 1958 MacKay article and the Bieganski patent (application filed May 6, 1958) clearly disclose the use of loop antenna systems, we think it would have been obvious to the skilled artisan to resort to the loop antenna art for details as to the design and arrangement of such devices, at the time appellant\u2019s invention was made, which we consider to be January 16, 1960, the filing date of appellant\u2019s counterpart German application, priority of which is claimed under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119. The secondary references disclose the use of a plurality of such antennas having non-parallel axes in diversity receiver systems such as those disclosed and claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">Since we find no reversible error in the decision of the board, that decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
