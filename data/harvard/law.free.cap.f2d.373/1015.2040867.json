Annual sales were initially about $20,000 to $25,000. They grew to approximately $140,000 to $150,000 in the years 1960-1962. Sales for 1963 were about $50,000. Sales of $75,000 to $80,000 were predicted for 1964.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>evidence of registrant\u2019s advertising expenditures has been introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">The petitioner has for many years sold a variety of products including animal feeds, cereals, and farm equipment under numerous trademarks utilizing a checkerboard design or variants of the word CHECKER. Its registrations of these trademarks include registrations for livestock and poultry feeds, bread, baked rye flour products, various other food products, feed containers, watering fountains for animals, insecticides, fungicides, and vermifuges, antibiotics and even magazines. It is petitioner\u2019s practice to show the checkerboard mark on all advertising material and printed forms. Its advertising expenditures during the years 1958-1962 were in excess of seventy-two million dollars. Its total sales over that same period exceeded three billion dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Petitioner also owns and operates a chain of rural stores which sell its products and others at retail. The latter are called Checkerboard stores and are identified by a checkerboard design on the store fronts. Customer\u2019s receipts bear the checkerboard design. These stores sold binder twine before registrant\u2019s first use of CHECKERBOARD. Petitioner has introduced into evidence sales tickets for binder twine from 1956 and 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The board dismissed the petition for cancellation because, in its view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-7\">* * * regardless of any asserted prior rights petitioner is now claiming in its checkerboard design and its registered marks pleaded herein, it has either acquiesced, by acts of omission and commission, to respondent\u2019s asserted superior rights in its registered mark as applied to bailer twine or had taken the past position that there was no confusion in trade because it regarded respondent\u2019s product as substantially different from the goods on which it used its mark, or marks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-17\">That conclusion is built upon evidence of the following chronology. Application for the registration in question was filed March 4, 1960, and registration issued December 6, 1960. On March 7, 1961, attorneys for appellee\u2019s predecessor, wrote to a supplier of petitioner, objecting to the supplier\u2019s shipment of twine under the trademark CHECKER into the United States as an infringement of his company\u2019s rights in its registered trademark CHECKERBOARD. On March 29, 1961, petitioner\u2019s attorney answered that letter and requested certain information on registrant\u2019s mark and its use. In the next two weeks several other letters were exchanged by counsel. Petitioner\u2019s counsel then learned that Mr. Long, at that time president and owner of appellee\u2019s predecessor, was a valued customer of petitioner and, in response to a suggestion from the sales department, arranged a conference with him, during which petitioner\u2019s counsel suggested that Mr. Long contact one of petitioner\u2019s buyers to negotiate sales of twine and other products. Mr. Long did so and by May 18, 1961, sold 900 bales of twine to petitioner under the CHECKERBOARD label. Negotiations continued at least into the latter part of June but no further purchases could be agreed upon. In November and December 1961, Mr. Long wrote to petitioner\u2019s buyer about prices for the coming season. On December 21, 1961, petitioner\u2019s attorney wrote to Mr. Long and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>expressed concern over the use of CHECKERBOARD in the farm supply field. Petitioner no longer sells twine under the CHECKER mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The board\u2019s analysis of the foregoing led it to dismiss the petition for cancellation. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-5\">In summary, the record shows that petitioner has had actual knowledge of respondent\u2019s use and registration of its mark since early in 1961; following such notice, and with the apparent consent of its legal counsel on such matters, it negotiated and subsequently bought \u201cCHECKERBOARD\u201d bailer twine from respondent and discontinued its purchases of \u201cCHECKER\u201d bailer twine from another party. While Mr. Fraser [petitioner\u2019s counsel], in his testimony on his recollections as to his dealings with respondent, now takes the inconsistent positions that it was his feeling that the respondent would only use its mark on goods which were sold exclusively to petitioner or that respondent would forego the use of its mark \u201cCHECKERBOARD\u201d if petitioner were to purchase its products, the record fails to support either of these positions. In fact, to the contrary, it indicates that petitioner acquiesced to [in] respondent\u2019s asserted superior rights in its mark for bailer twine, and that respondent apparently expanded its business in \u201cCHECKERBOARD\u201d for such goods on the basis thereof. It is concluded that petitioner is precluded by its past actions from now asserting that it will be damaged by the continued existence of respondent\u2019s registration of [on] the register.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The registrant, properly, we think, interprets the board\u2019s opinion thus expressed to be \u201cthat laches or acquiescence amounting to estoppel is present in the case at bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">The doctrine here invoked has been available in trademark infringement suits at least since McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245, 24 L.Ed. 828 (1877), in which, although an injunction was granted, an accounting was denied because of \u201cacquiescence of long standing\u201d and \u201cinexcusable laches.\u201d The circumstances under which an injunction would also be denied became clearer in the subsequent cases. In Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514, 9 S.Ct. 143, 32 L.Ed. 526 (1888), the Court commented on McLean v. Fleming:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-10\">Mere delay or acquiescence cannot defeat the remedy by injunction in support of the legal right, unless it has been continued so long, and under such circumstances, as to defeat the right itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">These circumstances, the Court indicated, may well arise \u201cwhere the use by others for a long period, under assumed permission of the owner, had largely enhanced the reputation of a particular brand.\u201d The equity of a defendant in his promotional expenditures was soon established. Valvoline Oil Co. v. Havoline Oil Co., 211 F. 189 (D.C.N.Y.1913). It is in this form that the doctrine comes to us. However, the obligation has always been on the infringer to show not only inexcusable delay or apparent acquiescence but also \u201csome reason why it will not be just to stop him.\u201d Dwinell-Wright Co. v. White House Milk Co., 132 F.2d 822 (2d Cir. 1943, L. Hand, J.). The registrant, of course, has the right to invoke the doctrine in a cancellation proceeding. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1069 (1964); Loma Linda Food Co. v. Thomson &amp; Taylor Spice Co., 279 F.2d 522, 47 CCPA 1071 (1960); Halliday, Laches, Acquiescence and Estoppel in Registration Cases, 40 Trademark Rep. 85 (1950). He, however, bears the burden of showing the injustice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Loma Linda, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>We cannot agree that registrant has here met that burden. It, to be sure, has shown activity on the part of petitioner which, for the sake of argument, may be deemed acquiescence in registrant\u2019s use of the mark.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But it has not made even a serious effort to show prejudice to itself as a result of petitioner\u2019s retreat from that stance. We see no decisions made by registrant in reliance upon petitioner\u2019s purported acquiescence. We have no evidence of promotional expenditure. Sales data are too imprecise even to indicate any substantial growth of registrant\u2019s trade in the six-month period between petitioner\u2019s alleged acquiescence and first assertion of right in the mark for baler twine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"> It is probably true that long acquiescence in the use of a trademark by a successful business, even without expansion of trade, may provide a basis for a valid inference of prejudice. See Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Du Bois Brewing Co., 175 F.2d 370 (3d Cir. 1949). Logically, we suppose, it must be admitted that each day sees some incremental aggrandizement of good will\u2014 each advertising dollar expended adds in some sense to registrant\u2019s equity. But a minimal equity thus acquired over such a short period of time as six months has never been enough to overturn another\u2019s rights in a trademark. Some substanial prejudice has always been required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Registrant has cited three cases. In each of these, it seems to us, the injustice in stopping the latecomer\u2019s use of the mark was manifest. In Valvoline Oil Co. v. Havoline Oil Co., supra, the combination of an unexcused delay of eight years with advertising expenditures of at least $100,000 persuaded the court that equity forbade an injunction. In Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. J. L. Prescott Co., 102 F. 2d 773 (3d Cir. 1939), advertising expenditures of almost $14,000,000 were again decisive in light of an unexeused delay of at least five years. AnheuserBusch, Inc. v. Du Bois Brewing Co., supra, was an extraordinary case in which the infringing business had not expanded at all in 40 years. But the good will acquired and advertising of defendants during that long period, coupled with plaintiff\u2019s apparent acquiescence, convinced the court\u2019s majority that an injunction would be unfair. We find it impossible to equate these cases with the one at bar. We cannot so lightly find that the registrant was prejudiced. See Meat Industry Suppliers, Inc. v. Kroger Co., 130 U.S.P.Q. 434 (N.D.Ill. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">The parties were asked to file supplementary briefs in which they discussed Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Dunhill Tailored Clothes, Inc., 119 U.S.P.Q., 325 (S.D.N.Y.1958), a typical case in which prejudice was inferred from long acquiescence. Registrant\u2019s comments on that ease are of interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-13\">While the period of time of the knowledge, cordiality and sales, and apparent acquiescence is much less in the instant case than in <em>Dunhill, </em>the present case involves additional facts of significance, namely (a) the demand * * * by registrant that petitioner cease use of the trade-mark; (b) the compliance by petitioner with such demand * * * (c) discussions between petitioner\u2019s counsel and registrant\u2019s principal subsequent to the reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>istrant\u2019s demand, in which no counter demand was made by the petitioner; (d) registrant\u2019s apparent right to assume that it was acting properly in view of the absence of any use of petitioner\u2019s trademark in any field even remotely analogous to baler twine; and (e) the absence of any confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A25\">The additional facts recited do not reflect any injustice consequent upon the petition for cancellation. They show neither reliance nor other prejudice. They seem to spring from a vague feeling that it was somehow unfair for the hitherto docile petitioner, of a sudden, to take the offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Registrant\u2019s defense is, after all, an equitable one. We do not scan petitioner\u2019s history for one fatal misstep. We sustain petitioner\u2019s rights in the absence of a showing that to do so would work <em>injustice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ait\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1074-6\">WORLEY, C.

Testimony on registrant\u2019s sales was somewhat imprecise.' Mr. Elwood Long, the former president and owner of appellee\u2019s predecessor, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-14\">Mr. Long, can you tell us some estimate of your volume of sales during the years that you were handling this Checkerboard twine? I believe you said from \u201958 to late December of \u201962? A. Well, our smallest years would run twenty to twenty-five thousand starting in \u201958 and \u201959. And then the volume grew up to a hundred and forty to fifty thousand in \u201960 and \u201961 and in \u201962.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-25\">Mr. Victor Barredo, general manager of registrant also testified on sales:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-27\">Qll.

Since January, 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-10\">Q14. And how did you come to commence it at that time? A.

Oh, around \u2014 I don\u2019t have the exact figure \u2014 but I would say close to fifty thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-19\">Q17. Do you have a forecast of your sales for 1964? A. Well, we anticipate an increase and we are figuring that\u2014 rather we are getting prepared for an increase to around probably seventy-five or eighty thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-20\">We adopt registrant\u2019s view for purposes of this opinion i. e., that the testimony refers to sales of <em>twine </em>under the CHECKERBOARD trademark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">.

We think petitioner\u2019s actions were subject to several interpretations.
