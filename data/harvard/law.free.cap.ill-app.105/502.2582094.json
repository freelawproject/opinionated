Doherty and appellant.</p><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-7\" pgmap=\"524\">The Dohertys executed to Witbeck, November 1, 1897, their two promissory notes, payable to their own order and by them indorsed, one for' the sum of $6,000, due five years after date, and the other for the sum of $1,500, due two years after date, both notes bearing interest at the rate of six per cent per annum before maturity, and on default of payment of the interest at maturity, the interest to be seven per cent after maturity. The interest was payable semi-annually and was evidenced by interest notes. Payment of the $1,500 note was extended by indorsement thereon, as follows : \u201c The within $1,500 principal note is hereby extended as follows : $500 to be paid on or before May 1, 1901, and the remaining $1,000 to be paid on or before November 1, 1901.\u201d \u201c Three interest coupons of $45 each, due, one May 1, 1900, one November 1,1900, and one interest coupon for $30, due November 1, 1901, are to be given for the semi-annual six per cent interest to accrue during such extension.\u201d Notes for the semi-annual interest were given accordingly. The trust deed contains a provision that \u201c if the time for the payment of the principal sum aforesaid shall be extended, the provisions of said note and this trust deed shall continue in force until the sums hereby secured are fully paid.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-3\" pgmap=\"525\">Issues having been made upon the bill, the cause was referred to a master to take proofs and report his conclusions. Pending the reference to the master, the court made the following order:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\" pgmap=\"525\">\u201c This cause having come on to be heard, upon motion of the complainant to appoint a receiver of the property named in the bill in this cause, and upon the bill of complaint herein, and it appearing to the court that there should be a receiver to take charge of the buildings and the property for the benefit of the complainant herein, and said cause having been argued by the counsel for the respective parties, now, therefore, in consideration thereof it is ordered, adjudged and decreed and the court doth hereby order, adjudge and decree, that Homer G.

And the said party of the first part hereby appoints any attorney of any court of record to be the true and lawful attorney of said party of the first part, to appear in any court of record in which any bill may be filed for the foreclosure of this deed, and waive service of process, and file an answer therein confessing all material facts in said bill set forth, and waiving proof thereof, and confessing to be due the amount claimed therein for principal and interest, and advances and expenses under this deed, and consenting to the immediate entry of a decree therefor, and of a decree for strict foreclosure if the same be praye'd in such bill, directing a sale forthwith of said premises, and all right, title and equity of redemption of the party of the first part, the heirs and assigns of said party, therein, in accordance with law and the practice of such court, for the purpose of paying the amount of such decree, interest and costs, and to such other provisions, orders and findings as are usually embraced in such decrees, and consenting that said party of the second part or either of his successors in trust may be appointed a special commissioner to make the' sale provided for in said decree, who shall receive as his commission upon such sale an amount equal to that allowed by law to sheriffs upon sales upon execution, and such compensation as receiver as the court may direct.

Witbeck, from defendants, Maggie A. Doherty and John A. Doherty, and from defendant Sarah Dexter Noe, and from each of them, on account of the provisions of said notes and said deed of trust, and on account of the foregoing, the sum of $7,964.62, as appears from the following items:</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\" pgmap=\"527\">Principal promissory note \u2018 B \u2019 due by election. .$1,500 00</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARF\" pgmap=\"527\">Seven per cent interest on $500 from May 1,1901, to November 1,1901....................... 17 50</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-10\" pgmap=\"527\">Six per cent interest on $1,000 from May 1, 1901, to November 1, 1901........................ 30 00</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-12\" pgmap=\"527\">Extension of interest note No. 3, due May 1,1901 45 00</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-13\" pgmap=\"527\">Seven per cent interest from May 1,1901, to November 1, 1901............................. 1 57</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8q\" pgmap=\"527\">Principal promissory note \u2018A\u2019 due bv election.. 6,000 00</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-15\" pgmap=\"527\">Six per cent interest thereon from May 1, 1901, to November 1, 1901........................ 180 00</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-17\" pgmap=\"527\">Interest note No. \u2018A\u2019 due May 1, 1901......... 180 00</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-18\" pgmap=\"527\">Seven per cent interest thereon from May 1,1901, to November 1, 1901....................... 6 80</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-20\" pgmap=\"527\">August 16, 1901, cash advanced for abstract of title............ 4 25</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-21\" pgmap=\"527\">Total............. $7,964 62</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-22\" pgmap=\"527(20) 528(51)\">\u201c Also the further sum of $375 incurred to be paid herein as and for complainant\u2019s solicitors\u2019 fees, which sum last mentioned is five per cent of the amount of the principal notes secur\u00e9d by said trust deed and expressly provided by said deed of trust, and is a usual, reasonable and customary fee for the services rendered in and about this cause by the solicitors for the complainant.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-4\" pgmap=\"528\">\u201c That said complainant, John H.

The court overruled the exceptions, confirmed the report and decreed in accordance therewith. It was provided in the decree that, in the event of a deficiency, on sale of the premises, the complainant should have a deficiency decree against appellant and the Dohertys.</p><attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-8\" pgmap=\"528\">F. W. Coombs, attorney for appellant; R. W. Robinson, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-9\" pgmap=\"528\">Hillard &amp; Abbey, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b528-10\" pgmap=\"528\">Mr. Justice Adams</author> <p id=\"AqRy\" pgmap=\"528\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b528-11\" pgmap=\"528\">Appellant\u2019s counsel objects that there is no averment in the bill that appellant accepted the deed of the premises in question from the Dohertys, or any evidence that she took possession of the premises, as averred in the bill, or that appellee was the legal owner or holder of the notes at the time of their maturity, of that appellee ever elected to declare any unmatured principal sum due; that there is no evidence to sustain an item of $4.25 included in the amount found due by the master; that the amount allowed as solicitors\u2019 fees is excessive and unwarranted, and that the court erred in appointing a receiver.</p> <p id=\"b528-12\" pgmap=\"528(41) 529(61)\">It is averred in the bill that the Dohertys \u201c executed and delivered to one Sarah Dexter Noe\u201d their warranty deed of the premises described in the trust deed. This is a sufficient averment. A delivery necessarily imports a recipient. Appellant does not deny the delivery to her, or that she accepted; but impliedly admits acceptance of the deed. She avers in her answer that she is the owner of the premises, but denies liability \u201c by reason of the execution or delivery to her of any deed by the said John A. Doherty, or' the said Maggie A. Doherty.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b529-4\" pgmap=\"529\">On the hearing before the master the following occurred :</p> <p id=\"b529-5\" pgmap=\"529\">Q. \u201c Have you got the deed with you, Mr. Coombs, the deed from Maggie A. Doherty and John A. Doherty to Sarah Dexter Hoe, conveying the real estate described in the bill ? \u201d</p> <p id=\"b529-6\" pgmap=\"529\">Mr. Coombs : \u201c Ho, sir, I have not.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b529-7\" pgmap=\"529\">Q. \u201c Mrs. Hoe has the deed, or you have it for her ? \u201d</p> <p id=\"b529-8\" pgmap=\"529\">Mr. Coombs: \u201c My impression is that it has been returned from the recorder\u2019s office. It is either in her possession, or it has not been returned from the recorder\u2019s office.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b529-10\" pgmap=\"529\">Mr. Coombs, appellant\u2019s solicitor, then said he had no objection to the putting in evidence a certified copy of the deed. Whether or not appellant went into actual possession of the premises, is immaterial. The notes were produced and put in evidence by appellee, and William H. Moore testified that the Dohertys executed the notes, and that they were delivered by him, the witness, to appellee. The filing the bill was a sufficient election by appellee to declare the unmatured paper due. As to the item of $4.25 contained in the master\u2019s report as follows, \u201c August 16, 1901, cash advanced for abstract of title,\u201d the evidence is that appellant\u2019s solicitors advanced that sum, on behalf of the complainant, toward paying for an abstract of title. It is, however, sufficient to say that in the objections to the master\u2019s report, which were made exceptions on the hearing, there is no specific objection to the $4.25 item, or any objection- sufficient to call the master\u2019s attention to it. The provision of the trust deed in respect to solicitors\u2019 fees is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b529-11\" pgmap=\"529\">\u201c And it is agreed the sum allowed and decreed for complainant\u2019s solicitors\u2019 fees shall be five per cent of the amount of the principal note hereby secured, and in no event less than one hundred dollars.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b530-3\" pgmap=\"530\">The objection of appellant\u2019s counsel is that there were two principal notes; that the provision quoted should be applied to the smaller, or $1,500 one, and that the fee should be, at most,\" $100. But in a prior part of the trust deed the following occurs : \u201c Now, therefore, this indenture further witnesseth, that the said party of the first part, for the better securing the payment of said principal sum of money, with interest thereon, according to the true intent and meaning of the said principal notes and of the said interest notes, and the prompt fulfillment of the covenants on the part of the said first party herein contained,\u201d etc.; then follow the words of conveyance. The original trust deed put in evidence before the master, and returned by him to the lower court as an exhibit, has been produced before us. It is a printed form, with only such written words in it as are necessary to make it applicable between the parties to it, and in it the words \u201c principal note,\u201d where they occur in the above quotation, are in print, and next after the \u201ce\u201d in the word \u201cnote\u201d the letter \u201cs\u201d is written, making the words to read \u201c principal notes.\u201d We think it clear that, in the provision for solicitors\u2019 fees quoted supra, the letter \u201cs\u201d was omitted by mistake or inadvertence after the word \u201c note,\u201d and that the parties intended five per cent of the principal notes and not of the \u201c principal note.\u201d The parties evidently intended a criterion for the allowance of a solicitor\u2019s fee, but the words \u201c principal note \u201d furnish no criterion, because there are two principal notes, and in this pater t ambiguity it seems impossible to determine on which of the notes, if either, to estimate the five per cent. The parties evidently intended to state an amount, five per cent of which should be allowed as solicitors' fees. In Siegel, Cooper &amp; Co. v. Colby, 176 Ill. 210, the court say:</p> <p id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">\u201c It is well settled that a court of law may, when there is an obvious mistake made on the face of the instrument which is corrected by other expressions therein, when the whole instrument is considered, construe it according to the evident intent.of the parties, as manifested by all the language used.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b530-6\" pgmap=\"530(12) 531(52)\">In Packer v. Roberts, 140 Ill. 9, it is said, in connection with a review of many authorities on this subject, \u201c Inaccuracy of language which results from inserting a word not meant, or using the wrong word, will not be permitted to defeat the intention, when it can be distinctly ascertained.\u201d See also, Packer v. Roberts, cited by the court, supra.</p> <p id=\"b531-4\" pgmap=\"531\">One witness testified before the master that the usual and customary fee for foreclosing a mortgage is five per cent of the amount due. Another testified that a fair, usual and customary fee would be from $400 to $500.</p> <p id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531\">The trust deed contains the following provision :</p> <p id=\"b531-6\" pgmap=\"531\">11 And it is covenanted and agreed by and on behalf of said first party, and on behalf of said first party\u2019s heirs, legal representatives, assigns and lessees of said premises, that upon or after the commencement of proceedings in any court to foreclose this deed of trust, as hereinbefore provided, a receiver may be appointed by such court, and continued in office to manage the aforesaid property, collect the rents and profits thereof, and apply the same to the costs, interest and debt hereby secured, as such court may direct, until the sale of said premises under the decree in such proceeding,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b531-7\" pgmap=\"531\">This provision clearly authorized the appointment of a receiver. McLester v. Rose, 104 Ill. App. 433, citing, among other cases, Loughridge v. Haugan, 79 Ill. App. 644, and First Nat. Bk. v. Ill. Steel Co., 174 Ill. 140. See, also, Bagley v. Ill. T. &amp; S. Bank, 199 Ill. 76.</p> <p id=\"b531-8\" pgmap=\"531\">The sole objection of counsel to the appointment of the receiver is, that the court, after referring the cause to the master, was powerless to hear and determine the application for a receiver. This is rather a startling proposition, and is not in the least supported by Shack v. McKey, 97 Ill. App. 460, or Cox v. Pierce, 120 Ill. 556, cited by counsel. We think it too plain to require argument that the court, by referring the cause to the master, was not rendered powerless to appoint a receiver, as provided by the trust deed.</p> <p id=\"b531-9\" pgmap=\"531\">The decree will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
