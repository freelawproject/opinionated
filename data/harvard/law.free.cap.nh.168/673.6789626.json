J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4W\">Following a jury trial in Superior Court <em>{Wageling, </em>J.), the defendant, Eric R. Cable, appeals his conviction for negligent homicide \u2014 driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI), <em>see </em>RSA 630:3, II (2007), and the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he caused the victim\u2019s death and that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object to the admission of certain evidence and to certain statements by the prosecutor in his opening statement and closing argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">\n<em>I. Brief Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The relevant facts follow. In April 2013, a grand jury indicted the defendant on alternate counts of negligent homicide. <em>See </em>RSA 630:3, I (2007), II; <em>see also State v. Wong, </em>125 N.H. 610, 618-20 (1984) (explaining that, under RSA 630:3, I, II, the culpability requirement of negligent homicide may be satisfied either by showing that a person caused the death of another negligently or by establishing that the person caused the death in the course of driving while under the influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The first count alleged that, on or about July 14, 2012, the defendant committed the crime of negligent homicide \u2014 DUI when he \u201coperated] a powerboat on Northwood Lake\u201d while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and that, as a consequence of being under the influence, he caused the death of the victim \u201cin that, while [the victim] was riding on the gunwales or straddling the bow\u201d of the boat, the defendant \u201cmaneuvered said boat in a manner that resulted in [the victim] falling overboard and being struck by the boat, drive and spinning propeller.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 630:3, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The second count alleged that the defendant committed the crime of negligent homicide on or about July 14, 2012, when he \u201cnegligently[ ] caused the death of [the victim]\u201d by allowing him \u201cto ride on the gunwales or straddle the bow\u201d when the defendant \u201cexecuted a turning maneuver striking the wake of another boat, resulting in [the victim] falling overboard and being struck by the boat, drive and spinning propeller.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 630:3,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">A jury convicted the defendant on both counts. However, the State <em>nolle prossed </em>the second count, and the trial court sentenced the defendant only for the first count (negligent homicide \u2014 DUI). In addition, the trial court found the defendant guilty of two violation-level offenses: (1) failure to display a proper vessel number as part of the registration process, <em>see </em>RSA 270-E:8 (2010); and (2) failure to obtain a boater safety education certificate, <em>see </em>RSA 270-D:10 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Thereafter, the defendant filed a direct appeal of his negligent homicide \u2014 DUI conviction. After doing so, he filed in the trial court a motion for a new trial based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant has not provided a transcript of any hearing that might have been held on that motion. At oral argument, the State represented, and the defendant did not dispute, that the trial court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial. The record does not establish that the defendant ever requested such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and his discretionary appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial followed. We consolidated the defendant\u2019s direct and discretionary appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">\n<em>II. Direct Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">We first address the defendant\u2019s direct appeal of his negligent homicide \u2014 DUI conviction in which he argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that his operation of the boat while under the influence of intoxicating liquor caused the victim\u2019s death. Because a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence raises a claim of legal error, our standard of review is <em>de novo. State v. Collyns, </em>166 N.H. 514, 517 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">To prevail upon a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must demonstrate that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>In such a challenge, \u201cwe objectively review the record to determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Zubhuza, </em>166 N.H. 125, 128 (2014) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>To convict the defendant of negligent homicide \u2014 DUI, the State was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that: (1) the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor; (2) when he operated a propelled vehicle; and (3) caused the death of another. RSA 630:3, II. At trial, the defendant conceded that he operated a propelled vehicle within the meaning of the statute. He also stipulated that the victim died \u201cby drowning after receiving blunt penetrating injuries to his head, neck and chest as a result of being struck by the boat[,] drive and spinning propeller of the boat in which he had been a passenger.\u201d Additionally, for the purposes of this appeal, the defendant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor when he operated the boat. Thus, the only issue for us to consider is whether the defendant\u2019s impairment caused the victim\u2019s death. <em>See State v. Whittaker, </em>158 N.H. 762, 766 (2009); <em>see also Wong, </em>125 N.H. at 620 (to sustain a conviction for negligent homicide \u2014 DUI, the State must establish a causal connection between the person\u2019s driving under the influence, the subsequent collision, and the resulting death).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Although the defendant refers to the standard we apply when evidence to prove an element is solely circumstantial, <em>see State v. Germain, </em>165 N.H. 350, 361 (2013), that standard does not apply here because the evidence of causation was both direct and circumstantial, <em>see State v. Saunders, </em>164 N.H. 342, 349-52 (2012). Based upon our review of the evidence as a whole and all reasonable inferences therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that it was sufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to find that the defendant\u2019s impairment caused the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The jury viewed the boat. Also, the jury heard from multiple witnesses that, before falling overboard, the victim had been sitting either on the bow or the gunwales of the boat. The jury also heard testimony that although \u201cbow rider[s],\u201d like the defendant\u2019s boat, are \u201ccommon\u201d in New Hampshire, it is \u201cnot commonplace\u201d for passengers of such boats to fall overboard. The jury heard as well, from multiple witnesses, that the victim fell overboard when the defendant, operating the boat at approximately 20 miles per hour, turned it into one or more waves. In a written statement he gave at the scene, the defendant stated that the victim \u201cfell off the front right side of the boat\u201d when the defendant \u201cturned around and hit a wave.\u201d On the evening of the incident, the defendant told a Northwood Lake resident that his \u201cfriend was sitting on the bow of the boat with his legs over, and they hit a wave and he got dragged into the water.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) At trial, the defendant testified that, when he turned the boat, it \u201cwent over some small waves,\u201d which made \u201cthe boat . . . pitch and yaw\u201d and caused the victim to lose his balance and fall overboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The jury also heard that, on the afternoon of the incident, before the victim fell to his death, the defendant had been drinking alcohol. There was evidence that there were more than 100 alcoholic beverage containers on the boat, 89 of which were empty. One witness described the defendant as \u201cdefinitely under the influence,\u201d becoming \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201ca little wild\u201d as the day wore on. She estimated that both the defendant and the victim had had more than eight alcoholic drinks over the course of approximately three and one-half hours. A criminal toxicology expert estimated that, at the time of the incident, the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was .133. <em>See </em>RSA 265-A:2, II (2014) (making it unlawful to operate a boat with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or more).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Further, Joshua Dirth, a marine patrol sergeant, testified that it was unlawful for a passenger to sit on the gunwales or bow while a motorboat is being operated. <em>See </em>RSA 270-D:7 (2010) (providing that \u201c[n]o person shall operate a motorboat or ride as a passenger in a motorboat while sitting on either the starboard or port gunwales or the transom, and no person shall straddle the bow while the motorboat is in operation underway\u201d). Dirth also testified that, had he observed the defendant operating the boat with the victim seated on the bow or gunwales, he would have stopped the boat and charged the defendant with misdemeanor careless and negligent operation. <em>See </em>RSA 270:29-a (2010) (providing that \u201c[a]ny person who shall operate a power boat upon any waters of the state in a careless and negligent manner or so that the lives and safety of the public are endangered shall be guilty of a misdemeanor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Based upon all of the evidence, a rational trier of fact could have reasonably inferred that the defendant\u2019s impairment caused him to allow the victim to sit on the bow or gunwales, even though it was unlawful for the victim to do so. <em>See </em>RSA 270-D:7. A rational trier of fact could also have reasonably found that the defendant\u2019s impairment caused him to turn the boat through a wave while the victim was so sitting. Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the State, we are unable to conclude, as a matter of law, that no rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant\u2019s impairment caused the victim\u2019s death. <em>See Whittaker, </em>158 N.H. at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>III. Discretionary Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s discretionary appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance rests upon both the State and Federal Constitutions. <em>See </em>N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>CONST, amends. VI, XIV. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. </em>Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\">Both the State and Federal Constitutions guarantee a criminal defendant reasonably competent assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>161 N.H. 507, 528 (2011); <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984). To prevail upon his claim, the defendant must demonstrate, \u201cfirst, that counsel\u2019s representation was constitutionally deficient and, second, that counsel\u2019s deficient performance actually prejudiced the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>160 N.H. 581, 584 (2010) (quotation omitted); <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\u201cTo meet the first prong of this test, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>161 N.H. at 528 (quotation omitted); <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688. \u2018We judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct based upon the facts and circumstances of that particular case, viewed from the time of that conduct.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 584; <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690. As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\"><em>Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 584-85 (quotation omitted). The strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct is objectively reasonable \u201chas particular force\u201d in this case because, without an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, we have \u201cno way of knowing whether a seemingly unusual or misguided action by counsel had a sound strategic motive.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 8 (2003) (quotation omitted). Because \u201c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms[,] [t]o establish that his trial attorney\u2019s performance fell below this standard, the defendant has to show that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>competent lawyer\u201d would have engaged in the conduct of which he accuses his trial counsel. <em>Whittaker, </em>158 N.H. at 768-69 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\u201cTo meet the second prong, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>161 N.H. at 528 (quotation omitted); <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>161 N.H. at 528 (quotation omitted); <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. \u201cThe prejudice analysis considers the totality of the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Kepple, </em>155 N.H. 267, 270 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\u201cBoth the performance and prejudice prongs of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 585. \u201cTherefore, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are not supported by the evidence or are erroneous as a matter of law, and we review the ultimate determination of whether each prong is met <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>\u201cOn appeal, when we determine that a defendant has failed to meet either prong of the test, we need not consider the other one.\u201d <em>Kepple, </em>155 N.H. at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The defendant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to evidence that the defendant: (1) violated New Hampshire boating laws by operating the boat while the victim was seated on the bow or gunwales; (2) did not have a boating license; (3) had not taken a boater safety course; (4) did not display the correct vessel number on his boat; and (5) had driven the boat earlier that day with too many people on board. He also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper comments in his opening statement and closing argument. We examine each allegation in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">\n<em>A. Evidence that the Defendant Unlawfully Operated the Boat while the Victim was Seated on the Bow or Gunwales</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">The defendant first contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the following testimony by Dirth on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">Q Okay. Where that person is seated at the far left there in the front of the boat, is a [sic] legal to operator [sic] boat in New Hampshire for somebody sitting up there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">A No, it\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-13\">Q Okay. Where is the only legal position for people to be seated up in that boat, upfront there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>A In a boat of this configuration, it would be anywhere where there actually is a seat, itself, so in the interior of the boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">Q How about if somebody wasn\u2019t seated in the seat, but kind of leaning up with their butt on any of the railings on the sides here, is that legal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">A No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Defense counsel objected to this testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor. Can we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: This is getting into expert testimony. He\u2019s talking about the legalities of the boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">THE COURT: This is a law enforcement officer just stating the facts under which I \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-15\">THE COURT: \u2014 assume that if there\u2019s a regulation and/or . . . RSA, that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-16\">THE COURT: Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">After defense counsel\u2019s objection was overruled, Dirth testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-18\">Q So as I was asking, if somebody isn\u2019t physically seated in these seats, but up here standing with \u2014 leaning against these gunwales, or their butt partially up on those gunwales, is that a legal position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-19\">A If somebody\u2019s actually \u2014 excuse the language I\u2019m using. But your butt cheek is on the gunnel or up on the bow, that\u2019s where the issue arises, so that would be illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-20\">Q Okay. They would have to be seated in the seats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-21\">A Or they could stand, as long as they\u2019re standing in the interior of the boat. No different if I was standing here versus maybe in the rear of the boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-22\">Q I\u2019m sorry, sergeant, as you were explaining about whether that\u2019s \u2014 whether there was any erratic operation in your \u2014 in what happened in this case, any evidence of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>A Absolutely, there is. I mean, he flew out of the boat. A bow rider is a very common \u2014 a common boat used all over the state. You see them on a daily basis, and it\u2019s just very \u2014 it is just not commonplace to have people flying out of boats, I mean, in the marine industry. There would be an uproar. And you just \u2014 those kinds of calls don\u2019t happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">If I had seen that type of operating happen, I would have stopped the boat and I would have cited [the defendant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On cross-examination, Dirth clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">Q And you were also told that... [the victim] frequently sat up in that area of the boat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">A If he did sit up there, it would be on the starboard side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">Q Right. And the law that you talked about when you were being asked questions this morning by [the prosecutor], that it\u2019s illegal to sit up on the bow in this area right here, that law applies equally to passengers, too, doesn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">A It does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">Q So it\u2019s not just a matter of that it would be illegal to sit up there if you were an operator of the boat; it\u2019s illegal to sit up there if you were a passenger, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">A Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">Q Would you have also cited [the victim] for sitting up there, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">AI don\u2019t know. The operation would have been so egregious, that I probably would have charged [the defendant] with what I call \u2014 it\u2019s a careless negligent statute, a misdemeanor. I don\u2019t see that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-14\">Q The law regarding seating applies equally to passengers, as we established, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-15\">A It does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">The defendant contends that Dirth\u2019s testimony was objectionable because it constituted a \u201cplainly incorrect interpretation of the law,\u201d and was \u201cimproper expert testimony about the status of the law.\u201d Moreover, he asserts that his trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination \u201cleft the jury with the belief that either [the victim] or [the defendant] or both could have been cited for violating RSA 270-D:7, when in fact, only [the victim] had committed such a violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-17\">We are unable to conclude from this record that defense counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that the defendant asserts that his counsel failed to object to the witness\u2019s testimony as improper expert testimony, the record belies his assertion. Defense counsel, in fact, did object on this basis, and his objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">To the extent that the defendant contends that his counsel failed to object that Dirth inaccurately summarized the pertinent law, defense counsel made this argument clearly at a later point in the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: I intend to cross [the defendant] on the pamphlet that he didn\u2019t have \u2014 because he didn\u2019t take the boater safety course, which clearly shows, Judge, operating the boat with somebody sitting right where [the victim] is is illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s inconsistent with the statute, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: No, it\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">THE COURT: Okay. It appears, too \u2014 and they have testimony this morning to support it, to reflect that it\u2019s \u2014 this is issued by \u2014 responsive by the State of New Hampshire to advise people [about] the laws in New Hampshire regarding boater safety. And so Defense counsel, or other people, might have a different impression of what the laws are. That\u2019s what the people that enforce the law are saying the intent of the law is. And while I appreciate that Defense counsel has read [RSA 270-D:7] to say what you\u2019re suggesting it says, I don\u2019t share your interpretation of that statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Although the defendant argues that his trial counsel failed to \u201cchallenge the state\u2019s interpretation of the law,\u201d the trial court disagreed with this assertion, as do we. In ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court found that, at trial, it had considered and rejected defense counsel\u2019s interpretation of RSA 270-D:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">Moreover, we are not persuaded that Dirth, in fact, misstated the law. Although Dirth\u2019s testimony on direct examination might have left the jury with the impression that RSA 270-D:7 prohibits operating a boat while a passenger is sitting on the gunwales or bow, his testimony on cross-examination made clear that he believed that the defendant violated RSA 270:29-a, not RSA 270-D:7. Under RSA 270:29-a, a boat operator commits a misdemeanor when he operates a power boat \u201cin a careless and negligent manner or so that the lives and safety of the public are endangered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>We are unable to conclude, on this record, that counsel\u2019s strategic choice to clarify the state of the law during his cross-examination of Dirth and in oral argument to the trial court rather than by objecting to Dirth\u2019s testimony on direct examination was not sound trial strategy. \u201cThis is precisely the sort of calculated risk that lies at the heart of an advocate\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>540 U.S. at 9; <em>see State v. Fecteau, </em>140 N.H. 498, 502 (1995). Based upon this record, we hold that the defendant has failed to overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, his trial counsel acted reasonably. <em>See Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 584-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>B. Evidence that the Defendant Did Not Take a Boater Safety Course or Display the Correct Vessel Number on the Boat</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The defendant next challenges his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to evidence that he never took a boater safety course and that his boat did not display the correct vessel number. Although the defendant contends that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial and, therefore, objectionable, in fact, it was material to the two violation-level offenses with which he was charged and of which the trial court found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The defendant was charged with, and found guilty of, failing to obtain a boater safety education certificate, as required by RSA 270-D:10, and of failing to display the proper vessel number on his boat, pursuant to his boat registration, as required by RSA 270-E:8. Thus, evidence that the defendant did not take a boater safety course and did not list the proper vessel number on his boat was both relevant and admissible. Contrary to his assertions, evidence that he did not take a boater safety course or display the correct vessel number on the boat, was not evidence of \u201cother\u201d bad acts, but was evidence of bad acts that were among those for which he was tried. \u201cFailing to advance a meritless argument or raise a futile objection does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>People v. Ericksen, </em>793 N.W.2d 120, 125 (Mich. Ct. App. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">In a footnote to his brief, the defendant contends that \u201c[t]o the extent that. . . the evidence was relevant to prove matters being decided by the judge,\u201d his counsel was ineffective for failing to ask whether he would be willing to plead guilty to the two violation-level offenses. To support this contention, the defendant relies upon his own affidavit. Because the trial court was not required to believe the defendant\u2019s self-serving affidavit, we conclude that it fails to rebut the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 584-85 (quotation omitted); <em>see Ki Kang Lee v. Glebe, </em>No. C14-05603 RBL, 2015 WL 1282150, at *7 (W.D. Wash. March 20, 2015) (holding that the state court reasonably concluded that the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>self-serving affidavit failed to rebut the strong presumption of competence that counsel adequately consulted with him about whether to submit a certain jury instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\n<em>C. Evidence that the Defendant Lacked a Boating License</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The defendant next asserts that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to evidence that he operated the boat without a license. Although he does not dispute that he lacked a boating license, he argues that such evidence was irrelevant. He also contends that, when combined with evidence that he did not take a boater safety course or display the correct vessel number on the boat, evidence that he lacked a boating license was excludable under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> Even if we assume that evidence that the defendant lacked a boating license was inadmissible, there is no reasonable probability that excluding it would have resulted in a different verdict. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693 (noting that \u201c[i]t is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding\u201d; there is a \u201cgeneral requirement that the defendant affirmatively prove prejudice\u201d). Indeed, the defendant does not argue that the result of his trial would have been different had evidence that he lacked a boating license been excluded. Under these circumstances, we cannot find that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\n<em>D. Evidence that the Defendant Drove the Boat with Too Many People on Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The defendant next argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to testimony that, earlier in the day, the defendant had operated the boat with too many people on board. There was evidence that, although the boat\u2019s capacity was seven people, earlier in the day, the defendant had operated it with nine people on board. <em>See </em>RSA 270-D:5 (2010) (making it unlawful to operate a vessel \u201cwhile carrying passengers . . . beyond its safe carrying capacity, taking into consideration weather and other operating conditions\u201d). The defendant argues that this evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial. Assuming without deciding that the defendant is correct, we are unable to conclude that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to such evidence amounted to constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">During his cross-examination of Dirth, defense counsel elicited the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">Q Sergeant Dirth, at the time of the accident, there weren\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t over the weight limit; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>A No, they were not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">Q In fact, there were four people on the boat at the time of the accident, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">A Yes, there was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In his closing argument, defense counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">Next we had Sergeant Dirth take up more of your time explaining that earlier in the day the number of passengers and the weight of the boat exceeded the legal limit. Should they have done that when they went off to the sandbar? No, they shouldn\u2019t have. But did that have anything to do with the accident? No, it did not. Because at the time of the accident there were four people on the boat and they were within the legal limit, again as Sergeant Dirth had to concede on cross-examination. You should see this type of evidence for what it is. It\u2019s smoke and mirrors and attempt to divert your attention from the eyewitnesses who were on the boat, three eyewitnesses that I previously mentioned, . . . that there was no dangerous or erratic operation leading up to or during the time of the accident. It was a freak accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Given this record, we cannot say that defense counsel\u2019s decision to neutralize the evidence on this peripheral topic in his cross-examination of Dirth and closing argument, rather than by objecting to Dirth\u2019s testimony, failed to fall within the \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 585 (quotation omitted). \u201c \u2018The decision to neutralize the testimony rather than to object was a reasonable tactical choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nogueda v. Peery, </em>No. 2:14-cv-1045 GGH P, 2015 WL 2448701, at *22 (E.D. Cal. May 20,2015) (quoting, with approval, the state court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim); <em>see State v. Geboy, </em>No. 14-02-09, 2003 WL 178616, at *6 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 28,2003) (holding that defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance when, even if his counsel should have objected to certain of the prosecutor\u2019s statements in closing, his counsel \u201cneutralized any prejudicial effects with a compelling closing argument attacking the state\u2019s evidence and lack thereof\u2019); <em>see also Hodges v. State, </em>No. M2002-01334-CCA-R3-PC, 2003 WL 22325736, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 10, 2003) (upon <em>de novo </em>review, rejecting the petitioner\u2019s argument that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to various items of irrelevant evidence when counsel testified that his trial strategy was to use cross-examination to \u201cneutralize unfavorable inferences or to turn seemingly damaging testimony into [favorable] evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>\n<em>E. Prosecutor\u2019s Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Finally, the defendant asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and closing argument in which, he contends, the prosecutor improperly: (1) argued that it was illegal to operate a boat with a passenger seated on the bow or gunwales; and (2) referenced evidence that the defendant did not have a boating license, did not take a boater safety course, did not display the proper vessel number on the boat, and drove the boat earlier in the day with too many people on board.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The defendant has failed to demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to these comments fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. \u201cThe standard for reversible error in a prosecutor\u2019s opening statement is that the prosecutor must be shown to have acted in bad faith, the opening statement must be completely unsupported by the evidence, and the defendant must be prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>State v. Gaudet, </em>166 N.H. 390, 397-98 (2014) (quotation and emphasis omitted). \u201cIn examining claims of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, we face the delicate task of balancing a prosecutor\u2019s broad license to fashion argument with the need to ensure that a defendant\u2019s rights are not compromised in the process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398 (quotation omitted). \u201cA prosecutor may draw reasonable inferences from the facts proven and has great latitude in closing argument to both summarize and discuss the evidence presented to the jury and to urge them to draw inferences of guilt from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399 (quotation omitted). \u201cAt the same time, there must be limits to pleas of pure passion and there must be restraints against blatant appeals to bias and prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s assertions in his opening statement that the defendant\u2019s \u201cillegal operation of a boat while being under the influence of intoxicating liquor caused the death of [the victim],\u201d and that one \u201ccan\u2019t operate a boat with somebody sitting\u201d on the gunwales or bow, and his nearly identical assertions in his closing argument, were supported by the evidence, and, therefore, were not improper. As previously discussed, Dirth testified that, had he observed the defendant operating the boat with the victim seated on the bow or gunwales, he would have charged the defendant with misdemeanor careless and negligent operation. <em>See </em>RSA 270:29-a. The prosecutor\u2019s references in his opening statement and closing argument to evidence that the defendant did not have a boating license, did not take a boater safety course, did not display the proper vessel number on the boat, and drove the boat earlier in the day with too many people on board, likewise, were \u201cwithin the latitude accorded prosecutors when summarizing and discussing the evidence presented.\u201d <em>State v. Scott, </em>167 N.H. 634, 642 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>(2015). Accordingly, the defendant has failed to overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, his trial counsel acted reasonably when he did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement or closing argument. <em>See Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 584-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>F. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">For all of the reasons previously discussed, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that he received constitutionally defective assistance of counsel. \u201cBecause the standard for determining whether a defendant has received ineffective assistance of counsel is the same under both constitutions, necessarily, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.\u201d <em>Whittaker, </em>158 N.H. at 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-7\">CONBOY, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
