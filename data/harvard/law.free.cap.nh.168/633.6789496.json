Maryea and co-defendant Thomas Velardi settled. The principal issue in this case is whether the provisions in RSA chapter 507-B waiving governmental immunity from tort liability arising out of, among other things, the operation of motor vehicles, abrogate the County\u2019s common law discretionary function immunity. We hold that they do not, and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">The trial court\u2019s order recites the following facts. Maryea was an inmate at the Strafford County House of Corrections. In January 2011, the County was transporting Maryea from the House of Corrections to the Federal District Court in Concord in an inmate transport van. Maryea rode handcuffed and shackled in the van\u2019s back compartment, which was designated for inmates. The compartment had no seatbelts. During the drive, the van collided with Velardi\u2019s vehicle, and Maryea sustained injuries. Maryea then brought negligence claims against Velardi and the County. In her negligence claim against the County, Maryea alleged that the County is liable for her injuries because the transport van was not equipped with seatbelts in the back compartment where she was required to be seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Wayne Estes, the former Sheriff of Strafford County, had previously considered installing seatbelts in the County\u2019s inmate transport vans but had decided against it. In an affidavit, Estes explained that the only seatbelts available for the inmate compartments were \u201clap belts.\u201d According to Estes, because of their shackles, the inmates would not be able to tighten the lap belts. To secure the belts, Estes explained, corrections officers would need to enter the vans with the inmates. Each transport van could carry up to eight inmates, and Estes worried that, as corrections officers adjusted the inmates\u2019 seatbelts, inmates might overwhelm the officers, take their firearms, and/or escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The County moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was immune from liability because the decision not to install seatbelts was a discretionary function. In her objection, Maryea raised three principal arguments: (1) RSA 507-B :2 abrogated the County\u2019s common law discretionary function immunity; (2) the transportation of prisoners was not a \u201cdecision requiring a high degree of discretion\u201d protected by discretionary function immunity; and (3) the County was not entitled to immunity because its use of the transport van was a \u201cproprietary function,\u201d rather than a governmental function. (Bolding omitted.) The trial court granted summary judgment in the County\u2019s favor. On appeal, Maryea raises the same arguments. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We begin by analyzing Maryea\u2019s argument that RSA 507-B :2 abrogated the County\u2019s common law discretionary function immunity. Maryea explains that \u201cRSA 507-B :5 acts as a general grant of immunity to governmental units.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 507-B:5 (2010). According to Maryea, RSA 507-B:5 \u201cremoves any common law immunities as well as the common law associated with bodily injury or personal injury cause[s] of action[ ], and grants immunity, subject to the exceptions found in RSA 507-B:2.\u201d The County contends that discretionary function immunity survived RSA chapter 507-B\u2019s enactment. It cites <em>Ford v. New Hampshire Department of Transportation, </em>163 N.H. 284 (2012), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he existence of immunity for discretionary functions is fundamental to [New Hampshire\u2019s] system of separation of powers.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>163 N.H. at 294. The County then asserts that, \u201cbased on separation of powers,\u201d discretionary function immunity is \u201cconstitutionally required.\u201d The County further argues that discretionary function immunity remained \u201cintact\u201d after RSA chapter 507-B because this court has continued to apply the doctrine in cases in which \u201cliability would have been [otherwise] permissible under RSA 507-B :2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Merrill v. City of Manchester, </em>114 N.H. 722 (1974), charted a new course for governmental immunity in New Hampshire law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before <em>Merrill, </em>municipalities were immune from tort liability if their tortious acts arose from the \u201cexercise [of] a governmental function.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>114 N.H. at 725. However, municipalities \u201cacting in their corporate or proprietary capacity\u201d were \u201cliable for their torts under the same principles applied to private corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Merrill, </em>we rejected this governmental-proprietary function immunity framework, holding that municipalities were \u201csubject to the same rules as private corporations if a duty ha[d] been violated and a tort committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730. However, we recognized an exception. Immunity remained for \u201cacts and omissions constituting (a) the exercise of a legislative or judicial function, and (b) the exercise of an executive or planning function involving the making of a basic policy decision which is characterized by the exercise of a high degree of official judgment or discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729. We refer to the latter exception as discretionary function immunity. <em>See Everitt v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>156 N.H. 202, 211 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In response to <em>Merrill, </em>the legislature enacted RSA chapter 507-B, entitled \u201cBODILY INJURY ACTIONS AGAINST GOVERNMENTAL UNITS.\u201d <em>See Schoff v. City of Somersworth, </em>137 N.H. 583, 585 (1993). RSA 507-B:5 states that \u201c[n]o governmental unit shall be held liable in any action to recover for bodily injury, personal injury or property damage except as provided by this chapter or as is provided or may be provided by other statute.\u201d RSA 507-B :5. RSA 507-B :2 creates an exception to RSA 507-B :5, providing that \u201c[a] governmental unit may be held liable for damages in an action to recover for bodily injury, personal injury or property damage caused by its fault or by fault attributable to it, <em>arising out of ownership, occupation, maintenance or operation of all motor vehicles, </em>and all premises.\u201d RSA 507-B:2 (2010) (emphasis added). RSA 507-B:l, I, defines \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d as \u201cany political subdivision within the state including any county, city, [or] town.\u201d RSA 507-B:l, I (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>RSA chapter 507-B does not address discretionary function immunity. Since its enactment, however, we have regularly applied this immunity doctrine in tort cases that involve state and local governmental units:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">[W]e have held that immunity exists for: ... a town selectmen\u2019s decision not to lay out certain roads, <em>Rockhouse Mt. Property Owners Assoc. v. Town of Conway, </em>127 N.H. 593, 600 (1986); traffic control and parking regulations, <em>Sorenson v. City of Manchester, </em>136 N.H. 692, 694 (1993); setting of road maintenance standards and construction of a sidewalk when based upon a city\u2019s faulty plan or design, <em>Gardner [v. City of Concord, </em>137 N.H. 253, 258, 259 (1993)]; traffic control and management of roadway safety, <em>Bergeron v. City of Manchester, </em>140 N.H. 417, 422, 424 (1995); a decision whether to enact maintenance and inspection regulations, <em>Mahan [v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Admin. Services, </em>141 N.H. 747, 751 (1997)]; and the training and supervision of coaches and referees at a school basketball game, <em>Hacking [v. Town oBelmont, </em>143 N.H. 546, 550 (1999)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\"><em>Everitt, </em>156 N.H. at 211-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Moreover, in <em>Everitt, </em>we distinguished between statutory immunity \u2014 such as sovereign immunity, <em>see </em>RSA 99-D:1 (2013), and immunity for governmental units, <em>see </em>RSA ch. 507-B \u2014 and common-law municipal immunity, which, with limited exception, we abrogated in <em>Merrill. See Everitt, </em>156 N.H. at 209. We recognized that discretionary function immunity was necessary to protect \u201ccertain essential, fundamental activities of government ... so that our government can govern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210 (quotation omitted). We noted that discretionary function immunity was meant \u201cto limit judicial interference with legislative and executive decision-making.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, as we explained in <em>Ford, </em>\u201c[t]he existence of immunity for discretionary functions is fundamental to our system of separation of powers.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>163 N.H. at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Recently, in <em>Farrelly v. City of Concord, </em>168 N.H. 430, 442 (2015), we noted that, \u201cas our decisions indicate, we have not interpreted [RSA chapter 507-B] as completely occupying the field of municipal immunity so as to preempt the common law doctrine.\u201d We now hold that RSA chapter 507-B does not abrogate the doctrine of discretionary function immunity. For more than forty years, discretionary function immunity, which is rooted in New Hampshire\u2019s constitutional separation of powers, has operated alongside RSA chapter 507-B\u2019s immunity framework, protecting the discretionary decisions of governmental units even when those decisions concerned the ownership, occupation, maintenance, or operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>motor vehicles or premises. <em>See, e.g., Tarbell Adm\u2019r, Inc. v. City of Concord, </em>157 N.H. 678, 679-80 (2008) (holding that discretionary function immunity barred the plaintiffs \u201cnegligence claims alleging that the City failed to properly construct a dam,\u201d <em>ie., </em>a city premises, and control and regulate its water level). During this time, the legislature has not amended RSA chapter 507-B in a way that would affect the application of discretionary function immunity. We therefore reject Maryea\u2019s argument that RSA 507-B :2 abrogated the County\u2019s discretionary function immunity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Maryea\u2019s injuries allegedly arose from the County\u2019s decision not to install seatbelts in the inmate transport van that was transporting her to the Federal District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That decision concerned the County\u2019s \u201cownership, occupation, maintenance or operation of [its] motor vehicles.\u201d RSA 507-B :2. However, as explained above, the County may still be immune from liability if its decision constituted a discretionary function.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\u201cIn resolving discretionary immunity questions, we distinguish between planning or discretionary functions and functions that are purely ministerial.\u201d <em>Bergeron, </em>140 N.H. at 421. Planning or discretionary functions are functions that are \u201ccharacterized by the high degree of discretion and judgment involved in weighing alternatives and making choices with respect to public policy and planning.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>126 N.H. 554, 563 (1985) (quotation omitted). Ministerial functions, on the other hand, are functions that are \u201cabsolute, certain and imperative, involving merely the execution of a set task.\u201d 14 P. Loughlin, New HAMPSHIRE Practice: Local Government Law \u00a7 1040, at 27-33 (2011). For example, in our analysis of the statutory discretionary function immunity for state agencies, <em>see </em>RSA 541-B:19,I(c) (2007), we drew a distinction between the \u201cdecision to place or not to place a guardrail on a roadway,\u201d a protected discretionary decision, and the construction of that guardrail, an act of implementation that \u201cneither required nor contained any discretionary decision-making.\u201d <em>DiFruscia v. N.H. Dept. of Pub. Works &amp; Highways, </em>136 N.H. 202, 205 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Here, like the decision whether to place the guardrail in <em>DiFruscia, </em>Estes\u2019s decision not to install seatbelts was \u201cconduct characterized by [a] high degree of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Estes considered installing the seatbelts, but decided that the danger to the officers and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>public outweighed the increased safety that the seatbelts would provide for inmates. Specifically, Estes determined that the seatbelts would require corrections officers to enter the vans with the inmates, which would make it easier for the inmates to overwhelm the officers, access their firearms, and escape. Thus, the decision not to install seatbelts involved \u201cweighing alternatives and making choices with respect to public policy and planning,\u201d and was therefore a protected discretionary function. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>126 N.H. at 563 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\">Maryea argues in her brief that the County owed a duty \u201cto provide a reasonably safe transportation method,\u201d and was therefore \u201crequired to take some good-faith action to provide inmates with a reasonably safe environment for transportation.\u201d Maryea further argues that \u201c[t]he issue is not whether the decision to not install seatbelts was a discretionary function, but rather whether the implementation of that decision by transporting prisoners without any . . . precautions to ensure their safety comports with\u201d discretionary function immunity. To the extent that Maryea argues that this case involves the implementation of a discretionary decision, we reject that characterization of her claim. Maryea based her negligence action against the County on the van\u2019s lack of seatbelts, which, we have concluded was a discretionary, rather than a ministerial, function for which the County was entitled to immunity. Further, to the extent that Maryea argues that the County\u2019s duty to provide for inmate safety conflicts with and somehow abrogates the County\u2019s immunity, we agree with the County that discretionary function immunity applies even if such a duty is owed. This is because the discretionary immunity analysis does not concern the defendant\u2019s duty to the plaintiff, but the threshold question of whether the defendant\u2019s allegedly negligent act or omission is the type of discretionary conduct that discretionary function immunity protects.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In her notice of appeal and the questions presented in her brief, Maryea also refers to the County\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d suggesting that it vitiates the County\u2019s discretionary function immunity. The County argues that Maryea did not preserve this deliberate indifference argument for appellate review. We agree. \u201cOn appeal, we consider only issues that have been both timely raised below and preserved for our review.\u201d <em>Appeal of Pelleteri, </em>152 N.H. 809, 811 (2005). The closest that Maryea came to raising an argument in the trial court about deliberate indifference was in her objection to the County\u2019s summary judgment motion in which she stated that the County\u2019s failure to install any safety devices in the van \u201cshow[ed] a complete disregard for the safety and well[-]being of the prisoners transported.\u201d However, Maryea never suggested that the County\u2019s alleged disregard was deliberate or that deliberate indifference ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>gated the County\u2019s immunity. Because Maryea failed to raise this argument in the trial court, we need not address it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Finally, we reject Maryea\u2019s contention that the County is not immune because its operation of the inmate transport van was a proprietary rather than a governmental function. In <em>Merrill, </em>we repudiated the distinction between proprietary and governmental functions as the basis for immunity. <em>Merrill, </em>114 N.H. at 725-26, 729; <em>see also Opinion of the Justices, </em>126 N.H. at 558 (\u201cIn <em>Merrill . . . </em>this court significantly altered the common law immunity of municipalities by abolishing the governmental-proprietary function distinction.\u201d). Maryea cites cases from other jurisdictions that continue to employ the governmental-proprietary function distinction, but she does not attempt to reconcile those cases with <em>Merrill. </em>Nor does Maryea argue that we should overrule <em>Merrill </em>in light of those cases. Thus, Maryea\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Because we hold that RSA 507-B:2 did not abrogate the County\u2019s common law discretionary function immunity, and discretionary function immunity protected the County from liability arising from its decision not to install seatbelts in its inmate transport vans, we conclude that the trial court did not err by granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b660-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-6\"> We note that many of our discretionary function cases, including <em>Merrill, </em>involved municipalities, not counties. However, at the time <em>Merrill </em>was decided, counties and municipalities both enjoyed immunity. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>101 N.H. 546, 548 (1957) (noting that municipal immunity \u201cfrom liability for torts arising out of negligence in the performance of governmental functions\u201d extends to counties); <em>Dempster v. County, </em>88 N.H. 472, 473 (1936). Here, neither party distinguishes between counties and municipalities for the purposes of discretionary function immunity Moreover, we see no reason why discretionary function immunity should protect municipalities\u2019 discretionary acts but not the discretionary acts of counties. <em>Cf. Bergeron v. City of Manchester, </em>140 N.H. 417, 421 (1995) (addressing a city\u2019s and the State\u2019s discretionary function immunity together \u201c[b]ecause the standards governing whether a city is immune from tort liability under <em>Merrill </em>do not differ appreciably from those that govern the State\u2019s immunity under RSA chapter 541-B\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> Although, on appeal, Maryea frames some of her discretionary function arguments around the County\u2019s alleged failure to provide any safety precautions in the transport van, including \u201cseatbelts, hand holds, [or] padding,\u201d in her complaint and in her arguments to the trial court, her negligence claim was based upon only the County\u2019s decision not to install seatbelts. For this reason, we limit our analysis to that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
