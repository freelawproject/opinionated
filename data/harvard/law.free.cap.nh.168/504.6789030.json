June 30,2016). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">The following facts are derived from the record. THI is a subsidiary of THI of New Hampshire, LLC, itself a subsidiary of a parent company that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>owns nursing home operators throughout the country. In approximately 2003, THI purchased and began operating a nursing home, Pleasant Valley Nursing Center (Pleasant Valley), in Derry.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In 2012, THI had an opportunity to expand when Exeter Healthcare, Inc. closed its nursing home in Exeter and offered to sell its 109 licensed nursing beds. THI and Exeter Healthcare entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the beds on January 25, 2013, and THI made deposit payments to Exeter Healthcare in accordance with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The following month, THI requested that the Board grant approval for the transfer of the beds from Exeter Healthcare to THI. Because the Pleasant Valley building would not accommodate all of the beds to be transferred, THI also requested permission to apply for a CON to construct a new building to house the beds in a different location. THI selected a site in Londonderry for the new building, which it planned to operate under the name Traditions at Londonderry. In its application, THI explained that the transfer would occur in the same nursing home region in Rockingham County, such that the number of beds in the region would not increase. THI also informed the Board that its contract conditioned its obligation to buy the beds from Exeter Healthcare upon the Board\u2019s approval of the CON for Traditions at Londonderry.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The Board met on February 21, 2013, and questioned whether it had statutory authority to approve THI\u2019s requests. RSA 151-C:4 effectively creates a moratorium by barring construction of new nursing home facilities in the state unless the applicant obtains a CON from the Board, which may issue a CON only under very limited circumstances. <em>See </em>RSA 151-C:4,1, III (a). Under one such exception, the Board \u201cmay\u201d issue a CON \u201cfor construction or renovation as necessary to repair or refurbish an <em>existing facility, </em>or to accommodate additional beds obtained by transfer to an <em>existing facility.\u201d Id. </em>(emphases added). The Board looked to the statutory definition of \u201cHealth care facility\u201d and found that it encompassed \u201clicensed nursing homes including all services and <em>property owned by such.\u201d </em>RSA 151-C:2, XV-a (emphasis added). Based upon this definition, the Board concluded that it had authority to approve the bed transfer and gave THI permission to apply for a CON, apparently finding that Pleasant Valley was an \u201cexisting facility\u201d and that the proposed Londonderry facility would be \u201cproperty owned by such.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board conditioned its ruling upon THI submitting the CON application within 24 months, so that THI would not \u201chold [the beds] hostage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>THI submitted its CON application in September 2013. The Board deemed the application \u201ccomplete\u201d and commenced formal review in December 2013. In accordance with RSA 151-C:8, XII, THI submitted a request to amend its application in February 2014 to include an improved design. The Board approved the request, and THI submitted its amendment the following month. Formal review commenced again on April 25, 2014, with the 90-day formal review period ending on July 25, 2014. As required by RSA 151-C:8, X, the Board held a public hearing on June 19, 2014, which continued on July 17, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">Before the Board deemed THI\u2019s initial application complete, unrelated litigation resulted in an agreement to transfer ownership of Pleasant Valley from THI to a third party. The third party\u2019s attorney contacted the Board in May and again in October 2013 to notify it of the fact that Pleasant Valley would be transferred to the third party as of December 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In November 2013, the Board asked THI to clarify how this change of ownership of Pleasant Valley would affect THI\u2019s CON application. Specifically, the Board questioned who would \u201cbe the rightful CON applicant\u201d following the transfer. THI informed the Board that it remained the applicant and that it was not in any way affiliated with the third party transferee of Pleasant Valley. However, it nonetheless asserted that the Board should consider THI as an \u201cexisting facility\u201d excepted from the statutory moratorium. The Board approved the transfer of Pleasant Valley to the third party on December 10, 2013. According to THI, the transfer of Pleasant Valley was complete as of January 1, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The Board undertook a full review of THI\u2019s status as the CON applicant following the transfer of Pleasant Valley, addressing the issue in correspondence with THI, at public hearings, and in consultation with the Attorney General. At the conclusion of its July 17, 2014 meeting, the Board voted unanimously to deny THI\u2019s CON application. In an August 21, 2014 memorandum confirming its decision, the Board detailed its findings pursuant to RSA 151-C:7 and applicable regulations. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. RULES, He-Hea 303.01. Although the Board found that THI\u2019s proposed facility would satisfy regulatory requirements for services offered, quality of care, and financial feasibility, among other criteria, the Board nevertheless denied THI\u2019s application because it was not an \u201cexisting facility.\u201d The Board reasoned that Pleasant Valley had been the only New Hampshire facility operated by THI, and THI\u2019s ownership of Pleasant Valley had formed \u201cthe basis upon which the transfer of beds was approved by the [Board], which then allowed a CON application to be filed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reaching its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>decision, the Board relied in part on precedent set by its past adjudications \u201crequir[ing] that any transferred beds be: (1) kept in the same nursing home region in order to maintain the requirements of the statutory bed need formula; and (2) placed at a facility where existing nursing beds are in operation.\u201d THI moved for reconsideration, which the Board denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Appeals from a decision of the Board are brought pursuant to RSA 151-C.TO, which incorporates by reference the provisions of RSA chapter 541 (2007). <em>Appeal of Parkland Med. Ctr., </em>158 N.H. 67, 70 (2008). We will affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be \u201carbitrary or capricious or not made in compliance with applicable law.\u201d RSA 151-C:10, III; <em>see Appeal of Parkland, </em>158 N.H. at 70. The burden of proof is on \u201cthe party seeking to set aside any order or decision of the [Board] to show that the same is clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d RSA 541:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">THI contends that the Board incorrectly applied the statutory moratorium found in RSA 151-C:4, III because THI had an existing facility \u2014 Pleasant Valley \u2014 when it first petitioned the Board for a CON to construct a new facility, and under the statute, an exception to the moratorium allows for the transfer of beds to an \u201cexisting facility.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 151-C:4, 111(a) (\u201c[A] certificate of need may be issued ... to accommodate additional beds obtained by transfer to an existing facility\u201d). THI also argues that the Board\u2019s denial of THI\u2019s CON application was arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful because the Board based its denial on the transfer of Pleasant Valley, yet the Board approved that very transfer during the CON completeness review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">To resolve these issues, we must engage in statutory interpretation. <em>See Appeal of Michele, </em>168 N.H. 98, 101 (2015). \u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Petition of Malisos, </em>166 N.H. 726, 729 (2014). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are \u201cthe final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of Seabrook, </em>163 N.H. 635, 644 (2012). \u201cWe first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Appeal of Local Gov\u2019t Ctr., </em>165 N.H. 790, 804 (2014). \u2018We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We construe all parts of a statute together to effectuate its overall purpose and avoid an absurd or unjust result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMoreover, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>do not consider words and phrases in isolation, but rather within the context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis enables us to better discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, \u201c[w]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute itself for further indications of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Petition of Malisos, </em>166 N.H. at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We begin by examining the language of RSA 151-C:4,1, which creates a statutory moratorium on construction of new nursing homes: \u201cNo new institutional health service shall be offered or developed within the state, nor shall any arrangement or commitment for financing the offering or developing of a new institutional health service be made, except pursuant to obtaining a [CON] for such service.\u201d RSA 151-C:4,111(a) then directs the Board: \u201cNo new [CON] shall be granted ... for any nursing home, skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, or rehabilitation facility . . . through the period ending June 30, 2016.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The statute provides for limited exceptions to this prohibition on the Board\u2019s authority to grant a CON. <em>See </em>RSA 151-C:4, III. The Board \u201cshall\u201d issue a CON \u201cfor replacement or renovation of existing beds as necessary to meet life safety code requirements or to remedy deficiencies noted in a licensing inspection pursuant to RSA 151 or state survey and certification process pursuant to titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act.\u201d RSA 151-C:4, 111(a). Additionally, the Board \u201cmay\u201d issue a CON \u201cfor construction or renovation as necessary to repair or refurbish an existing facility, or to accommodate additional beds obtained by transfer to an existing facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute qualifies the exception' for the transfer of beds to an \u201cexisting facility\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">In the case of repair, refurbishment, or transferred beds, the resulting costs in excess of the current capital expenditure threshold as adjusted for inflation pursuant to RSA 151-C:5, 11(f)(1) shall not be reflected in any state Medicaid rate. Any application for a certificate of need under this subparagraph shall indicate whether it is for a life safety code requirement or to remedy deficiencies noted in a licensing inspection or whether it is for repair or refurbishment of an existing facility or for transferred beds. If the application is approved, it shall be deemed that the board has agreed with the indicated reason for such application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The statute does not define \u201cexisting\u201d or \u201cexisting facility,\u201d but RSA 151-C:2, XV-a defines the term \u201cHealth care facility\u201d as \u201chospitals, ambu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>latory surgical facilities, specialty hospitals and licensed nursing homes including all services and property owned by such.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[h]ealth care facilities shall include facilities ... which are licensed or required to be licensed in whole or in part by the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute also defines \u201cPhysical facility or site\u201d as \u201cthe total buildings, structures, and land of a health care facility.\u201d RSA 151-C:2, XXIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We assume, without deciding, that, at the time it was owned by THI, Pleasant Valley nursing home could have' been the same \u201chealth care facility\u201d as THI\u2019s proposed new location, Traditions at Londonderry, because the legislature so broadly defined the terms \u201chealth care facility\u201d and \u201cphysical facility.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 151-C:2, XV-a; RSA 151-02, XXIX. Regardless of what might comprise a \u201cfacility,\u201d however, that facility must be \u201cexisting\u201d for the Board to approve any transfer of beds to it. <em>See </em>RSA 151-C:4, III(a). We turn, then, to the meaning of the term \u201cexisting facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Because the term \u201cis not defined in the statute, we look to its common usage, using the dictionary for guidance.\u201d <em>K.L.N. Construction Co. v. Town of Pelham, </em>167 N.H. 180, 185 (2014). We have interpreted the term \u201cexisting facility,\u201d as used in RSA chapter 151-C, by looking to the dictionary definition of \u201cexisting,\u201d which is \u201cto have actual or real being.\u201d <em>Appeal of Parkland, </em>158 N.H. at 75; <em>see </em>WEBSTER\u2019S Third New INTERNATIONAL Dictionary 796 (unabridged ed. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The State argues that the term \u201cexisting facility\u201d in RSA 151-C:4, 111(a) is clear and unambiguous, and that a facility must be \u201cexisting\u201d when the Board acts on the merits of the CON application, not merely when the application is submitted or when the Board deems the application complete for purposes of commencing its review. THI, on the other hand, contends that a facility need not remain \u201cexisting\u201d throughout the course of the Board\u2019s CON review. According to THI, \u201cexisting\u201d means only that the facility must exist when the CON applicant obtains beds by transfer. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In interpreting \u201cexisting facility,\u201d we do not examine the phrase in isolation. <em>See Local Gov\u2019t Ctr., </em>165 N.H. at 804. The statute states that a CON \u201cmay be <em>issued </em>for construction or renovation as necessary to repair or refurbish an existing facility, or to accommodate additional beds obtained by transfer to an existing facility.\u201d RSA 151-C:4, III(a) (emphasis added). Further, the statute broadly provides that \u201c[n]o new certificate of need shall be <em>granted </em>by the board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The statute specifies the requirements that must be met \u2014 including that there be an existing facility \u2014 when the Board \u201cgrants\u201d or \u201cissues\u201d a CON. In other words, the facility must exist when the Board engages in its final review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>either approves or denies the request, and not merely at the time the applicant files its application or obtains beds by transfer. If the legislature meant the latter, it could have said that in the statute. We do not add language that the legislature did not see fit to include, <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ctr., </em>165 N.H. at 804, and THI\u2019s reading of the statute would require us to do exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">THI seems to suggest that once its application was accepted as complete, the Board all but agreed to issue a CON. However, that is not a reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme. There would be no need for the review process contemplated by the statute if the Board\u2019s decision to accept an application as complete was the equivalent of granting the application. THI relies heavily on the fact that the Board initially found that Traditions at Londonderry could be an \u201cexisting facility\u201d for purposes of the transfer of beds from Exeter Healthcare, and then gave THI permission to apply for a CON on that basis. However, these initial findings by the Board were interlocutory and did not preclude the Board from reassessing the situation based upon the changed circumstances that existed at the time it considered THI\u2019s application for approval on the merits. <em>Cf. Radziewicz v. Town of Hudson, </em>159 N.H. 313, 315 (2009) (reciting the general principle that a \u201ctrial court has the power to reconsider an issue until final judgment or decree\u201d). Likewise, the fact that the Board approved the transfer of Pleasant Valley to an unrelated third party provides no basis to interpret the statute in the manner THI advocates. THI suggests that the Board should have informed THI, at the time it approved the transfer of Pleasant Valley to the third party, that such transfer could affect THI\u2019s CON application, but did not do so. To the contrary, the record shows that the Board reached out to THI and asked questions about the transfer and the CON. THI does not explain what more the Board could or should have done, and provides no basis for its assertion that the onus was on the Board to notify the applicant more specifically that its actions might affect its pending application.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">THI also contends that the Board erroneously and unlawfully relied on its precedent set in prior adjudications. In its order denying THI\u2019s application, the Board noted that it previously had denied a transfer of <em>nursing beds </em>to a facility that operated only <em>residential care beds </em>because the transfer would be akin to establishing a new institutional health service, in violation of the moratorium on nursing home beds. The Board required that transferred beds be placed at a facility where existing <em>nursing beds </em>were already in operation. It is not clear to what extent the Board relied on this precedent in reaching its final decision. However, regardless of the extent of such reliance, we agree with the Board that the term \u201cexisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>facility\u201d cannot be stretched so far as to include an entirely new facility that no longer has any relationship to another operating facility owned by the applicant at the time the Board is asked to grant the CON.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">THI also argues that the Board\u2019s decision contradicts the statute\u2019s purpose, which THI claims is to keep beds in sendee. However, the plain language of the statute reflects that this goal is to be accomplished only in the narrow circumstances to which the statute applies. Here, THI did not meet the requirement that it have an existing facility, and the Board had no authority to ignore this requirement to further an arguably more general statutory objective. <em>See State v. Dor, </em>165 N.H. 198, 205 (2018) (\u201c[I]t frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that <em>whatever </em>furthers the statute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u201d (quotation omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the Board properly interpreted RSA 151-C:4 as preventing it from approving THI\u2019s CON application.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-6\">Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> Neither party challenges the Board\u2019s conclusion that a newly constructed (or to be constructed) facility remotely located from the one currently operated by the applicant can qualify as an \u201cexisting facility\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We thus have no occasion to resolve this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\"> The record reflects that THI\u2019s ownership of Pleasant Valley had been material to the Board\u2019s February 2013 deliberations, when it first gave THI permission to apply for a CON. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Board\u2019s minutes from its February 21, 2013 meeting state that THI submitted its requests \u201cfor the Pleasant Valley Nursing Center.\u201d In a February 27,2013 letter to counsel for THI, the Board stated that it had \u201cconsidered the requests submitted by [THI], d/b/a Pleasant Valley Nursing Center.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-18\"> As explained in the text, even if the primary purpose of the statute is to avoid a decrease in the number of beds, that cannot override the clear statutory language. Moreover, it is far from clear that this is the primary purpose, given the arguably conflicting objective evidenced by the moratorium on new nursing facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
