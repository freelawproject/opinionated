McKaig cross-appeals the state board\u2019s decision and argues that she is entitled to reinstatement with back pay and benefits. We affirm in part, reverse in part, order that McKaig be reinstated to her former employment, and remand to the board for further proceedings to determine whether she is entitled to additional remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The state board\u2019s decision includes the following facts. McKaig was a high school guidance counselor employed by the district. In November 2012, a student \u2014 whom, consistent with the record, we will refer to as \u201cStudent A\u201d \u2014 and her boyfriend told McKaig and another guidance counselor that Student A was pregnant and that she wanted to terminate her pregnancy. Student A was fifteen years old at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">McKaig suggested that Student A tell her mother about the pregnancy, but Student A refused. Student A and her boyfriend told McKaig that they did not want Student A\u2019s mother to know about the pregnancy because they were afraid for their safety. McKaig researched Student A\u2019s options and found New Hampshire\u2019s parental notification and judicial bypass laws for minors seeking an abortion. <em>See </em>RSA 132:33, :34, II (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">After meeting with Student A, McKaig and the other guidance counselor met with the principal and other school staff to discuss the issue of Student A\u2019s pregnancy. The principal expressed his view that the school should inform Student A\u2019s mother about the pregnancy. McKaig disagreed, asserting that Student A had a right to keep the pregnancy confidential. The meeting concluded without a decision about whether to contact Student A\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">After the meeting, McKaig spoke with Attorney Barbara Keshen of the New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union about Student A\u2019s situation. McKaig provided Keshen with Student A\u2019s initials, age, and grade. McKaig and Keshen also discussed Student A\u2019s potential privacy rights. Keshen\u2019s opinion was that the judicial bypass law protected the confidentiality of Student A\u2019s pregnancy and the fact that she was contemplating an abortion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>McKaig relayed this opinion to Student A, and Student A made an appointment with a health center and another attorney to assist her with the judicial bypass proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On December 3, 2012, the principal instructed the school nurse to meet with Student A to tell her that the school would inform her mother about her pregnancy by December 5. That same day, McKaig told the principal about her conversation with Keshen and urged him to contact Keshen to discuss Student A\u2019s rights. The principal did not contact Keshen; however, on December 4, Keshen contacted him. He told Keshen that he had reviewed the parental notification and judicial bypass laws and determined that they did not prevent him from telling Student A\u2019s mother about the pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Keshen instituted a petition for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the principal in superior court to prevent the principal from contacting Student A\u2019s mother. McKaig was named as the petitioner \u201cON BEHALF OF [Student A]\u201d; she was not named in her individual capacity. The petition did not include Student A\u2019s name. It instead referred to Student A by her initials and mentioned her age and grade, and that she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The district\u2019s attorney filed a special appearance on the principal\u2019s behalf, notifying the superior court that the principal would not inform Student A\u2019s mother about the pregnancy until the court held a hearing on the TRO petition. On December 10, Student A obtained a \u201cjudicial bypass order\u201d from the superior court. The next day, the superior court granted the TRO petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Some four months later, on April 9, 2013, McKaig received a notice of nonrenewal from the superintendent; the notice did not advise her of the reasons for nonrenewal. McKaig subsequently requested a written statement of the reasons and a hearing before the local board under RSA 189:14-a (Supp. 2015). On May 24, 2013, the superintendent sent McKaig a statement of three reasons for her nonrenewal: insubordination, breach of student confidentiality, and neglect of duties. The record contains no indication that, prior to McKaig receiving the statement of reasons for nonrenewal, she was advised by any administration official that in connection with this matter she had been insubordinate, had breached student confidentiality, or had neglected her duties. After the hearing, the local board upheld McKaig\u2019s nonrenewal on the grounds of insubordination and breach of confidentiality, but not neglect of duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">McKaig appealed to the state board, which found, pursuant to RSA 189:14-b, II (2008), that the local board\u2019s decision was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d The state board reversed the local board\u2019s decision to uphold McKaig\u2019s nonrenewal, but it did not order McKaig\u2019s reinstatement or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>remedy. McKaig moved for reconsideration in light of the board\u2019s failure to specify a remedy; the state board denied her motion. The district appealed the state board\u2019s decision to this court. McKaig cross-appealed, arguing that we should affirm the state board\u2019s decision except for its failure to provide a remedy. McKaig contends that she was entitled to reinstatement with back pay and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">RSA chapter 541 governs our review of the state board\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>RSA 21-N:11, III (2012). Under RSA 541:13 (2007), we will not set aside the state board\u2019s order except for errors of law, unless we are satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that it is unjust or unreasonable. <em>See Appeal of Hillsborough County Nursing Home, </em>166 N.H. 731, 733 (2014). In reviewing the state board\u2019s order, our task is not to determine whether we would have found differently or to reweigh the evidence, but, rather, to determine whether the state board\u2019s findings are supported by competent evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>We review the state board\u2019s rulings on issues of law <em>de novo. Id. </em>\u201cThe party seeking to set aside the [state] board\u2019s order bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Appeal of Hopkinton Sch. Dist., </em>151 N.H. 478, 480 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The district first argues that the state board committed an error of law by \u201cfailing to correctly apply the clearly erroneous standard of review required under RSA 189:14-b, II.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) According to the district, the state board instead impermissibly engaged in <em>de novo </em>review, \u201cunlawfully reaching] its own factual conclusions based upon the evidence presented at the local school board level rather than determin[ing] whether the [local board\u2019s] decision was supported by the evidence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">RSA 189:14-b, II provides that \u201c[t]he state board of education shall uphold a decision of a local school board to nonrenew a teacher\u2019s contract unless the local school board\u2019s decision is clearly erroneous.\u201d RSA 189:14-b, II. As the district correctly notes, we have \u201cyet to consider the clearly erroneous standard ... in RSA 189:14-b, II.\u201d However, as to decisions by trial courts, we review a trial court\u2019s \u201cfactual findings as a mixed question of fact and law under the clearly erroneous standard. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if unsupported by the evidence .... Our inquiry is to determine whether the evidence presented to the trial court reasonably supports the court\u2019s findings, and then whether the court\u2019s decision is consonant with applicable law.\u201d <em>Taylor-Boren v. Isaac, </em>143 N.H. 261, 264 (1998) (quotation omitted). We note that nothing in RSA 189:14-b, II\u2019s text indicates that the legislature intended not to assign \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d its usual and customary meaning. Thus, the state board applies the clearly erroneous standard as stated in <em>Taylor-Boren v. Isaac </em>when reviewing the decisions of local school boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>We hold that the state board did not err in its application of RSA 189:14-b, II\u2019s clearly erroneous standard. The state board\u2019s decision shows that it reviewed the record and found that the record did not reasonably support the local board\u2019s conclusions that McKaig had been insubordinate or breached student confidentiality. Concerning insubordination, for example, the state board reviewed the district\u2019s policies cited by the local board and determined that the plain language of those policies did not require, among other things, that McKaig report to the superintendent before acting to prevent the principal from disclosing Student A\u2019s pregnancy. This conclusion was not a <em>de novo </em>factual determination. Rather, the state board accepted the local board\u2019s account of what McKaig did to assist Student A, but found clearly erroneous the local board\u2019s conclusion that McKaig\u2019s actions were inconsistent with district policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The district insists that the state board \u201cunlawfully reached its own factual conclusions . . . rather than determine whether the [local board\u2019s] decision was supported by the evidence.\u201d The district argues that <em>\u201cde novo </em>review is plainly evident in the conclusion section of [the state board\u2019s] decision, wherein it states that \u2018[u]nder these particular circumstances, the record as a whole does not support a finding of insubordination or breach of confidentiality against McKaig.\u2019 \u201d We fail to see how that statement in the state board\u2019s conclusion, which essentially mirrors our explanation of the clearly erroneous standard in <em>Taylor-Boren, </em>amounts to <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The district also points to several of the state board\u2019s allegedly impermissible factual conclusions, including that: \u201c[t]here was nothing in the policy that required [McKaig] to appeal to the superintendent\u201d; \u201cthe record reflected legitimate safety concerns\u201d; \u201cMcKaig acted consistently with the policies and practices applicable to her role as guidance counselor\u201d; and others. (Quotations omitted.) However, none of these conclusions evidence an impermissible <em>de novo </em>review. The first of the three is not a factual conclusion, but an interpretation of district policy, which interpretation is similar to a question of law. The clearly erroneous standard does not prohibit the state board\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review of the local board\u2019s interpretation of district policy. <em>Cf. Taylor-Boren, </em>143 N.H. at 264 (including in the clearly erroneous standard an inquiry into not only \u201cwhether the evidence presented . .. reasonably supports the court\u2019s findings,\u201d but also \u201cwhether the court\u2019s decision is consonant with applicable law\u201d). As to the remaining conclusions, the state board pointed to significant evidence in the record or defects in the local board\u2019s reasoning, which, according to it, supported its conclusions and rendered the local board\u2019s contrary conclusions clearly erroneous. This is precisely the nature of the review that RSA 189:14-b, II requires the board to conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Next, the district argues that it was unjust and unreasonable for the state board to reverse the local board\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>RSA 541:13. In doing so, the district challenges both of the state board\u2019s conclusions: (1) that McKaig was not insubordinate; and (2) that McKaig did not impermissibly disclose Student A\u2019s confidential information. Mindful of the significant deference that we owe the state board under RSA 541:13, we reject both of the district\u2019s challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">We hold that it was neither unjust nor unreasonable for the state board to rule that the local board\u2019s decision that McKaig was insubordinate was clearly erroneous. According to the local board, McKaig was insubordinate because she violated two school district policies: Policies 4244 and 4116. Policy 4244 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">The best [course] of action for an employee to take to avoid an insubordination issue is to follow the directive given by the supervisor, then later question or challenge the directive through dispute resolution. If an employee disagrees with a policy, regulation, rule, procedure and/or directive, or thinks it is unfair or unnecessary, the employee should discuss the issue with the Building Administrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The local board concluded that McKaig violated this policy by \u201cdisregarding] the principal\u2019s role as decision maker and go[ing] to court against him, rather than up the chain of command.\u201d However, the state board explained that Policy 4244 did not require going \u201cup the chain of command,\u201d but only that McKaig speak \u201cwith the building administrator^ that is, the principal,] if there was a disagreement with his decision.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The state board concluded that McKaig complied with Policy 4244 by \u201ckeeping the principal informed as to her actions and research on behalf of Student A[,] and urging him to contact\u201d Keshen. The district argues that Policy 4244\u2019s reference to dispute resolution required McKaig to \u201cattempt to resolve\u201d her disagreement with the principal \u201cabove the level of [her] supervisor,\u201d that is, with the superintendent, rather than to file \u201ca lawsuit in [s]uperior [c]ourt.\u201d Thus, the district argues, the local board\u2019s conclusion that \u201cMcKaig was insubordinate in violation of Policy 4244\u201d was not clearly erroneous, and the state board was \u201cunjust and unreasonable in deciding that there \u2018was nothing in the policy that required [McKaig] to appeal to the superintendent.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Contrary to the district\u2019s contention, the plain language of Policy 4244 does not require district employees to appeal their disagreements \u201cup the chain of command.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Although the policy mentions dispute resolution, it refers to it as the \u201cbest,\u201d not the only, course of action that an employee may take to \u201cchallenge [a] directive.\u201d Moreover, consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>tent with the state board\u2019s conclusion, the policy recommends that employees discuss policy disagreements with the building administrator, that is, the principal. Thus Policy 4244\u2019s text supports the state board\u2019s conclusion that, to avoid insubordination, McKaig was required only to discuss her disagreement with the principal, which she did. Moreover, the state board observed that \u201cMcKaig acted consistently with policies and practices applicable to her role as guidance counselor.\u201d Thus, the state board apparently recognized that McKaig had professional obligations apart from her responsibilities as an employee. Accordingly, we conclude that it was neither unjust nor unreasonable for the state board to rule that the local board\u2019s application of Policy 4244 was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The state board also rejected as clearly erroneous the local board\u2019s conclusion that McKaig violated Policies 4244 and 4116 by failing to \u201cfollow and abide by the decision of\u2019 the principal to inform Student A\u2019s mother about her pregnancy. Policy 4244 refers to dispute resolution as a means of \u201cehalleng[ing] [a] directive.\u201d Policy 4116, in turn, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ll staff members will follow policies as outlined by the School District . . . and/or the directions of the Principal.\u201d The local board concluded that the principal\u2019s decision to inform Student A\u2019s mother about her pregnancy was a \u201cdirective\u201d even though \u201cit was not a direct order\u201d to McKaig not to act on Student A\u2019s behalf. (Quotation omitted.) According to the local board, because McKaig disobeyed this directive by \u201ccho[osing] to become a litigant against\u201d the principal, McKaig violated Policies 4244 and 4116 and was therefore insubordinate. The state board determined that the record did not support the local board\u2019s finding that there was a directive because the principal never told McKaig \u201cto cease her efforts on behalf of Student A, even when it became apparent that both she and the other guidance counselor disagreed with the principal\u2019s decision and that McKaig had already consulted with\u201d Keshen. The district argues that the local board committed no clear error by finding that the principal\u2019s decision was a directive, which McKaig disobeyed, and, thus, the state board\u2019s conclusion that McKaig violated no directive was unjust and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The record supports the state board\u2019s conclusion that the principal did not give McKaig a directive. After McKaig told the principal about Student A\u2019s pregnancy, the principal did not tell McKaig to stop assisting Student A. The principal\u2019s next action was to direct the school nurse to have a discussion with Student A about her pregnancy. Because the principal never instructed McKaig not to act on Student A\u2019s behalf, it was neither unjust nor unreasonable for the state board to conclude that McKaig did not disobey a directive of the principal or that the local board\u2019s ruling that McKaig violated Policies 4244 and 4116 was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Next, the district argues that it was unjust and unreasonable for the state board to reject as clearly erroneous the local board\u2019s finding that McKaig breached student confidentiality. According to the local board, McKaig violated another provision in Policy 4116 by providing Student A\u2019s \u201cconfidential medical and identifying information\u201d to Keshen and by allowing \u201cthat information\u2019s subsequent disclosure\u201d in the TRO petition. The state board found that McKaig\u2019s disclosure was justified under an exception to the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which, we note, is incorporated into Policy 4116 by reference. The state board explained that the exception \u201cpermits release of confidential information under certain \u2018emergency\u2019 situations.\u201d <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(l)(I) (2012). The state board provided two additional reasons for its decision that the local board\u2019s ruling on confidentiality was clearly erroneous. However, the state board\u2019s reading of Policy 4116 alone supports its conclusion that neither McKaig\u2019s disclosure nor Keshen\u2019s inclusion of that disclosure in the TRO petition violated the confidentiality policy. Thus, we confine our discussion about confidentiality accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Policy 4116 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ll employees are expected to keep personal information pertaining to pupils <em>in confidence </em>as required by the Buckley Amendment,\u201d that is, FERPA. The local board found that McKaig violated Policy 4116 by disclosing to Keshen Student A\u2019s initials, age, academic year, and pregnancy. The state board disagreed, and noted that FERPA permits the disclosure of confidential student information in emergency situations \u201cif the knowledge of such information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The state board noted Student A\u2019s safety concerns, acknowledged that the local board failed to address those concerns or \u201cwhether . . . McKaig\u2019s actions were at least in accordance with the FERPA exceptions,\u201d and determined that \u201cthe record supported] a conclusion that they were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We note that, in reversing the local board\u2019s decision, the state board was not interpreting or applying federal law. Rather, the state board\u2019s decision shows that, to the extent that it considered FERPA\u2019s provisions, it did so to determine the scope of Policy 4116\u2019s confidentiality provision. For this reason, we reject the district\u2019s argument that the state board erred in relying on FERPA\u2019s health and safety exception because FERPA applies to \u201ceducational agenc[ies] or institution[s],\u201d not district employees, such as McKaig. This argument incorrectly assumes that the board was considering only FERPA, rather than Policy 4116, when analyzing McKaig\u2019s disclosure. Unlike FERPA, Policy 4116 applies to \u201c[a]ll employees.\u201d It instructs employees to \u201ckeep personal information pertaining to pupils <em>in confidence\u201d </em>in accordance with FERPA. When drafting Policy 4116, the district could have crafted its own student confidentiality rules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>exceptions. Instead, it opted to incorporate by reference the rules and exceptions of FERPA, which include the health and safety exception that the board considered. Thus, FERPA\u2019s application to \u201ceducational agencies] or institution[s]\u201d is not controlling in our review of the board\u2019s decision. We instead focus on the board\u2019s interpretation of Policy 4116, which incorporates FERPA guidelines as the standard by which \u201c[a]ll [district] employees\u201d must manage confidential student information.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The record shows that in ruling that McKaig violated Policy 4116, the local board failed to consider FERPA or its exceptions. Because Policy 4116 incorporates FERPA, it was neither unjust nor unreasonable for the state board to conclude that the local board\u2019s failure to address FERPA in its analysis of Policy 4116 was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Further, the record supports the state board\u2019s determination that Student A and \u201cher boyfriend were afraid for their safety if [Student A\u2019s] mother found out\u201d about her pregnancy. Both McKaig and the other guidance counselor testified repeatedly about Student A\u2019s safety concerns. The local board did not address this testimony specifically, but stated more generally that it did not base its decision on \u201cwhat the witnesses who dealt with [Student A] claim she said at various points in time.\u201d The local board appeared to conclude that these statements were irrelevant to the confidentiality issue, explaining that \u201c[t]he statements attributed to [Student A] did not relate in any substantial way to the . . . issues supporting the acceptance of the Superintendent\u2019s recommendation,\u201d including the failure \u201cto preserve the confidentiality of student information.\u201d However, consideration of those statements was necessary to determine whether the health and safety exception, as incorporated into Policy 4116, permitted McKaig\u2019s disclosure. The statements showed that McKaig disclosed limited information about Student A for the purpose of preventing the principal from informing Student A\u2019s mother about the pregnancy and thereby endangering Student A and her boyfriend. Thus, it was neither unjust nor unreasonable for the state board to find clearly erroneous the local board\u2019s failure to consider that testimony as well as its ultimate conclusion that McKaig violated Policy 4116. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The dissent and the majority agree on one thing \u2014 this case is <em>sui generis. </em>Our analysis is confined to the particular policies of the Farmington School District and their application to a unique set of facts. In this narrow context, we conclude that, for the reasons stated above, the state board\u2019s interpretations of the policies were neither unjust nor unreasonable. Although the dissent may interpret the policies differently, we decline to substitute our judgment for the state board\u2019s reasonable interpretations based upon its administrative expertise. <em>See Appeal of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number><em>Town of Seabrook, </em>163 N.H. 635, 646 (2012) (\u201c[W]e are reluctant to substitute our judgment for the expertise of administrative officials\u201d). Additionally, given the limited issues before us, we cannot accept the dissent\u2019s predictions about our decision\u2019s \u201cfrightening implications for the management of all collective organizations.\u201d We also note that, contrary to what the dissent maintains, McKaig did not \u201csue her supervisor\u201d because she \u201cdisagree[d] with his decision\u201d about Student A. She brought the TRO petition on behalf of a minor, who was granted significant rights by the New Hampshire legislature. At no point during the superior court litigation did the district challenge McKaig\u2019s standing to bring suit on behalf of Student A, whose rights were at issue. Moreover, we find it ironic, as well as concerning, that: the district asked the trial court to grant the requested TRO against it, which the trial court did and which the district did not appeal; and then, five months later, the district decided not to renew McKaig\u2019s employment based, in part, upon her filing of the TRO petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Apart from the unique circumstances giving rise to this case, there is nothing remarkable about our analysis; rather, it is based upon a reasoned application of legislative enactments, and employs well-established principles of judicial review, according proper deference to the state board\u2019s decision. We are disappointed by the tone of the dissent and its incorrect assumptions about our motivations. In contrast, we do not choose to speculate upon the motivations of the dissent; rather, after giving due consideration to the legal points raised by the dissent, we reject its substantive criticisms of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Although the state board reversed the local board\u2019s decision not to renew McKaig\u2019s employment, it did not order a specific remedy. McKaig argues that she is entitled to reinstatement with back pay and benefits. The district does not deny that reinstatement would be a proper remedy in the event that we uphold the board\u2019s decision. However, it contests McKaig\u2019s entitlement to back pay and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">RSA 189:14-b grants the state board the authority to review and reverse the decisions of local boards in nonrenewal matters. <em>See </em>RSA 189:14-b. However, the statute does not explicitly provide for a remedy in the event of a reversal. In two cases, we have discussed remedies for teachers who prevailed in nonrenewal matters. In <em>Petition of Dunlap, </em>134 N.H. 533 (1991), we ordered the reinstatement of a teacher whose contract the school district had not renewed because of the teacher\u2019s many absences due to chronic asthma. <em>Dunlap, </em>134 N.H. at 534-35, 543. McKaig cites <em>Dunlap </em>to support her argument that RSA 189:14-b \u201cincludes the power to reinstate a teacher.\u201d However, <em>Dunlap </em>did not so hold. Rather, in <em>Dunlap, </em>we held that the petitioner\u2019s nonrenewal on account of his asthma violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>a statute that prohibited employment discrimination against the disabled. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 543. We ordered reinstatement on the basis of that statutory violation, but we did not explicitly connect the reinstatement remedy to RSA 189:14-b. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In <em>Littky v. Winchester School District, </em>129 N.H. 626 (1987), we awarded attorney\u2019s fees to a teacher who prevailed in a nonrenewal matter. <em>Littky, </em>129 N.H. at 631. In doing so, we relied upon the \u201ctest we set out in <em>Harkeem v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 687, 377 A.2d 617 (1977), [stating that] where an individual is forced to seek judicial assistance to secure a clearly defined and established right, which should have been freely enjoyed without such intervention, an award of counsel fees on the basis of bad faith is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). We note, however, that here McKaig requests back pay and benefits, not attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We acknowledge, as did the district, that, without the ability to order reinstatement, the state board\u2019s authority to reverse a local board\u2019s decision not to renew a teacher or, in the instant case, a guidance counselor, would be meaningless. <em>See </em>RSA 189:14-b. We therefore affirm the state board\u2019s reversal of the local board\u2019s decision, and order that McKaig be reinstated to her former employment. We also remand to the state board the issue of whether McKaig is entitled to additional remedies, which issue should be addressed by the state board in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b757-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and CONBOY and Bassett, JJ., concurred; Lynn, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b757-9\">Lynn, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASdy\">dissenting. The majority\u2019s holding, that the State of New Hampshire Board of Education (state board) could have reasonably concluded that McKaig was not insubordinate, is based upon two flawed premises. First, the holding is based upon the implicit (albeit unstated) determination that the principal\u2019s decision to disclose Student A\u2019s pregnancy to her parents was in some manner at least arguably unlawful or wrong. Second, it also accepts that, because McKaig disagreed with the principal\u2019s decision to tell the parents, she had a right, not simply to advise the student of her disagreement with his decision, but to become an adversary in a court proceeding against him. Neither of these premises, however, can withstand scrutiny. Additionally, the majority allows the state board to impermissibly act as fact finder regarding McKaig\u2019s breach of Student A\u2019s right to confidentiality per district policy. Had the state board given the required deference to the Farmington School Board\u2019s (local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>board) decision, it would have been required to uphold the decision not to renew McKaig\u2019s contract. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Given the majority\u2019s truncated recitation of the facts, I include the following facts that were presented to the local board at the two-day evidentiary hearing it held pursuant to RSA 189:14-a (Supp. 2015). On November 26, 2012, Demetria McKaig and the other guidance counselor at Farmington High School met with Student A, a fifteen-year-old girl, and her boyfriend, who was nearly four years older.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that meeting, the counselors learned that Student A was pregnant and that she wanted to have an abortion. According to McKaig, the two \u201cwere very concerned [for] the boyfriend\u2019s safety if [Student A\u2019s] family found out, and that they were adamant they did not want [her] mother to know.\u201d Thereafter, McKaig began looking for services to help the student.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Later that week, at a meeting with select school staff including the principal, McKaig informed those present of Student A\u2019s disclosure and that she did not want to tell her mother. A conversation ensued about whether the parents<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> should be informed, and the principal inquired about how the school had handled similar situations in the past. The principal stated that he \u201cfelt strongly that, for the health and safety of that child, the parents need[ed] to know what was going on, both for her and the baby.\u201d The school nurse stated that she felt the parents should be notified, and indicated that she had done so on a prior occasion even though the student did not want the parent to know of the pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Both guidance counselors opposed informing the parents. The other guidance counselor testified that she felt the principal was \u201cpersonalizing,\u201d because he stated that he would want to know if his teenage daughter were pregnant. She also agreed that the two guidance counselors were the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>two in the meeting who voiced opposition to telling the parents. Ultimately, the principal decided to wait until after the weekend to make a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On Monday, December 3, the principal, after consulting with both the assistant superintendent and th\u00e9 assistant principal, asked the school nurse to meet with Student A, to see if she could convince the student to tell her parents. He asked the nurse to confirm with the student that she was, in fact, pregnant and to inform her that if she did not tell her mother by that Wednesday, the school would invite the parent in for a meeting to inform her. The nurse met with Student A, who \u201cadamantly\u201d denied being pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">During this time, McKaig had contacted the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire (ACLU), and received a copy of RSA 132:33 and :34 (2015), a statute requiring parental notification prior to a minor having an abortion and establishing the procedure for a so-called \u201cjudicial bypass\u201d of such notification requirement under certain circumstances. McKaig forwarded the statute to the principal and tried to have him contact Attorney Barbara Keshen of the ACLU. The principal testified that he considered the statute, but determined that the statute concerned a minor having an abortion, and that he was only concerned about informing the parents of the pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">McKaig, noting the lack of school district policy directly on point, also forwarded the principal additional research she had gathered about state and federal information on this issue. For instance, McKaig cited the New Hampshire Department of Education\u2019s website, which stated: \u201cIf a student discloses a pregnancy to a nurse or other school staff member, the issue of whether to inform the student\u2019s parent(s) is to be determined on a case-by[-]case basis at the local school level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">On December 4, Keshen called the principal and asked him if he had reviewed the parental notification statute. He indicated that he had, and that it did not change his mind about informing Student A\u2019s parents about the pregnancy. There was also testimony that both the superintendent and the assistant superintendent agreed with the principal\u2019s decision to tell the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">\u2022 At around this same time, McKaig had a conversation with Keshen about potentially filing an emergency lawsuit in superior court. Keshen stated that she \u201cfelt that [she] was representing (Student A)\u201d and not McKaig, but needed to use McKaig\u2019s name on the complaint. McKaig assented but stated that she wanted to speak with Student A first. Keshen testified that she did not speak with Student A and never received the student\u2019s authorization to file a lawsuit. Keshen also testified that she did not know Student A\u2019s reasons for not wanting to reveal her pregnancy to her family. McKaig gave Keshen the student\u2019s initials, age, and grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>McKaig met with Student A during her lunch break and informed her of the principal\u2019s intentions. McKaig told the student that, in order to stop the principal from telling her mother, McKaig is \u201cgoing to have to go to court,\u201d to which the student responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want my mom to know.\u201d McKaig then stated \u201cokay[,] [t]hank you[]\u201d and \u201ccalled [Keshen] and said go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">That afternoon, Keshen filed a complaint in superior court seeking \u201ca temporary and immediate order restraining [the principal] from informing the parents of [Student A] that she is pregnant.\u201d The only legal basis asserted in the complaint for granting such relief was that the principal would be in violation of the parental notification law if he informed the parents. Keshen testified that she did not review any district policies relating to this issue and that her entire approach was based upon her understanding of the judicial bypass provisions of the parental notification law. The complaint was captioned \u201cDEMETRIA MCKAIG (ON BEHALF OF [Student A\u2019s initials])\u201d versus the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Upon receipt of the complaint, the principal contacted the school district administration. The superintendent, in turn, contacted Attorney Barbara Loughman, who filed a special appearance on behalf of the principal. Loughman informed the court that the principal agreed, pending a hearing, not to notify the parents of Student A about her pregnancy. A hearing was then scheduled for December 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The court held a hearing regarding the restraining order on December 11. There, the parties learned that, the day before, the court had held a hearing on Student A\u2019s petition to have an abortion without notifying her parents and had granted a waiver of notification under RSA 132:34. Loughman testified that, upon being informed of the grant of the parental notification waiver, the school district did not challenge the request for a restraining order because there was no longer a health issue for the district to address with the parents. Loughman stated, \u201cI basically said to the Court, please enter an order telling us that we can\u2019t tell the parent because, otherwise,... the District feels it has a responsibility to do so.\u201d The court issued an order \u201cenjoin[ing] the defendant from making the disclosure to the parents, and order[ed] him to remind the members of the administrative team of the confidentiality requirements of RSA 132:34.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In April 2013, McKaig received a letter from the superintendent informing her that he would not be renominating her to her position for the following school year. Pursuant to her rights under RSA 189:14-a, McKaig requested the specific reasons for the nonrenewal' and a hearing before the local board. In May, the superintendent sent McKaig a letter listing three reasons for her nonrenewal: (1) insubordination, stating that \u201c[r]ather than follow the chain of supervisory authority within the school district in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>to address a student matter, you chose to bring suit in Superior Court against your supervisory principal\u201d; (2) breach of student confidentiality, stating \u201c[i]n your handling of the student matter referenced above, you failed to keep personal student information private in violation of District policies and practice, and otherwise exercised poor judgment in disregard for District policies and practice\u201d; and (3) neglect of duties, in part for failing to attend \u201cspecial education team meetings concerning students for whom you are responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Following a hearing, the local board accepted the superintendent\u2019s recommendation not to renew MeKaig\u2019s contract, by a vote of 3-2. It did so on the bases that McKaig was insubordinate and breached Student A\u2019s confidentiality; it did not accept the recommendation based upon neglect of duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Pursuant to RSA 189:14-b (Supp. 2015), McKaig appealed the local board\u2019s decision to the state board. A state board hearing officer, after reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, recommended that the state board reverse the decision of the local board. The state board, after additional briefing and oral argument, adopted the recommendation of the hearing officer and reversed the local board\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Before turning to the merits, I address the applicable standard of review. The majority correctly notes that, per RSA 189:14-b, the state board must uphold the decision of the local board unless it is clearly erroneous. This means that the local board\u2019s factual findings must be upheld unless \u201cunsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Taylor-Boren v. Isaac, </em>143 N.H. 261, 264 (1998) (quotation omitted). The majority recites this standard, but then goes on to say that it must determine whether the state board\u2019s findings are supported by competent evidence in the record. The majority never explains the \u201cfindings\u201d it is referencing, but it must mean factual findings, as it acknowledges that rulings of law are reviewed <em>de novo. </em>However, the state board did not act as fact finder in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">It was the local board, not the state board, which held an evidentiary hearing in this matter. Before the state board hearing officer, as well as before the state board itself, the parties presented oral argument and briefing, but both sides relied upon a transcript of the hearing before the local board. One of the fundamental reasons we defer to the tribunal that saw and heard the evidence is \u201cbecause a trial transcript provides no indication of a witness\u2019s tone of voice or demeanor, two useful tools in the assessment of credibility.\u201d <em>State v. Giles, </em>140 N.H. 714, 718-19 (1996); <em>see also State v. Gribble, </em>165 N.H. 1, 24 (2013) (\u201cIn contrast to the cold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>transcript received by the appellate court, the in-the-moment <em>voir dire </em>affords the trial court a more intimate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member\u2019s fitness for jury service.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\">Because the state board had no basis for resolving disputed factual issues, its review of the local board\u2019s decision should have been confined to assessing whether the local board made an error of law or whether the evidence before the local board was insufficient to support the decision it reached. <em>See Taylor-Boren, </em>143 N.H. at 264. Only upon one of these bases could the state board properly have found that the local board\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous. Nonetheless, without the benefit of the ability to appraise the \u201chost of factors impossible to capture fully in the record \u2014 among them, [the witnesses\u2019] inflection, sincerity, demeanor, candor, [and] body language,\u201d <em>Gribble, </em>165 N.H. at 24 (quotation omitted), the state board reversed the local board\u2019s decision. The majority blesses the state board\u2019s action, purporting to defer to the state board\u2019s \u201cadministrative expertise\u201d regarding the interpretation of the policies at issue here. Yet neither the matter of employee insubordination nor the matter of whether Student A had a legitimate fear of informing her parents requires any specialized knowledge or expertise about the operation or management of the school system. Nor do the issues here involve policies or regulations that have been repeatedly construed by the state board in a particular manner, such that they have become imbued with an administrative gloss that would be entitled to deference. <em>See Petition of Kalar, </em>162 N.H. 314, 321-22 (2011). On the contrary, the state board\u2019s review of the local board\u2019s decision required nothing more sophisticated than an ability to read the straight-forward language of the school district\u2019s policies and the transcript of the hearing held before the local board. As discussed below, the record before us simply does not support the state board\u2019s \u201cfindings,\u201d which in reality amount to nothing more than the state board substituting its judgment for that of the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Turning to the merits, I first discuss the majority\u2019s conclusion that the state board reasonably found the local board\u2019s decision that McKaig was insubordinate in violation of district Policies 4244 and 4116 to be clearly erroneous. To arrive at this conclusion, the state board and the majority endeavor to surgically parse the language of these policies in a manner that deprives them of any real meaning. For example, the majority asserts that Policy 4244 does not require an employee who disagrees with her superior\u2019s decision to go \u201cup the chain of command\u201d with her disagreement, but only that she speak with the building supervisor (here the principal); and that Policy 4116 was not violated because the principal never gave McKaig a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>specific directive \u201cto cease her efforts on behalf of Student A.\u201d (Quotations omitted.) The obvious problem with these constructions is the negative implication which the state board and the majority seek to draw from the policies \u2014 that in the absence of a specific provision in the policies or specific statement from the principal saying that an employee who disagrees with her supervisor\u2019s decision on an issue within his authority to decide cannot sue to have the decision reversed, it was perfectly all right for McKaig to do so. The thesis that an employee who disagrees with her employer\u2019s business decision-making that does not infringe upon some personal right or interest of the employee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may <em>for that reason alone </em>file a lawsuit against the employer to change the decision without committing insubordination is a novel legal concept \u2014 and one that carries rather frightening implications for the management of all collective organizations, whether public or private, large or small.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the majority cites no law and conducts no analysis supporting such a far-reaching legal proposition, it is fair to conclude that the majority does not genuinely ascribe to its validity and does not decide the case on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Instead, although the majority studiously avoids saying as much, the only plausible explanation for its holding is that the majority believes McKaig\u2019s action in suing her principal was not insubordinate because the principal\u2019s decision to tell Student A\u2019s parents about her pregnancy was not simply one with which McKaig disagreed, but was in some way wrongful or unlawful. Stated differently, if the principal was properly within his rights to tell the parents about the student\u2019s pregnancy, then it is hard to imagine how the majority could hold that it was not insubordinate for McKaig to participate in a lawsuit against the principal because she disagreed with that otherwise correct decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Indeed, the state board\u2019s ruling reveals that the claimed unlawfulness of the principal\u2019s decision to disclose Student A\u2019s pregnancy to her parents was the linchpin of its decision. The state board concluded that McKaig was not insubordinate because \u201cshe was acting under a reasonable belief that state law afforded the student certain privacy rights that prevented parental disclosure under the circumstances.\u201d The only ground offered by McKaig to support the supposed \u201cunlawfulness\u201d of the principal\u2019s intended disclosure is the claim that such disclosure would violate the judicial bypass provision of the parental notification law, RSA 132:34. There is, however, not even an arguable legal basis for this claim, and the local board thus was entirely correct in \u201crejeet[ing] the argument that notifying a parent would be a violation of RSA 132.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\">The parental notification law generally prohibits the performance of an abortion upon a minor until 48 hours after notice of the proposed abortion has been given to a parent of the minor. <em>See </em>RSA 132:33. RSA 132:34 creates a procedure, the so-called \u201cjudicial bypass,\u201d that permits a minor to have an abortion without notifying a parent by filing a petition in the superior court and obtaining a ruling by a judge that the minor either \u201cis mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion\u201d or, if the minor is not mature, \u201cthe performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parent. . . would be in her best interests. . . .\u201d RSA 132:34, II. The statute also provides that <em>\u201c[proceedings </em>under this section shall be held in closed court, shall be confidential and shall ensure the anonymity of the minor.\u201d RSA 132:34, 11(b) (emphasis added). It continues that \u201c[a]ll court proceedings under this section shall be sealed\u201d and \u201c[a]ll documents related to this petition shall be confidential and shall not be available to the public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">By its plain language, the statute imposes an obligation of confidentiality only with respect to the judicial bypass proceeding itself and any documents or filings related thereto. Nothing in the statute even remotely purports to establish some form of privilege that bestows upon a pregnant minor the right to preclude others who become aware of her pregnancy or her intended or completed abortion from sources outside the judicial bypass court proceeding (whether through voluntary disclosure by the minor or otherwise) from disclosing such information to others, including the minor\u2019s parents. Neither McKaig nor <em>amicus </em>ACLU offers the slightest developed argument suggesting how the text of RSA 132:34 could plausibly be construed to confer such a privilege. Yet the existence of such a phantom \u201cpregnancy privilege\u201d forms the entire underpinning of McKaig\u2019s appeal. And although the majority makes no explicit attempt to construe RSA 132:34 as creating such a privilege, it summarily concludes that Student A was \u201cgranted significant rights by the New Hampshire legislature.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>However, the majority never tells us what these rights are, in which statute they are located, or how they apply to the principal in this case. Therefore, we are left to guess that, through some wholly unarticulated methodology, the majority has somehow determined that the confidentiality provisions regarding the judicial bypass <em>proceeding </em>established by RSA 132:34 created a privilege which prevented a person uninvolved in that proceeding \u2014 the principal \u2014 from disclosing the pregnancy to the parents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Student A\u2019s disclosure to McKaig of her pregnancy was not part of the judicial bypass proceeding. Neither the principal nor the school district were parties to or had access to the bypass proceeding, which had not even been instituted at the time Student A made her disclosure to McKaig, nor does RSA 132:32 through :34 impose a requirement on Student A to speak with a school counselor (or anyone else, for that matter) as a prerequisite to invoking the judicial bypass procedure. If Student A did not want anyone to know she was pregnant or that she wished to have an abortion, she had it completely within her control to keep that information private and to anonymously invoke the judicial bypass procedure. Instead, she decided to voluntarily disclose her situation to her boyfriend and McKaig. I do not for a moment question the wisdom of that choice. But by disclosing her pregnancy to these individuals, she assumed the risk that they would make further disclosure of the information, including to her parents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See generally Lewis v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 206, 210-11 (1966); <em>State v. Valenzuela, </em>130 N.H. 175, 182-83 (1987). In particular, by disclosing her pregnancy and desire for an abortion to McKaig in her capacity as a school counselor and employee of the school district, Student A assumed the risk that the district would treat the information in accordance with school district policies and procedures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Aside from her unavailing reliance on RSA 182:34, McKaig makes no claim that there exists any other authority that precluded the principal from disclosing Student A\u2019s pregnancy to her parents. Based on the state board\u2019s observation that \u201cMcKaig acted consistently with policies and practices applicable to her role as guidance counselor,\u201d the majority confidently asserts that \u201cthe state board <em>apparently </em>recognized that McKaig has professional obligations apart from her responsibilities as an employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But of course the basis for such recognition is anything but apparent, given that the principal had the discretion to inform Student A\u2019s parents of her pregnancy and that the state board did not articulate the substance of any such \u201cpolicies and practices\u201d that authorized McKaig, through legal action or otherwise, to prevent the principal from doing so. In fact, the record reflects that the principal had the authority to do exactly what he proposed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">As both McKaig and the other guidance counselor acknowledged in their testimony before the local board, the State Department of Education had information on its website regarding when a school administration should inform a student\u2019s parents that she is pregnant. Both admitted that disclosure is not prohibited and that a decision to inform the parents must be made on a case-by-case basis at the local school level. When confronted with this information, McKaig did not deny its applicability or that the principal\u2019s decision to disclose was one made \u201cat the local school level,\u201d but, rather, maintained that the principal\u2019s decision \u201cwas against the law.\u201d As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>discussed herein, however, McKaig was wrong \u2014 there is no law, policy, or other authority that would have prevented the principal from disclosing Student A\u2019s pregnancy to her parents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Absent some showing that the principal\u2019s decision was unlawful or wrongful, this case is no different than any other disagreement between a supervisor and an employee. For example, had the principal made a lawful decision to suspend a student and McKaig disagreed with that determination, there would be no question that McKaig could not file a lawsuit against the principal to prevent the suspension. Nonetheless, without any discussion of the lawfulness of the principal\u2019s decision, the majority upholds the state board by reasoning that McKaig was not insubordinate because she, by becoming a named party in a lawsuit against the principal, did not violate any \u201cdirective\u201d given by the. principal. It states that \u201c[b]ecause the principal never instructed McKaig not to act on Student A\u2019s behalf, it was neither unjust nor unreasonable for the state board to conclude that McKaig did not disobey a directive of the principal.\u201d This is tantamount to holding that McKaig was not insubordinate because the principal never instructed her not to sue him if she disagreed with the decision that' he made. However, a directive that a person cannot sue her supervisor when she disagrees with his decision should be so plainly evident to any reasonable person that it would be irrational to expect it to have been stated aloud. Yet, the majority\u2019s decision seems to require just that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">I agree that Policy 4244 did not explicitly require McKaig to take her disagreement to the superintendent, but that she \u201cshould discuss the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>with the Building Administrator,\u201d and that the building administrator in this ease was the principal. However, the only sensible reading of the policy in these circumstances is that it reflects the recognition that the principal had the final decision-making authority regarding the disclosure of the pregnancy and that there was no additional recourse for McKaig. Furthermore, even if the policy could be read to contemplate some implied ability for an employee to seek reconsideration of a decision within the hierarchy of the school district, it cannot reasonably be understood to incorporate a right to file a lawsuit against the building administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\">The clear tenor of Policies 4244 and 4116, in proscribing insubordination, is completely consistent with the common and accepted meaning of the term, which is \u201cdefiance of authority.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1172 (unabridged ed. 2002). In that regard, there is ample support in the record for the local board\u2019s finding that, by \u201ccho[os-ing] to become a litigant\u201d against her principal, McKaig was insubordinate in violation of these policies. The state board determined, without elaboration, that \u201c[i]t is unclear from the record whether McKaig herself was familiar with the form the pleadings would take, or whether she was aware of or considered their potential adversarial effect.\u201d However, if there is anything about the decisions below that is clearly erroneous, it is this purported \u201cfinding\u201d of the state board. Keshen testified at the local board hearing that she spoke with McKaig \u201cto make sure that... [she] was aware that I was going to be putting her name on this petition because I didn\u2019t know the student\u2019s name\u201d and that \u201cbefore I would put someone\u2019s name on a petition, I would have a conversation with them about it.\u201d Keshen also testified that she informed McKaig that \u201cthere could be consequences for\u201d McKaig being named in the lawsuit. Even McKaig admitted that she knew that Keshen was going to use her name. There is, in short, scant support for the thesis that McKaig did not appreciate what she was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Moreover, the local board could readily- have found that, even under McKaig\u2019s erroneous view that the principal\u2019s decision was \u201cagainst the law,\u201d there was no justification for the way she chose to handle the matter. McKaig could have simply spoken with Student A, put her in contact with Keshen, and let the two discuss the student\u2019s legal options. However, McKaig did much more than that. She assumed an active role as adversary against her principal \u2014 so much so that, when Keshen filed the complaint in the superior court, she did so based on McKaig\u2019s authorization and without ever having personally spoken to Student A in order to determine that the student consented to Keshen\u2019s representation or the filing of a lawsuit on her behalf. The local board quite understandably was skeptical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>that Keshen could have been \u201crepresenting a minor student she had never met or talked to,\u201d testimony the local board reasonably found to be \u201cquite incredible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">For all of the reasons discussed above, if the state board had afforded the proper deference to the local board, it would have been required to uphold the decision of the local board that McKaig was insubordinate according to the school\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">I also cannot agree with the majority\u2019s holding that the state board sustainably determined that the local board\u2019s decision that McKaig breached her duty of confidentiality to Student A was clearly erroneous. Initially, I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of Policy 4116. The majority holds that the policy\u2019s reference to the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g (2012), when stating that \u201c[a]ll employees are expected to keep personal information pertaining to pupils <em>in confidence </em>as required by\u201d FERPA adopted, for all employees, the health or safety exception described in FERPA. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g (b)(l)(I). It therefore concludes that the fact that FERPA is applicable only to \u201ceducational agenc[ies] or institution^]\u201d is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">However, because FERPA applies only to \u201ceducational agenc[ies] and institution^],\u201d only those entities, not a school district employee acting against the wishes of the school administration, are permitted to disclose confidential information and rely upon the health or safety exception. To interpret Policy 4116 as allowing any employee individually to disclose confidential information regardless of the contrary view of the educational agency or institution as to the need for disclosure would mean that the district adopted a policy allowing for the violation of FERPA because it does not allow for such disclosure by individual employees. This interpretation makes little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Even putting the interpretation of the policy aside, had McKaig truly been acting on behalf of Student A, one would think that McKaig would have simply obtained Student A\u2019s consent to disclose her confidential information to Keshen so that she could file the lawsuit. However, McKaig does not argue that Student A consented to the disclosure of her confidential information. Instead, the majority relies upon the FERPA health or safety exception mentioned in the policy to uphold the state board\u2019s decision. However, the state board\u2019s conclusion that there were legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>safety concerns if Student A\u2019s parents were notified of her pregnancy is perhaps the most obvious instance of it substituting its own factual findings for that of the local board.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">To be sure, there is testimony from both guidance counselors that Student A expressed a safety concern. However, the local board determined that it could not rely upon the statements of Student A, who did not testify, but whose statements were admitted as hearsay testimony through other witnesses. It determined that Student A \u201cwas, in all likelihood, very much inclined to say what she felt those she was dealing with wanted to hear when drawn into this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The local board\u2019s finding that the hearsay statements of Student A are of questionable credibility is, contrary to the state board\u2019s conclusion, appropriately supported by the record in this case. For instance, when the principal instructed the school nurse to approach Student A, the student lied \u2014 \u201cadamantly\u201d denying being pregnant. Additionally, the superintendent testified that Student A informed the administration that McKaig had made the appointment for her at the Feminist Health Center, and both McKaig and the executive director of the center deny this, testifying that the student made the appointment herself. The local board\u2019s determination not to attribute much weight to the hearsay statements of Student A was undoubtedly well within its discretion as fact finder, and hardly constitutes clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Nonetheless, the state board reasoned that \u201cMcKaig was privy to Student A\u2019s concerns and arguably in the best position to assess the safety issues regarding the family.\u201d It also states that \u201cthere is no dispute as to the legitimacy of these [safety] concerns.\u201d However, exploration of the record regarding these \u201csafety concerns\u201d reveals that, at best, the testimony reflects conclusory statements completely devoid of foundation, and, at worst, that they did not involve a safety concern with informing the parents at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Initially, neither the majority nor the state board discuss the substance of Student A\u2019s safety concerns. The majority simply reasons that both guidance counselors \u201ctestified repeatedly about Student A\u2019s safety concerns.\u201d This testimony consisted mostly of vague and unarticulated allegations of safety concerns without factual backup. Among these, McKaig testified that Student A and her boyfriend \u201cwere very concerned [for] the boyfriend\u2019s safety if the family found out.\u201d The other guidance counselor testified that the student \u201chad safety concerns within her family,\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the family dynamic was \u201cnot a healthy environment and a safe environment.\u201d Neither guidance counselor provided any support whatsoever for these conclusory assertions. For example, there was no testimony regarding the extent or nature of either counselor\u2019s prior dealings with the parents, evidence of a history of intemperate or abusive behavior by the parents toward Student A or other children of the parents, or any other details providing any objective basis for concluding that Student A\u2019s parents posed a genuine threat to her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Perhaps most troubling is that, to the extent that the guidance counselors did offer anything more than the vague conclusions recited above, their testimony does not support a finding that Student A had a legitimate fear <em>of her parents </em>finding out that she was pregnant. McKaig herself testified that \u201c[t]he concern from the student was if the parent \u2014 if the <em>brother </em>had found out the girl was sexually active with the boy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The other guidance counselor also stated that, at the school staff meeting, \u201c[w]e talked about there was a brother and so we did go into some detail about\u201d the safety concerns within her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">This testimony indicates that the purported safety concerns had nothing to do with the parents finding out that Student A was pregnant or potentially getting an abortion, but were concerns that her brother might have hurt her boyfriend if the brother found out that she was sexually active. Based on this testimony, the local board could reasonably have found that the justification for McKaig\u2019s actions amounted to nothing more than a misguided subjective belief on her part that Student A\u2019s parents could not be trusted to handle the affairs of their own family, including controlling the behavior of their son. Needless to say, such a subjective belief, which from all that appears was shared by no one in the school district hierarchy, cannot seriously amount to \u201clegitimate safety concerns\u201d justifying McKaig\u2019s breach of student confidentiality in order to prevent Student A\u2019s parents from learning of her pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Furthermore, it bears repeating once again that, even if the local board credited MeKaig\u2019s explanation for her actions, it still could have found that there was absolutely no reason for her to disclose to Keshen any identifying information regarding Student A. Whatever concerns McKaig may have had about protecting Student A could have been fully satisfied, without any need for disclosure of such information to Keshen, by McKaig recounting her concerns to the attorney generically and then simply informing Student A of what she had been told by Keshen, giving the student Keshen\u2019s telephone number, and suggesting that she call Keshen if she wanted to pursue the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">The majority observes that \u201c[t]he state board provided two additional reasons for its decision that the local board\u2019s ruling on confidentiality was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>clearly erroneous.\u201d Although it is true that the state board discussed two matters in addition to the \u201csafety\u201d rationale, it is not clear what significance the state board placed on these matters in arriving at its decision. Nonetheless, because, unlike the majority, I do not find the state board\u2019s reliance on the safety rationale persuasive, I briefly address these additional matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">First, the state board appeared to fault the local board for not making an explicit finding as to whether the petition for a restraining order brought against the principal was automatically sealed at the time it was filed on December 4, 2012, or whether it was removed from the public record only when the court ordered that it be sealed on December 11,2012. To support its decision that the local board did not make a finding on this point, the state board relied on the following sentence in the local board\u2019s decision: <em>\u201c[Ifi </em>this information was not sealed until December 11,2012, [Student A\u2019s] situation, and enough information to easily identify her was available to the public for a full week.\u201d (Emphasis in state board\u2019s ruling.) By focusing on the word \u201cif\u2019 in this sentence, the state board concluded that the local board had merely <em>presumed </em>that the petition was an open public record for a period of one week. However, a reading of the local board\u2019s full discussion of this issue shows that the state board erred in construing the local board\u2019s decision in this manner. The local board specifically noted that there was conflicting evidence about when the petition was sealed. It determined that the testimony of Attorneys Loughman and Sanford Roberts (who represented Student A in the bypass proceeding) supported the conclusion that the petition was sealed only when the judge ordered it sealed on December 11, while Attorney Keshen\u2019s testimony \u201cseemed to suggest\u201d that the petition was automatically sealed when it was filed. After describing other aspects of Keshen\u2019s testimony that it found troubling, the local board found that it was \u201cinclined on balance to put greater weight on the testimony of Ms. Loughman and Mr. Roberts on this point.\u201d Thus, despite its inartful use of the word \u201cif\u2019 (seemingly as a proxy for \u201cbecause\u201d or for \u201caccepting that\u201d) in the concluding sentence of its analysis of the matter, the local board\u2019s decision is amenable to the reasonable construction that, based upon its assessment of witness credibility, it determined that the petition was available to the public for one week before it was sealed. Because a reviewing tribunal must assume that the fact finder made all underlying findings necessary to support its ruling, <em>see In the Matter of Aube &amp; Aube, </em>158 N.H. 459, 466 (2009), and because this construction is both reasonable and supported by the evidence, the state board was required to accept the local board\u2019s decision on the matter under the deferential review of factual findings mandated by the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Taylor-Boren, </em>143 N.H. at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>The second matter discussed by the state board in the breach of confidentiality portion of its ruling concerned attorney-client privilege. The state board determined that Keshen \u201cwas bound by the attorney-client privilege and therefore prohibited from [redisclosing] the information\u201d she received from McKaig about Student A. But the local board did not hinge its finding of a breach of confidentiality solely upon what Keshen <em>did </em>with the information she received (Student A\u2019s initials, age, grade, and the fact that she was pregnant). Rather, the local board found that the breach of confidentiality occurred when McKaig disclosed this information to Keshen, who was not an employee of the school district, in the first place. Furthermore, contrary to what the state board apparently surmised Keshen\u2019s obligations to be regarding redisclosure of the information about Student A that she received from McKaig, it is undisputed that Keshen did in fact redisclose this information \u2014 to the court \u2014 when she filed the petition for the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Given the deference the state board should have afforded the factual findings of the local board, and because the local board\u2019s findings were supported by the record, I would reverse the decision of the state board regarding both insubordination and the breach of Student A\u2019s confidentiality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The majority assures us that its decision is based upon \u201creasoned application of legislative enactments and well established principles of judicial review.\u201d In reality, however, the \u201creasoning and principles\u201d relied upon by the majority are nowhere to be found. In particular, one searches the majority\u2019s opinion in vain for any analysis refuting the applicability of the <em>Lewis-Valenzuela </em>assumption-of-risk doctrine line of cases or the inapplicability of RSA 132:34 to the circumstances of this case. Whether the legislature should have created a privilege prohibiting school districts from disclosing to parents communications between a pregnant minor and school counselors concerning the pregnancy or possible termination of the pregnancy is a debatable point. What is not debatable is that the legislature did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>not do so; and neither the state board nor this court has the authority to decide this case as if the legislature <em>had </em>enacted such a privilege merely because the board or the majority of the court may believe that the legislature <em>should have </em>done so. Yet that, unfortunately, is the upshot of the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">As will be obvious to anyone reading it who is at all versed in the law, today\u2019s decision is <em>mi generis. </em>It is hard to imagine another situation in which a court would hold that a subordinate employee does not commit misconduct by filing a lawsuit against a superior because of a disagreement with the superior\u2019s work-related decision that is within the scope of the superior\u2019s authority, violates neither the law nor the policies of the employer, and has no adverse impact on the employee. As such, the decision represents another example of the phenomenon of casting normal legal principles aside when courts are confronted with cases that implicate the hot button issue of abortion. <em>See McCullen v. Coakley, </em>134 S. Ct. 2518, 2545 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (\u201cIn its zeal to treat abortion-related speech as a special category, the majority distorts not only the First Amendment but also the ordinary logic of probative inferences.\u201d). Because I cannot join the bandwagon of political correctness that provides the only justification for the majority\u2019s decision, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-9\"> At the hearing, there was a discussion about the fact that, because of Student A\u2019s age and legal inability to consent to sexual activity, her boyfriend likely had engaged in criminal conduct, and whether the school district had an obligation to report the conduct to the police. The discussion indicated that the boyfriend\u2019s age was a few months short of that necessary to render his conduct a felony. From this discussion, I infer that the boyfriend was slightly less than four years older than Student A. <em>Compare </em>RSA 632-A:3, II (Supp. 2015) (sexual penetration with a person, not the actor\u2019s spouse, age 13 or older and under 16 constitutes class B felony \u201cwhere the age difference between the actor and the other person is 4 years or more\u201d), <em>with </em>RSA 632-A:4,1(c) (Supp. 2015) (sexual penetration with a person, not the actor\u2019s spouse, age 13 or older and under 16 constitutes class A misdemeanor \u201cwhere the age difference between the actor and the other person is 4 years or less\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\"> It is unclear from the record whether Student A had more than one parent that was to be notified, but it does not matter for purposes of this case. I use \u201cparents\u201d in order to account for the possibility that Student A\u2019s biological father or other legal guardian may have been part of any notification by the principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> This would be an entirely different ease if the principal\u2019s decision had adversely affected McKaig\u2019s rights or status as an employee of the school district. In that circumstance, she might well have been'fully justified in challenging the decision by pursuing her rights under the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), including, if allowed by the CBA, initiating an action in court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> The majority disputes that McKaig \u201csued her supervisor because she disagreed with his decision,\u201d insisting that instead she \u201cbrought a TRO petition on behalf of a minor, who was granted significant [but wholly undescribed] rights by the New Hampshire legislature.\u201d This is little more than an attempt to elevate semantics over substance. The fact is that McKaig was the named petitioner in the lawsuit, in the same manner that a parent or guardian would be the named party in a lawsuit brought on behalf of his or her child or ward who, because of age or incapacity, could not bring suit on his or her own behalf. Of course, the fact that McKaig was not Student A\u2019s parent or guardian, and therefore appears to have had no legal standing to act in her behalf, makes the lawsuit she brought all the more unprecedented. The majority notes that the school district did not challenge McKaig\u2019s ability to act on Student A\u2019s behalf. But lack of standing deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction, a defect that cannot be remedied by consent or waiver. <em>See Libertarian Party of New Hampshire v. Secretary of State, </em>158 N.H. 194, 195 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\"> The legislature that passed a statute entitled \u201cParental <em>Notification </em>Prior to Abortion,\u201d and which established a confidential judicial proceeding by which the notice to parents that is normally required prior to performance of an abortion can be waived, will no doubt be quite surprised to learn that it also <em>sub silentio </em>created a privilege that prevents third parties not involved in the proceeding from notifying parents of their minor child\u2019s pregnancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-11\"> It is worth noting here that, unless he or she somehow becomes a part of the judicial bypass proceeding (by, for example, submitting an affidavit in support of \u2014 or in opposition to \u2014 the minor\u2019s claim that she is mature or that having an abortion is in her best interest), RSA 132:34 imposes no obligation of confidentiality on even the physician selected by the minor to perform the abortion. Rather, if such an obligation exists, its source must be found elsewhere, such as in the physician-patient privilege. <em>See </em>RSA 329:26 (2011); N.H. R. Ev. 503(a). Whether that privilege would impose an absolute bar against a physician disclosing a minor\u2019s pregnancy or intent to have an abortion to her parents, over the minor\u2019s objection, or, as with the school policies at issue here, grants the physician discretion to make such disclosure based upon his or her sound medical judgment, is a matter I leave for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b765-12\"> In its <em>amicus </em>brief, the ACLU argues that \u201c[interpreting RSA 132:34 as protecting the confidentiality of a minor\u2019s pregnancy status is also correct as a matter of constitutional law.\u201d To the extent that the ACLU\u2019s argument could be construed as asserting that Student A had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>a constitutional right to protect her voluntary disclosure to McKaig by going to court to get an injunction against the principal, none of the cases cited by the ACLU support the existence of such a right. Por the same reason, there is no basis upon which McKaig could <em>reasonably </em>have believed that the principal\u2019s disclosure to Student A\u2019s parents of the information Student A voluntarily disclosed to McKaig independently of the judicial bypass proceeding was unlawful, so as to support the thesis that McKaig\u2019s actions in bringing a lawsuit against the principal are protected, as the ACLU claims, by New Hampshire\u2019s Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, RSA chapter 275-E (2010 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2015). <em>See </em>RSA 275-E:2,1(a) (Supp. 2015). Not only is there an absence of legal authority supporting the ACLU\u2019s suggestion that Student A enjoyed a \u201cconstitutional right to privacy\u201d in the circumstances of this case, but the implications of such a privilege would be quite breathtaking. Normally a constitutional right limits governmental action only. I am aware of no circumstance, however, where the constitution itself, as opposed to a statute or regulation, would prohibit either a governmental actor or a private actor from disclosing information voluntarily provided to it by the person claiming privacy protection. If such a privilege exists, does it apply only to McKaig, her principal, and the school district, or also to Student A\u2019s boyfriend and other friends to whom she may have disclosed her pregnancy (perhaps upon their express or implied \u201cpromise\u201d to keep the information \u201csecret\u201d)? Does the privilege prohibit only disclosure to Student A\u2019s parents, or disclosure to anyone as to whom she is afraid the disclosure will jeopardize her physical safety or emotional health (for example, by causing her embarrassment)? The First Amendment implications alone of a court having the ability to enjoin such disclosures are more than a little troubling, not to mention the due process implications of interfering with parents\u2019 ability to access information bearing on their minor child\u2019s welfare that the child has voluntarily disclosed to persons other than the parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\"> The proposition that RSA 132:34 could be interpreted to bar the principal from disclosing Student A\u2019s pregnancy to her parents is at odds with the Child Protection Act, RSA chapter 169-C (2014 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2015). RSA 169-C:29 (2014) requires school officials and \u201cany other person who has reason to suspect that a child has been abused or neglected\u201d to report such abuse to the department of health and human services (DHHS). RSA 169-0:32 (2014) abrogates \u201c[the] privileged quality of [any] communication between . . . any professional person and his patient or client, except that between attorney and client,\u201d and provides that any such abrogated privileges \u201cshall not constitute grounds for failure to report as required by this chapter.\u201d Under the Act, an \u201c[a]bused child\u201d includes a child who has been \u201c[s]exually abused,\u201d which in turn includes a child under 18 who has been \u201crape[d].\u201d RSA 169-C:3,11(a), XXVII-a (2014). Because Student A was under age 16 and thus incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, she was the victim of statutory rape, in violation of RSA 632-A:4,1(c), and the principal and school district presumably had an obligation to report this fact to DHHS. Given that, upon receipt of such report, DHHS has an obligation to conduct a child protective investigation, <em>see </em>RSA 169-C:34, II (2014), and because it is wholly unrealistic to expect that DHHS could do so without Student A\u2019s parents becoming aware of the investigation, the privilege claim which McKaig and the ACLU advocate would effectively prevent DHHS from performing its statutorily imposed duties in circumstances in which a child under 16 does not desire his or her parents to know that he or she has been sexually active. Needless to say, there is no basis whatsoever for interpreting RSA 132:34 to compel such a result in circumstances, such as exist here, where a mandatory reporter learns of the minor\u2019s sexual conduct independently of the judicial bypass proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\"> To the extent the state board relied upon the safety concerns discussed in this section of the dissent as support for its conclusion that McKaig was not insubordinate, the discussion herein demonstrates that the state board had no basis for upsetting the local board\u2019s finding that such concerns provided no justification for her insubordinate conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> The majority \u201cfind[s] it ironic, as well as concerning... that the district asked the trial judge to grant the [temporary restraining order], and then, five months later, decided not to renew McKaig\u2019s employment based in part on\u201d that order. However, the record does not support the conclusion that, by assenting to the trial court\u2019s order, the district agreed that the parental notification law prevented the principal from telling the parents. Rather, Loughman testified that the district was concerned about its potential liability to Student A\u2019s parents if it did not tell them about her pregnancy; and it seems clear from the context that, after learning that the trial court had already granted the waiver of parental notification in the bypass proceeding, the district agreed to the restraining order in the hopes that it would provide the district with legal \u201ccover\u201d against potential liability in the event it was sued by the parents. Although this strategy by the district may not have been particularly courageous, it hardly provides a retroactive justification for McKaig\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b774-13\"> The majority expresses its disappointment with the \u201ctone\u201d of the dissent and its \u201cincorrect assumptions\u201d about the majority\u2019s motivations. The majority undoubtedly would prefer that my disagreements with its decision be set forth less bluntly, for then our differences could more readily be explained as a mere academic debate over some nice points of law. However, the fact is that the majority\u2019s decision is not supported by any recognized body of established law or legal principles, but is instead an exercise of raw judicial power in the form of an opinion crafted <em>ad hoc </em>to produce the desired outcome. It is understandable that the majority would be distressed when this is pointed out. But its discomfort provides no justification for me to \u201csugar-coat\u201d what has occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
