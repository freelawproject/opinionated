R. 11, filed by the State, is whether the Adult Parole Board (APB) exceeded its authority or otherwise violated the rights of the respondent, Jerry Roberts, when it paroled him to a consecutive sentence \u2014 the maximum of which had been suspended \u2014 but then refused to release him from prison upon his completion of the minimum term of that sentence. We hold that the APB\u2019s actions were not improper and we therefore reverse the order of the Superior Court (Anderson, J.), which granted the respondent\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">1 \u2014 1</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. The respondent was convicted of aggravated felonious sexual assault (AFSA) and sentenced to four-to-ten years at the New Hampshire State Prison (prison). The respondent also received a sentence of one-to-two years for related conduct; that sentence was suspended. The respondent began serving his four-to-ten year sentence in 2008. On April 1, 2013, the respondent was classified as a C-l inmate and resided in a halfway house at the prison. While at the halfway house, the respondent was arrested and consequently returned to general population status in the prison. Following his arrest, the State moved to impose his one-to-two year suspended sentence. The Superior Court 0O\u2019Neill, J.) partially granted the State\u2019s motion: it imposed the one-year minimum sentence, which was to be served consecutively to the four-to-ten year sentence, but suspended the two-year maximum of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">On August 15,2013, the respondent appeared before the APB, as he had served the minimum four years of his AFSA sentence. <em>See </em>RSA 651-A:6,1 (2007). (subsequently amended). At that time, he was \u201capproved for parole to consecutive,\u201d and his parole hearing paperwork indicated that he must have \u201creview prior to release consideration\u201d with the Administrative Review Committee (ARC). The respondent thus began serving his one-year consecutive sentence. On October 2, 2013, the ARC evaluated the respondent and recommended that he return to the prison\u2019s sexual offender treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Upon completion of his one-year consecutive sentence in August 2014, the respondent was not released from the prison into the community. Instead, he continued serving his original four-to-ten year sentence. The State asserted that the respondent was not released because he had not yet completed the required sexual offender treatment program. The respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he was entitled to immediate release from the prison because he had been paroled from his four-to-ten year sentence to his one-year consecutive sentence, and he had completed the one-year sentence. The State moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the respondent was not entitled to immediate release because the APB had not granted him \u201cparole to release\u201d from prison, but instead had merely granted him \u201cparole to a consecutive sentence,\u201d and thus the APB retained the authority to determine whether he should be released upon completion of the consecutive sentence. Following a hearing, the court denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, granted the respondent\u2019s petition, and ordered that the respondent be released from prison. Thereafter, the State sought certiorari review of the trial court\u2019s order, which we stayed pending our decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u201cCertiorari is a remedy that is not granted as a matter of right, but rather at the discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Petition of State of </em>N.H., 166 N.H. 659, 662 (2014); <em>see </em>SUR Ct. R. 11. \u201cCertiorari is available to review whether the trial court acted illegally with respect to jurisdiction, authority or observance of the law, or unsustainably exercised its discretion or acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously.\u201d <em>Petition of State of </em>N.H., 166 N.H. at 662-63. The issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly granted the respondent\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief, a determination that turns upon whether the APB\u2019s refusal to release him into the community upon completion of his consecutive sentence constituted \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>present deprivation of a protected liberty interest. <em>See Brennan v. Cunningham, </em>126 N.H. 600, 603-04 (1985) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">h-( hH I \u2014 1</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\">We begin our analysis by briefly reviewing the relevant statutory framework governing sentencing and parole, specifically considering the authority of the APB. The legislature has articulated the following as its goals in establishing the parole system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">It is the intent of the legislature that the state parole system provide a means of supervising and rehabilitating offenders without continued incarceration and a means by which prisoners can be aided in the transition from prison to society. It is also the intent of the legislature that the policies, procedures and actions of the adult parole board and the department of corrections relative to the administration of this system emphasize the need to protect the public from criminal acts by parolees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">RSA 651-A:1 (2007); <em>see also Knowles v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, </em>140 N.H. 387, 390 (1995). The statute defines \u201cparole\u201d as \u201ca conditional release from the state prison which allows a prisoner to serve the remainder of his term outside the prison, contingent upon compliance with the terms and conditions of parole as established by the parole board.\u201d RSA 651-A:2, II (2007). The APB is \u201cresponsible for paroling prisoners from the state prison.\u201d RSA 651-A:4, I (Supp. 2014). To fulfill this responsibility, \u201cthe legislature has granted broad authority to the parole board to enact rules regarding the conduct of parole hearings, the criteria used to evaluate prisoners who seek parole, conditions for parolee conduct, and the procedures for parole revocation.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>140 N.H. at 390; <em>see </em>RSA 651-A:4, III (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">There is no right to parole in New Hampshire. <em>See Baker v. Cunningham, </em>128 N.H. 374, 380-81 (1986) (\u201cAlthough any State legislature is free to provide that parole is a matter of right rather than a subject of discretion, the General Court of this State has not done so\u201d and, \u201c[i]n the absence of some provision grounded in State law mandating a prisoner\u2019s release upon proof of. certain ascertainable facts, there is no right to parole.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also </em>N.H. Admin. RULES, Par 301.02 (\u201cParole shall be considered a privilege, something to be earned rather than automatically given_\u201d). Rather, the grant of parole rests squarely within the discretion of the APB, and \u201c[w]e have held that the parole board\u2019s broad discretion to deny parole is not limited by RSA chapter 651-A, or by its administrative rules.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>140 N.H. at 390. \u201cAs long as the decision [to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>grant parole] rests upon . . . essentially discretionary determinations, a prisoner\u2019s interest in parole fails to rise above the level of a hope.\u201d <em>State v. Gibbons, </em>135 N.H. 320, 322 (1992) (quotation omitted); <em>see Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, </em>442 U.S. 1, 11 (1979) (\u201cThat the state holds out the <em>possibility </em>of parole provides no more than a mere hope that the benefit will be obtained\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The starting point for analysis of the specific issue before us requires us to consider the nature of the APB\u2019s act of paroling a prisoner from the sentence he is currently serving to another sentence ordered to be served consecutively to the first. As stated, the APB is tasked with paroling prisoners from the state prison into the community. RSA 651-A:4,1. When a prisoner is serving one sentence, the transition from prison to society is a straightforward one: he or she is eligible for traditional parole into the community upon completion of the minimum of the sentence. RSA 651-A:6, I. When a prisoner is serving multiple sentences, one or more of which is consecutive to another, however, this transition to society is no longer a one-step process: instead, the prisoner must first transition from one sentence to another before finally transitioning into the community. Faced with this situation, the APB has developed an intermediate step in the traditional parole process that allows prisoners to parole into a consecutive sentence upon completion of the minimum of a prior sentence. The effect of this practice is to restructure the order of sentences by allowing a prisoner to serve time on a consecutive sentence while continuing to serve time on the initial sentence, and thus potentially earn conditional release into the community more quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\"> Although no provision of RSA chapter 651-A or the administrative rules governing parole specifically authorizes the APB to grant parole to a consecutive sentence, neither do the statutes or the rules prohibit it from doing so; and, given the APB\u2019s longstanding history of exercising this power, we agree with the State that the legitimacy of this practice is now beyond question. <em>See N.H. Retirement System v. Sununu, </em>126 N.H. 104, 109 (1985) (\u201c[T]he long-standing practical and plausible interpretation [of a statute] applied by the agency responsible for its implementation, without any interference by the legislature, is evidence that the administrative construction conforms to the legislative intent.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>see also Appeal of Town of Seabrook, </em>163 N.H. 635, 644 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\"> The respondent argues that the APB, upon deciding to parole him to his consecutive and final sentence, could not then \u201ccontinue to hold [him] on the prior AFSA sentence after he ha[d] completed serving the consecutive one-year sentence.\u201d We disagree. As part of its broad discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>administer the parole process, the APB has the authority to deny parole altogether in appropriate circumstances. It thus follows that, within this discretion, the APB has the lesser authority to utilize the intermediate mechanism of parole to a consecutive sentence without thereby committing to release the prisoner into the community upon completion of that sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are likewise not persuaded by the respondent\u2019s additional argument that such a result <em>impermissibly </em>alters the ordering of the sentences as imposed by the court. Paroling a prisoner to a consecutive sentence necessarily \u25a0\u2014 and permissibly \u2014 has the effect of changing the order of sentences, ie., in consolidating the unexpired portion of both an initial sentence and a consecutive sentence; and no meaningful alteration results from a prisoner <em>continuing </em>to serve the unexpired portion of the first-imposed sentence after completing the consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The respondent also contends that the APB\u2019s act of paroling him to his consecutive sentence\u2019 entitled him to a revocation hearing before he could be \u201creturned\u201d to serving his four-to-ten year sentence. Again, we disagree. This argument is premised upon two incorrect assumptions: first, that a prior sentence is extinguished when a prisoner is paroled to a consecutive sentence; and second, that the act of paroling the respondent to his consecutive sentence gave him a liberty interest in conditional release upon completion of that sentence. Because the respondent\u2019s four-to-ten year sentence was not completed, and was not put on hold, at the time he was paroled to his consecutive sentence, he could not have been \u201creturned\u201d to his prior sentence, as he never \u201cleft it\u201d in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">More importantly, the parole-to-consecutive practice does not, as the respondent urges, invariably constitute a determination by the APB that the prisoner shall be conditionally released into the community upon completion of the consecutive sentence. Rather, \u201cparole to consecutive\u201d means what it says: parole to a consecutive sentence, <em>not </em>traditional parole to conditional release into the community. That distinction is critical because a prisoner\u2019s desire to obtain parole release \u2014 unlike his interest in remaining in the community <em>once released </em>\u2014 does not trigger constitutional protection against the deprivation of a liberty interest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">A decision to deny parole thus remains qualitatively different from a decision to revoke parole once granted. While the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>to revoke is characteristically circumscribed by the burden on the government to prove facts amounting to a violation of parole conditions, the decision to deny is discretionary. Therefore, though the State may not revoke without procedural due process, the decision to deny is not so circumscribed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><em>Baker, </em>128 N.H. at 381 (citations omitted); <em>see Greenholtz, </em>441 U.S. at 9-10 (discussing the \u201ccrucial distinction\u201d between parole release and parole revocation, and quoting Judge Henry Friendly\u2019s observation that \u201cthere is a human difference between losing what one has and not getting what one wants\u201d (quotation omitted)). Because the APB\u2019s practice of paroling to a consecutive sentence does not contemplate conditional release into the community, but rather is an intermediate step that occurs <em>prior to </em>parole release consideration, the APB\u2019s act of paroling the respondent to his consecutive sentence did not trigger a liberty interest such that the APB was required to hold a parole revocation hearing before requiring him to continue serving time on his AFSA sentence. <em>See Baker, </em>128 N.H. at 380-81 (no right to parole release in New Hampshire).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Our conclusion that the APB has the authority to parole to a consecutive sentence, while retaining discretion to determine later whether the prisoner should be released into the community, also furthers public policy. By not requiring it to commit to eventual release at the time it determines whether a prisoner can start serving a consecutive sentence, the APB may be encouraged to grant parole to consecutive sentences in close cases where it would not do so if that decision carried with it the requirement that the prisoner be released upon completion of that sentence. However, were we to accept the respondent\u2019s argument that the APB loses the ability to later reevaluate a prisoner\u2019s readiness for release because the parole-to-consecutive practice creates a liberty interest in a <em>future </em>conditional release upon completion of the consecutive sentence \u2014 an event that may not come to fruition for five, ten, or fifteen years, or longer \u2014 the APB might well be reticent to utilize this practice. The inevitable result would be a decreased likelihood of paroling a prisoner to a consecutive sentence upon completion of the minimum term of his or her initial sentence, thereby jeopardizing the practice\u2019s presumptive benefits to prisoners. In short, by allowing prisoners to serve a consecutive sentence concurrently with a prior sentence, and earn conditional release more quickly, the APB effectuates the legislature\u2019s goal that, in administering the parole process, it both supervise and rehabilitate prisoners without unnecessarily prolonging their incarceration, a beneficial result that we will not undo. <em>See </em>RSA 651-A:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In the alternative, the respondent argues that, even assuming that the practice of paroling to a consecutive sentence without automatic release at the conclusion thereof is permissible, \u201cthe habeas court properly found that [the respondent] had been \u2018paroled in the traditional sense\u2019 \u201d rather than paroled to a consecutive sentence. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In its order, the trial court concluded that, because \u201cthe APB ha[d] failed to clearly state that [the respondent] was being administratively paroled,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he \u201cwas paroled in the traditional sense to his one-year imposed consecutive sentence,\u201d and therefore was entitled to be released when that sentence ended. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court relied upon the APB Form, which states, under the heading \u201cParole Board Notes,\u201d that the respondent was \u201capproved for parole to consecutive, must have ARC review prior to release consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The respondent, noting that \u201cprinciples of due process require that orders relating to the imposition of criminal sentences be expressed in clear terms,\u201d asserts that, because there is no \u201cmeaningful distinction\u201d between a parolee \u201creceiving an order regarding the grant or denial of parole and a criminal defendant receiving a sentence from a judge,\u201d the same due process requirement of clarity of terms should also govern the APB\u2019s actions. <em>See State v. Fletcher, </em>158 N.H. 207, 209-10 (2009) (\u201cDue process requires a sentencing court to clearly communicate to the defendant the exact nature of the sentence as well as the extent to which the court retains discretion to modify it or impose it at a later date.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Even if we were to assume without deciding that this analogy is appropriate, our reading of the APB\u2019s form does not lead us to conclude that it provides support for granting the respondent the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\"> We interpret written documents <em>de novo. See Edwards v. RAL Auto. Group, </em>156 N.H. 700, 705 (2008) (\u201cThe interpretation of final judgments, like the interpretation of other written documents, is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>Accordingly, the respondent\u2019s suggestion, that we must accept the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the APB form because it represents a factual determination supported by the record, is misplaced. Based upon its plain language, we conclude that the APB Form was sufficiently clear, in that it notified the respondent that he was being paroled <em>to a consecutive sentence, </em>and that such action did not create a reasonable expectation that the respondent was automatically entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>conditional release upon the completion of his consecutive sentence. It states that the respondent would need ARC review prior to release <em>consideration, </em>thus indicating that, at the time he was paroled to the consecutive sentence, the APB had not yet considered him for release into the community. Because we conclude that the form was sufficiently clear to notify the respondent that he was only being paroled to his consecutive sentence, we reject his argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting the respondent habeas corpus relief. We therefore reverse its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-5\"> Although the State filed its appeal as a request for certiorari review, we note that the trial court\u2019s decision is a final order, which would arguably permit review as an appeal pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 7. In light of the facts that neither party raises this issue, the appeal was timely filed under either Rule 7 or Rule 11, and the basis of our decision is the trial court\u2019s error of law, we conclude that the specific mechanism by which the ease came before us is of no particular consequence, and we therefore do not consider the issue further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\"> By letter dated June 15, 2015, respondent\u2019s counsel advised the court that the respondent had been released from prison on parole. She asserts that, as a result, \u201cthe appeal is now moot as to him.\u201d In light of this letter, we directed the State to file a response setting forth its position as to whether the appeal is moot. In its response, the State contends that the appeal is not moot because, in light of the trial court\u2019s order that the respondent had been released on traditional parole by virtue of the APB\u2019s August 2013 order, there is an open issue as to the validity of conditions imposed by the APB in connection with respondent\u2019s subsequent release. The State also asserts that the issues raised in this appeal are of pressing public interest to insure the proper functioning of the parole system, and satisfy the exception to mootness for cases that are \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review.\u201d <em>State v. Carter, </em>167 N.H. 161, 164-65 (2014). On the latter point, the State cites a case from the Hillsborough County Superior Court-North, which presents a scenario similar to that involved herein, and raises the question of whether a prisoner who has been paroled to a consecutive sentence that is thereafter suspended must be immediately released into the community. For the reasons articulated by the State, we conclude that this case is not moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> We note that, in cases where the maximum of the consecutive sentence has not been suspended, as happened here, the issue of whether the APB can parole to a consecutive sentence, while retaining the authority to decide later whether to release the prisoner on that sentence, may have lesser practical significance because, regardless of whether such authority exists, the APB would have discretion to decide whether the prisoner should be granted parole to release <em>on the consecutive sentence </em>upon completion of the minimum term of that sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b38-9\"> By \u201cadministrative parole,\u201d the trial court apparently meant to describe a kind of parole, such as parole to a consecutive sentence, in which the prisoner is not entitled to automatic release at some point in the future. We are advised by the State that the APB does not utilize the term \u201cadministrative parole\u201d to describe the practice of parole to a consecutive 'sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
