On appeal, the petitioner argues that the trial court erred when it determined that she lacked standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage to the Trust, and when it declined to enjoin the foreclosure, notwithstanding her assertion that she had a homestead right. <em>See </em>RSA 480:1 (2013) (amended 2015). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The parties do not dispute the following facts. The subject property was originally purchased by the petitioner\u2019s husband in August 2001. In 2003, the petitioner and her husband granted a mortgage on the property to New Century Mortgage Corporation. In 2004, the petitioner\u2019s husband refinanced the mortgage with a mortgage loan from First Franklin Financial Corporation. In February 2007, the petitioner\u2019s husband filed for bankruptcy. Although the property had been conveyed between the petitioner and her husband on multiple occasions before the bankruptcy filing, when he filed for bankruptcy, only the petitioner\u2019s husband held title to the property by quitclaim deed. In May 2009, the mortgage was assigned to \u201cDeutsche Bank Nation Trust, as Trustee for FFLMT Trust 2005-FF2 Mortgage Pass-through Certificates, Series 2005 FF2.\u201d This initial assignment was subsequently corrected. The corrective assignment, dated April 15, 2013, identifies the Trust as the assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On July 2, 2013, the petitioner and her husband divorced. Shortly thereafter, the petitioner obtained the property \u2014 by quitclaim deed. On July 11, 2013, the Trust began foreclosure proceedings pursuant to RSA 479:25 (2013). The foreclosure sale was scheduled for December 13, 2013; however, the petitioner obtained a court order temporarily enjoining the sale. That order remains in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Thereafter, the Trust moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it holds both the note and the mortgage and is entitled to enforce the same. The trial court ruled in favor of the Trust, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Camire v. Gunstock Area Comm\u2019n, </em>166 N.H. 374, 376 (2014). If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\n<em>I. Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We first address whether the petitioner has standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage to the Trust. Under New Hampshire law, \u201c[a] debtor may, generally, assert against an assignee... any matters rendering the assignment absolutely invalid or ineffective, .. . but, if the assignment is effective to pass legal title, the debtor cannot interpose defects or objections which merely render the assignment voidable at the election of the assignor or those standing in his shoes.\u201d <em>Woodstock Soapstone Co. v. Carleton, </em>133 N.H. 809, 817 (1991) (quotation and emphases omitted). The petitioner is not the debtor, but asserts that because she is the homeowner, she has the same rights to challenge the assignment as the actual debtor, her ex-husband. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that the petitioner stands in the place of her ex-husband. Thus, with this assumption, whether the petitioner has standing to challenge the assignment turns upon whether the assignment is void or only voidable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The petitioner argues that the assignment is void because the Trust did not comply with its Pooling and Servicing Agreement (PSA). She asserts that the PSA, which is governed by New York law, requires the Trust to assemble all mortgages in its corpus by a date certain, known as the \u201cclosing date.\u201d She contends that the \u201cclosing date\u201d relevant to this case was in April 2005, and, because the assignment did not occur until May 2009, more than four years later, the assignment is void under New York law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law \u00a7 7-2.4 (McKinney 2002); <em>see also Aurora Loan Services LLC v. Scheller, </em>No. 2009-22839, 2014 WL 2134576, at *3 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 22,2014) (unreported). The Trust counters that the Trust\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the PSA rendered the assignment merely voidable, not void. <em>See Rajamin v. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co., </em>757 F.3d 79, 86-90 (2d Cir.2014); <em>see also Bank of America Nat. Ass\u2019n v. Patino, </em>No. 2014-03453, 2015 WL 2457886, at *1 (N.Y. App. Div. May 27, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Generally, a non-party to a contract governed by New York law lacks standing to enforce the contract unless the contract contains clear language evidencing an intent to allow enforcement by such a party, \u201csuch as language indicating that the non-party is a third-party beneficiary\u201d of the contract. <em>Berezovskaya v. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co., </em>No. 12 CV 0655 (KAM), 2014 WL 4471560, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2014). In the instant case, the petitioner is not a party to the PSA and does not argue that she is a third-party beneficiary of it. <em>See id. </em>Rather, she asserts that, because the requirements set forth in the PSA were not followed when the mortgage was transferred to the Trust, the assignment is void and the mortgage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>note never became property of the Trust. <em>See id. </em>In making this argument, she relies upon a few cases that have concluded that an assignment of a mortgage after the closing date of a trust is void under New York law. <em>See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Erobobo, </em>No. 31648/2009, 2013 WL 1831799, at *7-8 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Apr. 29, 2013) (unreported), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>127 A.D.3d 1176 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015); <em>Aurora, </em>2014 WL 2134576, at *3; <em>Glaski v. Bank of America, Nat. Ass\u2019n, </em>160 Cal. Rptr. 3d 449, 463 (Ct. App. 2013); <em>In re Saldivar, </em>No. 11-10689, 2013 WL 2452699, at *4 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. June 5, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">However, the weight of authority supports the Trust\u2019s assertion that the alleged failure to comply with the PSA rendered the assignment merely voidable and not void. <em>See Rajamin, </em>757 F.3d at 88, 90 (explaining that \u201cmost courts... have interpreted New York law to mean that a transfer into a trust that violates the terms of a PSA is voidable rather than void\u201d and citing cases (quotation omitted)); <em>see also Patino, </em>2015 WL 2457886, at *1; <em>Monchgesang v. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co., </em>No. 14-cv-262-LM, 2015 WL 1578920, at *8-9 (D.N.H. Apr. 9,2015). This is because, under New York law, \u201cunauthorized acts by trustees are generally subject to ratification by the trust beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Rajamin, 757 </em>F.3d at 88. \u201cThe principle that a trustee\u2019s unauthorized acts may be ratified by the beneficiaries is harmonious with the overall principle that only trust beneficiaries have standing to claim a breach of trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. \u201cIf a stranger to the trust also had such standing, the stranger would! have the power to interfere with the beneficiaries\u2019 right of ratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under New York law, because \u201ca trust\u2019s beneficiaries may ratify the trustee\u2019s otherwise unauthorized act,\u201d and because \u201ca void act is not subject to ratification,\u201d an unauthorized act by a trustee \u201cis not void but merely voidable by the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see Butler v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas, </em>748 F.3d 28, 37 n.8 (1st Cir. 2014) (observing that \u201cthe vast majority of courts to consider the issue\u201d have concluded that, under New York law, \u201cthe acts of a trustee in contravention of a trust may be ratified, and are thus voidable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The cases upon which the petitioner relies do not address, or even consider, the well-settled rule that a beneficiary may ratify a trustee\u2019s ultra vires act, thus making such an act voidable, rather than void. <em>See Berezovskaya, </em>2014 WL 4471560, at *7 (referring to <em>Erobobo </em>and <em>Saldivar); see also Aurora, </em>2014 WL 2134576, at *3; <em>Glaski, </em>160 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 463-64. Further, the principal case upon which the petitioner relies, <em>Erobobo, </em>2013 WL 1831799, at *7-8, has been reversed. <em>See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Erobobo, </em>127 A.D.3d 1176 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015). Additionally, the \u201cvast majority of courts analyzing\u201d <em>Glaski, </em>160 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 463-64, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201chave found it unpersuasive\u201d and have rejected its analysis. <em>Kan v. Guild Mortg. Co., </em>178 Cal. Rptr. 3d 745, 751 (Ct. App. 2014) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Thus, we join those courts that have concluded that, under New York law, \u201can action that violates the term of a trust agreement, such as a transfer of a loan to a trust after the trust\u2019s closing date, renders the transaction voidable at the election of either party to the agreement,\u201d and that \u201ca non-party to the PSA,\u201d such as the petitioner in this case, \u201cdoes not have standing to challenge such a transaction.\u201d <em>Berezovskaya, </em>2014 WL 4471560, at *8; <em>see In re Davies, </em>565 F. App\u2019x 630, 633 (9th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases and concluding that California Supreme Court would likely follow \u201cthe weight of authority\u201d holding that borrowers who are not parties to PSAs cannot challenge them); <em>In re Correia, </em>452 B.R. 319, 324-25 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2011) (debtors lack standing to raise violations of a PSA).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>II. Homestead Right</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We next address whether the trial court erred when it denied the petitioner\u2019s request that the court enjoin the foreclosure, despite her assertion of her homestead right. <em>See </em>RSA 480:1 (providing that \u201c[e]very person is entitled to $100,000 worth of his or her homestead, or of his or her interest therein, as a homestead\u201d). \u201cThe issuance of injunctions, either temporary or' permanent, has long been considered an extraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>ATV Watch v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Resources &amp; Econ. Dev, </em>155 N.H. 434, 437 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cAn injunction should not issue unless there is an immediate danger of irreparable harm to the party seeking injunctive relief, there is no adequate remedy at law[,] and the party seeking an injunction is likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, ellipses, and brackets omitted). The trial court retains the discretion to decide whether to grant an injunction \u201cafter consideration of the facts and established principles of equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437-38 (quotation omitted). \u2018We will uphold the decision of the trial court with regard to the issuance of an injunction absent an error of law, unsustainable exercise of discretion, or clearly erroneous findings of fact.\u201d <em>Dupont v. Nashua Police Dep\u2019t, </em>167 N.H. 429, 434 (2015) (quotation and brackets omitted), <em>petition for cert. docketed </em>(U.S. May 26, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The trial court determined that the petitioner was not entitled to a permanent injunction because she failed to establish that, if the foreclosure occurred, she was in \u201cimmediate danger of irreparable harm.\u201d <em>ATV Watch, </em>155 N.H. at 437 (quotation omitted). The court explained that the foreclosure proceeding itself would not result in the \u201cautomatic ejectment\u201d of the petitioner, and, thus, her \u201cright to remain in the premises is not jeopardized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>by the foreclosure proceedings,\u201d and \u201cher assertion of her homestead interest in the property is premature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">The petitioner does not challenge this determination directly. Instead, she argues that \u201c[ajllowing [the Trust] to foreclose without assurance that [she] will receive the benefit of her homestead right is unjust,\u201d and asks that we allow the injunction to remain in place so that she can be given \u201cassurances about how [her] homestead right will be preserved.\u201d She posits that \u201c[i]f the injunction remains in place, she could either remain in the home indefinitely or an order could be issued mandating that the [respondent] pay [her] for her $100,000 homestead exemption as a condition of the injunction being lifted.\u201d Proceeding in this manner, the petitioner contends, \u201cfulfills the interest of judicial economy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The petitioner\u2019s arguments fail to persuade us that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion or erred as a matter of law when it denied her request that the court enjoin the foreclosure. As the Trust explains, assuming that the petitioner \u201cbrings and prevails in a proceeding under RSA 480:8-a, the fact that the foreclosure took place\u201d will not impair her alleged homestead right. <em>See </em>RSA 480:8-a (2013) (empowering the superior court, \u201cupon petition of the owner of a homestead or the wife or husband surviving such owner, or upon petition of a judgment creditor and such notice as it may order\u201d to \u201cappoint appraisers and cause the homestead right to be set off, and a record of the proceedings being made in the registry of deeds, the right shall be established as against all persons\u201d). Nor will the foreclosure automatically result in the petitioner\u2019s removal from the home. Thus, we cannot say that the trial court erred when it determined that the petitioner failed to show that she would be in immediate danger of irreparable harm if the foreclosure were to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-6\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
