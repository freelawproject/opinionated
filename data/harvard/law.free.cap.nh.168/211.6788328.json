We affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings on the merits and reverse its imposition of a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">In 1990, Congress amended the Federal Clean Air Act to require the use of an \u201coxygenate\u201d in gasoline in areas not meeting certain national air quality standards. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(k) (Supp. 1991) (amended 2005, 2007). An oxygenate is a substance used to reduce gasoline emissions. <em>See Oxygenated Fuels Ass\u2019n Inc. v. Davis, </em>331 F.3d 665, 666 (9th Cir.2003). The amendment did not mandate the use of any particular oxygenate; it simply required that \u201c[t]he oxygen content of the gasoline shall equal or exceed 2.0 percent by weight.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(k)(2)(B). To implement the requirement, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG Program), which required gasoline contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ing an oxygenate of the manufacturer\u2019s choice. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.46(g)(9)(i) (2000). Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was one among several possible oxygenates. <em>Id. </em>MTBE is a gasoline additive that increases the octane levels of fuels. Metropolitan areas with significant concentrations of ambient ozone were required to use reformulated gasoline. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(k). Other areas, like New Hampshire, could opt in to the program to receive credit toward mandatory emissions reduction requirements. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(k)(6)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">New Hampshire joined the RFG Program in 1991, with respect to the State\u2019s four southern-most counties, effective January 1, 1995. Between 1995 and 2006, gasoline with MTBE was sold throughout the State. In 1997, employees at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES) became aware that MTBE could pose increased risks to groundwater. In 1998, studies from Maine and California raised concerns about MTBE. In 1999, DES adopted regulations setting a maximum contaminant level for MTBE in drinking water and groundwater at 13 parts per billion (ppb).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In 2000, the EPA advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">MTBE is capable of traveling through soil rapidly, is very soluble in water ... and is highly resistant to biodegradation .... MTBE that enters groundwater moves at nearly the same velocity as the groundwater itself. As a result, it often travels farther than other gasoline constituents, making it more likely to impact public and private drinking water wells. Due to its affinity for water and its tendency to form large contamination plumes in groundwater, and because MTBE is highly resistant to biodegradation and remediation, gasoline releases with MTBE can be substantially more difficult and costly to remediate than gasoline releases that do not contain MTBE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Advance Notice of Intent to Initiate Rulemaking under the Toxic Substance Control Act to Eliminate or Limit the Use of MTBE as a Fuel Additive in Gasoline, 65 Fed. Reg. 16094, 16097 (Mar. 24, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">In 2001, the Governor petitioned the EPA to allow the State to opt out of the RFG Program, but did not receive a reply until 2004. <em>See </em>Removal of the Reformulated Gasoline Program From Four Counties in New Hampshire, 69 Fed. Reg. 4903 (Feb. 2, 2004). In 2004, the legislature enacted legislation banning MTBE gasoline effective in 2007. <em>See </em>RSA 146-G:12 (2005) (repealed 2015). In 2005, Congress eliminated the oxygenate requirement and enacted a renewable fuels mandate to increase ethanol usage. <em>See </em>Energy Policy Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-58, \u00a7\u00a7 1501, 1504, 119 Stat. 594, 1067, 1076 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In 2008, New Hampshire sued several gasoline suppliers, refiners, and chemical manufacturers seeking damages for groundwater contamination allegedly caused by MTBE. Before trial, all defendants except Exxon settled with the State. After almost ten years of litigation, the case went to trial in 2013 on three causes of action: negligence; strict liability \u2014 design defect; and strict liability \u2014 failure to warn. After an approximately three-month trial, the jury found in favor of the State on all of its claims. The jury rejected Exxon\u2019s defenses that \u201cin designing its MTBE gasoline, it complied with the state of the art\u201d; that \u201cthe hazards posed by the use of MTBE in gasoline were obvious, or were known and recognized by the State\u201d; and that Exxon \u201cprovided distributors with adequate warnings of the hazards of MTBE gasoline.\u201d The jury also found that Exxon failed to prove that \u201cthe actions of someone other than the State or ExxonMobil (which were not reasonably foreseeable to ExxonMobil) were the sole cause of the State\u2019s harm,\u201d that \u201cthe State committed misconduct that contributed to its harm,\u201d or that some or all of Exxon\u2019s fault should be allocated to certain nonparties.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The jury awarded total damages in the amount of $816,768,018. These damages included: (a) $142,120,005 for past cleanup costs; (b) $218,219,948 to assess and clean up 228 high-risk sites; (c) $305,821,080 for sampling drinking water wells; and (d) $150,607,035 for treating drinking water wells contaminated with MTBE at or above the maximum contaminant level. The jury found that Exxon\u2019s market share for gasoline in New Hampshire during the applicable time period was 28.94%. Accordingly, the trial court entered an amended verdict of $236,372,644 against Exxon. The trial court subsequently awarded the State prejudgnient interest in accordance with RSA 524:l-b (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">On appeal, Exxon contends that: (1) the State\u2019s suit should have been dismissed on the grounds of separation of powers and due process; (2) the suit should have been dismissed due to waiver; (3) the State\u2019s claims are preempted by the 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act; (4) the State failed to establish that Exxon departed from the applicable standard of care; (5) Exxon did not have a duty to warn the State; (6) market share liability is not an acceptable theory of recovery; (7) the State should not have been permitted to rely upon aggregate statistical evidence; (8) Exxon was unfairly prejudiced in its ability to present evidence of fault on the part of other nonparties; (9) the trial court erred in deciding the State had <em>parens patriae </em>standing; (10) the State\u2019s damages claims for future well impacts are not ripe; and (11) the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on future costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\n<em>II. Separation of Powers and Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Exxon argues that the State\u2019s suit should have been dismissed on the grounds of separation of powers and due process. Exxon asserts that based upon the State\u2019s decision to participate in the RFG Program beginning in 1991, and the legislature\u2019s failure to ban MTBE before 2007, \u201c[t]he retroactive no-MTBE duty\u201d imposed upon it \u201cconflicts with bedrock principles of the separation of powers\u201d and \u201cdue process.\u201d Exxon also argues that the suit conflicts with the Oil Discharge and Disposal Cleanup Fund (ODD Fund), RSA ch. 146-D (Supp. 2014); <em>see </em>Laws 2014, 177:1 (repealing RSA chapter 146-D, eff. July 1 2025), and the Gasoline Remediation and Elimination of Ethers Fund (GREE Fund), RSA ch. 146-G (Supp. 2014); <em>see </em>Laws 2014, 177:3,1 (repealing RSA chapter 146-G, excluding RSA 146-G:9, eff. July 1, 2025), Laws 2014, 177:3, II (repealing RSA 146-G:9, eff. October 1, 2025). The State, asserts that Exxon failed to preserve its separation of powers argument because the arguments it raises on appeal were not made to the trial court, and that Exxon fails to identify where it preserved its due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The appealing party bears the burden of demonstrating that it \u201cspecifically raised the arguments articulated in [its appellate] brief before the trial court.\u201d <em>Dukette v. Brazas, </em>166 N.H. 252, 255 (2014). Generally, the failure to do so bars a party from raising such claims on appeal. <em>N. Country Envtl. Servs. v. Town of Bethlehem, </em>150 N.H. 606, 619 (2004). <em>But see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16-A (plain error rule). We have reviewed the record and agree with the State that Exxon failed to preserve its separation of powers argument concerning the State\u2019s purported public policy decisions, as well as its due process argument. However, we address, as properly preserved, Exxon\u2019s separation of powers argument based upon the ODD and GREE Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Before trial, Exxon moved for summary judgment on separation of powers grounds, arguing that the State\u2019s suit threatened to usurp the legislature\u2019s appropriations power because the ODD and GREE Funds \u201cembody the legislative choice regarding how testing and remediation should be funded\u201d and \u201cthis suit would allow the Attorney General to fund remediation in a very different way and create an appropriation outside of the General Court\u2019s purview.\u201d Exxon asserted that, because \u201cthere is no existing statutory mechanism through which any damages awarded to the State in this litigation could be specifically appropriated to the investigation, testing, and remediation the State requests,\u201d it would violate separation of powers for the court or the attorney general \u201cto order such an appropriation.\u201d Thus, Exxon argued, \u201c[i]n light of the existing funds and their structure, this suit implicates appropriations-related separation of powers problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The trial court denied the motion, concluding that Exxon had failed to establish that the legislature intended the ODD or GREE Funds to be the State\u2019s exclusive remedy. As to the ODD Fund, the court found that pursuant to the plain language of RSA 146-D:6,1, and I-a, the Fund \u201cis only authorized to disburse funds to owners of underground storage facilities, bulk storage facilities, or the land on which such facilities are stored\u201d and, thus, the statute did not demonstrate legislative intent \u201cto provide a remedy for the damages sought by the State in this litigation.\u201d As to the GREE Fund, although noting that it does not contain an explicit limitation upon who may seek payment, because the potential damages at issue in this suit far exceed the $2,500,000 capped balance of the fund, the trial court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">[i]t is reasonable to infer, then, that in creating the GREE Fund the legislature did not intend it to serve as the sole source of cleanup funds for any and all contamination event[s]. Its relatively small size indicates that it was intended to address a small number of isolated incidents at any given time, not a statewide contamination of the type alleged here by the State. Finally, the Court notes that neither fund claims to be an exclusive remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Accordingly, the court found that \u201cthe existence of these funds does not evince the intent of the legislature to preclude suits such as this one\u201d and that \u201cthe State\u2019s suit does not threaten to usurp the legislature\u2019s appropriations power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">On appeal, Exxon argues that the legislature \u201ccreated two detailed statutory schemes \u2014 the ODD Fund and the GREE Fund \u2014 to enable direct spillers to pay the often substantial costs of remediation,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is precisely when the legislature has established a tailored regulatory framework to address a particular problem that this Court has declined to make judicial \u2018improvements\u2019 to the democratically-enacted scheme.\u201d The State argues that its suit \u201cis consistent with the ODD and GREE funds\u201d in that the \u201ccaps on those funds, their purposes, and their structures confirm that neither was intended to replace recovery actions for tortious activity against manufacturers of dangerous products or to free manufacturers that withhold knowledge of a dangerous condition from liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Whether the State\u2019s lawsuit violates the Separation of Powers Clause of the State Constitution, N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37, because it conflicts with the ODD and GREE Funds, is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Cloutier v. State, </em>163 N.H. 445, 451 (2012). \u201cThe separation of powers among the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government is an important part of its constitutional fabric.\u201d <em>Duquette v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, </em>154 N.H. 737, 746 (2007). \u201cSeparation of the three co-equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>branches of government is essential to protect against a seizure of control by one branch that would threaten the ability of our citizens to remain a free and sovereign people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the Separation of Powers Clause, \u201ceach branch is prohibited . .. from encroaching upon the powers and functions of another branch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746-47. Nevertheless, Part I, Article 37 does \u201cnot provide for impenetrable barriers between the branches ... and the doctrine is violated only when one branch usurps an <em>essential </em>power of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Appeal of Local Gov\u2019t Ctr., </em>165 N.H. 790, 804 (2014). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature, as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>Statutory \u201cprovisions barring [a] common law right to recover are to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Estate of Gordon-Couture v. Brown, </em>152 N.H. 265, 267 (2005). \u201cIf such a right is to be taken away, it must be expressed clearly by the legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The purpose of the ODD Fund is \u201cto establish financial responsibility for the cleanup of oil discharge and disposal, and to establish a fund to be used in addressing the costs incurred <em>by the owners </em>of underground storage facilities and bulk storage facilities for the cleanup of oil discharge and disposal.\u201d RSA 146-D:1 (emphasis added). The ODD Fund allows owners of eligible facilities to apply for reimbursement of court-ordered damages to third parties for injury or property damage and costs of cleanup of oil discharges up to $1,500,000. RSA 146-D:6, III. The ODD Fund is financed by a fee on imported oil that is paid on a per gallon basis by distributors who import oil into New Hampshire. RSA 146-D:2-:3. As the trial court found, \u201cthe end goal of the ODD Fund is not to offset tort liability for Defendants but rather to provide an excess insurance mechanism for [underground storage tank] owners who are otherwise in compliance with all relevant laws and rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The purpose of the GREE Fund, a fund in addition to both the Oil Pollution Control Fund established pursuant to RSA 146-A:ll-a (Supp. 2014) and the ODD Fund, \u201cis to provide procedures that will expedite the cleanup of gasoline ether spillage, mitigate the adverse [e]ffects of gasoline ether discharges, encourage preventive measures, impose a fee upon importers of neat gasoline ethers into the state and establish a fund for the remediation of groundwater and surface water contaminated by gasoline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ethers.\u201d RSA 146-G:1, II. \u201cTh[e GREE] nonlapsing, revolving fund shall be used .... to mitigate the adverse [e]ffects of gasoline ether discharges including, but not limited to, provision of emergency water supplies to persons affected by such pollution, and . . . the establishment of an acceptable source of potable water to injured parties.\u201d RSA 146-G:4,1. \u201cNot more than $150,000 shall be allocated annually for research programs dedicated to the development and improvement of preventive and cleanup measures concerning such gasoline ether discharges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fund\u2019s balance is capped at $2,500,000. RSA 146-G:4, II. The fund is financed in part by the ODD Fund. RSA 146-D:3, VI(b); RSA 146-G:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We agree with the trial court that there is no language in either of the statutory provisions establishing the ODD and GREE Funds indicating a legislative intent to preclude the damages sought by the State in this case. <em>See also State v. Hess Corp., </em>161 N.H. 426, 431 (2011) (MTBE defendants conceded that the State may recover damages to test and treat statutorily defined public water systems). Accordingly, we reject Exxon\u2019s separation of powers argument based upon the ODD and GREE Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\n<em>III. Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Exxon argues that the State\u2019s suit should have been dismissed due to waiver. Before trial, Exxon moved for summary judgment, arguing, in part, that \u201cby requiring that RFG ... gasoline be sold in New Hampshire, with full knowledge that such gasoline would contain MTBE and with full knowledge of all of MTBE\u2019s alleged defective properties, the State cannot now be allowed to sue Defendants who thereafter complied with the State\u2019s demands and supplied MTBE gasoline to the State.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) In denying the motion, the trial court noted that, because Exxon did not assert that the State expressly waived its right to sue for harm from MTBE, Exxon could only proceed under an implied waiver theory. The court found that there were \u201cgenuine issues of disputed fact regarding the State\u2019s knowledge, [Exxon\u2019s] knowledge, and timing of this awareness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Following the jury verdict, Exxon moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. Exxon argued, in part, that it was \u201cunfairly prejudiced\u201d when the trial court instructed the jury on waiver in its preliminary instructions \u201cbut then refused to include that instruction in its final instructions or in the verdict form.\u201d In its order denying Exxon\u2019s motion, the trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">In its motion for summary judgment on waiver, Exxon argued that the State knew MTBE\u2019s characteristics but still opted in to the RFG program, thereby waiving any claims it had or would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>develop regarding MTBE contamination. However, the State disputed its level of knowledge. During trial, Exxon attempted to prove the State\u2019s knowledge by presenting witnesses that testified that MTBE\u2019s characteristics were widely known and understood thereby suggesting the State should have known about MTBE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">The State countered this testimony with its own witnesses explaining that the first time State employees found MTBE in a contamination site, those employees were unable to identify the compound and asked the U.S. EPA for assistance. The State also presented testimony that it did not become aware of MTBE\u2019s full nature until the State of Maine published a study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">This testimony goes to the issue of waiver but it is also relevant to the issue of [the State\u2019s] misconduct, and the Court gave an instruction on [the State\u2019s] misconduct. In fact, the Court instruction on [the State\u2019s] misconduct encompassed the same elements embodied in a waiver claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">On appeal, Exxon argues that, \u201cwith knowledge of MTBE groundwater risks, the State opted-in to the RFG program, participated in that program for years, repeatedly opposed banning MTBE, and ultimately decided in 2004 that continuing MTBE\u2019s use for nearly three more years was better for the State than an outright ban.\u201d Thus, there was \u201cample evidence to support a jury verdict finding waiver,\u201d and the trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to instruct the jury is clear error.\u201d Exxon also argues that the trial court\u2019s reasoning that a waiver instruction was unnecessary is erroneous, \u201cas misconduct and waiver are distinct defenses that are appropriately charged separately.\u201d The State argues that, at trial, Exxon adduced no evidence of express or implied waiver, that the special verdict form reflects that the jury rejected Exxon\u2019s defense \u201cthat the hazards posed by the use of MTBE in gasoline were obvious, or were known and recognized by the State,\u201d and that, in any event, the trial court \u201ccorrectly concluded that its misconduct instruction adequately encompassed Exxon\u2019s waiver defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Whether a particular jury instruction is necessary and the exact scope and wording of jury instructions are within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See State v. Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. 331, 334 (2005). We review the trial court\u2019s decisions on these matters for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Exxon\u2019s \u201cplaintiffs misconduct defense\u201d jury instruction as given by the trial court provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>If you find that ExxonMobil\u2019s product was unreasonably dangerous, ExxonMobil failed to provide a warning, or behaved negligently and that ExxonMobil is liable, you should then go on to determine if the State committed misconduct that contributed to cause its injuries. With respect to the State\u2019s alleged misconduct, ExxonMobil bears the burden to prove that it is more likely than not that the State committed misconduct in its use of the product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-3\">Misconduct includes, but is not limited to, abnormal use of the product, misuse of the product, <em>failing to discover or foresee dangers that the ordinary person or entity would have discovered or foreseen, voluntarily proceeding to encounter a knoum danger, and failing to mitigate damages.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We note that in its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) following the jury verdict, Exxon made the same argument regarding its misconduct defense that it makes on appeal regarding waiver. Asserting in its motion for JNOV that the evidence \u201coverwhelmingly proved ExxonMobil\u2019s affirmative defenses,\u201d Exxon argued that \u201c[t]he evidence at trial overwhelmingly proves that the State\u2019s misconduct contributed to its injuries. First, the evidence established that the State voluntarily encountered a known danger by opting-in to the RFG program with knowledge of MTBE\u2019s characteristics. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that the State knew that MTBE would be used in New Hampshire to comply with the RFG program.\u201d (Citation omitted.) In support of its waiver argument on appeal, Exxon asserts that \u201cwith knowledge of MTBE groundwater risks, the State opted-in to the RFG program [and] participated in that program for years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Concluding that the waiver and misconduct instructions are similar because they both address the State\u2019s knowledge and subsequent actions based upon that knowledge, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">Depending on the State\u2019s knowledge, the jury could have found that the State knew or shotdd have known the characteristics of MTBE gasoline and thereby either waived any challenge it is now raising or should have been held partially responsible for its own injury. In other words, because the jury was instructed on and considered the issue of the State\u2019s knowledge \u2014 that the State knew of MTBE and used it anyway \u2014 the jury also considered whether the State waived any claims about MTBE contamination risks by knowingly using MTBE. The jury nonetheless rejected this theory. Thus, Exxon was not entitled to an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>waiver instruction because the plaintiff\u2019s misconduct instruction encompassed this affirmative defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that there was enough evidence for Exxon\u2019s implied waiver defense to go to the jury, we hold that any error was harmless given the jury\u2019s finding that the State did not commit misconduct that contributed to its harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>IV. Federal Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Exxon argues that the State\u2019s claims are preempted by the Federal Clean Air Act. Before trial, Exxon moved for summary judgment, arguing that Congress and the EPA \u201ctook actions providing that federal requirements were to be met by allowing refiners to choose MTBE as an additive to gasoline,\u201d and that \u201cState law is preempted where it seeks to ban an action that federal law affirmatively chooses to make available to state actors.\u201d The trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s tort claims present an obstacle to the federal purpose of the Clean Air Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Noting that \u201c[o]n numerous occasions, courts throughout the United States have considered whether the [Clean Air Act] preempts state tort law claims regarding the use of MTBE,\u201d the trial court applied the reasoning of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The trial court explained that Exxon\u2019s arguments</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">are essentially identical to those made by the defendants during <em>In re MTBE Products Liability Litigation. </em>Here, the Defendants claim that the federal regulation deliberately provided manufacturers with a range of oxygenate choices and the choice was designed to further the regulation\u2019s objectives. The Defendants further argue that Congress and the EPA stressed the importance of MTBE as a choice and encouraged its use. Finally, they point to the lengthy legislative history of the [Clean Air Act] to support their arguments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-10\"><em>See In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Products, </em>457 F.

The trial court concluded that \u201c[l]ike the defendants [in <em>MTBE </em>Products], the Defendants here have failed to prove that the State\u2019s tort law claims are preempted by the [Clean Air Act], and their use of the legislative history is irrelevant due to the unambiguous language of the [Act].</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Exxon moved for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, based in part upon its assertion that the evidence presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cdemonstrates that the State\u2019s claims are preempted based on the Clean Air Act\u2019s requirement that gasoline contain an oxygenate and the factual evidence demonstrating that no feasible alternative oxygenate existed sufficient to meet the requirements of RFG in New Hampshire.\u201d Noting that Exxon\u2019s argument \u201cis presented in a highly summary fashion,\u201d the trial court declined to revisit the preemption claim and relied upon its earlier decision denying Exxon\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">After the jury verdict, Exxon moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial arguing, in part, that the trial court \u201cfailed to instruct the jury on ExxonMobil\u2019s affirmative defense of preemption or include it in the verdict form.\u201d According to Exxon, the trial court erred because \u201cthere were sufficient facts\u201d to support its argument \u201cthat MTBE was the only feasible oxygenate for use in New Hampshire\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe State\u2019s claim would be preempted because ExxonMobil was required to use an oxygenate under the Clean Air Act Amendments.\u201d Exxon asserted also that \u201cas a matter of law, the State\u2019s claims were preempted . . . because Congress specifically intended for refiners to be able to choose among oxygenates, including MTBE, to comply with the RFG program and eliminating MTBE would have interfered with the goals of the [Act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Noting that \u201c[t]he preemption argument Exxon raises directly alleges the argument it raised pretrial and in its directed verdict motion,\u201d the trial court denied the motion. The court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">[t]o the extent Exxon argues the jury should have been instructed on preemption in order to find facts from which the Court could further evaluate preemption, the Court considered and rejected this argument in its [order denying Exxon\u2019s motion for a directed verdict]. Even assuming New Hampshire courts would adopt this view of preemption, there are no facts to support Exxon\u2019s theory. Exxon alleges the State\u2019s claims are preempted by the federal Clean Air Act and its RFG program. The Court rejected this legal argument. There are no facts that a jury could find that would alter the legal analysis this Court already undertook.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">On appeal, Exxon argues that a state tort duty holding it liable for supplying MTBE is preempted by the Clean Air Act, \u201cparticularly because Exxon had no safer, feasible alternative to MTBE at the time.\u201d According to Exxon, \u201c[preemption here follows <em>a fortiori </em>from\u201d <em>Geier v.

Automated Medical Labs., </em>471 U.S. 707, 713 (1985). First, within constitutional limits, \u201cCongress is empowered to pre-empt state law by so stating in express terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the absence of express pre-emptive language, Congress\u2019 intent to pre-empt all state law in a particular area may be inferred where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for supplementary state regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u201cEven where Congress has not completely displaced state regulation in a specific area, state law is nullified to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This \u201cconflict preemption\u201d arises when \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility, or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Exxon relies upon the so-called \u201cobstacle branch\u201d of conflict preemption \u2014 that state law \u201cstand[s] as an obstacle to the accomplish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Arizona, </em>132 S.

The RFG Program required gasoline used in specific geographic areas to have a minimum oxygen content, achieved by the addition of an oxygenate of the manufacturer\u2019s choice. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7545(k)(2)(B), (m)(2); <em>see also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.46(g)(9)(i). After the passage of the amendments, the EPA certified various blends of gasoline for use in the RFG Program, including gasoline containing MTBE, but did not mandate the use of any one oxygenate. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">the 1990 Amendments did not require, either expressly or implicitly, that Exxon use MTBE. Although the 1990 Amendments required that gasoline in certain geographic areas contain a minimum level of oxygen, they did not prescribe a means by which manufacturers were to comply with this requirement. The EPA identified MTBE as one additive that could be used to \u201ccertify\u201d gasoline, but certification of a fuel meant only that it satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>certain conditions in reducing air pollution. Neither the statute nor the regulations required Exxon to use MTBE, rather than other oxygenates, such as ethanol, in its gasoline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>MTBE Products Liability Litigation, </em>725 F.3d at 98 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We disagree with Exxon that preemption here \u201cfollows <em>a fortiori\u201d </em>from <em>Geier </em>and <em>Williamson. </em>Those cases both considered portions of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208), promulgated pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. In <em>Geier, </em>a 1984 version of FMVSS 208 required manufacturers to equip their vehicles with passive restraint systems, but gave manufacturers a choice among several different passive restraint systems, including airbags and automatic seatbelts. <em>Geier, </em>529 U.S. at 864-65, 875. The question before the United States Supreme Court was whether the Act, together with the regulation, preempted a state tort suit that would have held a manufacturer liable for not installing <em>airbags. See id. </em>at 865. In determining whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicted with federal law, the Court considered whether the state law stood as an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the objectives of the federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 886. After examining the regulation, including its history, the promulgating agency\u2019s contemporaneous explanation of its objectives, and the agency\u2019s current views of the regulation\u2019s preemptive effect, the Court concluded that giving auto manufacturers a choice among different kinds of passive restraint devices was a significant objective of the federal regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 874-83. Because the tort suit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of that objective in that the suit would have deprived the manufacturers of the choice among passive restraint systems that the federal regulation gave them, the Court found the state tort suit preempted. <em>Id. </em>at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In <em>Williamson, </em>the Supreme Court considered a 1989 version of FMVSS 208 requiring that auto manufacturers install seatbelts on the rear seats of passenger vehicles. <em>Williamson, </em>562 U.S. at 326. The law required manufacturers to install lap-and-shoulder belts on seats next to a vehicle\u2019s doors or frames but gave them a choice of installing either simple lap belts or lap-and-shoulder belts on rear inner seats. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that like the regulation in <em>Geier, </em>the regulation at issue before it left the manufacturer with a choice and, like the tort suit in <em>Geier, </em>the tort suit at issue would restrict that choice. <em>Id. </em>at 332. However, after reviewing the history of the regulation before it, including the agency\u2019s explanation of the reasons for not requiring lap-and-shoulder belts for rear inner seats and the Solicitor General\u2019s representations of the agency\u2019s views, the Court concluded that providing manufacturers with this seatbelt choice was not a significant objective of the federal regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 334-36. Thus, the Court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>that because the choice of the type of restraint was not a significant regulatory objective, the state tort suit was not preempted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Exxon does not point to any part of the Clean Air Act or its legislative history that supports a conclusion that the choice among oxygenate options was a significant objective of the federal law. Indeed, \u201c[t]he [Clean Air Act] itself contains no language mandating that [Exxon] have a choice among oxygenates.\u201d <em>In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Products, </em>457 F. Supp. 2d at 336-37. Unlike <em>Geier, </em>in which the federal regulation deliberately provided the manufacturer with a range of choices among different passive restraint devices, \u201c[h]ere, the choice of oxygenate options is a means towards improving air quality, and the existence of the choice itself is not critical to furthering that goal.\u201d <em>MTBE Products Liability Litigation, </em>725 F.3d at 98 n.15. <em>\u201cGeier </em>does not stand... for the proposition that any time an agency gives manufacturers a choice between two or more options, a tort suit that imposes liability on the basis of one of the options is an obstacle to the achievement of a federal regulatory objective and may be pre-empted.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>562 U.S. at 337 <em>(Sotomayor, </em>J.,' concurring). Rather, \u201ca conflict results only when [the regulation] . . . does not just set out options for compliance, but also provides that the regulated parties must remain free to choose among those options.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We reject Exxon\u2019s argument that \u201c[d]espite ample evidence that there was no safer, feasible alternative to MTBE,\u201d the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on this issue was error because \u201cpreemption questions can be informed by questions of fact.\u201d Exxon asserts that \u201c[a]t the summary judgment stage, the [trial court] rejected the purely legal argument that the State\u2019s claims would be preempted even if there were safer, feasible alternatives, but later . . . refused to consider the different and fact-dependent question whether preemption would apply if Exxon had no safer, feasible alternative.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The record shows, however, that Exxon\u2019s proposed jury instruction did not ask the jury to find whether there was <em>no safer feasible alternative </em>to MTBE. Rather, the proposed instruction asked \u201cwhether prohibiting the use of MTBE in gasoline during the period at issue here <em>would have resulted in delays and increased costs </em>to the expansion of the federal RFG program,\u201d thus establishing preemption. (Emphasis added.) This position has been rejected as a matter of law. <em>See MTBE Products Liability Litigation, </em>725 F.3d at 103 (although legislative materials demonstrate that Congress was sensitive to the magnitude of the economic burdens it might be imposing by virtue of the RFG Program, \u201cthey hardly establish that Congress had a \u2018clear and manifest intent\u2019 to preempt state tort judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that might be premised on the use of one approved oxygenate over a slightly more expensive one\u201d); <em>Oxygenated Fuels </em>Ass<em>\u2019n Inc., </em>331 F.3d at 673 (plaintiff \u201coffered virtually no support for its assertion that the Clean Air Act\u2019s goals \u2014 for purposes of preemption analysis \u2014 are a smoothly functioning market and cheap gasoline\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">We agree with several other courts that have addressed and rejected the issue of preemption and MTBE. <em>See, e.g., MTBE Products Liability Litigation, </em>725 F.3d at 100-03 (rejecting Exxon\u2019s obstacle branch preemption arguments); <em>In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Products, </em>739 F.

Exxon asserted that, because the evidence presented at trial \u201cdemonstrated that the entire industry acted in the same manner in using gasoline containing MTBE in New Hampshire,\u201d there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>\u201cno evidence to establish the standard of care or what a reasonable manufacturer or supplier would have done, let alone that ExxonMobil deviated from any applicable standard of care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The trial court denied Exxon\u2019s motion, rejecting its argument that because the State did not present evidence regarding the care exercised by other manufacturers and refiners in the industry, the State failed to show that Exxon\u2019s actions were unreasonable. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">In fact, the State presented testimony from Duane Bordvick regarding the risk-benefit analysis his company, Tosco \u2014 another manufacturer during the relevant time period of this case \u2014 conducted. Bordvick testified that Tosco decided not to use MTBE because of the unique and increased risks Tosco perceived MTBE to have. This testimony not only directly contradicts Exxon\u2019s argument that the State failed to show the care exercised by other members of the refining industry, it also serves as some evidence from which a jury could conclude that Exxon\u2019s behavior in selecting MTBE as its RFG formula oxygenate and doing so without providing a warning was unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">(Citations omitted.) The trial court also rejected, as unsupported by the record, Exxon\u2019s argument that it could not have foreseen all manner in which the State\u2019s alleged harm occurred. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">The State admitted Barbara Mickelson\u2019s memorandum to Exxon that demonstrates Exxon received warnings against the use of MTBE \u2014 that MTBE would take longer and cost more to remediate than traditional gasoline spills. Other witnesses corroborated Exxon\u2019s possession of information regarding the expense associated with MTBE remediation as early as the 1980s. In this way, a reasonable jury could conclude that Exxon should have foreseen the harm the State now alleges \u2014 increased remediation costs of a different nature than those associated with traditional gasoline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Following the jury verdict, Exxon moved for JNOV, arguing, in part, that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record regarding the standard of care for a reasonably prudent refiner or manufacturer or what actions ExxonMobil took that breached a standard of care\u201d when the decision to use MTBE was made. Exxon asserted that it presented testimony showing that it \u201ccarefully considered the use of MTBE,\u201d including consulting with \u201c[a]t least nine different groups within Exxon\u201d to gain information, and that \u201c[ojther <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>gasoline refiners and manufacturers agreed with Exxon\u2019s assessment that the RFG program\u2019s requirements could not have been met without the use of MTBE in addition to ethanol.\u201d Noting that it had previously rejected Exxon\u2019s arguments in its directed verdict ruling, the trial court relied upon that ruling in declining to consider these arguments again \u201c[bjecause Exxon raises no new facts or law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On appeal, Exxon argues that the State \u201coffered no evidence to support the notion that a reasonable supplier in New Hampshire would never have used ..MTBE at any time\u201d and that \u201c[w]ithout a relevant standard against which to compare Exxon\u2019s conduct, the State\u2019s negligence claim ... fails as a matter of state law.\u201d According to Exxon, the State failed to establish that it departed from the applicable standard of care simply by marketing MTBE, asserting that \u201cthe evidence presented at trial showed that manufacturers overwhelmingly complied with the RFG program in the Northeast by using MTBE because there was no safer, feasible alternative.\u201d The State argues that \u201c[t]he record contains ample evidence that Exxon breached the standard of care,\u201d the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the duty of care, and the jury found Exxon negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Weighing the evidence is a proper function of the factfinder. <em>93 Clearing House, Inc. v.

In a December 1986 meeting with MTBE Committee members, including Exxon, the EPA expressed concern about MTBE leaking into groundwater because MTBE, \u201cwhich is very soluble in water, can find its way to drinking supplies (i.e. acqu[i]fers).\u201d Nonetheless, in February 1987, the MTBE Committee represented to the EPA that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">there is no evidence that MTBE poses any significant risk of harm to health or the environment, that human exposure to MTBE and release of MTBE to the environment is negligible, that sufficient data exists to reasonably determine or predict that manufacture, processing, distribution, use and disposal of MTBE will not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>an adverse effect on health or the environment, and that testing is therefore not needed to develop such data.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">After Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 to require use of an oxygenate in gasoline, members of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group that included Exxon, met with New Hampshire officials and encouraged them to opt in to the RFG Program. During those meetings, it was not disclosed that oil companies would use MTBE in RFG Program gasoline. Robert Varney, who was the commissioner of DES during the relevant time, testified that, although Exxon knew as early as 1984 about MTBE groundwater contamination issues, Exxon did not warn the State or provide it with any information about those issues before Varney recommended that the State opt in to the RFG Program in 1991 or before he recommended that it remain in the Program in 1997. He also testified that the State would not have opted in to the RFG Program if DES had known the information contained in Miekelson\u2019s 1984 memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In 1999, Exxon had identified more than 100 known contamination sites in New England, many polluted solely with MTBE. That same year, a study by Exxon on the costs of cleaning up MTBE noted that spills containing MTBE could be more difficult and costly to clean up because MTBE \u201cis more soluble [in water] and less biodegradable than other gasoline components.\u201d The study found that \u201c[c]ost increases related to MTBE are significant for ... New England\u201d due in part to \u201chydrogeologic site conditions which maximize the potential for MTBE to \u2018travel\u2019 and impact receptors (e.g., shallow groundwater, fractured bedrock, a high density of private potable wells).\u201d In 2000, Exxon employees observed in an internal communication that \u201cindustry has not demonstrated the ability to stop leaks and spills to the level required to avoid MTBE concentrations that effect [sic] the taste and odor in drinking water,\u201d that \u201cnon MTBE fuel leaks are more managable [sic],\u201d and that \u201c[b]ased on experience in [the] US, it is fair to assume that other places using MTBE will eventually find groundwater contamination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Duane Bordvick, a former senior vice-president for safety, health and environment at Tosco Corporation, a gasoline refinery in California, testified that in 1997 he made a statement on behalf of Tosco that the company had decided \u201cthat long-term use of MTBE was not in the best interest of\u2019 the company or its shareholders due to the \u201cpotential threat to California\u2019s drinking water resources and the associated liability ... for restoring water resources.\u201d He testified that that conclusion was drawn based upon several factors including: \u201cthe growing evidence on the threat of MTBE contamination and evidence related to the difficulty of cleaning up MTBE\u201d; \u201cthe cost associated [with] potentially having to participate in replacement of drinking water to cities\u201d; \u201cthe potential liability for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>of MTBE, associated legal costs, [and] potential lawsuits that may result\u201d; and the \u201clikelihood\u201d that those costs \u201cwould exceed ... whatever costs may be associated with no longer relying on MTBE in [Tosco\u2019s] gasoline,\u201d including refinery changes and other equipment changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">As the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">Negligence is the failure to use reason\u00e1ble care. Reasonable care is the degree of care that an ordinary, prudent manufacturer or supplier would use under the same or similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">The failure to use reasonable care may take the form of action or inaction. That is, negligence may consist of either: doing something that an ordinary, prudent manufacturer or supplier would not do under the same or similar circumstances; or, failing to do something that an ordinary, prudent manufacturer or supplier would do under the same or similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">A manufacturer or supplier has a duty to make inspections or tests that are reasonably necessary to see that its product is safe for its intended use and for any other reasonably foreseeable purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, we hold that the record contains sufficient evidence to support a finding that Exxon breached the standard of care by acting unreasonably under the circumstances. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\n<em>VI. Duty to Warn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Exxon argues that it did not have a duty to warn the government as sovereign, rather than as end user or consumer, of the characteristics of MTBE gasoline. In 2008, Exxon moved to dismiss the State\u2019s failure-to-warn claim, alleging that when the State claims that, as a bystander, it is a consumer of MTBE, and is therefore entitled to bring a products liability claim, it improperly expands the definition of \u201cconsumer,\u201d and that the State should be classified as a third party bystander. Because New Hampshire does not recognize bystander liability claims, Exxon argued that the State\u2019s strict liability claims should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">The trial court denied the motion, finding that the State\u2019s claim regarding Exxon\u2019s alleged failure to warn of its defective product had been properly pleaded. Based upon RSA 481:1 (2013), the court concluded that because the State \u201cholds the waters of New Hampshire in trust for the public,\u201d the State had properly alleged that \u201cthe defendants may be sought to be held liable for damage to the State\u2019s waters.\u201d The trial court rejected the argument that \u201cthe State\u2019s interests in its water are akin to those of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>bystander.\u201d Several years later, Exxon moved for summary judgment on the State\u2019s failure-to-warn claim, arguing that because the State was not a \u201cuser\u201d or \u201cconsumer\u201d of MTBE it \u201ccannot premise a failure-to-warn claim on [Exxon\u2019s] alleged failure to warn the State itself.\u201d The trial court agreed with the State that the issue had already been addressed in the prior order on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">In its motion for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Exxon argued, in part, that the State \u201cfailed to introduce evidence that ExxonMobil failed to warn \u2018users\u2019 of gasoline containing MTBE, instead focusing exclusively on ExxonMobil\u2019s alleged failure to warn the State as a regulatory entity, not as a user.\u201d The trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s arguments, stating that \u201cthe State is the party who \u2014 if a jury determined a warning was required \u2014 would have been owed the warning.\u201d The court explained that \u201c[t]he State, as the consumer and in its <em>parens patriae </em>capacity, was an end user of MTBE gasoline. This Court has previously ruled the State has standing to assert claims brought on behalf of the people of New Hampshire. Additionally, the State is a consumer itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">On appeal, Exxon argues that \u201c[t]he theory that there is a duty to warn the sovereign <em>qua </em>sovereign\u201d is \u201cwholly unprecedented, oversteps longstanding limitations of New Hampshire tort law, and raises serious First Amendment difficulties.\u201d The State argues that \u201calthough Exxon contends that the verdict hinges on the State\u2019s status as sovereign, the trial evidence clearly demonstrated that Exxon provided no warning about MTBE to anyone\u201d and that Exxon, thus, \u201cfailed to warn the State as regulator, the State as an end user, or the citizenry represented by the State as <em>parens patriae.\u201d </em>We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The General Court has declared that the State is the trustee over all of the State\u2019s water. Pursuant to RSA 481:1,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">an adequate supply of water is indispensable to the health, welfare and safety of the people of the state and is essential to the balance of the natural environment of the state. Further, the water resources of the state are subject to an ever-increasing demand for new and competing uses. The general court declares and determines that the water of New Hampshire whether located above or below ground constitutes a limited and, therefore, precious and invaluable public resource which should be protected, conserved and managed in the interest of present and future generations. The state as trustee of this resource for the public benefit declares that it has the authority and responsibility to provide careful stewardship over all the waters lying within its boundaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>RSA 481:1. As trustee, the State can bring suit to protect from contamination the waters over which it is trustee. <em>Hess, </em>161 N.H. at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In <em>State v. City of Dover, </em>153 N.H. 181 (2006), we determined that the State was the proper party to bring suit against the MTBE defendants, because it \u201chas a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health and well-being, both physical and economic, of its residents with respect to the statewide water supply.\u201d <em>City of Dover, </em>153 N.H. at 186. In addition, we concluded that the State satisfied the requirements of <em>parens patriae </em>standing because it asserted an injury to a quasi-sovereign interest, and alleged injury to a substantial segment of its population. <em>Id. </em>at 187-88. \u201c[A] state may act as the representative of its citizens where the injury alleged affects the general population of a State in a substantial way.\u201d <em>Hess, </em>161 N.H. at 433 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we held that the State has <em>parens patriae </em>standing to bring suit against the MTBE defendants on behalf of the residents of New Hampshire. <em>City of Dover, </em>153 N.H. at 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The jury was not instructed that Exxon owed a duty to the State as sovereign. Rather, the trial court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">In deciding whether there was a design defect in the product, you may consider whether there was a warning, and, if so, whether the warning was adequate. The warning is inadequate unless it makes the potential harmful consequences apparent and contains specific language directed at the significant risks or dangers caused by a failure to use the product in the prescribed manner. The manner of the warning is inadequate unless it is of such intensity to cause a reasonable person to exercise caution equal to the potential danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">The State has the burden to prove that if ExxonMobil had provided an adequate warning, MTBE gasoline would not have been used or would have been used differently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">A failure to warn amounts to a legal cause of harm when the failure to warn is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, and if the harm would not have occurred without the failure to warn. The failure to warn need not be the only cause of the injury, but it must be a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">We reject Exxon\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s failure-to-warn claim was improper because it was premised upon a duty to warn the \u201csovereign <em>qua </em>sovereign.\u201d Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\n<em>VII. Market Share Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Exxon argues that market share liability is not an acceptable theory of recovery and, that, even if it is, the trial court erred in applying market share liability in this case. Several years before trial, Exxon sought an order requiring the State to specify \u201cwhich Defendants it seeks to hold liable for the damages,\u201d \u201cwhat damages it seeks to recover from those Defendants and when and how the damages occurred,\u201d and \u201cthe legal theory for holding those Defendants liable for the damages.\u201d (Quotations omitted.) The trial court denied the motion, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">requiring the State to allege specifically which defendant caused each injury would create an impossible burden given the allegations of commingling of MTBE and the asserted indivisible injury to the State of New Hampshire\u2019s water supplies. To mandate the State to establish more particularized causation would essentially allow the defendants to seek to avoid liability because of lack of individualized proofs where the gravamen of the claim is ... that all defendants placed gasoline containing MTBE into the stream of commerce, thereby causing [the State\u2019s] injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">To allow such a state of events would be to allow claims for tortious conduct for discrete, identifiable, and perhaps lesser tortious acts, but to deny claims for tortious conduct where the conduct alleged may be part of group activity which is alleged [to] have led to a common, and more deleterious, result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">(Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In a subsequent order, the trial court, recognizing that \u201csituations exist where a plaintiff may not necessarily be able to identify, specifically, which members of a group, who are engaged in the same activity, caused his or her damages,\u201d noted that courts \u201callow plaintiffs to prove causation through alternative theories of liability,\u201d including market share liability and \u201cseemingly specific to the MTBE cases, . . . commingled product theory.\u201d The court found that the \u201ccommingled product theory\u201d does not apply here because that theory \u201conly relieves the Plaintiff of its burden to prove the percentage of a particular Defendant\u2019s gasoline found at a particular site,\u201d and the court \u201chas already found that a specific site-by-site approach is unfeasible and unnecessary in this case.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court concluded that market share liability \u201cis a more reasoned approach to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">As the trial court explained, the purpose behind market share liability is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>[i]n our contemporary complex industrialized society, advances in science and technology create fungible goods which may harm consumers and which cannot be traced to any specific producer. The response of the courts can be either to adhere rigidly to prior doctrine, denying recovery to those injured by such products, or to fashion remedies to meet these changing needs. In an era of mass production and complex marketing methods the traditional standard of negligence is insufficient to govern the obligations of manufacturer to consumer; courts should acknowledge that some adaptation of the rules of causation and liability may be appropriate in these recurring circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">(Quotation, ellipsis, and brackets omitted.) The court noted that in determining whether market share liability applies in certain circumstances, the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability sets forth six factors that provide a general framework for analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">(1) The generic nature of the product; (2) the long latency period of the harm; (3) the inability of plaintiffs to discover which defendant\u2019s product caused plaintiffs harm; (4) the clarity of the causal connection between the defective product and the harm suffered by plaintiffs; (5) the absence of other medical or environmental factors that could have caused or materially contributed to the harm; and (6) the availability of sufficient \u201cmarket share\u201d data to support a reasonable apportionment of liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">(Quotation and ellipsis omitted.) <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 15 comment c at 233 (1998). The court found that in this case \u201cthese factors weigh heavily in favor of utilizing market share liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Exxon subsequently moved for summary judgment on the issue of causation, asserting that New Hampshire has not adopted the market share liability theory, and that \u201cthe theory is contrary to New Hampshire law.\u201d The trial court concluded, however, that New Hampshire recognizes market share liability. Citing <em>Buttrick v. Lessard, </em>110 N.H. 36 (1969), and <em>Trull v. Volkswagen of America, </em>145 N.H. 259 (2000), the court reasoned that \u201c[t]he New Hampshire Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed its willingness to provide plaintiffs with a less stringent burden of proof where they face a \u2018practically impossible burden,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c[gjiven this willingness, the court is confident that existing New Hampshire law supports the application of Market-Share Liability.\u201d Dismissing as unfounded Exxon\u2019s suggestion that market share liability \u201cis synonymous with absolute liability,\u201d the trial court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>[e]ven where a plaintiff proceeds under a Market-Share Liability theory, he must prove that the defendants breached a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from their products .... The requirement to prove that a defendant breached his duty to avoid harm is a separate and distinct burden. Only after a plaintiff makes such a showing is he entitled to a relaxed standard for proving causation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">(Quotation and citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Applying the six Restatement factors, the trial court determined that market share liability should be applied in this case. As to the first factor, the generic nature of the product, the court found that the State had alleged sufficient facts for the court to conclude that MTBE is fungible, <em>ie., </em>that it is interchangeable with other brands of the same product. As to the second factor, whether the harm caused by the product has a long latency period, the trial court found that the harm caused by MTBE was not latent because it travels faster and further than other chemicals. Thus, the court concluded that this factor weighs in favor of Exxon. As to the third factor, the plaintiffs inability to identify which defendant caused the harm, the trial court concluded this factor weighs in the State\u2019s favor because \u201cretailers commingled gasoline in storage tanks at stations, so it would be impossible to determine which of the defendants\u2019] MTBE gasoline was discharged into the environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The trial court found that the fourth factor, the clarity of the causal connection between the defective product and harm suffered by the State, favors the State. The court agreed with Exxon\u2019s general proposition that the gasoline market does not alone reflect the risk created and, thus, the court required the State \u201cto introduce market share data as targeted as possible (e.g. market share data specific to RFG and non-RFG counties).\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Noting that it is impossible to determine market share with mathematical exactitude, the court concluded that the experts\u2019 market data was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The trial court found the fifth and sixth factors favor the State. As to the fifth factor, whether other medical or environmental factors could have contributed to the harm, the court noted that Exxon had not asserted that other factors contributed. As to the sixth factor, the sufficiency of the market data, the court found that the State\u2019s experts had presented \u201cenough market data to allow the State to proceed\u201d on a market share liability theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Following the jury verdict, Exxon moved for JNOY, arguing, in part, that, for five reasons, the market share liability evidence the jury considered was insufficient for the jury to find it liable: (1) there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that Exxon\u2019s market share for MTBE gasoline was 28.94% because that figure measured all gasoline supplied in New Hampshire; (2) there was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that all gasoline containing MTBE was fungible; (3) no rational trier of fact could have found that the State could not trace MTBE gasoline back to the company that supplied it because, from 1996 to 2005, the State could identify the suppliers that caused its alleged harm; (4) the State failed to identify a substantial segment of the relevant market for gasoline containing MTBE because it only presented evidence as to \u201ca snapshot of\u2019 the wholesale market; and (5) the State failed to establish the relevant market at the time of its alleged injuries. Noting that Exxon had raised, and the court had rejected, all of these arguments before, and because Exxon raised no new law or facts to support its motion, the court addressed Exxon\u2019s arguments \u201conly for the purpose of further explanation and clarification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Considering Exxon\u2019s first and fifth arguments together, the court determined that \u201cthe State presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that all gasoline imported into New Hampshire was commingled with MTBE gasoline. From there, the jury could reasonably have assigned Exxon the share of the gasoline market that its supply represented.\u201d With respect to Exxon\u2019s second argument, the court concluded that there was \u201csufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that MTBE gasoline was fungible.\u201d As to Exxon\u2019s third and fourth arguments, the court noted that the State \u201cpresented evidence through various witnesses from which a juror could reasonably conclude that all gasoline in New Hampshire was statistically likely to be commingled with MTBE to some concentration. Thus, it was for the jury to decide whether it would rely upon the 100 percent figure [the State\u2019s expert] provided, or a lower figure.\u201d The court also observed that it had previously found the State\u2019s expert qualified, and that her testimony \u201cwas based upon sufficient facts and data; her testimony was the product of reliable principles and methods; and she applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d Finally, the trial court addressed Exxon\u2019s additional argument that, because MTBE gasoline could be traced to a supplier from the refinery, the State failed to prove its market share case. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">The State\u2019s theory of the case, as addressed in pretrial, trial, and directed verdict rulings, was that MTBE gasoline is untraceable once spilled or leaked; once it causes harm to the State. It is wholly irrelevant that gasoline might be traceable to a particular supplier from a wholesale distributor or even the refinery because, as the State alleged, once the gasoline causes harm, it cannot be traced to a supplier, distributor, or refiner. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>heard evidence to this extent, and could thereby have found that the State met the requisites of relying on market share liability for causation purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Exxon also moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial arguing, in part, that the trial court erred as a matter of law by allowing the State to use market share liability. Exxon argued that the State \u201cshould have been compelled ... to proceed on a site-specific basis and rely on traditional causation to prove its claims,\u201d and that it was error \u201cto permit the State to use a wholesale supplier market share when it was undisputed that... the MTBE gasoline that allegedly caused the State\u2019s harm could be traced back to the wholesale suppliers, thus negating the need for or applicability of [market share liability] theories.\u201d The trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s arguments. As to Exxon\u2019s argument that the jury needed to find first that the State could not prove traditional causation in order to find the State entitled to rely upon market share liability, the trial court stated that market share liability \u201cdid not require the State to prove that it could not establish traditional causation; it required the State to show that it could not identify the tortfeasor responsible for its injury. The \u2018last resort\u2019 requirement focuses on the inability of the plaintiff to identify the manufacturer of a product, not the absence of alternative causes of action or theories of recovery.\u201d The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">During trial, the State presented several witnesses who testified that MTBE gasoline is fungible and commingled at nearly every step in the distribution network, thereby making it virtually, impossible if not impossible to trace from a spill or leak back from a contamination site to a retailer or supplier. This testimony tended to fulfill the State\u2019s burden of proving that it was unable to identify the specific tortfeasor responsible for its injury. The jury\u2019s verdict \u2014 finding that the State was unable to identify the specific tortfeasor responsible for its injury \u2014 was not conclusively against the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">On appeal, Exxon argues that the trial court erred in adopting market share liability in New Hampshire because it \u201cdeparts from centuries of New Hampshire law.\u201d Exxon also argues that \u201c[e]ven if market share liability would ever be appropriate under New Hampshire law, this would be a poor case to make that first jump\u201d and that the trial court \u201capplied the wrong market share.\u201d The State argues that traditional principles of tort law support the use of market share evidence, that Exxon has failed to show that market share liability was not warranted on the facts of this case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>that the trial court properly ruled that the jury was entitled to determine that Exxon should be held liable for its percentage of the supply, rather than the refining market.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">We review challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case. <em>In the Matter of McArdle &amp; McArdle, </em>162 N.H. 482, 485 (2011).

In <em>Sindell, </em>the plaintiffs alleged injuries resulting from their <em>in \u00fatero </em>exposure to the drug diethylstilbesterol (DES), a synthetic hormone that was marketed to women as a miscarriage preventative from 1947 to 1971. <em>Sindell, </em>607 P.2d at 925. In 1971, a link was discovered between fetal exposure to DES and the development many years later of adenocarci-noma. <em>Id. </em>Over 200 manufacturers made DES and, because of the long latency period and generic nature of the drug, many plaintiffs were unable to identify the precise manufacturer of the DES ingested by their mothers during pregnancy. <em>Id. </em>at 931. Plaintiff Sindell brought a class action against 11 drug manufacturers, alleging that the defendants were jointly and severally liable because they had acted in concert to make, market, and promote DES as a safe and effective drug for preventing miscarriages. <em>Id. </em>at 925-26. The trial court had dismissed the claims due to Sindell\u2019s inability to identify which defendants had manufactured the DES responsible for her injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In reversing that decision, the California Supreme Court expanded alternative liability to encompass what is now known as market share liability. Under market share liability, the burden of identification shifts to the defendants if the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case on every element of the claim except for identification of the actual tortfeasors, and the plaintiff has joined the manufacturers of a \u201csubstantial share\u201d of the DES market. <em>Id. </em>at 936-37. Once these elements are established, each defendant is severally liable for the portion of the judgment that represents its share of the market at the time of the injury, unless it proves that it could not have made the DES that caused the plaintiffs injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The court based its decision upon two considerations: (1) \u201cas between an innocent plaintiff and negligent defendants, the latter should bear the cost of the injury\u201d; and (2) \u201c[f]rom a broader policy standpoint,\u201d because the manufacturer \u201cis in the best position to discover and guard against defects in its products and to warn of harmful effects ..., holding it liable ... will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>provide an incentive to product safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. The court held it to be reasonable, in the context of the case, \u201cto measure the likelihood that any of the defendants supplied the product which allegedly injured plaintiff by the percentage which the DES sold by each of them ... bears to the entire production of the drug sold by all for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937. By holding each defendant liable for the proportion of the judgment represented by its share of the market, \u201ceach manufacturer\u2019s liability would approximate its responsibility for the injuries caused by its own products.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Several states have adopted some form of market share liability. <em>See, e.g., Collins v. Eli Lilly Co., </em>342 N.W.2d 37, 49-51 (Wis. 1984) (adopting a form of market share liability in DES case); <em>Martin v. Abbott Laboratories, </em>689 P.2d 368, 380-82 (Wash. 1984) (rejecting <em>Sindell </em>market-share theory of liability in favor of market-share alternative liability in DES case); <em>Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly and Co., </em>539 N.E.2d 1069, 1075-78 (N.Y. 1989) (adopting market share liability theory for a national market in DES case); <em>Conley v. Boyle Drug Co., </em>570 So. 2d 275, 285-86 (Fla. 1990) (adopting market share alternate liability theory in DES case); <em>Smith v. Cutter Biological, Inc., </em>823 P.2d 717, 727-29 (Haw. 1991) (adopting market share liability theory in action against manufacturers of blood product). In other jurisdictions, courts have left open the possibility of adopting market share liability in the future. <em>See, e.g., Skipworth v. Lead Industries Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>690 A.2d 169, 172 (Pa. 1997) (deciding not to adopt market share liability in lead paint case, but recognizing that the need to adopt that theory might arise in the future); <em>Shackil v. Lederle Laboratories, </em>561 A.2d 511, 529 (N.J. 1989) (decision \u201cshould not be read as forecasting an inhospitable response to the theory of market-share liability in an appropriate context\u201d); <em>Case v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>743 P.2d 1062, 1066-67 (Okla. 1987) (rejecting market share liability in asbestos case but recognizing that market share considerations were sufficient in DES context to achieve a balance between the rights of the defendants and the rights of the plaintiffs); <em>Payton v. Abbott Labs, </em>437 N.E.2d 171, 190 (Mass. 1982) (court might recognize \u201csome relaxation of the traditional identification requirement in appropriate circumstances so as to allow recovery against a negligent defendant of that portion of a plaintiffs damages which is represented by that defendant\u2019s contribution of DES to the market in the relevant period of time\u201d); <em>see Abel v. Eli Lilly and Co., </em>343 N.W.2d 164, 173-74 (Mich. 1984) (a \u201cnew DES-unique version of alternative liability\u201d will be applied in cases in which all defendants have acted tortiously, but only one unidentifiable defendant caused plaintiffs injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We disagree with Exxon that the trial court erred in concluding that New Hampshire would recognize market share liability as an alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>liability theory and that the theory is proper on the facts of this case. In <em>Buttrick v. Lessard </em>we adopted strict liability for design defect claims because requiring the plaintiff to prove negligence would impose \u201can impossible burden\u201d on the plaintiff due to the difficulty of proving breach of a duty by a distant manufacturer using mass production techniques. <em>Buttrick, </em>110 N.H. at 39. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">The rule requiring a person injured by a defective product to prove the manufacturer or seller negligent was evolved when products were simple and the manufacturer and seller generally the same person. Knowledge of the then purchaser . . . was sufficient to enable him to not only locate the defect but to determine whether negligence caused the defect and if so whose. The purchaser of the present day is not in this position. How the defect in manufacture occurred is generally beyond the knowledge of either the injured person or the marketer or manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\"><em>Id. </em>As we later noted, what was crucial to our policy analysis in <em>Buttrick </em>\u201cwas the recognition that the need to establish traditional legal fault in certain products liability cases had proven to be, and would continue to be, a practically impossible burden. This was the compelling reason of policy without which <em>Buttrick </em>would have gone the other way.\u201d <em>Bagley v. Controlled Environment Corp., </em>127 N.H. 556, 560 (1986) (citations and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Based upon this rationale, we subsequently placed the burden of proving apportionment upon defendants in crashworthiness or enhanced injury cases involving indivisible injuries. <em>Trull, </em>145 N.H. at 260. In <em>Trull, </em>we held that plaintiffs were required to prove that a design defect was a substantial factor in producing damages over and above those caused by the original impact to their car, and, once they had made that showing, the burden would shift to the defendants to show which injuries were attributable to the initial collision and which to the design defect. <em>Id. </em>at 265. That burden was placed upon the defendants because the plaintiffs would otherwise have been \u201crelegated to an almost hopeless state of never being able to succeed against a defective designer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We were persuaded by policy reasons not to place a \u201cpractically impossible burden\u201d upon injured plaintiffs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">By contrast, we have declined to expand products liability law in cases in which plaintiffs have not faced a practically impossible burden of proving negligence. <em>See, e.g., Royer v. Catholic Med. Ctr., </em>144 N.H. 330, 335 (1999) (strict liability did not apply to tort action against non-manufacturer hospital for selling defective prosthetic knee to plaintiff); <em>Bruzga v. PMR </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Architects, </em>141 N.H. 756, 761 (1997) (unlike a consumer who purchases a mass-produced good, strict liability does not apply to architect and contractor because the owner or user of a building does not face \u201cextraordinary difficulties in proving liability under traditional negligence principles\u201d); <em>Bagley, </em>127 N.H. at 560 (declining to impose strict liability in action by landowner against adjoining landowner for damages resulting from soil and groundwater contamination because \u201cthere [was] no apparent impossibility of proving negligence\u201d); <em>Siciliano v. Capitol City Shows, Inc., </em>124 N.H. 719, 730 (1984) (refusing to extend strict liability to owner and operator of amusement park ride when there was no indication that the plaintiffs suffered an \u201cunfair burden\u201d from not doing so because they possess adequate protection through an action for negligence); <em>Wood v. Public Serv. Co., </em>114 N.H. 182, 189 (1974) (no \u201ccompelling reason of policy or logic\u201d advanced to apply strict liability to electric companies in wrongful death action).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We have also declined to expand products liability law when the defendants could not have been at fault. <em>Simoneau v. South Bend Lathe, Inc., </em>130 N.H. 466 (1988). In <em>Simoneau, </em>we rejected the product line theory of successor liability, reasoning that \u201cliability without negligence is not liability without fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. Under the product line theory, a party that acquires a manufacturing business and continues the output of its line of products, assumes strict liability for defects in units of the same product line manufactured and sold by the predecessor company. <em>Id. </em>at 468. We refused to \u201cimpose what amounts to absolute liability on a manufacturer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 470, reaffirming \u201c[t]he common-law principle that <em>fault and responsibility </em>are elements of our legal system applicable to corporations and individuals alike\u201d and that such principle ought \u201cnot be undermined or abolished by spreading of risk and cost in this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Based upon the reasoning expressed in our cases developing products liability law in New Hampshire, the trial court concluded that it would \u201cnot rigidly apply theories of tort law where doing so would either be impractical or unfairly \u2018tilt the scales\u2019 in favor of one party or another.\u201d We agree with the trial court that, based upon our willingness to construct judicial remedies for plaintiffs who would be left without recourse due to impossible burdens of proof, applying market share liability was justified in the circumstances presented by this case. In addition to finding that the State had proven all of the elements of its claims, the jury found: \u201cMTBE gasoline is fungible\u201d; the State \u201ccannot trace MTBE gasoline found in groundwater and in drinking water back to the company that manufactured or supplied that MTBE gasoline\u201d; and the State \u201chas identified a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tial segment of the relevant market for gasoline containing MTBE.\u201d We have reviewed the record and conclude that it contains sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings. Given the evidence presented, the State faced an impossible burden of proving which of several MTBE gasoline producers caused New Hampshire\u2019s groundwater contamination. We hold that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion in allowing the State to use the theory of market share liability to determine the portion of the State\u2019s damages caused by Exxon\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Exxon argues that because the trial court found that there was sufficient evidence for the State to prove traditional causation, it erred by instructing the jury on market share liability. We disagree. To the contrary, the trial court merely found that the State could prove \u201cbut for\u201d causation as required under the market share liability theory. \u201cUnder market share liability, the burden of identification shifts to the defendants if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie ease on every element of the claim except for identification of the actual tortfeasor or tortfeasors ...\u201d <em>In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Products Liab., </em>379 F. Supp. 2d 348, 375 (S.D.N.Y.2005). Exxon argued in its motion for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief that, \u201c[f]or each of the State\u2019s claims, the State was required to provide evidence specific to ExxonMobil that gasoline containing MTBE from ExxonMobil was the but for cause of the State\u2019s alleged injuries and that ExxonMobil\u2019s conduct or product were a substantial factor in bringing about the State\u2019s alleged injuries.\u201d Exxon asserted that such proof \u201cwas utterly lacking . . . and the State has not identified any evidence that gasoline containing MTBE from ExxonMobil caused any of the alleged contamination in this case under traditional theories of causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The trial court denied Exxon\u2019s motion, reasoning that, from testimony presented by the State, \u201ca reasonable jury could conclude that Exxon was the proximate cause of the State\u2019s alleged injury under a traditional causation theory.\u201d Thus, the trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s argument that the State had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case on each of its claims. Further, the evidence established that MTBE gasoline is a fungible product, that the fungibility of MTBE gasoline allows it to be commingled at nearly every step of the gasoline distribution system, and that commingling prevents the State from tracing a molecule of MTBE gasoline from the refinery to New Hampshire so that the State cannot identify the refiner of the MTBE gasoline that caused the harm. Thus, because the State could not identify the tortfeasor responsible for its injury, under market share liability the burden of identification shifted to Exxon. Accordingly, the jury was instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>If the State has been harmed by a product that was manufactured and sold by any number of manufacturers and suppliers, and the State has no reasonable means to prove which manufacturer or supplier supplied the product that caused the injury, then the State may use market share liability to satisfy its burden of proof. Under market share liability, ExxonMobil is responsible for the State\u2019s harm in proportion to ExxonMobil\u2019s share of the market for the defective product during the time that the State\u2019s harm occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">Market share liability requires that the State . .. prove all the elements for negligence, or strict liability defect in design, or strict liability based on a failure to warn and that the State suffered harm. In addition, the State must prove the following: (1) it has identified enough MTBE gasoline manufacturers or suppliers in this case so that a substantial share of the relevant market is accounted for; and (2) MTBE gasoline is fungible, meaning that one manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s MTBE gasoline is interchangeable with another\u2019s; and (3) the State cannot identify the manufacturer or supplier of the MTBE gasoline that caused the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Finally, we find no error with the trial court\u2019s ruling that the jury was entitled to determine that Exxon could be held liable for its percentage of the supply market. As the trial court reasoned, because Exxon \u201chad or should have had knowledge of the characteristics of MTBE gasoline from [its] refining role[ ],\u201d a jury could find Exxon liable for MTBE gasoline it supplied but did not refine. The trial court explained that the jury was entitled to estimates of supplier and refiner market share and that both reflected Exxon\u2019s \u201ccreation of the risk within the State,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny figure within this spectrum would be an appropriate measure of the State\u2019s damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\n<em>VIII. Aggregate Statistical Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Exxon argues that the State should not have been permitted to rely upon aggregate statistical evidence rather than individualized evidence of particular water supplies and sites. Before trial, Exxon moved to exclude the opinions of three of the State\u2019s experts estimating the probability of MTBE occurrence in New Hampshire, the past costs of MTBE remediation, and the future costs of investigating and remediating MTBE sites. Exxon argued that these experts, Dr. Graham Fogg, Gary Beckett, and Dr. Ian Hutchison, \u201cattempt to draw statewide conclusions about MTBE detections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>and costs from small \u2018sample\u2019 datasets, extrapolating to the State at large,\u201d but \u201cfail ... to follow basic, well-accepted statistical and scientific principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Following a hearing, the trial court issued a written order \u201caccepting] the [State\u2019s] argument that using statistical methods is appropriate and, as a result, the state-wide proof model is acceptable and relevant.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201cthe use of statistical methods, assuming their reliability, makes the existence of the [State\u2019s] injury more probable than it would be without such evidence; likewise, it will assist the trier of fact to understand and determine both the existence and extent of the [State\u2019s] injury.\u201d Thus, the trial court concluded that the State\u2019s experts\u2019 opinions \u201care relevant to prove injury-in-fact and damages\u201d and that it would accept proof of injury \u201cthrough the use of statistical evidence and extrapolation, i.e. the \u2018statewide approach.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The trial court set forth several reasons in support of its conclusion. First, the court noted that the majority of the cases cited by Exxon are class-action cases, \u201cwhich disallow the use of aggregate damages across a class of plaintiffs.\u201d The court found those cases distinguishable because, here, the State \u201cdoes not seek to establish injury among several class plaintiffs through the use of an aggregate model, but instead seeks to prove <em>its own </em>injury through the use of statistics.\u201d Second, the court reasoned that New Hampshire\u2019s \u201c \u2018declaration of policy\u2019 confirms that an injury to both public and private waters within the [s]tate is an indivisible injury, allowing for the State to prove its claim upon state-wide proof.\u201d The court stated that under RSA 481:1, \u201c[t]he state as trustee of the waters for the public benefit declares that it has the authority and responsibility to provide careful stewardship over all the waters lying within its boundaries,\u201d and that this statute provides the State \u201cwith more than just a vehicle to demonstrate standing: the statute allows the [State] to prove injury to a single resource.\u201d (Quotation and brackets omitted.) Finally, the trial court reasoned that \u201cgeneral policy considerations support allowing the [State] to establish injury and damages using statistical methods.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">American manufacturers now mass produce goods for consumption by millions using new chemical compounds and processes, creating the potential for mass injury. As a result, modern adjudicatory tools must be adopted to allow the fair, efficient, effective and responsive resolution of claims of these injured masses. In a perfect setting, the [State] would have the resources to test each individual well over a long period of time and precisely determine its damages. However, if such a process were undertaken here, it would have to continue beyond all lives in being. The Court simply cannot support such a process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Moreover, requiring the [State] to test each individual well undoubtedly and unfairly \u201ctilts the scales\u201d in [Exxon\u2019s] favor .... Here, . . . the necessary additional litigation costs the [State] would have to bear would consume much of any recovery, making continued pursuit of the litigation fruitless. Because of these public policy interests, the Court finds that allowing the [State] to use statistical methods of proof is relevant to prove injury and damages in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\">The fact is that for decades, judges, lawyers, jurors, and litigants have shown themselves competent to sift through statistical evidence in a variety of contexts, from mass toxic torts to single-car collisions. Not only have they shown themselves competent, but also such evidence has become a generally accepted method for a plaintiff to prove his case. This Court is simply not persuaded by [Exxon\u2019s] attempt to frame this case as a class action. As a result, the Court rejects the notion that New Hampshire law forbids the use of a statistical approach to prove injury-in-fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">(Quotations, citations, brackets, and ellipsis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Exxon subsequently attempted to exclude the opinions of the same three experts on grounds of reliability, arguing that the State\u2019s experts used improper methodologies and, even when they used proper methodologies, they applied the methodologies incorrectly to the facts and data provided. After conducting a thorough analysis of each of the statistical methods employed by the State\u2019s experts, the trial court concluded that their opinions and methodologies were reliable and denied Exxon\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Following the trial court\u2019s ruling that the statewide approach was acceptable, Exxon sought an interlocutory transfer to this court. The trial court denied the request, finding that Exxon failed to satisfy the requirements of New Hampshire Supreme Court Rule 8(1). <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 8 (interlocutory appeal from ruling). In its order, the trial court noted that, despite its rulings otherwise, Exxon continued to assert that it is feasible to try this case on a well-by-well approach. As the court explained, under Exxon\u2019s approach,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">the State would identify a contaminated'drinking-water well and then trace the source of contamination to a particular physical location that leached gasoline into the ground. These locations will usually be businesses associated with gasoline, like retail gas stations and junkyards. From here, these entities can then trace the gasoline back through the product chain to the wholesaler and eventually the refiner. In this way, either the State or the retailers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>can spread the liability throughout the product chain. [Exxon] explain[s] that because all entities in a product chain would be liable for the State\u2019s harm, the State should be required to proceed on a well-by-well approach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The trial court found this method to be \u201ctechnically and scientifically infeasible.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">The State\u2019s case attempts to impose liability on manufacturers and refiners. Without decision makers selecting, marketing, and reformulating MTBE, it would never have been included in the RFG program and would never have been imported into New Hampshire to spill, leak, and evaporate. Gasoline imported into New Hampshire would not have been capable of contaminating the State\u2019s water resources in the vast, seemingly uncontainable way it has if it did not contain MTBE. The State has chosen to pursue the named Defendants because they created the initial risk that led to widespread contamination. Based on this selected class of defendants, product tracing is virtually impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Defendants themselves admit that tracing MTBE found in a contaminated well all the way back to the refiner is virtually impossible because MTBE lacks a chemical signature, linking it to a particular refiner. Additionally, a contaminated well, many times, cannot be traced to a particular retailer, making it practically impossible to trace MTBE to a specific wholesaler.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Following the jury verdict, Exxon argued in its motion to set aside the verdict that the statewide approach allowed the State \u201cto prove its private well and \u2018future injury\u2019 case using statistical extrapolations from experts about potential hypothetical impacts rather than particularized evidence of an actual injury\u201d and that this \u201cresulted in the State being able to avoid its burden to prove individualized causation with respect to particular private well impacts.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, stating that its prior rulings on this issue were rulings of law and that because \u201cExxon does not raise any new facts regarding these rulings and it does not contend that the jury\u2019s verdict was conclusively against the weight of the evidence,\u201d the argument \u201cdid not properly fall within the purview\u201d of a motion to set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">On appeal, Exxon argues that the trial court erred in allowing the State to prove its case on a statewide basis. Exxon asserts that \u201c[e]very other court to address the issue has recognized that MTBE tort cases depend overwhelmingly on individualized questions of law and fact, and thus are not amenable to proof on a mass basis.\u201d According to Exxon, the trial court \u201cbroke from these precedents\u201d in allowing statewide aggregate evidence. The State argues that the \u201cimmense scope of Exxon\u2019s pollution\u201d has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u201cdirectly affected a substantial portion of the State\u2019s population\u201d and that \u201c[t]he statewide nature of Exxon\u2019s tortious conduct, therefore, required adjudication on a statewide basis.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The State asserts that Exxon has \u201cmischaracterize[d] both the trial record and the relevant standards of review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We review challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case. <em>In the Matter of McArdle, </em>162 N.H. at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Exxon cites <em>In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Products Litigation, </em>209 F.R.D. 823 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), as an example of why \u201cMTBE tort cases depend overwhelmingly on individualized questions of law and fact.\u201d The trial court, however, found this and other MTBE cases involving a determination as to \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to be unhelpful, as \u201cthe facts of this case are very different.\u201d In contrast to the New York MTBE case in which the court dismissed full categories of class plaintiffs who had actually tested and detected no MTBE in their wells, the trial court noted that here, \u201cthe [State] has tested many wells where it has discovered the existence of MTBE. It merely seeks to extrapolate that information in order to establish further injury.\u201d The trial court agreed that \u201cif the [State] had not tested any wells or had tested wells and found no MTBE, the [State\u2019s] pursuit of a statistical approach would be fruitless.\u201d As further distinguishing the New York MTBE case, the trial court noted that, whereas in the New York case, the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations neither contained any statistics pertaining to MTBE detection rates for private wells nor established that the private wells were located in proximity to possible release sites, here the State \u201cprovided the Court with adequate statistical evidence through their experts,\u201d and, the State seeks recovery \u201con the basis of \u2018high-risk\u2019 areas only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">At trial, the State offered proof based upon expert testimony regarding 1,584 specific sites where MTBE has been known to leak and has contaminated the subsurface. The State also introduced scientific evidence through expert testimony that 5,590 drinking water wells serving 16,276 people are contaminated with MTBE at levels over 13 ppb, and that many more are expected to become contaminated in the future. Dr. Fogg used substantial data on MTBE contamination in the state to calculate statistically the number of drinking wells currently contaminated by MTBE. The State\u2019s experts expressly accounted for the fact that \u201cevery site is different.\u201d Exxon does not contend on appeal that the expert evidence was irrelevant or unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Based upon the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that the use of statistical evidence and extrapolation to prove injury-in-fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>was proper was not an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See Bodwell v.

CLD Consulting Engineers, Inc., </em>153 N.H. 793 (2006). Before trial, Exxon filed disclosures containing lists of several thousand non-litigants, including the names of gasoline suppliers, gasoline importers, foreign refiners, domestic refiners, distributors, trucking companies, and persons with leaking underground storage tanks. After reviewing these initial disclosures, the trial court found that they did not sufficiently allege fault against the non-litigants and, as a result, did not provide either the court or the State with adequate notice under <em>DeBenedetto. </em>The trial court ordered Exxon to \u201cset forth, with specificity, a good faith basis for why each party listed within their disclosures is responsible for the claims made by the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The State subsequently moved to strike Exxon\u2019s supplemental disclosures, maintaining that Exxon failed to comply with the trial court\u2019s order because the disclosures did not provide sufficient evidence specific to each <em>DeBenedetto </em>party. In its order, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">Despite the fact that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has never directly addressed the present <em>DeBenedetto </em>issues, it has, nonetheless, supplied a framework to guide this court\u2019s analysis. This framework is made up of four principles: first, that RSA 507:7-e applies to all parties contributing to the occurrence giving rise to the action, including those immune from liability or otherwise not before the court; second, that a civil defendant who seeks to deflect fault by apportionment to non-litigants is raising something in the nature of an affirmative defense; third, the defendant carries the burdens of production and persuasion; and fourth, that a defendant may not easily shift fault under RSA 507:7-e; allegations of a non-litigant tortfeasor\u2019s fault must be supported by adequate evidence before a jury or court may consider it for fault apportionment purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(Quotations and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The trial court found \u201cthe most notable portion of the framework, and the most helpful in the present analysis, is that portion identifying non-litigant liability as akin to an \u2018affirmative defense.\u2019 \u201d Because in New Hampshire defendants are required to plead affirmative defenses to provide the plaintiff with adequate notice of the defense and a fair opportunity to rebut it, the trial court determined that \u201cwhen a defendant raises a defense under <em>DeBenedetto, </em>its disclosure must provide the plaintiff with adequate notice of the defense and the plaintiff must be given fair opportunity to rebut it.\u201d Looking at the requirements of other jurisdictions, the court reasoned that the Colorado standard \u201cfor evaluating a defendant\u2019s notice of non-litigant fault [is] persuasive in molding a standard for \u2018adequate notice\u2019 under DeBenedetto.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">proper notice in the <em>DeBenedetto </em>context requires [Exxon] to provide to the State identifying information for the nonparty in addition to a brief statement of the basis for believing such nonparty to be at fault. Furthermore, the notice must allege sufficient facts to satisfy all the elements of at least one of the State\u2019s claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">(Quotations, citations, and brackets omitted.) The trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s assertion that it need demonstrate only \u201chow a <em>DeBenedetto </em>party contributed to the harm alleged by the State, not correspond each <em>DeBenedetto </em>party to individual claims,\u201d reasoning that Exxon cannot assert that it has \u201cany less of a burden than to link [its] own allegations of non-litigant fault to at least one of the claims asserted by the State.\u201d (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Thereafter, the trial court determined that with respect to negligence, Exxon \u201cmust assert that a nonparty owed a duty with respect to MTBE gasoline and breached that duty. This will require demonstrating that a nonparty had some knowledge of MTBE or its characteristics, or should have had some knowledge.\u201d With respect to products liability, the trial court determined that Exxon \u201cmust assert that a nonparty knew or reasonably should have known of the nature of MTBE upon which the State\u2019s claims are based in order to show that an entity below [Exxon] in the product chain is similarly culpable and/or owed a similar duty to warn.\u201d The trial court explained that Exxon \u201cneed not show that a nonparty was aware of the unique nature of MTBE ... However, a nonparty cannot possibly [have] foreseen the type of harm alleged by the State absent some knowledge that MTBE was generally present in gasoline or could have been present. Alternatively, [Exxon] may demonstrate that a nonparty should have known of MTBE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>After the jury verdict, Exxon moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. Exxon argued that the trial court erred by: (1) \u201cimproperly requiring ExxonMobil to prove that the non-parties were liable for the State\u2019s claims, rather than proving only that they contributed to the State\u2019s injury\u201d; (2) \u201cpreventing ExxonMobil from relying on RSA 146-A to establish the non-parties\u2019 fault\u201d; (3) \u201crequiring proof that the non-parties had actual or constructive knowledge of MTBE\u2019s presence in gasoline before contributing to the State\u2019s injury\u201d; and (4) requiring it to present \u201ccategories of evidence rather than evidence about the actions of particular individuals in connection with particular injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s first three challenges because they raised pure questions of law that the court addressed pretrial and \u201cExxon has raised no new fact or law to convince the Court to readdress these arguments.\u201d Regarding the statewide proof claim, the trial court agreed with the State that allowing categories was a convenience, not a requirement, and \u201cExxon could have presented evidence regarding every individual <em>DeBenedetto </em>party, as opposed to categorical evidence.\u201d As to the categories, the trial court found that \u201cExxon presented very little evidence establishing nonparty liability\u201d and that its primary witness who testified regarding the various categories of nonparties \u201cdid not indicate that nonparties were aware of MTBE\u2019s presence in gasoline during the relevant time period, and he never stated that nonparties were aware their actions caused spills and leaks that caused MTBE contamination.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court concluded that it \u201ccannot say that a jury verdict rejecting Exxon\u2019s <em>DeBenedetto </em>defense was conclusively against the weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On appeal, Exxon argues that the trial court\u2019s <em>DeBenedetto </em>rulings \u201cdeviate from clear precedent and denied Exxon a meaningful opportunity to prove that third parties contributed to at least part of the alleged harm.\u201d Exxon asserts that the trial court\u2019s ruling that Exxon had to link each <em>DeBenedetto </em>party to a claim made by the State \u201ceviscerated Exxon\u2019s statutory right to allocate fault to third parties.\u201d The State argues that Exxon\u2019s <em>DeBenedetto </em>argument is \u201cunavailing because Exxon did not show at trial that non-parties were at <em>fault </em>for MTBE pollution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">We review challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case. <em>In the Matter of McArdle, </em>162 N.H. at 485.

RSA 507:7-e, I, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">I. In all actions, the court shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">(a) Instruct the jury to determine... the amount of damages to be awarded to each claimant and against each defendant in accordance with the proportionate fault of each of the parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(b) Enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of the rules of joint and several liability, except that if any party shall be less than 50 percent at fault, then that party\u2019s liability shall be several and not joint and he shall be liable only for the damages attributable to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201c[F]or apportionment purposes under RSA 507:7-e, the word \u2018party\u2019 refers not only to \u2018parties to an action, including settling parties,\u2019 but to all parties contributing to the occurrence giving rise to an action, including those immune from liability or otherwise not before the court.\u201d <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 804 (quotation, ellipsis, and citation omitted). \u201c[A] defendant may not easily shift fault under RSA 507:7-e; allegations of a non-litigant tortfeasor\u2019s fault must be supported by adequate evidence before a jury or court may consider it for fault apportionment purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] civil defendant who seeks to deflect fault by apportionment to non-litigants is raising something in the nature of an <em>affirmative defense\u2019\u2019 Goudreault v. Kleeman, </em>158 N.H. 236, 256 (2009). Accordingly, \u201cthe defendant carries the burdens of production and persuasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201ca defendant who raises a non-litigant apportionment defense essentially becomes another plaintiff who must seek to impose liability on a non-litigant just as a plaintiff seeks to impose it on him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted); <em>see Wyle v. Lees, </em>162 N.H. 406, 413 (2011) (trial court implicitly concluded that the defendants failed to prove their allegations of comparative negligence for purposes of apportionment of damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">As the trial court correctly concluded, apportionment under RSA 507:7-e requires proof of fault. <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 800 (apportionment must include all tortfeasors who are causally negligent by either causing or contributing to the occurrence in question). At trial, Exxon\u2019s expert witness, Jeffrey A. Klaiber, an environmental consultant, testified for several days, including providing extensive testimony regarding typical spill and leak scenarios for the various categories of alleged faulty nonparties. He acknowledged, however, that he did not interview anyone at any of the sites that Exxon contends are responsible for MTBE contamination, that he did not know whether anyone who owned or operated any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>those sites knew that MTBE gasoline behaves differently from other gasolines when released into the environment, and that he did not know if any of the owners or operators of those sites even knew that MTBE was in the gasoline that they were receiving. Nonetheless, the trial court allowed the jury to consider apportioning liability to those nonparties. The trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\">In this state, courts and juries may apportion fault to all persons or entities who contributed to causing an injury, even if they are not parties to the lawsuit. What that means in this case is that if you find that the State has proven any of its three claims against ExxonMobil, then ExxonMobil shall have the burden of proving that some or all of its fault should be allocated to the nonparties identified in Defense Exhibit 1047.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The jury answered \u201cNo\u201d to each portion of this question on the special verdict form: \u201cHas ExxonMobil proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that some or all of its fault should be allocated to nonparties in the following categories? ... a. Tanks With Holes . . . b. Aboveground Releases . . . c. Tanks With Releases . . . d. Junkyards.\u201d Based upon the record, we are not persuaded by Exxon\u2019s argument that it was denied \u201ca meaningful opportunity\u201d to apportion fault to third parties or that it suffered any prejudice from the trial court\u2019s rulings. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>X. Parens Patriae</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Exxon argues that the trial court erroneously decided that the State had <em>parens patriae </em>standing, rather than submitting this question to the jury. Exxon asserts that whether there is an injury to a \u201csubstantial segment\u201d of the population is a question of fact for the jury, not a question of law for the judge, and that a rational jury could have found the State\u2019s proof insufficient. The State argues that Exxon waived this argument because Exxon failed to raise it before the trial court, including failing to raise it in its motion for summary judgment on <em>parens patriae </em>issues or in its motion for a directed verdict, and failed to argue it in either its motion for JNOV or motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We have reviewed the record and agree with the State that Exxon has failed to demonstrate that it specifically raised this argument before the trial court. <em>See Dukette, </em>166 N.H. at 255. Accordingly, because the argument is not preserved for our review, we decline to address it substantively. <em>See N. Country Envtl. Servs., </em>150 N.H. at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\n<em>XI. Future Well Impacts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Exxon argues that the State\u2019s \u201cfuture, speculative, and unknown well and site impacts\u201d are not ripe for review. Before trial, Exxon raised this argument in a summary judgment motion. The trial court denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">It is well settled in New Hampshire that an injured party may seek recovery for future harm that will arise from a current injury. In order to recover for future damages, a party need only show that there is evidence from which it can be found to be more probable than not that the future damages will occur. Thus, contrary to [Exxon\u2019s] argument, New Hampshire has no absolute prohibition on awarding future damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The court finds that the State\u2019s damages for future and unknown well impacts are fit for . . . judicial determination. Importantly, the injury causing the future harm has already occurred. The injury occurred when MTBE entered State waters. The State\u2019s claim for future damages merely seeks to measure the extent of the harm caused, which New Hampshire allows. Furthermore, the court has already determined that the methods undertaken by the State\u2019s experts for determining the future harm . . . are relevant and reliable. Therefore, the State\u2019s future damages claims are ripe for review under the first prong of the ripeness test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">(Quotation, citations, and brackets omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Exxon moved for a directed verdict following the State\u2019s conclusion of its case-in-chief arguing, in part, that the State failed to present its damages figure with sufficient certainty. Exxon argued that the State failed to prove that it has \u201csustained a cognizable injury\u201d and that the State\u2019s damages evidence was insufficient. The trial court rejected the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">The State need only show an approximation of its harm. As this Court\u2019s prior orders on this issue explain, the State does not need to have identified every contaminated well in New Hampshire to show it is injured. Nonetheless, the State presented testimony in its case-in-chief through Gary Beckett, Dr. Ian Hutchison, Dr. Graham Fogg, Steve Guercia, and Brandon Kernen. These witnesses estimated the number of wells that are currently suffering contamination based on statistical sampling, the location of spill sites, and the number and proximity of drinking wells in New Hampshire. The mere fact that the State\u2019s damages figure is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>based on an approximation does not make it speculative or legally insufficient. Further, the evidence presented during the State\u2019s case-in-chief regarding the estimated costs of remediation efforts based on estimated contamination is sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude the State has suffered a cognizable injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Following the jury verdict Exxon moved for JNOV, arguing that \u201cseveral aspects of the jury\u2019s damages award for future well testing and treatment . .. are unsupported by the evidence.\u201d Denying the motion, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Exxon explains that even if it is liable, the damages figure the jury awarded is speculative because it is based on expert estimations and not supported by evidence; it is not sufficiently definite. The Court considered and rejected this argument in its directed verdict order: \u201cThe mere fact that the State\u2019s damages figure is based on an approximation does not make it speculative or legally insufficient.\u201d Because Exxon raises no new facts or law, the Court will not reconsider its prior ruling. As such, the record is not so clearly in Exxon\u2019s favor that the Court can find the jury\u2019s verdict is unsustainable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">In addition, Exxon moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, arguing that \u201c[j]ust because MTBE is in groundwater now does not mean that it will injure private wells in the future,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthese projected injuries are speculative and were not ripe.\u201d The trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">This Court has ruled that the State\u2019s injury already occurred; MTBE has already been brought into New Hampshire. Exxon sought a jury instruction on imminent and immediate harm, which the Court denied. Whether the State has been injured is a question for the jury, but prospective damages are proper where there was evidence from which the jury could find it more probable than otherwise that such damage would occur. Because Exxon\u2019s motion raises no new issues of law or fact, the Court declines to reconsider its prior rulings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">(Quotation and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">On appeal, Exxon argues that the trial court erred \u201cin allowing the State to claim more than $300 million in damages for the costs of testing private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>wells for possible MTBE contamination, $150 million to treat whatever contamination is found in the wells in the future, and another $218 million for anticipated generalized costs to characterize . . . and clean up release sites,\u201d because these claims are unripe and should be dismissed. Exxon asserts that the State \u201cdid not present proof of actual or imminent contamination to particular private wells,\u201d and that the State\u2019s claims for treatment of future private-well impacts \u201care even more uncertain, remote, and contingent.\u201d According to Exxon, the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cdramatically increased the scope of this suit and took the [court] into territory where no common law court has gone before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The State argues that its harm \u201cexists today, and recompense for this type of harm is certainly no less recoverable than future medical expenses or damages for loss of income, both of which are regularly awarded in tort actions without raising ripeness concerns.\u201d The State also asserts that its testing and future-treatment claims are ripe because the State \u201cpresented concrete evidence of damage that already has occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201c[R]ipeness relates to the degree to which the defined issues in a case are based on actual facts and are capable of being adjudicated on an adequately developed record.\u201d <em>Appeal of City of Concord, </em>161 N.H. 344, 354 (2011). Although we have not adopted a formal test for ripeness, we have found \u201cpersuasive the two-pronged analysis used by other jurisdictions that evaluates the fitness of the issue for judicial determination and the hardship to the parties if the court declines to consider the issue.\u201d <em>Appeal of State Employees\u2019 Assoc., </em>142 N.H. 874, 878 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We find no error in the trial court\u2019s rulings on this issue. The State\u2019s claims for future testing and treatment are fit for judicial determination as the harm from MTBE has already occurred. <em>Cf. In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) Prod., </em>175 F. Supp. 2d 593, 607-11 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (individual plaintiffs could not show a present threat of imminent harm because either they had not tested their private wells or tests did not detect MTBE in their wells). The record establishes that, as of the time of trial, over 1,000 drinking wells in the state had tested positive for MTBE, and, of those, 358 wells were contaminated at levels over the maximum contaminant level of 13 ppb. The record also establishes that more than 5,000 wells, which have not yet been tested, were likely already contaminated with MTBE above 13 ppb at the time of trial. The record also contains evidence that the damage from MTBE contamination is not limited to drinking wells. According to the State\u2019s experts, MTBE has a \u201cresidence time\u201d of up to 50 years, during which time it gradually seeps through subsurface zones toward wells, lakes, and wetlands. The State\u2019s experts testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>although leaks from some underground storage tanks might not yet have been detected, those leaks \u201cwill continue to pose a hazard to groundwater quality.\u201d As the jury was instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">The State is entitled to be fully compensated for the harm resulting from ExxonMobil\u2019s legal fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">In determining the amount of damages to allow the State, you may.... consider whether it is more probable than otherwise that its damages will continue into the future as a direct, natural and probable consequence of ExxonMobil\u2019s legal fault and, if so, award it full, fair, and adequate compensation for those future damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Exxon does not present any argument on the hardship prong of the ripeness test, and we therefore consider any argument regarding that prong to be waived. <em>See State v. Roy, </em>167 N.H. 276, 286 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\n<em>XII. Prejudgment Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Exxon argues that the trial court should not have awarded prejudgment interest on future costs. Following the jury verdict, the State moved for taxation of costs, including prejudgment interest pursuant to RSA 524:l-b (2007). Exxon moved to preclude the addition of prejudgment interest on the future costs portion of the State\u2019s damage award, arguing that such an award would not serve the statute\u2019s purpose and \u201cwould amount to an illegal punitive award.\u201d Exxon asserted that because money has time value, interest is added to damages for past harms to take into account the time during which the plaintiff was deprived of its use, but \u201c[t]hat rationale is inapposite to an award for future costs associated with establishing investigation, testing and treatment programs and with MTBE impacts that have not yet occurred.\u201d The State objected, arguing that because the injury has already occurred when MTBE entered New Hampshire\u2019s waters, Exxon\u2019s \u201cmotion fails in its basic premise; there are no future injuries here.\u201d The State also argued that even assuming future injuries were at issue, the statute \u201cdoes not distinguish between past and future costs or harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The trial court rejected Exxon\u2019s arguments, noting that, although during trial, \u201cthe State categorized its damages as past, current, and future for purposes of breaking the figure into parts for evidentiary presentation,... this presentation was not intended to and did not define the State\u2019s injury.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">The State presented substantial evidence that the damage to its waters had already been done, MTBE had already been imported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>into the State, and this is the presentation of evidence that the jury accepted by its verdict. The mere fact that the State characterized part of its damages figure as that for future testing and remediation does not mean that it did not suffer the loss of use of these monies prior to the jury\u2019s verdict in this case. Further, had these monies been available during the last decade when litigation was pending, arguably, the cost to test and remediate would be lesser now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On appeal, Exxon argues that the trial court erred \u201cby awarding prejudgment interest on the total judgment amount, or $236,872,664, when $195,243,134 of those damages . . . were for the State\u2019s claims for investigating, testing, characterizing, and treating alleged MTBE contamination in New Hampshire\u2019s private wells and future costs for site investigation and remediation.\u201d According to Exxon, \u201c[p]rejudgment interest on those future costs fails to serve the compensatory purpose of RSA 524:1-b and thus should not have been awarded.\u201d The State argues that Exxon \u201cmakes no effort to square its argument with [the statute\u2019s] text,\u201d and that \u201cRSA 524:l-b has dual purposes: to accelerate settlement and provide compensation for the loss of use of money damages.\u201d (Quotation and emphasis omitted.) The State asserts that \u201c[ajwarding prejudgment interest to all of the State\u2019s damages satisfies the objective of accelerating settlement, regardless of when the money underlying the damages is spent,\u201d and that \u201cbecause the contamination occurred in the past, ongoing treatment and testing does not, as Exxon claims, represent \u2018future harms\u2019 or damages the State has yet to incur.\u201d (Quotation, brackets, and citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, upon a verdict for damages and upon motion of a party, interest is to be awarded as part of all judgments.\u201d <em>State v. Peter Salvucci Inc., </em>111 N.H. 259, 262 (1971). Pursuant to RSA 524:1-b, in all civil proceedings, other than an action on a debt,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">in which a verdict is rendered or a finding is made for pecuniary damages to any party, whether for personal injuries, for wrongful death, for consequential damages, for damage to property, business or reputation, for any other type of loss for which damages are recognized, there shall be added... to the amount of damages interest thereon from the date of the writ or the filing of the petition to the date of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">RSA 524:l-b; <em>see </em>RSA 524:l-a (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. In the Matter of Liquidation of Home Ins. Co., </em>166 N.H. 84, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(2014). We are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, ascribe the plain and ordinary-meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"> The purpose of the legislature in enacting RSA 524:l-b was \u201cto clarify and simplify the existing law and to make plain that in all cases where the trial court awarded money to the party entitled to be compensated, interest at the legal rate is to be added to the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89 (quotation omitted). Even assuming, without deciding, that the damages award included some amount for \u201cfuture\u201d costs, the plain language of the statute does not distinguish between past and future damages. Rather, the statute mandates the award of prejudgment interest \u201cto the amount of damages.\u201d Thus, the plain language of the statute provides no support for Exxon\u2019s argument differentiating past and future damages for purposes of calculating and awarding prejudgment interest. <em>See Starr v. Governor, </em>151 N.H. 608, 610 (2004) (we will not add words to a statute that the legislature did not see fit to include). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in awarding prejudgment interest as to all of the State\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<em>XIII. State\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The State cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s order imposing a trust upon approximately $195 million of the damages award. Before trial, Exxon moved \u201cto establish a court supervised trust fund for any monies the State recovers in this litigation\u201d and for \u201can accounting for all settlement proceeds the State has received to date.\u201d Exxon argued that the need for a trust fund was necessary \u201cgiven the speculative nature of the State\u2019s future damages,\u201d and that a \u201c \u2018pay-as-you-go\u2019 fund .. . would effectively limit the State\u2019s recovery to those future testing, monitoring, treatment, and remediation costs the State actually incurs.\u201d The State objected, and the trial court deferred ruling until after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Following the verdict, Exxon renewed its motion, asserting that \u201c[t]he need for a court-supervised trust is proven by the recent press coverage indicating that the New Hampshire Legislature intends to divert funds awarded in this litigation away from MTBE remediation,\u201d and that, in two recent Maryland cases, the court had required court-supervised trust funds in medical monitoring cases involving alleged MTBE exposures. The State objected, arguing, among other contentions, that, because the trial court had already determined that \u201cthe underlying causes of action do not require the State to prove how it will spend damages, there is no basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>imposing a court-supervised trust requiring the State to establish how the money will be spent as a prerequisite to obtaining the damages for which Exxon was found liable.\u201d In addition, the State argued that Exxon \u201chas not cited a single case, statute, or other authority that would allow [the trial court] to establish a trust fund for monies received by the State pursuant to a jury award in a products liability case,\u201d and that Exxon\u2019s reliance upon the Maryland cases was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">The trial court granted Exxon\u2019s motion in part, agreeing that \u201ca trust is necessary to protect the <em>res </em>of the jury damage award.\u201d The trial court reasoned that \u201cbecause the State brought this case in its <em>parens patriae/ </em>trustee capacity,\u201d the \u201cState\u2019s obligation to remediate contaminated water exists independent of Exxon\u2019s interest in the damages figure the jury awarded the State,\u201d and the State \u201cmust ensure it has adequate resources to test and treat New Hampshire\u2019s waters in the future.\u201d The court declined to impose a trust upon the amount of damages designated for past cleanup costs, reasoning that \u201cthose monies must be available upon final judgment\u201d for the State to reimburse itself. However, the court imposed a trust upon the amount of damages designated for 228 high-risk sites, sampling private drinking water wells, and treating drinking water wells contaminated with MTBE at or above the maximum contaminant level. The court rejected Exxon\u2019s request for an order compelling the State to disclose how it would proceed with testing and remediation, but noted that \u201cto the extent Exxon has a legal interest in a trust as a beneficiary at the termination of the trust, it may file a proposed procedure for how the trust should function.\u201d The trial court deferred deciding whether the trust would be court-supervised, and a hearing date was set for the court \u201cto consider each party\u2019s proposal for the administrative details of a trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Before the scheduled hearing date, the State moved for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s order, Exxon filed this appeal, and the State filed its cross-appeal. We subsequently issued an order staying the appellate proceedings to allow the trial court to issue a final decision on the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The trial court thereafter denied the motion. The court noted at the outset that \u201cit would be inefficient for the Court to decide all the relevant details of a trust now, if the Supreme Court is being asked to decide whether the existence of a trust is permissible. As such, this Court interprets the Supreme Court order to require a ruling on imposition of a trust but not the details.\u201d The trial court rejected the State\u2019s arguments that, among other things, the court conflated <em>parens patriae </em>and the public trust doctrine, failed to comply with RSA 6:11, III (Supp. 2014), and violated separation of powers. The trial court also rejected the State\u2019s argument that Exxon lacked standing, stating that \u201cthe Court specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>left open the question of whether Exxon has standing\u201d and that \u201cExxon\u2019s standing was irrelevant to the Court\u2019s determination to impose the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On appeal, the State argues that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a trust was erroneous for several reasons, including that no common law precedent or statute provides for the imposition of a trust over the State\u2019s damages award. Exxon argues that trial courts have \u201cbroad and flexible equitable powers,\u201d which include the power to establish a trust over the damages awarded in this case. (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Although we recognize that \u201c[t]he propriety of affording equitable relief in a particular case rests in the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Libertarian Party of N.H. v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>158 N.H. 194, 196 (2008), this principle does not apply to the remedy in this case. The common law remedy for a tort law cause of action is lump-sum damages. <em>See Reilly v. United States, </em>863 F.2d 149, 169 (1st Cir.1988) (under the common law rule, \u201ca court\u2019s authority to award damages for personal injuries is limited to making lump-sum judgments\u201d); <em>see also In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d), </em>56 F. Supp. 3d 272, 273, 275 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (declining to impose a reversionary trust on damages awarded for Exxon\u2019s liability on claims of public nuisance, negligence, trespass, and products liability for failure to warn, because the remedy for a traditional tort law cause of action is lump-sum damages). Thus, in the absence of a statute or an agreement between the parties, when a tortfeasor loses at trial it must pay the judgment in one lump sum. <em>See Reilly, </em>863 F.2d at 170; <em>see also Vanhoy v. United States, </em>514 F.3d 447, 454-55 (5th Cir.2008) (court refused to deviate from a conventional lump-sum award and create a reversionary trust over damages in the absence of any applicable statutory or precedential requirement); <em>Frankel v. Heym, </em>466 F.2d 1226, 1228-29 (3d Cir. 1972) (\u201ccourts of law had no power at common law to enter judgments in terms other than a simple award of money damages\u201d; thus, \u201ccourt should not make other than lump-sum money judgments\u201d in case brought under Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cunless and until Congress shall authorize a different type of award\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> The trial court reasoned that a trust was required because the State brought this action in its <em>parens patriae </em>capacity. <em>Parens patriae, </em>however, is simply a standing doctrine. <em>See Hess, </em>161 N.H. at 431-32. As we explained in <em>Hess, </em>\u201c[t]he public trust doctrine, from which the State\u2019s authority as trustee stems, and the <em>parens patriae </em>doctrine are both available to states seeking to remedy environmental harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431. \u2018While the public trust doctrine is its own cause of action, <em>parens patriae </em>is a concept of standing, which allows the state to protect certain quasi-sovereign interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431-32 (quotations omitted). <em>\u201cParens patriae </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>does not provide a cause of action, but may provide a state with standing to bring suit to protect a broader range of natural resources than the public trust doctrine because it does not require state ownership of such resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the fact that the State was allowed to proceed under <em>parens patriae </em>standing authorizes the imposition of a trust over the money damages awarded for Exxon\u2019s torts. In the absence of statutory or precedential support, we decline to deviate from the conventional lump-sum damages award and, accordingly, reverse the trial court\u2019s imposition of a trust as erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b289-6\">Hicks, J., and VAUGHAN, J., retired superior court justice, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
