The trial court ruled that the defendant was protected by municipal immunity pursuant to RSA 507-B:5 (2010). On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by failing to apply the exception to general immunity pursuant to RSA 507-B:2 (2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The trial court found, or the record reflects, the following. On or around May 7, 2012, Logan, a student at a school operated by the defendant, was playing football on the playground during the lunch recess when another student tackled him and \u201cslammed him to the ground,\u201d causing injury to his head. Logan did not return to class after lunch, and none of the school\u2019s staff reported the incident on the playground or that Logan was missing from class. Logan was later found wandering the halls, disoriented. He was taken to the nurse\u2019s office, where he remained for approximately fifty minutes, at which point the nurse contacted the plaintiff to retrieve him from school. The nurse did not call for an ambulance. The plaintiff took Logan to the emergency room, where she learned that he had possibly suffered a concussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">On January 30, 2014, the plaintiff filed her complaint alleging that the defendant \u201cacted in a special relationship to [Logan], taking responsibility for [his] health, safety, and [well-being] while he was under its care, custody, and control,\u201d and that it had breached its duty leading to Logan\u2019s injuries. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that RSA 507-B:5 immunizes it from the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claims and that those claims do not fall within the exception to immunity created by RSA 507-B:2. On August 1, 2014, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">On appeal, the plaintiff asserts two arguments for our consideration: (1) that the exception to general municipal immunity, RSA 507-B:2, applies in this case because the plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose from the operation of the defendant\u2019s premises; and (2) that the plaintiff should have been allowed to proceed to discovery to determine whether the negligent act \u2018Vas a result of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of and failure to correct known student supervisory deficiencies.\u201d (Bolding omitted.) We will address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>In reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we assume the truth of the facts alleged by the plaintiff and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Farm Family Cas. Ins. Co. v. Town of Rollinsford, </em>155 N.H. 669, 670 (2007). We need not, however, assume the truth of statements in the pleadings that are merely conclusions of law. <em>Ojo v. Lorenzo, </em>164 N.H. 717, 721 (2018). If the facts do not constitute a basis for legal relief, we will uphold the granting of a motion to dismiss. <em>Farm Family, </em>155 N.H. at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">RSA chapter 507-B is entitled \u201cBODILY INJURY ACTIONS AGAINST GOVERNMENTAL UNITS.\u201d (Bolding omitted.) RSA 507-B:5 states that \u201c[n]o governmental unit shall be held liable in any action to recover for bodily injury, personal injury or property damage except as provided by this chapter or as is provided or may be provided by other statute.\u201d RSA 507-B :5. One exception to RSA 507-B :5 is set forth in RSA 507-B :2, which states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] governmental unit may be held liable for damages ... caused by its fault or by fault attributable to it, arising out of ownership, occupation, maintenance or operation of all motor vehicles, and all premises.\u201d RSA 507-B:2. The parties do not dispute that the defendant meets the definition of \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d for the purposes of RSA 507-B:5, <em>see </em>RSA 507-B:l, I (2010), and that the plaintiffs action is one for \u201cbodily injury,\u201d RSA 507-B:l, II (2010). Furthermore, we have previously interpreted RSA 507-B :2 to require a nexus between the claim and the governmental unit\u2019s ownership, occupation, maintenance or operation of its motor vehicles or premises. <em>Dichiara v. Sanborn Reg\u2019l Sch. Dist., </em>165 N.H. 694, 696-97 (2013). Thus, regarding the plaintiffs first argument, the issue is whether the defendant\u2019s alleged liability arises out of its operation of the school premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">To resolve the issue before us \u2014 determining the meaning of \u201coperation of . . . all premises\u201d pursuant to RSA 507-B :2 \u2014 we must engage in statutory interpretation. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. State v. Dor, </em>165 N.H. 198, 200 (2013). We are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>When we interpret a statute, we look first to the statute\u2019s language, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We do not read words or phrases in isolation, but in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>We \u201cwill not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Smith v. City of Franklin, </em>159 N.H. 585, 588 (2010) (quotation omitted). This enables us to better discern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme. <em>LLK Trust v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>159 N.H. 734, 736 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The plaintiff, relying upon our decision in <em>Farm Family, </em>urges us to conclude that \u201coperation of . . . all premises,\u201d RSA 507-B:2, includes the operation of a business or enterprises located on those premises. Her reliance upon <em>Farm Family </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In <em>Farm Family, </em>the issue was whether the actions of the Rollinsford Fire Department, in cutting off and then improperly restoring electrical power to the insured\u2019s property, constituted \u201cownership, occupation, maintenance or operation\u201d of the insured\u2019s home and garage. <em>Farm Family, </em>155 N.H. at 671 (quotation omitted). We held that because the insured\u2019s property was never \u201cowned, occupied, maintained or operated\u201d by the fire department, the town was immune from liability for damages to the property resulting from a fire. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Farm Family argued that when fire department personnel restored power to the property, their actions constituted \u201coperation\u201d of the property within the meaning of RSA 507-B:2. <em>Id. </em>at 673. We observed that Farm Family\u2019s preferred definitions of the word \u201coperation\u201d were flawed because they lacked a direct object and RSA 507-B:2 requires a direct object \u2014 it allows suits against governmental units for damages arising out of \u201coperation <em>of </em>\u2019 all premises. <em>Id. </em>We explained that the definitions that pertain to operation of something are: (1) \u201cthe whole process of planning for and operating a business or other organized unit &lt;the [operation] of a large household&gt; &lt;the [operation] of a steel mill&gt;\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe operating or putting and maintaining in action of something (as a machine or an industry) &lt; careful [operation] of a motor car&gt; &lt; problems in the [operation] of a railroad&gt;.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674 (quotations omitted); Webster\u2019s THIRD New International Dictionary 1581 (unabridged ed. 2002). We then applied those definitions to the alleged facts and concluded that neither cutting off nor restoring electrical power to the insured\u2019s property constituted engaging in \u201cthe whole process of planning for or operating the insureds\u2019 home as an organized unit\u201d or putting or maintaining \u201cthe insureds\u2019 property in action.\u201d <em>Farm Family, </em>155 N.H. at 674. Thus, we held \u201cunder a proper construction of the term \u2018operation,\u2019 the [fire department] did not operate the insureds\u2019 property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Although one of the dictionary definitions upon which we relied in <em>Farm Family </em>uses \u201ca business\u201d as a direct object of the word \u201coperation,\u201d RSA 507-B:2 uses \u201cpremises\u201d as a direct object of the word \u201coperation.\u201d In <em>Farm Family, </em>we were not asked to define the word \u201cpremises.\u201d In the instant case, we must do so for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Although RSA chapter 507 does not define the term \u201cpremises,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>defines \u201cpremises\u201d to mean: (1) \u201cproperty that is conveyed by bequest or deed\u201d; (2) \u201ca specified piece or tract of land with the structures on it\u201d; (3) \u201ca building, buildings, or part of a building covered by or within the stated terms of a policy (as of fire insurance)\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe place of business of an enterprise or institution.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD New INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY, <em>supra </em>at 1789. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cpremises\u201d to mean \u201c[a] house or building, along with its grounds; . . . the buildings and land that a shop, restaurant, company, etc. uses.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1371 (10th ed. 2014). Both authorities limit the definition of premises to real property and any structures built upon it \u2014 that is, the physical property. This is consistent with the historical evolution of the term. <em>See </em>Garner, GARNER\u2019S Dictionary of Legal Usage 700 (3d ed. 2011) (detailing the history of \u201cpremises\u201d as used in the law). We see no reason to expand the definition in the manner desired by the plaintiff. Were we to include in the definition of premises the enterprises contained within the premises, we would effectively void the immunity granted by RSA 507-B:5. <em>See Dichiara, </em>165 N.H. at 696 (declining to adopt an interpretation of RSA 507-B:2 that would \u201cprovide a blanket exception to RSA 507-B:5\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the RSA 507-B:2 exception to municipal immunity requires a nexus between the claim and the governmental unit\u2019s ownership, occupation, or operation of its <em>physical </em>premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"> This ruling is consistent with our prior holdings interpreting the motor vehicle exception to immunity pursuant to RSA 507-B:2. In <em>Chatman v. Strafford County, </em>163 N.H. 320 (2012), we recognized that \u201cwhen a vehicle acts as merely the situs of an injury, the causal connection between the injury and the use of the vehicle is too tenuous to support coverage.\u201d <em>Chatman, </em>163 N.H. at 324 (quotation omitted) (using cases interpreting motor vehicle insurance policies as instructive). \u201cBy contrast, when the injuries stem from an act that is part of using a motor vehicle, the causal connection is established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same is true for the premises exception: simply because the alleged injury occurs in connection with the enterprise conducted on the defendant\u2019s premises does not mean that it arose out of the defendant\u2019s operation of the physical premises. Because the plaintiffs allegations that the defendant \u201cacted in a special relationship to\u201d Logan and breached its duty to him do not support a claim of injury arising out of the defendant\u2019s operation of the school\u2019s physical premises, her claim does not fall within the exception to municipal immunity created by RSA 507-B:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The plaintiff next argues that we should reverse the trial court\u2019s decision so that it may benefit from discovery and learn \u201c[i]f the school knew of and failed to correct inadequacies in student supervision to prevent foreseeable student injuries.\u201d The plaintiff relies upon our decision in <em>Marquay v. Eno, </em>139 N.H. 708 (1995), to support this argument. She also appears to suggest that <em>Marquay </em>would defeat the defendant\u2019s immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In <em>Marquay, </em>the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire presented us with a series of certified questions and asked us to consider whether school officials had common law duties \u201cto protect . . . students by reporting alleged sexual misconduct to the proper authorities and taking other protective measures, if they knew . .. that [the students] were being sexually harassed, assaulted or abused by [school employees].\u201d <em>Marquay, </em>139 N.H. at 712. We answered that some officials do owe such a duty. We were never asked to consider whether RSA 507-B:2 and RSA 507-B:5 immunize the school district from suit, and we did not opine on the issue of municipal immunity. As we have decided today, however, RSA 507-B:5 immunizes the defendant from suit based upon the particular claims asserted by the plaintiff. Permitting the plaintiff access to discovery in connection with her claims, as alleged, would not enable the plaintiff to overcome the immunity provided by RSA 507-B:5. Accordingly, we decline to reverse the decision of the trial court on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
