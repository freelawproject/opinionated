Specifically, the trial court ruled that, when CAC purchased the assets of Whaleback Systems Corporation (Whaleback), the transaction did not amount to a <em>de facto </em>merger between the two companies. On appeal, Celestica argues that the trial court erred by not imposing successor liability upon CAC under the <em>de facto </em>merger doctrine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\n<em>I. Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The trial court found the following facts, which are not in dispute on appeal. Whaleback was founded to provide telecommunications services through Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) to small and mid-sized businesses. Whaleback, which operated primarily from Portsmouth, was funded by a group of venture capital firms. The primary investors in Whaleback were: (1) Ascent Venture Partners IV, LP (Ascent), which owned 53.1% of the stock; (2) Egan Managed Capital III, LP (Egan), which owned 22.7%; and (3) Castile Ventures III, LP (Castile), which owned 17.8%. Fifteen other individuals owned the remaining 6.4% of the Whaleback stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Whaleback was also funded through a series of secured loans. Horizon Technology Funding Company, LLC (Horizon) lent Whaleback $3 million (Horizon Loan), and was the primary secured lender. Horizon held a security interest in all of Whaleback\u2019s assets, \u201cincluding equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and intellectual property rights.\u201d Subordinate to Horizon\u2019s secured interest, the three primary shareholders of Whaleback \u2014 Ascent, Egan, and Castile \u2014 also provided secured loans to Whaleback in the amounts of $4.8 million, $2 million, and $1.2 million respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In 2011, after Whaleback defaulted on the Horizon Loan, the investors began looking for new sources of funding. Hercules Technology Growth Capital offered to lend Whaleback $2 million, provided that the equity investors invested an additional $700,000 in the company. Ascent, however, responded that it would provide only $50,000 of additional capital. Castile and Egan declined to invest more capital as long as Whaleback continued to operate under its existing business model. Hercules eventually withdrew its offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Soon thereafter, Whaleback board members Roger Walton, of Castile, and Michael Shanahan, of Egan, discussed forming a new company to acquire Whaleback\u2019s assets. Walton had a background in information technology, and believed that Whaleback had valuable technology but had a flawed business model. Walton and Shanahan met with Karil Reibold, the CEO of Whaleback, to discuss the future of the company. The three then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>approached Horizon with a proposal whereby Castile and Egan would create a new company and purchase Whaleback\u2019s assets from Horizon. Under the proposal, Castile and Egan would pay Horizon $500,000, plus $50,000 in legal fees and costs. The plan also contemplated that Horizon would pay $125,000 to keep Whalebaek operating until the sale closed, at which time Castile and Egan would reimburse Horizon for this expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The parties ultimately agreed to the following terms, which were memorialized by a Letter of Intent (LOI) dated November 15,2011. Castile and Egan would fund Whaleback\u2019s operations between the signing of the LOI and the closing. Horizon would conduct a public auction of Whale-back\u2019s assets. The minimum bid at the auction was set at $600,000, and any interested bidder would be required to submit a $60,000 deposit on the day before the auction. Castile and Egan also had a right of first refusal, allowing them to match any higher bid. If they chose not to match a higher bid, Castile and Egan would receive a refund of any money invested in Whalebaek to keep it operational between the LOI and closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On November 15, the same day that the LOI was signed, Horizon sent a notice to Whalebaek stating that Whalebaek was in default on the Horizon Loan, thus triggering Horizon\u2019s right to sell all of Whaleback\u2019s assets at auction. Notice of the public auction was sent to all secured lenders and to Celestica. Notice was also published in the <em>Manchester Union Leader </em>and the <em>Boston Globe, </em>and posted on the auctioneer\u2019s website.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">At the November 29 auction, CAC, the new company formed by Castile and Egan, was the only bidder for Whaleback\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It bid $600,000. Prior to the December 7 closing, George Vaughn, who was hired to serve as CEO of CAC, worked with Reibold to keep Whalebaek running, because \u201cif there was an interruption in the business for any length of time then all of [Whaleback\u2019s] customers would be lost.\u201d Thus,- to ensure that it could provide uninterrupted service to its customers prior to the closing, CAC honored some of the debts owed by Whalebaek to existing vendors. Vaughn was ultimately responsible for deciding which of Whaleback\u2019s contracts that CAC would honor during the interim period.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The asset sale closed as planned. CAC \u201cacquired all of. .. Whaleback\u2019s assets, including the good will, existing customers, equipment, and intellectual property,\u201d free from any of Whaleback\u2019s liabilities, including the judgment that Celestica had obtained against Whalebaek. After the closing, Whalebaek had no assets. Whalebaek was not formally dissolved because it did not have sufficient funds to pay for its dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>In 2012, Celestica filed a petition for declaratory judgment in superior court, seeking a declaration that the asset sale between Whaleback and CAC constituted a <em>de facto </em>merger of the two companies. Celestica asked the trial court to rule that, under the theory of successor liability, CAC was \u201cfully and completely\u201d liable for the judgment that Celestica had obtained against Whaleback. Following a three-day bench trial, the trial court declined to impose successor liability on CAC. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Celestica first argues that we should review the trial court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>because it \u201cdoes not challenge the facts found by the trial court, but rather, the significance attributed to the facts and legal conclusions drawn from them.\u201d CAC counters that the imposition of successor liability is an equitable remedy within the sound discretion of the trial court, and, therefore, the trial court\u2019s ruling is owed deference on appeal. We agree with CAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Claims of successor liability, including the application of the <em>defacto </em>merger doctrine, are equitable in nature. <em>See Bielagus v. EMRE of </em>N.H., 149 N.H. 635, 639 (2003). \u201cThe propriety of affording equitable relief in a particular case rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Axenics, Inc. v. Turner Constr. Co., </em>164 N.H. 659, 669 (2013) (quotation omitted). \u2018We review the trial court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard to determine if they are supported by evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Bielagus, </em>149 N.H. at 639. We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision regarding equitable relief absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See Conant v. O\u2019Meara, </em>167 N.H. 644, 649 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u201cTo show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, [Celestica] must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly unreasonable or untenable to the prejudice of [its] case.\u201d <em>Axenics, </em>164 N.H. at 669. \u201cAlthough the award of equitable relief is within the sound discretion of the trial court, that discretion must be exercised, not in opposition to, but in accordance with, established principles of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cOur inquiry is to determine whether the evidence presented to the trial court reasonably supports the court\u2019s findings, and then whether the court\u2019s decision is consonant with applicable law.\u201d <em>Bielagus, </em>149 N.H. at 639 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\n<em>III. The De Facto Merger Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> A general precept of commercial law is that \u201ca corporation purchasing assets of another corporation is not liable for the seller\u2019s debts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 640. \u201cThis rule . . . allows, in the regular course of business, free alienability' of corporate assets to maximize their productive use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere are judicially recognized exceptions to this rule, however, intended to prevent corporations from evading their business obligations to creditors by selling their assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder the <em>defacto </em>merger exception, successor liability will be imposed if the parties have achieved virtually all of the results of a merger without following the statutory requirements for merger of the corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640-41 (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 293-A:11.07(a) (Supp. 2014) (describing the circumstances in which a merger between two entities becomes effective). In <em>Bielagus, </em>we enumerated four non-exclusive factors to be considered when determining whether a purported sale of assets is, in fact, a <em>defacto </em>merger. <em>Bielagus, </em>149 N.H. at 640-43. Those factors are whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">(1) There is a continuation of the enterprise of the seller corporation, so that there is continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">(2) There is a continuity of shareholders which results from the purchasing corporation paying for the acquired assets with shares of its own stock, this stock ultimately coming to be held by the shareholders of the seller corporation so that they become a constituent part of the purchasing corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">(3) The seller corporation ceases its ordinary business operations, liquidates, and dissolves as soon as legally and practically possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">(4) The purchasing corporation assumes those obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the seller corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 642 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe factor that usually tips the scales in favor of finding a merger is continuity of ownership, usually taking the form of an exchange of stock for assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In addition to the four factors, \u201c[t]he fact-finder may look to other factors indicative of commonality or distinctiveness with the corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\n<em>A. Continuation of the Enterprise of the Seller Corporation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The trial court first considered whether \u201c[t]here is a continuation of the enterprise of the seller corporation, so that there is continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642. The trial court observed that \u201c[t]his factor superficially supports the conclusion that [CAC] was a mere continuation of [Whaleback].\u201d However, it is apparent from the trial court\u2019s order that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>upon closer analysis, it found that this factor did not weigh in favor of imposing successor liability. Celestica argues that the trial court erred when it \u201ctried to explain away the facts showing a continuity of the enterprise,\u201d which, it argues, \u201care controlling.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Although the trial court observed that Whaleback and CAC \u201clooked like the same company immediately before and after the sale,\u201d it made numerous factual findings in support of its conclusion that the enterprise of CAC materially differed from that of Whaleback. For instance, with regard to continuity of management, the trial court credited the testimony of Walton, Castile\u2019s member on the Whaleback board of directors, that immediate turnover of management would have been detrimental to the value of the assets that CAC purchased. Walton testified that \u201cif there was any disruption in service as a result of firing management or employees, the customer base would immediately disappear and the value of the company would be lost.\u201d The trial court found that \u201cwithin 14 months of the foreclosure sale virtually the entire management team was replaced,\u201d and that only the Chief Technology Officer remained employed by CAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Further, prior to the asset sale, Castile and Egan each held only one of six seats on Whaleback\u2019s board of directors. After the closing, Castile and Egan held a total of three of four seats on CAC\u2019s board of directors, giving them control of the CAC board. As the trial court noted, \u201cbefore the sale Castile and Egan did not control . . . Whaleback either through equity ownership or on the Board of Directors,\u201d but \u201c[ajfter the sale Castile and Egan [controlled] the new company from both positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As for personnel, the trial court found that Whaleback had employed 28 staff members, and that, at the time of the trial, only half of those employees worked for CAC. The trial court recounted Walton\u2019s testimony that \u201cit took time to identify which employees continued to provide valuable services and to replace those who were not productive without disrupting service to the customers.\u201d Additionally, employees\u2019 stock options in Whaleback were cancelled, and each employee was granted new stock options in CAC \u201cbased on the employee\u2019s value to\u201d CAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In regard to continuity of CAC\u2019s business operations, the trial court referenced Walton\u2019s testimony that Whaleback\u2019s financial problems stemmed not from its services or technology, but rather from its \u201cpoor control over the cash flow.\u201d To that end, CAC brought in a new CEO, Vaughn, and gave him full control over spending. CAC also reduced its payments to resellers, who acted as middlemen between CAC and its customers, from 20% of the customer\u2019s contract to 10%, a change that \u201cdramatically improved\u201d CAC\u2019s revenue stream. CAC also moved to a \u201ccloud-based\u201d system to provide upgrades to customers remotely, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>opposed to individually servicing each customer\u2019s computer. Although Whaleback had developed the remote upgrade system, it did not invest the resources to implement it.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Additionally, in April 2013, CAC moved its operations from the facilities that Whaleback had used in Portsmouth and in Bedford, Massachusetts, to new locations in Boston and Virginia. The trial court found that the new facilities \u201cwere an upgrade and involved a completely different generation of equipment and technology from that used by... Whaleback in the prior facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Finally, the trial court found that Castile and Egan \u201cinvested an additional $1.1 million in equity and $200,000 in loans into [CAC] in order to implement the new business model.\u201d The trial court observed that \u201c[t]his money was necessary not just to keep Whaleback from bankruptcy but also to transition to new co-location facilities and to migrate customers to a new cloud-based technology.\u201d Moreover, these investments do not include the additional money that Castile and Egan spent to keep Whaleback operational between the auction and closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Given these factual findings \u2014 none of which are in dispute on appeal \u2014 there is ample evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the continuation-of-the-enterprise factor did not weigh in favor of imposing successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>B. Continuity of Shareholders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The second <em>Bielagus </em>factor is whether \u201c[t]here is a continuity of shareholders which results from the purchasing corporation paying for the acquired assets with shares of its own stock, this stock ultimately coming to be held by the shareholders of the seller corporation so that they become a constituent part of the purchasing corporation.\u201d <em>Bielagus, </em>149 N.H. at 642. \u201cIn traditional corporate law, the key factors to finding a <em>de facto </em>merger are the exchange of stock and continuity of ownership, because shareholders are the indirect beneficiaries of any increase in a corporation\u2019s assets or any decrease in its liabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643. \u201cThe existence of these factors suggests an asset sale is not actually a <em>bona fide </em>business transaction .. . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Celestiea first argues that the trial court\u2019s order \u201csuggests]\u201d that a <em>\u201cde facto </em>merger requires <em>uniformity </em>of ownership between the old and new company.\u201d We disagree with Celestica\u2019s interpretation of the trial court order. <em>See Choquette v. Roy, </em>167 N.H. 507, 513 (2015) (\u201cThe interpretation of a trial court order is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo!\u2019). </em>The trial court did not rule that uniformity of ownership is required to demonstrate a <em>de facto </em>merger. Rather, after recognizing that a <em>de facto </em>merger could be found absent uniformity, the trial court declined to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that, simply because Castile and Egan were shareholders in both companies, this factor favored imposing successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The trial court, after observing \u201cthat [Celestica] is correct that a foreclosure sale, in and of itself, does not terminate the successor liability inquiry,\u201d went on to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale, concluding that, despite the fact that \u201cCastile and Egan were shareholders in both companies, there was a <em>bona fide </em>change in ownership as a result of the foreclosure sale.\u201d There is ample evidence to support this finding. Prior to the closing, Castile and Egan owned 17.8% and 22.7%, respectively, of the stock in Whaleback. Castile and Egan paid $600,000 in cash for Whaleback\u2019s assets, and after the closing, Castile owned 66.7% of CAC, and Egan owned 33.3%. As the trial court noted, Castile changed from \u201cthe smallest institutional shareholder in ... Whaleback to holding an outright majority of the new company.\u201d Importantly, Ascent, Whaleback\u2019s majority shareholder, did not have an equity interest in CAC, nor did 15 other investors in Whaleback.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In light of these findings, Celestica has not demonstrated that the trial court erred in finding that the continuity-of-shareholders factor weighed against imposing successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>C. Cessation of the Business of the Seller Corporation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The trial court next considered the third <em>Bielagus </em>factor: whether the \u201cseller corporation ceases its ordinary business operations, liquidates, and dissolves as soon as legally and practically possible.\u201d <em>Bielagus, </em>149 N.H. at 642. The trial court noted that \u201con its face this factor tends to support imposing successor liability\u201d because \u201c[t]here is no question that . . . Whaleback functionally ceased operations without any capital after the foreclosure sale.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court observed that \u201cgood will and an existing customer base\u201d were valuable assets and, had \u2018Whaleback\u2019s property been liquidated and its operations ceased[,] Horizon would have lost these two valuable assets.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court did not give this factor much weight. Celestica argues that the trial court erred in doing so. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Celestica first argues that the trial court erred when it stated that this case is similar to <em>Bielagus. </em>However, the trial court did not state that this case was similar to <em>Bielagus </em>in all respects; rather it cited <em>Bielagus </em>in support of the proposition that a debtor\u2019s liabilities may be \u201ccut off\u2019 in some cases in which the buyer continues the business operations of the seller. Indeed, in that particular respect, this case is similar to <em>Bielagus, </em>a case in which the purchaser bought and continued operations of the seller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>residential real estate business, the trial court ruled that the sale did not amount to a <em>defacto </em>merger, <em>id. </em>at 638-39, and we upheld that determination, <em>id. </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Celestica also asserts that the trial court erred by determining that it would have constituted waste if CAC had not carried on Whaleback\u2019s business operations, a consideration that Celestica maintains is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the <em>defacto </em>merger doctrine. We disagree. As we observed in <em>Bielagus, </em>\u201c[i]nherent in an asset transfer is the purchaser\u2019s right to operate in the business to which the assets are suited .... Corporations purchase assets in order to use them; to do otherwise would constitute waste.\u201d <em>id. </em>at 642 (quotation omitted). We are not persuaded that the trial court erred in considering whether waste would have resulted if CAC had not carried on Whaleback\u2019s business operations or in assigning minimal weight to this factor in its <em>Bielagus </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>D. Assumption of Seller Corporation\u2019s Obligations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The fourth <em>Bielagus </em>factor is whether \u201c[t]he purchasing corporation assumes those obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the seller corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Celestica argues that the \u201ctrial court misapplied this <em>de facto </em>merger factor, concluding that there [was] no successor liability <em>because </em>[CAC] assumed only critical business liabilities of... Whaleback.\u201d Once again, we disagree with Celestica\u2019s reading of the trial court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The trial court found that CAC assumed only those liabilities that it deemed necessary to ensure continued operation of the company. It specifically observed that CAC \u201cdid not blindly assume [Whaleback\u2019s] liabilities,\u201d but \u201cagreed only to maintain those obligations which were crucial to preserve the company\u2019s good will and continued customers.\u201d Importantly, the trial court noted that, \u201c[h]ad CAC assumed liability for some non-essential debts, such as those to the insiders, this factor would weigh heavily in favor of [a] finding of successor liability.\u201d Here, the trial court reasonably concluded that, because it had found that Castile and Egan \u201clost millions of dollars in secured debt\u201d \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 as had other investors \u2014 the assumption of only critical business liabilities was not a factor weighing in favor of finding successor liability. Thus, the trial court\u2019s analysis was more detailed and nuanced than Celestica contends: the trial court did not rule that, simply because CAC assumed only the liabilities necessary to continue Whaleback\u2019s operations, successor liability should not be imposed. We are not persuaded that the trial court erred in its analysis of this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\n<em>E. Other Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Finally, in <em>Bielagus, </em>we stated that, in addition to the four enumerated factors, the \u201cfact-finder may look to other factors indicative of commonality or distinctiveness with the corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641. Here, the trial court considered the circumstances of the foreclosure sale itself, and concluded that CAC\u2019s purchase was the product of arms-length negotiations which resulted in adequate consideration being paid for the assets. Celestica argues that considerations such as adequacy of consideration and absence of collusion between Horizon and CAC were improperly considered by the trial court and are irrelevant to the <em>de facto </em>merger inquiry. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u201cA primary purpose of the <em>de facto </em>merger exception is to protect dissenting shareholders or creditors from a transaction that is a ploy to avoid the seller\u2019s liabilities.\u201d <em>Devine &amp; Devine Food v. Wampler Foods, </em>313 F.3d 616, 619 n.3 (1st Cir. 2002). \u201cCourts commonly appeal to this doctrine where the asset transfer in question was <em>neither an arms-length bargain nor supported by adequate consideration.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Bielagus, </em>149 N.H. at 643 (stating that continuity of ownership is an important factor given its tendency to demonstrate that \u201can asset sale is not actually a <em>bona fide </em>business transaction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Here, the trial court determined that the asset sale was <em>bona fide </em>and that \u201cthis circumstance weighs in favor of the finding that there is no successor liability.\u201d The trial court found that \u201cHorizon\u2019s lawyer testified credibly that he negotiated at arms-length with CAC\u2019s lawyers and Horizon\u2019s only interest was in minimizing its losses.\u201d To that end, the primary secured lender, Horizon, which had the undisputed right to foreclose and sell Whaleback\u2019s assets, held a widely advertised public auction, at which Celestica could have bid. Also, Horizon required a starting auction bid of $600,000, an increase of $100,000 from the original proposal by Castile and Egan to buy Whaleback\u2019s assets. The trial court noted that, given the amount of Whaleback\u2019s secured debt, if Whaleback\u2019s business had been liquidated, Celestica, as an unsecured judgment creditor, would not have received any money. We are not persuaded that the trial court erred when it found that the circumstances surrounding the foreclosure sale supported its conclusion that there was no <em>de facto </em>merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Finally, Celestica argues that the trial court \u201c[cjonflated\u201d the <em>defacto </em>merger doctrine with the successor liability doctrines of fraud and \u201cmere continuation.\u201d We disagree. In fact, as courts in other jurisdictions have observed, there is a substantial overlap between the doctrines giving rise to successor liability. <em>See, e.g., National Gypsum Co. v. Continental Brands Corp., </em>895 F. Supp. 328, 336 (D. Mass. 1995) (referring to <em>\u201cdefacto </em>merger\u201d and \u201cmere continuation\u201d as \u201c[sjlight variations on the theme of fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>conveyance\u201d and stating \u201c[w]hile these two labels have been enshrined separately in the canonical list of exceptions to the general rule of no successor liability, they appear, in practice to refer to the same concept and courts have often used the two terms interchangeably\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Cargo Partner AG v. Albatrans, Inc., </em>352 F.3d 41, 45 n.3 (2d Cir. 2003) (\u201cSome courts have observed that the mere-continuation and de-facto-merger doctrines are so similar that they may be considered a single exception.\u201d)\u2022 Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in its analysis or application of the doctrines that give rise to successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>TV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Accordingly, we hold that there is ample support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that CAC is not merely Whaleback \u201creincarnated as a different entity,\u201d and that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion when it refused to impose successor liability on CAC and denied Celestica\u2019s request for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, CONBOY, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\"> The actual bidder at auction was a predecessor of CAC named Communications Acquisitions, LLC. However, because the distinction between the two companies does not matter for purposes of this opinion, we refer to both entities as \u201cCAC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
