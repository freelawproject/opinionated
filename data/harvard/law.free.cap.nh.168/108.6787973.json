(Accurate Transport) and 41 Ashleigh Drive, LLC (Ashleigh Drive), on the basis that an abutter\u2019s appeal to the Derry Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) was untimely. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">The following facts are either undisputed or established by the record. In November 2012, Accurate Transport submitted a preliminary site plan application to the Derry Planning Board for approval to operate a \u201cDumpster Depot\u201d business on property owned by Ashleigh Drive. The property is located within the Town\u2019s Industrial III zoning district, which permits, among other uses, contractor\u2019s yards and freight and trucking terminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">On November 9,2012, prior to the Planning Board\u2019s review, the Technical Review Committee (TRC) held a meeting to evaluate the proposed site plan. The TRC is comprised of several Town representatives, including the code enforcement officer. The code enforcement officer believed that the proposed use of the property was permitted as both a contractor\u2019s yard and a freight and trucking terminal. The TRC approved the proposed plan, and, thereafter, the petitioners filed a formal site plan application with the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Planning Board held numerous public meetings. During several of the meetings, the Planning Board was advised that the code enforcement officer believed that the proposed use of the property was allowed as both a contractor\u2019s yard and a freight and trucking terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">On June 19, 2013, the Planning Board, in a seven-to-two decision, voted to accept jurisdiction over the petitioners\u2019 site plan application. A member of the Planning Board also moved to approve the application, subject to various conditions; however, the motion was subsequently withdrawn and the matter was continued to August 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">At the August 21 meeting, the Planning Board voted to approve the petitioner\u2019s application subject to several conditions, some of which differed from the conditions proposed on June 19. A written notice of decision was issued on August 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">On September 13, an abutter to the subject property, John T. O\u2019Connor, filed an application for administrative appeal with the ZBA. His appeal was captioned as an \u201cExplanation of Administrative Appeal of Code Enforcement\u2019s Decision to Determine Site is a Contractor\u2019s Yard and a Permitted Use for Dumpster Depot.\u201d The stated \u201cpurpose\u201d of the appeal was \u201cto show that the Code Enforcement Officer\u2019s decision was in error . . . when he determined that Dumpster Depot LLC falls under .. . Permitted Uses as a \u2018Contractors Yard.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The ZBA first considered O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal on October 3. To the extent that O\u2019Connor challenged the code enforcement officer\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>regarding the proposed use of the property, the ZBA denied the appeal based upon lack of jurisdiction because it deemed the appeal untimely. However, the ZBA decided that, because the appeal \u201calso contain[ed] timely allegations relating to the Planning Board\u2019s\u201d interpretation and/or application of the zoning ordinance in its August 21 decision, it would \u201cconvert\u201d O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal to an appeal of that decision, and, therefore, it would construe the appeal as timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">On November 7, the ZBA held a meeting regarding O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal. After discussing whether the proposed use of the property was allowed in the Town\u2019s Industrial III zoning district, the ZBA concluded that the Town\u2019s zoning ordinance did not permit the proposed use under any classification. Therefore, the ZBA decided that, by approving the site plan application, the Planning Board \u201cerred in its construction, interpretation and/or application of the [Town\u2019s] Zoning Ordinance as it pertains to the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">After unsuccessfully moving for rehearing, the petitioners appealed to the trial court and, subsequently, moved for summary judgment. They argued, in relevant part, that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal was untimely and that the ZBA lacked authority to treat the appeal as an appeal of the Planning Board\u2019s August 21 decision. In an initial order granting the petitioners\u2019 summary judgment motion, the trial court noted that the Town\u2019s zoning ordinance allowed aggrieved parties 20 days from the date of a decision to appeal to the ZBA. Assuming, without deciding, that \u201cit was proper for the ZBA to re-characterize O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal,\u201d the court determined that his appeal was untimely as it was filed on September 13, which was more than 20 days after the Planning Board\u2019s August 21 decision. Accordingly, the court concluded that the ZBA had no authority to consider O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal, and, thus, granted the petitioners\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Both parties moved for reconsideration, agreeing that the court erred by misapplying the time standards contained in the Town\u2019s zoning ordinance. In its reconsideration order, the court explained that in its initial order, it found that the Town\u2019s zoning ordinance allowed 20 days from the date of decision for an aggrieved party to appeal to the ZBA; however, the court agreed with the parties that the ordinance \u201cin fact states that the time is 20 days <em>from a wrritten decision.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Observing that the written decision of the Planning Board was released on August 28, the court noted that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal (filed September 13) would be timely if he was appealing the final Planning Board site plan approval. However, the court concluded that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal did not challenge the Planning Board\u2019s approval. Rather, the court found that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal challenged only the code enforcement officer\u2019s determination that the proposed use of the subject property was permitted as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>contractor\u2019s yard. The court decided that the Planning Board accepted the code enforcement officer\u2019s interpretation on June 19 when it voted to accept jurisdiction of the appeal. Because that vote was published on July 19, the court concluded that O\u2019Connor had 20 days from July 19 to appeal to the ZBA. Given that his appeal was filed in September, the court determined that it was untimely. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Judicial review in zoning cases is limited. <em>Brandt Dev. Co. of N.H. v. City of Somersworth, </em>162 N.H. 553, 555 (2011). Factual findings by the ZBA are deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable, and the ZBA\u2019s decision will not be set aside by the superior court absent errors of law unless it is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that the ZBA decision is unlawful or unreasonable. RSA 677:6 (2008). We will uphold the superior court\u2019s decision unless the evidence does not support it or it is legally erroneous. <em>Brandt Dev. Co. of </em>N.H., 162 N.H. at 555. The interpretation and application of a statute or ordinance is a question of law, and we review the superior court\u2019s ruling on such issues <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">As a threshold matter, both parties request that we decide, in the first instance, whether the ZBA erred by \u201cconverting\u201d O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal to an appeal of the Planning Board\u2019s August 21 decision. Although we do not typically address matters that should be considered by the trial court in the first instance, <em>see, e.g., Bartlett v. Commerce Ins. Co., </em>167 N.H. 521, 535 (2015) (declining to decide issue in the first instance), we will address this issue because it involves the statutory authority of the ZBA, which is a question of law. <em>See Cmty. Res. for Justice v. City of Manchester, </em>154 N.H. 748, 753 (2007) (addressing issues in the first instance to the extent that they involved questions of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The petitioners argue that the ZBA \u201cacted unlawfully in \u2018converting\u2019 the appeal\u201d to an appeal of the Planning Board\u2019s August 21 decision because no statute grants the ZBA the ability to so act. They contend that, because O\u2019Connor challenged only the code enforcement officer\u2019s determination that the proposed use of the property was permitted, the ZBA was not authorized to treat O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal as an appeal of the Planning Board\u2019s August 21 decision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\"> Although the petitioners correctly observe that there is no statutory provision that explicitly <em>permits </em>the ZBA to \u201cconvert\u201d an appeal, there is also no statute that <em>prohibits </em>the ZBA from taking such action.Moreover, under RSA 674:33 (Supp. 2014), the ZBA has broad authority to hear and decide appeals on subjects within its jurisdiction. <em>See Ouellette v. Town of Kingston, </em>157 N.H. 604, 610 (2008) (concluding that \u201cthe ZBA may hear appeals <em>de novo, </em>based upon the broad powers granted to it by statute\u201d); <em>see also Peabody v. Town of Windham, </em>142 N.H. 488, 492 (1997) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>(\u201cThe [ZBA] has broad authority on subjects within its jurisdiction\u201d). Because the proper enforcement of zoning ordinances is specifically within the ZBA\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>see </em>RSA 674:33,1, the ZBA had authority to address the zoning issues raised in O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal. <em>See Dube v. Town of Hudson, </em>140 N.H. 135, 138 (1995) (stating that the ZBA \u201chas explicit statutory authority to review the planning board\u2019s construction of the zoning ordinance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The ZBA found that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal \u201ccontained] . . . allegations relating to the Planning Board\u2019s <em>terms, construction, interpretation and/or application </em>of the zoning ordinance\u201d at the August 21 meeting, and, thus, it decided to consider those allegations. Although the caption and stated purpose of O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal referenced only the code enforcement officer\u2019s determination that the proposed use of the property was permitted as a contractor\u2019s yard, the body of the appeal referred to, and challenged, actions taken by the Planning Board at the meetings on June 19 and August 21. Given the ZBA\u2019s broad authority and the content of O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal itself, we cannot conclude that the ZBA erred by finding that his appeal \u201ccontain[ed] . . . allegations relating to the Planning Board\u2019s\u201d August 21 decision and by then treating the appeal as an appeal of that decision. The ZBA\u2019s use of the term \u201cconvert\u201d does not render the substance of its decision improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Given the basis of our conclusion as to this issue, we need not address the Town\u2019s argument that the ZBA was constitutionally required to assist O\u2019Connor by interpreting his appeal to be a challenge of the Planning Board\u2019s decision. <em>See Olson v. Town of Fitzwilliam, </em>142 N.H. 339, 345 (1997) (\u201cWe decide cases on constitutional grounds only when necessary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Town next argues that the trial court erred by concluding that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal was untimely. The Town asserts that the \u201ccourt erred by ascribing the date of acceptance [of jurisdiction of the site plan application by the Planning Board] as the operative date from which Mr. O\u2019Connor had to file his appeal because that vote cannot constitute a decision or determination on the merits of the application.\u201d Rather, the Town contends that, because August 28 (the date the Planning Board\u2019s written August 21 decision was issued) \u201cis the operative date from which an administrative' appeal was to be filed, Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal was timely as he filed within 20 days of [that] date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Relying primarily upon RSA 676:5 (Supp. 2014) and our decision in <em>Atwater v. Town of Plainfield, </em>160 N.H. 503 (2010), the petitioners counter that the trial court correctly determined that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal was untimely as \u201cany decision made by the Planning Board regarding whether the [Dumpster] Depot was a permitted use ... was made, at the latest, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the June 19, 2013 meeting,\u201d when the Planning Board voted to accept jurisdiction over the petitioners\u2019 site plan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">RSA 676:5, III provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">If, in the exercise of subdivision or site plan review, the planning board makes any decision or determination which is based upon the terms of the zoning ordinance, or upon any construction, interpretation, or application of the zoning ordinance, which would be appealable to the board of adjustment if it had been made by the administrative officer, then such decision may be appealed to the board of adjustment under this section ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Atwater, </em>we observed that the \u201cplain language of RSA 676:5, III, . . . makes clear that when a planning board makes a decision applying or interpreting a zoning ordinance, that decision must be appealed to the zoning board of adjustment pursuant to the procedures set forth for appeals to the board of adjustment under RSA 676:5.\u201d <em>Atwater, </em>160 N.H. at 509. We found that the overall policy and purpose of RSA 676:5, III is best served by interpreting the statute to mean that \u201ca planning board decision about a zoning ordinance is ripe and appealable to the ZBA when such a decision is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Zoning determinations are often made by a planning board at the very beginning of the application review process, and subsequent decisions by a planning board are often based upon these zoning determinations. Allowing or requiring parties to wait until a final vote of the board before challenging zoning determinations would be inefficient, and would impose significant hardship on applicants seeking site plan approval. As a practical matter, it makes far more sense to resolve the question of whether a planning board\u2019s interpretation or application of the zoning ordinance is accurate as early as possible in the application review process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Applying these principles, we concluded that the petitioners\u2019 RSA 676:5 appeal period began to run on the date of the planning board\u2019s conditional approval of the site plan application because, on that date, the planning board decided the zoning issue. <em>Id. </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">In this case, the Planning Board voted to accept jurisdiction of the site plan application at the June 19 meeting. There was also discussion at that meeting as to whether the proposed use was permitted, and at least one of the two members who voted against accepting jurisdiction expressed the belief that the proposed use was not permitted. After the Planning Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>voted to accept jurisdiction of the site plan application, a motion was made to approve the site plan application subject to several conditions. According to the meeting minutes, however, that motion was subsequently withdrawn \u201cin light of the request from the applicant\u201d to modify some of the conditions and \u201cto allow the Board an opportunity to review the proposed conditions.\u201d Review of the plan was tabled until the August 21 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">During the August 21 meeting, the Planning Board\u2019s discussion focused primarily upon the proposed conditions. After modifying some of the conditions, the Planning Board voted to approve the application subject to the revised conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Given these facts, we do not agree with the petitioners that an appealable decision regarding zoning compliance was made at the June 19 meeting. Although the Planning Board discussed whether the proposed use was permitted at the June 19 meeting, and at least one of the two members who voted against accepting jurisdiction expressed the belief that the proposed use was not permitted, the motion made at that meeting to approve the site plan application was withdrawn. Thus, the only decision made on June 19 was to accept jurisdiction of the site plan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">According to the plain language of RSA 676:4,1 (Supp. 2014), which sets forth the \u201cprocedures to be followed by [a] planning board when considering or acting upon a plat or application submitted to it for approval,\u201d accepting jurisdiction of a site plan application is merely a procedural prerequisite to a planning board\u2019s consideration of the merits of an application. <em>See </em>RSA 676:4, I(b)-(c)(1). The statute provides that, once a planning board determines that an application is complete and sufficient to invoke jurisdiction, \u201cthe board shall begin formal consideration and shall act to approve, conditionally approve ..., or disapprove\u201d the application. RSA 676:4, I(c)(1); <em>see DHB v. Town of Pembroke, </em>152 N.H. 314, 318 (2005) (\u201cA planning board cannot consider whether to approve an application before it accepts that application as complete.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">By merely accepting jurisdiction of the site plan application on June 19, the Planning Board made no decision regarding zoning compliance. It was not until the August 21 meeting, at which the Planning Board voted to approve the application subject to various conditions, that the Planning Board rendered a zoning determination that was appealable to the ZBA. <em>Cf. Atwater, </em>160 N.H. at 511 (concluding that decision to conditionally approve site plan application constituted appealable decision regarding zoning issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Therefore, we hold that the ZBA did not err by treating O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal as an appeal of the August 21 decision. The trial court found, and the parties do not dispute, that the zoning ordinance provides a 20-day appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>period that begins on the date of a written decision. Accordingly, the 20-day appeal period as to the August 21 decision began to run upon the issuance of the written decision on August 28. Because O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal was filed September 13, it was within 20 days of August 28 and was, thus, timely. The trial court, therefore, erred by concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Nonetheless, the petitioners contend that when it accepted jurisdiction on June 19, the Planning Board also accepted the code enforcement officer\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d that the proposed use was permitted and that this \u201cdecision\u201d needed to be timely appealed. <em>See </em>RSA 676:5, 11(b) (defining \u201cdecision of the administrative officer\u201d that is appealable to the ZBA to be, in pertinent part, \u201cany decision involving construction, interpretation or application of the terms of the ordinance\u201d). The code enforcement officer, however, never made such a \u201cdecision\u201d here. The record reflects that he simply opined that the proposed use was permitted and, thus, he, along with the other members of the TRC, preliminarily approved the use before the petitioners filed a formal site plan application with the Planning Board. As the code enforcement officer recognized during a hearing before the ZBA, his recommendation was not binding as it was ultimately for the Planning Board to decide whether the proposed use was permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The petitioners also assert that the ZBA unlawfully extended the 20-day appeal period by converting the appeal on October 3, more than 20 days beyond any decision. However, in making this argument, the petitioners concede that the 20-day time period is a \u201cprocedural deadline for <em>filing </em>an appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is no dispute that O\u2019Connor <em>filed </em>his appeal on September 13, which was within 20 days of August 28. Accordingly, the ZBA\u2019s consideration of the appeal outside of the 20-day period is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The petitioners further argue that, \u201ceven assuming the ZBA was allowed to convert Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal and assuming the appeal was timely, the ZBA considered issues outside the scope of Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal and, as a result, acted unlawfully.\u201d According to the petitioners, because O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal \u201cchallenged <em>only </em>that the site qualified as a \u2018Contractor\u2019s Yard,\u2019 \u201d the ZBA erred by considering whether the proposed use qualified under any other permitted use. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">As we have determined, the ZBA did not err by finding that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal contained allegations relating to the Planning Board\u2019s August 21 decision approving the site plan application and by then treating the appeal as an appeal of that decision. Even assuming that O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal challenged only whether the site qualified as a contractor\u2019s yard, we cannot conclude that, by considering whether the use was potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>permitted under any other zoning classification, the ZBA exceeded its authority. <em>See </em>RSA 674:33. By considering whether the proposed use was permitted under any zoning provision, the ZBA demonstrated its willingness to review the petitioners\u2019 request for approval of the proposed use. <em>See id. </em>We cannot conclude that such action constituted legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Finally, the Town argues that the petitioners waived, and failed to preserve, any challenge to the merits of the ZBA\u2019s decision that the Town\u2019s zoning ordinance did not permit the proposed use and that, therefore, the Planning Board erred by approving the site plan application. We agree. The petitioners did not challenge the merits of the ZBA\u2019s decision in their request for rehearing before the ZBA or in their appeal to the trial court. <em>See NBAC Corp. v. Town of Weare, </em>147 N.H. 328, 331 (2001) (issue not preserved and deemed waived when plaintiff failed to address it in motion for rehearing before selectmen and raised it for first time in motion for reconsideration filed with trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
