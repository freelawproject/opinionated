On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court (Wageling, J.) erred by: (1) admitting detailed evidence that he physically abused his former girlfriend, Jessica Linscott; and (2) allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify regarding the effects of domestic violence on a victim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The pertinent facts are as follows. In September 2012, Linscott and her three-year-old son, J.N., lived with the defendant in his home in Plaistow. The defendant and Linscott were in a domestic relationship, but the defendant was not the father of J.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Both the defendant and Linscott repeatedly disciplined J.N. for certain behaviors. If J.N. \u201chad an accident or if he peed on the floor,\u201d the defendant made J.N. \u201cclean it up\u201d and would put him \u201cin the shower and rinse him off.\u201d The defendant would spray water in J.N.\u2019s face and J.N. \u201cwould fight back.\u201d When the defendant let go of J.N., J.N. would \u201cflop all over the tub\u201d and \u201cslip and fall and smash his head.\u201d The defendant would then yell at J.N. and put him back under the shower spray. Linscott testified that \u201cthis happened many times\u201d and each time it \u201ccontinue[d] until [the defendant] decided to shut the shower off.\u201d Sometimes Linscott put J.N. in the shower because she felt that if she \u201cdidn\u2019t do it..., when [the defendant] would do it, it would be worse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The defendant also disciplined J.N. by having him run outside and by spanking him. Linscott spanked J.N., too, \u201c[b]ecause [she] thought [she] had to\u201d and that if she did not do so, the defendant and Linscott would fight about it and the defendant \u201cwould do it, and it\u2019d be a lot worse.\u201d The defendant repeatedly told Linscott that \u201csomething was wrong\u201d with J.N. and that he \u201chad a mental problem and that he must have autism.\u201d At first Linscott did not believe the defendant, but \u201cthe more [the defendant] told [her J.N.] was doing things wrong, the more [she] paid attention\u201d and \u201cbelieved that something was wrong with\u201d J.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">In November 2012, J.N. began \u201chaving seizures.\u201d On one occasion, Linscott tried to call 911, but the defendant \u201cripped the phone out of [her] hand,\u201d telling her that she was an \u201cidiot\u201d because J.N. \u201chad bruises all over him\u201d and if she called 911 they would be arrested for abuse. The defendant continued to treat J.N. the \u201csame way as if [the seizures] weren\u2019t going on, because he thought [J.N.] was doing them to himself.\u201d Linscott testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>that, whenever J.N. had a seizure, the defendant \u201c[y]ell[ed] at him, [told] him to stop doing that, and then hit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On November 14, after J.N. had been displaying the seizure-type behavior for three or four days, the defendant and Linscott brought him to the emergency room at Exeter Hospital. Subsequently, J.N. was transported to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon because \u201che had fluid in... or around his brain.\u201d At Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Linscott was questioned by staff from the hospital and the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth and Families about abuse at home. She did not \u201csay anything\u201d because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to believe\u201d that J.N.\u2019s injuries were caused by the defendant. Linscott testified that a \u201cpart of [her] was scared to tell them\u201d and \u201cscared to admit that it was going on.\u201d Linscott was also interviewed twice by the police and denied that the defendant had physically abused her or J.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Two days later, the defendant picked Linscott up at the hospital and they left New Hampshire. J.N. remained in the hospital. Shortly thereafter, the defendant and Linscott were arrested in Florida. At the time of her arrest, Linscott was photographed with what appeared to be a black eye. When interviewed by the police following her arrest, Linscott initially denied that the defendant abused her or J.N., but later reported that she sustained the black eye when the defendant struck her and described \u201cthings that had happened\u201d at the home in Plaistow.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The defendant was charged with two counts of first degree assault alleging that, acting in concert with or aided by Linscott, he recklessly caused serious bodily injury to J.N., and two counts of second degree assault alleging that, acting in concert with or aided by Linscott, he knowingly caused certain bodily injury to J.N. He was also charged with five counts of endangering the welfare of a child for \u201cfailing to seek medical care for J.N. while J.N. was suffering seizures and/or other symptoms following a head injury,\u201d two counts of witness tampering, and one count of unlawful interception and disclosure of oral communications or telecommunications. At trial, Linscott provided detailed testimony regarding numerous instances in which the defendant physically abused her and J.N. At the close of the evidence, the defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that Linscott was lying and that any abuse suffered by J.N. was caused by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The jury acquitted the defendant of one of the second degree assault charges, but convicted him on the remaining charges. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\n<em>II. Linscott\u2019s Testimony Regarding Her Abuse by the Defendant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Before trial, the defendant sought to exclude, pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b), any evidence that he threatened or abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Linscott. The State objected, arguing that evidence of uncharged abuse of Linscott by the defendant was relevant to explain to the jury why Linscott did not report the abuse of J.N. and failed to disclose the abuse to the police. The State asserted that, because J.N. would not be testifying at trial, the jury would hear only Linscott\u2019s testimony and, therefore, her \u201ccredibility [was] pivotal in the State\u2019s case against the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">After hearing offers of proof and arguments by counsel and reviewing transcripts and other documents submitted by the State, the trial court determined that the defendant\u2019s abuse of Linscott was relevant to explain her fear of the defendant and why she participated in the alleged acts, as well as why she lied to the police. The court further found that there was clear proof that the defendant committed threatening and abusive acts against Linscott. Specifically, the court found that there was clear proof that the defendant \u201cpulled ... Linscott and dragged her to the stairs,\u201d and \u201cthen dropped her over the stairs and struck her in the face, requiring medical treatment.\u201d In addition, the court found that, \u201c[o]n approximately eight occasions, [the defendant] strangled\u201d Linscott and that he also \u201csmashed her head against doors and walls,\u201d and \u201cpulled out handfuls of her hair.\u201d It further found that, at one point, Linscott tried to call her mother and the defendant grabbed her \u201cphone and broke it in half.\u201d The court found that, on one occasion, Linscott \u201chad to push her way past\u201d the defendant in order to leave and that the defendant told her \u201cthat if he ever found out she was talking with someone about their situation, he would kill her.\u201d Finally, the court found that the probative value of the evidence that the defendant abused Linscott was not substantially outweighed by its prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The defendant argues that the court erred by allowing Linscott to testify at trial concerning his abuse of her. He contends that admission of such evidence violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"AHa\">Rule 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">N.H. R. Ev. 404(b). The purpose of Rule 404(b) is to ensure that the defendant is tried upon the merits of the crime as charged and to prevent a conviction based upon evidence of other crimes or wrongs. <em>State v. Beltran, </em>153 N.H. 643, 647 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>We review the trial court\u2019s ruling for an unsustainable exercise of discretion and will reverse only if the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Because the defendant appeals only the court\u2019s pretrial ruling on the admissibility of Linscott\u2019s testimony regarding her abuse by the defendant, and because the defendant has not demonstrated that he renewed his objection after Linscott testified at trial, \u201cwe consider only what was presented at the pretrial hearing.\u201d <em>State v. Russell, </em>159 N.H. 475, 483 (2009) (quotation omitted); <em>cf. State v. Smalley, </em>151 N.H. 193, 196 (2004) (trial evidence reviewed on appeal because defendant renewed his Rule 404(b) objection at the end of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We have established a three-part test for the admissibility of evidence under Rule 404(b): (1) the evidence must be relevant for a purpose other than proving the defendant\u2019s character or disposition; (2) there must be clear proof that the defendant committed the act; and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>Beltran, </em>153 N.H. at 647. The State bears the burden of demonstrating the admissibility of such evidence. <em>Id. </em>Here, the defendant argues that the State failed to meet its burden, challenging the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to the first and third prongs of the Rule 404(b) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In order to meet its burden under the first prong, the State is required to specify the purpose for which the evidence is offered and articulate the precise chain of reasoning by which it will tend to prove or disprove <em>an issue actually in dispute, </em>without relying upon forbidden inferences of predisposition, character, or propensity. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cThat chain of reasoning must demonstrate a sufficient logical connection between the acts and the permissible purpose for which the State offers the evidence.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>159 N.H. at 483 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). Thus, for prior bad acts to be relevant, the acts must be in \u201csome significant way connected to material events constituting the crime charged\u201d and not so remote in time as to eliminate the nexus. <em>Beltran, </em>153 N.H. at 647-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The defendant contends that our articulation of the relevance standard for admission of prior bad act evidence sets forth a higher standard than that required under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 401, and that evidence of uncharged acts of domestic violence committed by him against Linscott did not meet this standard. We need not decide whether the relevance standard under Rule 404(b) is \u201chigher\u201d than that under Rule 401 because we conclude that the proffered evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior abuse of Linscott met the standard we have articulated for admission of prior bad act evidence under Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>There was a significant logical connection between the defendant\u2019s abuse of Linscott and her failure to report the abuse of J.N. and the reason she lied to the police. Because J.N. was not testifying at trial, Linscott\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s abuse of J.N. was critical to the State\u2019s ability to prove the crimes charged against the defendant relating to J.N. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s abuse of Linscott was relevant for the non-propensity purpose of explaining her justifiable fear of the defendant that prompted her to delay reporting the defendant\u2019s abuse of J.N. and, later, to lie to the police. <em>See Beltran, </em>153 N.H. at 648 (evidence of defendant\u2019s physical abuse of witness relevant to explain her submission to defendant\u2019s demands surrounding murders and her delay in reporting); <em>cf. State v. Berry, </em>148 N.H. 88, 91 (2002) (evidence of defendant\u2019s physical abuse of victim relevant to explain her delayed reporting of sexual abuse); <em>State v. Connor, </em>19 A.3d 146, 148-51 (Vt. 2011) (evidence of history of defendant\u2019s abusive conduct toward victim relevant to establish credible context for assault when victim delayed reporting assault to police). Thus, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, evidence of the defendant\u2019s abuse of Linscott was in a significant way connected to material events constituting the crime charged. <em>See Beltran, </em>153 N.H. at 647-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The defendant further argues that his abuse against Linscott was not in some significant way connected to material events constituting the crime charged because the State failed to establish that Linscott \u201cengaged in any acts regarding [J.N.] because the [defendant] abused her.\u201d He maintains that \u201cthere was no evidence presented to the trial court that the abuse by [him] had any impact on [Linscott] in relation to [J.N.].\u201d Specifically, he argues that there was no evidence that Linscott herself stated that she acted as she did out of fear of the defendant. The defendant, however, has failed to provide us with a transcript of the offer-of-proof hearing or with the other transcripts and documents relied upon by the court in making its ruling. Without the transcripts or documents, we cannot conclude that the court unsustainably exercised its discretion in ruling that the State had met its burden under the first prong of Rule 404(b). <em>See State v. Hebert, </em>122 N.H. 1089, 1090 (1982) (concluding that, without transcript, we could not say that trial court abused its discretion in ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for return of property).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">To the extent that the defendant relies upon Linscott\u2019s trial testimony to support his argument that there was no evidence that her actions in relation to the abuse of J.N. were caused by her fear of the defendant, we decline to consider such testimony. The defendant has appealed only the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling and has not demonstrated that he renewed his objection to the evidence after Linscott testified at trial. <em>Cf. Smalley, </em>151 N.H. at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The defendant next argues that the court erred in its analysis under the third prong of Rule 404(b). Under the third prong, evidence of other, uncharged bad acts \u201cis admissible if the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>159 N.H. at 485 (quotation omitted). Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision upon something other than the established propositions in the case. <em>Beltran, </em>153 N.H. at 649. It is not, however, evidence that is merely detrimental to the defendant because it tends to prove his guilt. <em>Id. </em>Among others, the factors we consider in weighing the evidence are: \u201c(1) whether the evidence would have a great emotional impact upon a jury; (2) its potential for appealing to a juror\u2019s sense of resentment or outrage; and (3) the extent to which the issue upon which it is offered is established by other evidence, stipulation or inference.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>159 N.H. at 485 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u201cWe accord considerable deference to the trial court\u2019s determination in balancing prejudice and probative worth under Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also State v. Tabaldi, </em>165 N.H. 306, 323 (2013) (\u201c[W]e give the trial court broad latitude when ruling on the admissibility of potentially unfairly prejudicial evidence.\u201d (quotation omitted)). \u201cTo prevail, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>159 N.H. at 485 (quotation omitted). \u201cParticularly pertinent to determining this balance is whether the evidence is relevant to prove an issue that is actually in serious dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u201cFirst, we consider the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Determining the probative value of evidence entails analyzing <em>how </em>relevant it is. <em>State v. Costello, </em>159 N.H. 113, 123 (2009). Here, as the trial court found, this evidence \u201chas a strong tendency to explain that [Linscott] was afraid for her life,\u201d and to provide the jury with \u201ca better context to understand her actions and evaluate her credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The defendant contends that no matter what relevance this evidence may have had, it \u201cwas greatly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d He maintains that evidence of prior abuse committed by him against Linscott was \u201cunfairly prejudicial... [d]ue to the similar nature of the charged and uncharged conduct.\u201d He further maintains that such evidence \u201chad no other impact upon the jury other than to evoke a sense of horror or rebuke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In weighing prejudice, a trial court must consider \u201cthe nature of the other bad act. Some acts have a great emotional impact upon a jury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>have greater potential for appealing to a juror\u2019s sense of resentment or outrage.\u201d <em>Smalley, </em>151 N.H. at 200 (quotation omitted). \u201cUnfair prejudice is inherent in evidence of other similar crimes or prior convictions.\u201d <em>Beltran, </em>153 N.H. at 649 (quotation omitted). The degree of prejudice may depend upon the similarity of the other incidents to those for which the defendant is currently on trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged treatment of Linseott was evidence of abuse, as was the evidence of the charged treatment of J.N. However, such evidence was not likely to have any greater impact upon the jury than the charged acts. <em>See State v. Howe, </em>159 N.H. 366, 378 (2009). Evidence of the defendant\u2019s abuse of Linseott, an adult, would not likely engender a sense of horror or outrage more than would the evidence of the defendant\u2019s abuse of J.N., a three-year-old child. As we discussed, the challenged evidence is relevant to explain why Linseott delayed reporting the abuse of J.N. and lied to the police. In light of the State\u2019s proffer that J.N. would not testify at trial, Linscott\u2019s testimony was crucial to the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Thus, even though evidence of the defendant\u2019s abuse of Linseott may have been prejudicial, it was not \u201cso inflammatory as to substantially outweigh its probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling was not clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>See Beltran, </em>153 N.H. at 649-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>III. Expert Testimony on Domestic Violence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by allowing the testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness on domestic violence. Expert testimony is admissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 702 \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 702. The determination of the admissibility of expert testimony \u201crests, in the first instance, within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Searles, </em>141 N.H. 224, 227 (1996) (quotation omitted). We reverse its determination \u201conly if the appealing party can demonstrate that the ruling was untenable or unreasonable and that the error prejudiced the party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">At trial, the State sought to introduce the testimony of Dr. Scott Hampton, an expert in the field of domestic violence. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court allowed Hampton\u2019s testimony. Hampton then generally described the nature and types of domestic violence. He testified about the progression of domestic violence in an intimate partner relationship and explained why victims often remain in a relationship despite continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>abuse. He explained why victims of such violence do not report, and lie about, the abuse and why a victim of domestic violence might fail to protect his or her child in an abusive situation. He further described the effects that a victim\u2019s child, who is a non-biological child of the perpetrator of the abuse, would have on the dynamics of a relationship involving domestic violence. Hampton stated that he had not reviewed any of the evidence in this case, and he did not give an opinion relative to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Relying upon <em>Searles, </em>the defendant argues that the court erred by allowing Hampton to testify about domestic violence because \u201csuch evidence is only admissible when a victim recants or otherwise minimizes the subject abuse during her testimony,\u201d and, here, Linscott \u201cnever minimized or recanted any of her statements about the abuse to which she was subject.\u201d Assuming that the defendant preserved this argument for appeal, we disagree with the defendant that <em>Searles </em>stands for the proposition that a victim of domestic violence must recant her statements or minimize the abuse in order for expert testimony on domestic violence to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In <em>Searles, </em>the defendant argued that the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce expert testimony concerning domestic violence syndrome in his trial for second degree assault against his girlfriend and their daughter. <em>See id. </em>at 225-26. He maintained that the expert\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because the victims did not minimize their injuries or the defendant\u2019s conduct in their trial testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 228. We disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 228-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Recognizing that courts in other jurisdictions have approved the use of expert testimony about the effects of domestic violence, we explained that domestic violence syndrome offers an explanation for particular actions and statements of domestic violence victims that may seem counterintuitive, such as a victim\u2019s recantation or minimization of abuse at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 227. When this sort of behavior is at issue, the testimony of a qualified expert may aid the jury in assessing the credibility of a domestic violence victim. <em>Id. </em>at 228. Given the testimony by the victims in that case, we held that the trial court did not err by concluding that evidence had been presented from which a jury could reasonably find that the victims had minimized their injuries and the defendant\u2019s actions and that this minimization would likely be puzzling to the lay observer. <em>Id. </em>at 228-29. In those circumstances, we concluded that expert testimony about domestic violence syndrome could provide a reasonable explanation for the victims\u2019 changed account of their injuries and the events in question. <em>Id. </em>at 229. We, therefore, determined that the expert testimony was properly admitted to assist the jury in evaluating the trial testimony of the victims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Our decision in <em>Searles, </em>however, is not as limited as the defendant suggests. Although in that case we referred to a domestic violence victim\u2019s recantation or minimization of abuse at trial, we did not state that those were the only circumstances in which expert testimony about domestic violence syndrome may be admissible. Rather, those were simply two examples of particular actions and statements that may seem counter-intuitive to a jury so as to allow for such expert testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 227-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Other jurisdictions have allowed expert testimony on the nature and effect of domestic violence in circumstances other than those involving recantation or minimization at trial. <em>See Com. v. Morris, </em>974 N.E.2d 1152, 1158 (Mass. App. Ct. 2012) (stating that expert testimony on domestic violence is \u201cadmissible to help jurors understand the potentially counterintuitive behavior of victims when assessing a victim\u2019s credibility\u201d); <em>State v. Grecinger, </em>569 N.W.2d 189, 197 (Minn. 1997) (holding that expert testimony on battered woman syndrome may be admissible in State\u2019s case-in-chief \u201cif it is introduced after the victim\u2019s credibility has been attacked by the defense, if it helps the jury understand the victim\u2019s inconsistent statements or delay in seeking prosecution of the batterer, and if the expert merely describes the syndrome and its characteristics and does not offer an opinion as to whether the victim suffers from it\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also State v. Ciskie, </em>751 P.2d 1165, 1170-74 (Wash. 1988) (discussing usefulness of expert testimony on battered women\u2019s syndrome to trier of fact). Thus, permissible expert testimony on domestic violence is not limited to only those cases in which a victim of domestic violence recants her statements or minimizes the abuse at trial. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument because it is based upon the faulty premise that Hampton\u2019s testimony was admissible only if Linseott recanted her statements or minimized the defendant\u2019s conduct at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">To the extent the defendant argues that the court erred by admitting Hampton\u2019s testimony because Linseott was a witness in this case and \u201cnot a victim of a charged crime,\u201d this argument has been insufficiently developed for our review. We, therefore, decline to address it. <em>See State v. Roy, </em>167 N.H. 276, 292 (2015) (declining to address an insufficiently developed argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that admission of Hampton\u2019s testimony unfairly prejudiced his case. He asserts that Hampton\u2019s testimony \u201cvilified [him] in the eyes of the jury\u201d and \u201cturned [Linseott] from a co-defendant/ accomplice into an uncharged victim.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Hampton testified exclusively in general terms about domestic violence relationships and why victims of domestic violence act in certain ways. He did not present opinion testimony based upon the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>case, nor did he opine as to the credibility of any witness. Hampton\u2019s testimony may have closely aligned with Linscott\u2019s description of abuse and therefore may have aided the jury in understanding her actions. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s suggestion, however, it did not transform his testimony into an opinion that the defendant was an abuser and Linscott a victim. <em>See Morris, </em>974 N.E.2d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Moreover, during Hampton\u2019s testimony, the court instructed the jury on several occasions that Hampton was not speaking about any of the individuals involved in this case. The court instructed the jury not to \u201cinfer in any way that because Dr. Hampton happens to refer to a he if he\u2019s talking about the abuser he means that all abusers are [men] or that it\u2019s in any way connected to [the defendant] in terms of his testimony.\u201d At the close of the evidence, the court further instructed the jury that it was \u201cnot bound by the opinion of the expert\u201d and was \u201cfree to ignore the expert\u2019s opinion if you find that the reasons given in support of the opinion are not sound or if you find that other evidence outweighs the opinion.\u201d The jury is presumed to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions, thus diminishing any potential for unfair prejudice from the admission of such testimony. <em>See Costello, </em>159 N.H. at 123. For these reasons, we do not agree with the defendant that Hampton\u2019s testimony invited the jury to base its decision upon something other than the established propositions in the case. <em>See Roy, </em>167 N.H. at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated that the trial court\u2019s decision to allow Hampton\u2019s testimony was untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion by admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
