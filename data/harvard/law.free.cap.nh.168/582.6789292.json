The defendants appeal rulings of the Superior Court <em>(Anderson, </em>J.) that: (1) Village Square of Hampton Condominium Association (Association) is governed by RSA chapter 292 (2010 &amp; Supp. 2015), entitled \u2018^Voluntary Corporations and Associations\u201d (hereinafter Voluntary Corporations Act), rather than RSA chapter 356-B (2009 &amp; Supp. 2015), the \u201cCondominium Act\u201d; and (2) Cotrupi has the right to use certain commercial parking spaces at the Condominium. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. The Condominium was created on August 11, 2006, pursuant to a declaration, which was recorded in the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds. The Condominium is a fourteen-unit building consisting of twelve residential units and two commercial units.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The declaration provides that fourteen of the parking spaces on the condominium property shall be commercial parking spaces shared by the owners of the two commercial condominium units. In 2007, Cotrupi purchased one of the commercial units. Cotrupi\u2019s warranty deed states that his unit \u201cis conveyed with the benefit of and subject to the Declaration.\u201d The deed also conveyed to Cotrupi \u201cthe exclusive right to use\u201d six of the commercial parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The Condominium\u2019s bylaws were recorded on the same date as was the declaration. The bylaws vest \u201c[t]he government of the condominium\u201d in the Association and provide that \u201c[a]ll [ojwners of [u]nits in the condominium shall constitute the Association.\u201d The bylaws state that: \u201cEach Unit shall be entitled to one vote.\u201d They also state that they \u201care adopted pursuant to\u201d and \u201care intended to comply with\u201d the Condominium Act. The bylaws further provide that: \u201cThe Association may be incorporated as a New Hampshire voluntary corporation and these By-laws shall serve as the By-laws of said corporation.\u201d In February 2007, the Association incorporated as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to the Voluntary Corporations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">In 2010, Roberge, through 428 Lafayette, LLC, purchased seven of the condominium units \u2014 six residential units and the remaining commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>unit. Almost immediately after Roberge purchased his units, other unit owners began complaining that he was violating the Association\u2019s bylaws. Disputes arose concerning his use of his commercial unit, as well as over parking and maintenance issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">Roberge\u2019s mother also owns two of the residential condominium units. She has historically given her voting proxies to Roberge, with the result that he had nine of the fourteen votes at Association meetings. In 2011, Roberge began serving as the Association\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In August 2013, the plaintiffs, condominium unit owners, brought this action against the defendants, seeking, among other things, various forms of injunctive relief, including: (1) \u201cthe appointment of a custodian or receiver of the Association for the duration of [the] litigation\u201d; (2) the removal of Roberge as the president of the Association; and (3) certain limitations on Roberge\u2019s voting rights. Cotrupi also individually filed an action against the defendants relating to, among other things, the use of commercial parking spaces at the Condominium. The trial court consolidated the actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On November 18,2013, following an evidentiary hearing, the Trial Court CMcHugh, J.) issued an order granting some of the plaintiffs\u2019 requested forms of relief. In its order, the court stated: \u201cIf the conditions do not improve then the plaintiffs have the right to petition for further relief from this Court and circumstances at that time might warrant a more severe Court response in terms of the management of the Condominium Association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In August 2014, the plaintiffs sought further relief from the court, including a finding that \u201cthe Association, as a corporation, is to operate in accordance with corporate princip[les] whereby each Director is afforded one vote on issues before the Board of Directors.\u201d After a hearing, the trial court ruled that the Association \u201cis governed as a nonprofit corporation [pursuant to the Voluntary Corporations Act], rather than a condominium [under the Condominium Act], for the relatively straightforward reason that it chose\u201d to incorporate. The court ordered the unit owners to \u201celect five directors\u201d and that \u201c[e]ach member shall have one vote \u2014 not one vote per unit.\u201d The defendants moved for reconsideration, arguing that the court erred in ruling that the Association is governed by the Voluntary Corporations Act rather than the Condominium Act. The defendants also raised an issue, not addressed in the court\u2019s order, concerning Cotrupi\u2019s right to use eight of the Condominium\u2019s commercial parking spaces not subject to his exclusive use. The court denied the defendants\u2019 motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\n<em>II. Governance of the Association</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred in ruling that governance of the Association is exclusively controlled by the Voluntary Corporations Act rather than the Condominium Act. They contend that: (1) application of the Condominium Act is mandatory; (2) the Association\u2019s bylaws prohibit the application of the Voluntary Corporations Act; and (3) application of the Voluntary Corporations Act, to the exclusion of the Condominium Act, will \u201cresult in the fundamental destabilization of countless condominiums.\u201d The plaintiffs counter that, as an incorporated entity, governance of the Association is exclusively controlled by the Voluntary Corporations Act and the Association\u2019s bylaws do not negate the Act\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Resolution of this issue requires us to engage in statutory interpretation. \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Autofair 1177, L.P. v. American Honda Motor </em>Co., 166 N.H. 599, 602 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603 (quotation omitted). \u201cWe first examine the language of the statute and ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Conant &amp; Faller, </em>167 N.H. 577, 580 (2015). \u201cAbsent an ambiguity we will not look beyond the language of the statute to discern legislative intent.\u201d <em>State v. Mayo, </em>167 N.H. 443, 450 (2015) (quotation omitted). !We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We interpret statutory provisions \u201cin.the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The Condominium Act applies \u201cto all condominiums and to all condominium projects.\u201d RSA 356-B:2,1 (2009). Under the Condominium Act, all condominiums must record \u201ca set of bylaws providing for the self-government of the condominium by an association of all the unit owners.\u201d RSA 356-B:35, I (2009). It further provides: \u201cThe unit owners\u2019 association may be incorporated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Voluntary Corporations Act governs voluntary corporations and associations, <em>see </em>RSA 292:1 (2010), :4 (2010), and provides that \u201c[t]he bylaws [of a voluntary corporation] may contain any provisions for the regulation and management of the affairs of the corporation not inconsistent with the laws of the state or the articles of agreement,\u201d RSA 292:6 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Neither the Condominium Act nor the Voluntary Corporations Act, however, contains language making it the exclusive Act governing condominium associations that incorporate. Because neither Act contains exclusivity language, we conclude that condominium associations that voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>incorporate, as in the present case, are subject to both Acts, including on matters of governance. Although not addressing the precise issue presented in this case, we note that other jurisdictions have utilized both the state\u2019s nonprofit corporation act and condominium act in addressing issues that arise with condominium associations incorporated as nonprofit corporations. <em>Cf. Grove Ass\u2019n v. Peraino </em>, No. 320685, 2015 WL 4249522, at *_ (Mich. Ct. App. July 14, 2015) (per curiam) (concluding that a bylaw provision of a condominium association incorporated as a nonprofit corporation, requiring approval of a supermajority of condominium owners before incurring legal expenses, was not void because, among other reasons, it did not conflict with Michigan\u2019s Nonprofit Corporation Act or Condominium Act); <em>Carolina Marlin Club Marina v. Freddy, </em>767 S.E.2d 604, 613 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014) (\u201cIn order to determine whether [the] notice [of a meeting given by a condominium association created as a nonprofit corporation] was proper, [the court] look[ed] to both the Condominium Act and the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act.\u201d); <em>Shioleno v. Sandpiper Condominiums Council of Owners, Inc., </em>No. 13-07-00312-CV, 2008 WL 2764530, at *3-7 (Tex. Ct. App. July 17, 2008) (determining that the condominium council, a nonprofit corporation that served as a condominium association, violated the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act, the Texas Uniform Condominium Act, and its own bylaws when it failed to allow a condominium owner access to the association\u2019s books and records).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In ruling that the Association is solely governed by the Voluntary Corporations Act, the trial court relied upon <em>Hobson v. Hilltop Place Community Assoc., </em>122 N.H. 1023 (1982). In <em>Hobson, </em>we held that Hilltop Place Community Association (HPCA), a nonprofit corporation, was governed by the Voluntary Corporations Act, not RSA chapter 479-A, the predecessor to the Condominium Act. <em>Hobson, </em>122 N.H. at 1025-27; <em>see Kilnwood on Kanasatka Condo. Unit Assoc. v. Smith, </em>163 N.H. 751, 753 (2012) (explaining that RSA chapter 479-A is the predecessor to the current Condominium Act). However, unlike in the present case, HPCA was not a condominium association that incorporated. Thus, <em>Hobson </em>is distinguishable. <em>See Hobson, </em>122 N.H. at 1024-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The defendants contend that the Association\u2019s bylaws prohibit the application of the Voluntary Corporations Act to the Association. They argue that, because the bylaws state that they were \u201cadopted pursuant to\u201d and \u201cintended to comply with\u201d the Condominium Act and that they \u201cshall serve as the By-laws\u201d of the Association if it incorporates, the Association is governed by the Condominium Act. Regardless of the provisions of the bylaws, however, the bylaws cannot negate the applicability of the Voluntary Corporations Act. <em>Cf. </em>18 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Corporations </em>\u00a7 16 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(\u2018Where a corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation or bylaws conflict with a statute under which the corporation was established, the statute controls\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The defendants also contend that the application of the Voluntary Corporations Act, to the exclusion of the Condominium Act, will \u201cresult in the fundamental destabilization\u201d of condominium associations. Because we conclude that condominium associations that incorporate are subject to both Acts, we need not address this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the Association is governed solely by the Voluntary Corporations Act. Because the court issued specific governance-related orders concerning the election of directors and voting allocation based upon its conclusion that only the Voluntary Corporations Act applied, we vacate those orders and remand the case to the trial court to consider the governance issues raised by the parties in light of our holding that condominium associations that incorporate are subject to both the Condominium Act and the Voluntary Corporations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\n<em>III. Commercial Parking Spaces</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The defendants next argue that the trial court erred in ruling that Cotrupi has the right to shared use of eight commercial parking spaces on the condominium property, in addition to his exclusive use of the remaining six commercial parking spaces. The defendants contend that, because Cotrupi\u2019s deed references an amended site plan that was never presented to the trial court or recorded with the registry of deeds, \u201cit is impossible to determine whether the Declarant intended for Cotrupi\u2019s deed to convey the exclusive use of six parking spaces, in addition to the eight remaining commercial spaces.\u201d The defendants assert that \u201c[wjithout an amended site plan, it is impossible to determine the deed\u2019s intent from its four corners\u201d and, thus, urge us to consider extrinsic evidence to determine its intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Resolving this issue requires us to interpret Cotrupi\u2019s deed. \u201cThe proper interpretation of a deed is a question of law for this court.\u201d <em>Lynch v. Town of Pelham, </em>167 N.H. 14, 20 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u2018We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a deed <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>\u201cIn interpreting a deed, we give it the meaning intended by the parties at the time they wrote it, taking into account the surrounding circumstances at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018We base our judgment on this question of law upon the trial court\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the language of the deed is clear and unambiguous, we will interpret the intended meaning from the deed itself without resort to extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf, however, the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the deed is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions and the circumstances surrounding the conveyance may be used to clarify its terms.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Cotrupi\u2019s deed states: \u201cSaid Unit is hereby conveyed together with the exclusive right to use those six (6) parking spaces designated as limited common area for said Unit as shown and noted on [the] plan ... to be recorded.\u201d It further states: \u201cSaid Unit is conveyed with the benefit of and subject to the [Condominium\u2019s] Declaration.\u201d Thus, the deed clearly and unambiguously grants Cotrupi the exclusive right to six commercial parking spaces and all the benefits stated in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The declaration provides: \u201cThe Commercial Unit owners shall have the right to park within the parking spaces designated as Limited Common Area for the Commercial Office Units on the Condominium Site Plan.\u201d Fourteen commercial parking spaces, including the eight in dispute, are designated as limited common area on the site plan recorded with the declaration. The declaration defines \u201c[l]imited [c]ommon [a]rea\u201d as \u201ca portion of the Common Area which has been reserved for the exclusive use of the specific Unit or Units to which the Limited Common Area is assigned.\u201d Thus, contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, in addition to being granted by deed the exclusive right to six commercial parking spaces, Cotrupi retains the right under the declaration to shared use of the remaining commercial parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it ruled that Cotrupi has the right to use his exclusively owned commercial parking spaces and the right to shared use of the remaining commercial parking spaces on the condominium property.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Lynn, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
