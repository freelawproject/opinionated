Sumner sought to inspect ballots cast in the town of Jaffrey during the 2012 general election. The defendant denied her request, citing RSA 659:95, II (Supp. 2015), which exempts ballots which have been cast from the Right-to-Know Law. On appeal, Sumner argues that RSA 659:95, II, along with RSA 660:16, II (2008) and RSA 669:33, II (2008) (collectively, \u201cthe ballot exemption statutes\u201d), violate several articles of the New Hampshire Constitution. We hold that the ballot exemption statutes do not violate our State Constitution, and, therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">The record supports the following facts. Sumner asked to inspect the Jaffrey ballots \u201c[t]o determine why 71 ballots . . . contained over votes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>therefore invaliding votes of 71 individuals,\u201d and to research \u201chow . . . ballots can be traced to a voter.\u201d When the defendant denied her request, Sumner sued in superior court, requesting, among other things, an order allowing her to review the Jaffrey ballots and a declaratory judgment that the ballot exemption statutes are unconstitutional. She then moved separately for permission \u201cto review [the] ballots as outlined in her complaint,\u201d which the trial court denied. The defendant moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\u2018When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Sabinson v. Trustees of Dartmouth College, </em>160 N.H. 452, 455 (2010). \u201cIf this review does not reveal any genuine issues of material fact, <em>i.e., </em>facts that would affect the outcome of the litigation, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Sumner first argues that the ballot exemption statutes violate Part I, Articles 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 22 of the New Hampshire Constitution. We read Sumner\u2019s brief to focus primarily upon Part I, Article 8, which states that \u201cthe public\u2019s right of access to governmental proceedings and records shall not be unreasonably restricted.\u201d N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 8. According to Sumner, \u201cthere is no legitimate privacy reason to exempt ballots from public review,\u201d and, thus, the ballot exemption statutes violate her constitutional right of access to governmental records.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\u201cThe constitutionality of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d New Hampshire Health Care Assoc. v. Governor, </em>161 N.H. 378, 385 (2011). \u201cIn reviewing a legislative act, we presume it to be constitutional and will not declare it invalid except upon inescapable grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThis means that we will not hold a statute to be unconstitutional unless a clear and substantial conflict exists between it and the constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIt also means that when doubts exist as to the constitutionality of a statute, those doubts must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cThe party challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">We have noted that the constitutional \u201cright of access [in Part I, Article 8] . . . must yield to reasonable restrictions.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Speaker, N.H. House of Representatives, </em>152 N.H. 276, 290 (2005). \u201cTo determine whether restrictions are reasonable, we balance the public\u2019s right of access against the competing constitutional interests in the context of the facts of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and emphasis omitted). \u201cThe reasonableness of any restriction on the public\u2019s right of access to any governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>proceeding or record must be examined in light of the ability of the public to hold government accountable absent such access.\u201d <em>Associated Press v. State of N.H., </em>153 N.H. 120, 125 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The State asserts an interest in preserving \u201cthe integrity, fairness, and efficiency of\u2019 the election process. We have noted that this interest is indisputably compelling. <em>See Opinion of the Justices (Voting Age in Primary Elections II), </em>158 N.H. 661, 670 (2009). It justifies the State\u2019s imposition of \u201ccertain eligibility requirements for voters . . . even though they limit a political party\u2019s ability to garner support and members,\u201d including the establishment of \u201can age qualification for voters,\u201d among other election regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">According to the State, the ballot exemption statutes promote its interest in two ways. First, the statutes prevent members of the public from accessing ballots, altering or hiding those ballots, and then challenging the results of an election. Such behavior would compromise the \u201cstrong public policy favoring stability and finality of election results.\u201d <em>Buonanno v. DiStefano, </em>430 A.2d 765, 770 (R.I. 1981). We observe that these risks, in part, supported one state court\u2019s determination to hold that copies of cast ballots were statutorily exempt from public records laws. <em>White v. Skagit County, </em>355 P.3d 1178, 1183 (Wash. Ct. App. 2015) (\u201cEach time ballots are handled, there is the potential to misplace, damage, or lose them.\u201d). Sumner\u2019s request presents a risk of even greater consequence because she seeks access to original ballots. If original ballots are damaged or lost and election results are subsequently challenged, the State may be unable to verify vote counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Second, the ballot exemption statutes protect voter privacy. According to the State, \u201csome ballots, such as those cast using [an] AW3 machine, those that are signed by the voter, and certain absentee ballots,\u201d may be traceable to voters, and the ballot exemption statutes prevent the public from identifying voters by inspecting those ballots. New Hampshire\u2019s elections laws have long preserved voter privacy. <em>See </em>Laws 1808, 49:4 (stating that a ballot with a marking on the back \u201cto distinguish the vote or voter\u201d will not be counted); Laws 1891, 49:23, :29 (penalizing voters for \u201coccupying] a marking shelf or compartment already occupied by another\u201d voter, placing \u201cdistinguishing mark[s]\u201d on ballots, or showing their ballots to others). Current election laws reflect this policy. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 659:23 (Supp. 2015) (requiring that ballots be handled \u201cso that the marks on [them] cannot be seen\u201d); RSA 659:35, II (Supp. 2015) (preventing voters from placing distinguishing marks on ballots); RSA 659:95-:100 (2008 &amp; Supp. 2015) (mandating the process for sealing and certifying ballots after they are cast).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Sumner\u2019s principal reason for requesting access to the Jaffrey ballots is to ensure that the town accurately counted its residents\u2019 votes. Although we recognize the legitimacy of this interest, we note that New Hampshire law enables public oversight of the vote counting process in ways that, unlike public ballot inspection, do not increase the risk of lost or damaged ballots, fraudulent election challenges, or infringement upon voter privacy. For instance, RSA 659:63 (2008) requires that vote counting be conducted in public, so that the public may observe the counting process as it occurs. Further, RSA 660:1 (Supp. 2015) and RSA 660:5 (2008) permit candidates to request recounts during which they or appointed representatives may inspect cast ballots to determine whether the ballots had been accurately counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Moreover, Sumner provides little support for the proposition that the constitutional right of access includes a right to inspect cast ballots. She cites two cases that were decided under the public records laws of other states. <em>See Price v. Town of Fairlee, </em>26 A.3d 26, 28 (Vt. 2011) (interpreting the Vermont Access to Public Records Act to allow access to ballots); <em>Marks v. Koch, </em>284 P.3d 118, 119, 124 (Colo. App. 2011) (interpreting the Colorado Open Records Act to allow access to ballots). Given that our statutes exempt cast ballots from our Right-to-Know Law, we find those cases unpersuasive. We also note that other states have interpreted their public records laws to exempt access to cast ballots. <em>See, e.g., White, </em>355 P.3d at 1184; <em>In re Decision v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>570 S.E.2d 897, 898 (N.C. Ct. App. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Given that New Hampshire\u2019s ballot exemption statutes promote the State\u2019s compelling interest in the integrity, fairness, and efficiency of elections, and that state law incorporates public oversight into the vote counting process, we find that, on balance, the State\u2019s interest outweighs the public\u2019s interest in access. We therefore hold that the ballot exemption statutes are reasonable restrictions under Part I, Article 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Sumner argues that the ballot exemption statutes facially violate other articles of the New Hampshire Constitution, including Part I, Article 11, which guarantees the right to vote, and Part I, Article 22, which protects freedom of speech. N.H. CONST, pt. 1, arts. 11, 22. However, Sumner provides no authority suggesting that the right to vote includes the right to inspect ballots. Sumner also fails to show how prohibiting access to already-cast ballots infringes freedom of speech. She cites <em>Rideout v. Gardner, </em>No. 14-cv-489-PB, 2015 WL 4743731, at *1 (D.N.H. Aug. 11, 2015), in which the federal district court ruled that a New Hampshire statute that made \u201cit unlawful for voters to take and disclose digital or photographic copies of their completed ballots\u201d was an invalid \u201ccontent-based restriction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>on speech that [could not] survive strict scrutiny.\u201d However, <em>Rideout </em>concerned acts of expression by individual voters \u2014 their disclosure of photographs of their ballots. <em>Id. </em>Here, Sumner does not explain how her inspection of ballots cast by others involves a similarly expressive act.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We reject, as underdeveloped, Sumner\u2019s remaining assertions that the ballot exemption statutes violate the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>See Keenan v. Fearon, </em>130 N.H. 494, 499 (1988) (\u201c[0]ff-hand invocations of the State Constitution [that] are supported neither by argument nor by authority . . . warrant[ ] no extended consideration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Sumner next argues that the trial court erred in rejecting, as a non-justiciable political question, her claim that the process by which the legislature enacted the ballot exemption statutes violated the New Hampshire Constitution. According to Sumner: the ballot exemption provisions were added to a bill without legislators knowing about them or having the opportunity to request that the attorney general verify the provisions\u2019 constitutionality; the provisions were not germane to the bill in which they were passed; the attorney general failed to encourage the legislature to repeal the ballot exemption statutes after they were enacted; and there were other alleged violations of the legislature\u2019s procedural rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\"> \u201cA controversy is nonjusticiable \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>involves a political question \u2014 where there is a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>152 N.H. at 288 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe authority to adopt procedural rules for passing legislation is demonstrably committed to the legislative branch by Part II, Articles 22 and 37 of the State Constitution.\u201d <em>Baines v. N.H. Senate President, </em>152 N.H. 124, 130 (2005). \u201cThe legislature, alone, has complete control and discretion whether it shall observe, enforce, waive, suspend, or disregard its own rules of procedure.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>152 N.H. at 284 (quotation omitted). Because Sumner\u2019s claim focuses upon alleged violations of the legislature\u2019s procedural rules, a ruling on that claim would have interfered in an area in which the constitution gives the legislature \u201ccomplete control and discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We, therefore, hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that Sumner\u2019s claim was non-justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Sumner also challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a court order allowing her to review the Jaffrey ballots. \u201cDecisions concerning pretrial discovery are within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>N.H. Ball Bearings v. Jackson, </em>158 N.H. 421, 429 (2009). \u2018We review a trial court\u2019s rulings on the management of discovery under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo establish that the trial court erred, [Sumner] must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly unten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>able or unreasonable to the prejudice of [her] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the request for the court order merely replicated Sumner\u2019s initial request, in her complaint, to review the Jaffrey ballots, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of the duplicate request was neither untenable nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Finally, Sumner argues that genuine issues of material fact precluded the trial court from granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. However, the disputed facts that she mentions in her brief do not affect the outcome of our decision, and are, therefore, immaterial. Having determined that the ballot exemption statutes \u2014 RSA 659:95, II, RSA 660:16, II, and RSA 669:33, II \u2014 do not violate the New Hampshire Constitution, we hold that the trial court did not err by granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
