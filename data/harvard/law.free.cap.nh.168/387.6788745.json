Palermo, was convicted on one count of aggravated felonious sexual assault, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(i) (2007), one count of criminal trespass, <em>see </em>RSA 635:2 (Supp. 2014), and two counts of simple assault, <em>see </em>RSA 631:2-a (2007). On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred by: (1) ruling that the State sufficiently authenticated certain Facebook messages; (2) admitting evidence of his prior incarceration, parole status, and civil lawsuit against the New Hampshire State Prison; and (3) allowing the State to introduce a photograph of him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The jury could have found the following facts. In 2011, the defendant and the victim\u2019s brother were inmates in the New Hampshire State Prison. Through her brother, the victim learned <em>that </em>the defendant needed assistance with a civil lawsuit he had filed /gainst the New Hampshire Department of Corrections and the State of New Hampshire. The victim agreed to provide such assistance. Between October 2011 and January 2012, while the defendant was incarcerated, he and the victim spoke on the telephone about the lawsuit and \u201cgot to know each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">On January 27, 2012, the defendant was released from prison and went to live with the victim and her family. That same day, the victim\u2019s son, D.L., age 16, created a Facebook account for the defendant and showed him how to send messages on the family\u2019s iPad from the Facebook application. D.L. also took a photograph of the defendant and \u201cposted\u201d it on the defendant\u2019s account. The defendant was allowed to use the iPad whenever one of the victim\u2019s other sons was at school or \u201cin bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">On the evening of February 3, 2012, while the victim\u2019s husband was at work, the victim, D.L., and the defendant were playing cards. The victim had a headache, and to help relieve it, the defendant began rubbing the victim\u2019s neck. The defendant\u2019s \u201chands got a little \u2018roamy\u2019 \u201d and the victim told him to \u201c[w]atch\u201d them. The defendant then moved both of his hands down the front of the victim\u2019s tank top, and put them on her breasts. She pushed him away and when she pulled up her tank top the defendant\u2019s hands went down the back of her pants onto her buttocks. The victim stood up, pushed him away, and \u201ctold him to cut it out.\u201d She and D.L. then went into her bedroom and locked the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant \u201cpopped the lock\u201d on the victim\u2019s bedroom door and asked if he could watch television with them. The victim agreed. The victim asked the defendant to pass her a box of candy. The defendant took a candy from the box, ran it up the victim\u2019s arm and down her chest, and then \u201cshoved it, along with his fingers, in [her] mouth.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>victim bit the defendant\u2019s fingers. He got upset and \u201cdemanded the iPad.\u201d The victim gave it to him and told him to leave the room. The defendant left and she locked the bedroom door again.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">A short while later, the defendant went back to the victim\u2019s bedroom, again \u201cpopped the lock\u201d on the door, and asked for the telephone. The victim gave it to him and told him to \u201c[g]et out.\u201d The defendant \u201cpopped the lock\u201d on the bedroom door two more times, looking for the keys to the victim\u2019s Ford Explorer, but the victim refused to give them to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Soon thereafter, the defendant left the house \u201cwith some type of tool in his hand,\u201d entered the Ford Explorer and, for a period of time, was \u201cunderneath the driver\u2019s seat with the door open.\u201d The defendant came back into the house shortly after 12:00 a.m. on February 4. At some point the victim fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Between 1:45 and 2:00 a.m., the victim began to awaken when she \u201cfelt rubbing\u201d on her back and buttocks, and then felt hands go inside her sweatpants. She felt the hands go from her \u201cbackside to [her] front side and down to [her] crotch area,\u201d and inside her vagina. When the victim rolled over, she realized that it was the defendant who was touching her.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The victim\u2019s husband, who had returned from work, was in the bathroom when he heard a noise that \u201csounded like the door opening, almost like a pop or a cracking type noise.\u201d He went to the bathroom doorway and saw the defendant sitting on the bed next to the victim. From his vantage point, it appeared that the defendant \u201chad his hands underneath the covers touching [the victim\u2019s] buttocks, groin; just about anything he could get his hands on.\u201d The victim\u2019s husband asked, \u201c[W]hat are you doing in my room?\u201d After a short pause the defendant left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">At about 8:00 a.m., the defendant told the victim that he was leaving. As the victim gave him a bag to use, he stated, \u201cLast night was terrible and I was hoping that you would give me a pass, Pm really sorry.\u201d The victim\u2019s husband heard the defendant ask the victim for \u201ca pass because he ... felt that what he did the night before was out of line.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the defendant left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Later that morning, D.L. opened the Facebook application on the family\u2019s iPad and the defendant\u2019s Facebook account appeared, indicating he had not signed out. The screen showed a message that had been sent by the defendant that day, stating: \u201cHey, how do you crack a Ford Explorer. I\u2019m going to kill someone in a minute.\u201d D.L. showed the message to the victim. The victim then discovered other Facebook messages sent by the defendant that day. She testified that the messages stated: \u201cI almost did the landlord\u2019s wife. Her husband walked in\u201d; \u201cshe\u2019s trying to play hard to get, Bro, I\u2019m gonna get mines\u201d; \u201cHe came home from work and walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>right in\u201d; \u201cKids want iPad . . . don\u2019t got much time left. . . . Give her my number . . . tell to call\u201d; and \u201cPm headed to Gloucester today, I\u2019ll be back later, love you, Bro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The jury found the defendant guilty of aggravated felonious sexual assault, criminal trespass, and two counts of simple assault. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\n<em>II. Facebook Messages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Before trial, the defendant sought to exclude all evidence of the Facebook messages unless the State could properly authenticate them. The State objected, and proffered evidence in support of authentication. Following an in-chambers hearing, the court ruled that, pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 901, the State\u2019s proffered evidence was sufficient to authenticate the Facebook messages as having been authored by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u201cThe decision to admit or exclude evidence is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Roy, </em>167 N.H. 276, 284 (2015) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn determining whether a ruling is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we consider whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary decision made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The defendant argues that the court\u2019s ruling on authentication was erroneous because: (1) \u201csomeone else could have sent the messages from [his] open Facebook account\u201d; (2) he \u201cpresented evidence that the [victim\u2019s] family had the opportunity to alter the Facebook messages\u201d; and (3) he \u201cpresented evidence that the messages submitted by the [victim\u2019s] family were altered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">We have not previously addressed the foundational requirements for the authentication of Facebook messages. After a review of the record, we conclude that our established rules governing authentication are sufficient to address the issues in this case. <em>Cf. Cotton v. State, </em>773 S.E.2d 242, 245 (Ga. 2015) (\u2018We have held that documents from electronic sources such as the printouts from a website like Facebook are subject to the same rules of authentication as other more traditional documentary evidence and may be authenticated through circumstantial evidence.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>382 S.W.3d 545, 549 (Tex. Ct. App. 2012) (\u2018With respect to electronic communications \u2014 such as e-mails, text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>messages, and as in this case, Facebook \u2014 the rules of evidence, including rule 901, are considered at least generally adequate to the task.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Rule 901(a) provides that \u201c[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 901(a). \u201cThe bar for authentication of evidence is not particularly high.\u201d <em>State v. Stangle, </em>166 N.H. 407, 409 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe proof necessary to connect an evidentiary exhibit to a defendant may be made by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe proponent need not rule out all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity, or prove beyond any doubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted). The State need only demonstrate a rational basis from which to conclude that the exhibit did, in fact, belong to the defendant. <em>State v. Ruggiero, </em>163 N.H. 129, 136 (2011). \u201c[T]he contested evidence, if otherwise relevant, should be admitted once a prima facie case has been made on the issue of authentication.\u201d <em>Stangle, </em>166 N.H. at 409 (quotation omitted). \u201cOnce the evidence is admitted, the rest is up to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Although Rule 901(a) requires the proponent to present evidence of authenticity, the rule does not establish formal requirements as to the nature or quantum of proof. <em>Id. </em>Rather, Rule 901(b) provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of methods of authentication or identification that conform to the requirements of Rule 901(a), including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">(1) <em>Testimony of witness with knowledge. </em>\u2014 Testimony that a matter is what it is claimed to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\"><em>(4)Distinctive characteristics and the like. </em>\u2014 Appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">N.H. R. EV. 901(b)(1), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Here, the defendant first argues that the court erred by ruling that the State sufficiently authenticated the Facebook messages as having been authored by him because \u201csomeone else could have sent the messages from [his] open Facebook account.\u201d He contends that the State\u2019s proffered authentication evidence was insufficient because: (1) the messages lacked distinctive characteristics; (2) the recipient of the messages did not testify; and (3) it would have been easy for someone to make it appear as though he authored the February 4 messages because he had not signed out of his Facebook account. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In support of authentication, the State proffered that D.L. would testify that: (1) he took the defendant\u2019s photograph after the defendant moved in with his family; (2) he created a Facebook account for the defendant using the defendant\u2019s photograph; and (3) he showed the defendant how to use the family\u2019s iPad and the Facebook website. In addition, the State proffered that it would present evidence that the defendant used the iPad around the time the messages were sent, that the messages were sent from the iPad, and that the defendant\u2019s release from prison and subsequent arrival at the victim\u2019s home coincided with the creation of the Facebook account. The State also asserted that it would present evidence that the messages contained information only a few individuals would know and that the information pertained specifically to the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Moreover, the State presented the court with a printout of the Facebook message stream, which started on February 1, days after the defendant\u2019s arrival at the victim\u2019s home, and ended on February 4, the day of the alleged assault. As the court found, the messages referred to the author\u2019s recent incarceration and parole status, which the State proffered were consistent with the defendant\u2019s circumstances. Likewise, the February 4 messages referenced the author\u2019s conduct consistent with the State\u2019s proffer regarding the anticipated testimony of the victim, the victim\u2019s husband, and D.L. as to the defendant\u2019s conduct earlier that morning and on the evening of February 3. Additionally, the message stating, \u201cKid wants iPad don\u2019t got much time left\u201d was consistent with the State\u2019s proffer that the victim would testify that one of her other sons had the primary right to use the iPad. Thus, despite the defendant\u2019s assertion otherwise, the State\u2019s proffered authentication evidence contained sufficient identifying details to link the authorship of the messages to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We also are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the State had to present testimony from the recipient of the Facebook messages to sufficiently authenticate them. He points to our statement in <em>Ruggiero </em>that \u201cbecause of the potential for unauthorized transmission of e-mail messages, authentication requires testimony from a person with personal knowledge of the transmission or receipt to ensure its trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ruggiero, </em>163 N.H. at 136 (quotation and brackets omitted). In <em>Ruggiero, </em>the State sought to authenticate certain e-mails attributed to the defendant through the testimony of the e-mail recipients. <em>Id. </em>at 136-37. We examined what proof is necessary to authenticate e-mails and whether, in the context of that case, the recipients\u2019 testimony sufficiently authenticated the e-mails. <em>Id. </em>at 135-37. Accordingly, our statement was made in the context of the issue before us in that case. To the extent that our language in <em>Ruggiero </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>could have conveyed that recipient testimony is required to authenticate all e-mails and other electronic communication under all circumstances, we now clarify that this is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Finally, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the ease with which someone could have made it appear as though the defendant authored the February 4 messages because he failed to sign out of his Facebook account did not preclude authentication based upon the State\u2019s proffered authentication evidence. The State was not required to \u201crule out all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity, or prove beyond any doubt\u201d that the Facebook messages were authored by the defendant. <em>Stangle, </em>166 N.H. at 409. Rather, the State needed only to provide evidence sufficient to support a finding that the messages were authored by him. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 901(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The defendant also argues that the court erred because he presented evidence that the victim\u2019s family had the opportunity to, and did, in fact, alter the messages. Prior to trial, the defendant presented the court with documents from a \u201cFacebook experiment\u201d conducted by defense counsel. The documents included: (1) a printout of a mock Facebook message exchange printed directly from Facebook; (2) a printout of the mock Facebook message exchange that had been copied and pasted into a Word document; and (3) a printout of the mock Facebook message exchange that had been copied and pasted into a Word document and then altered. He contends that because the Word documents he presented to the court shared similar characteristics with the Facebook documents the victim and her family provided to the State, he demonstrated that the victim and her family did not print the messages directly from a Facebook page as they claimed and, thus, could have, and did, alter the messages. Under these circumstances, he asserts that the State\u2019s proffered evidence was insufficient to authenticate the messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Although the court did not make a finding concerning the \u201cFacebook experiment,\u201d we \u201cmust assume that the trial court made subsidiary findings necessary to support its general ruling,\u201d <em>In the Matter of Aube &amp; Aube, </em>158 N.H. 459, 466 (2009) (quotation omitted). Thus, we assume the court found that the defendant\u2019s evidence did not require the State to present further evidence to satisfy the foundational requirements for authentication. Based upon the State\u2019s proffered authentication evidence, as described above, we conclude that such a finding was a sustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion when it found the Facebook messages were sufficiently authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\n<em>III. Prior Incarceration, Parole Status, and Civil Lawsuit Against the</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\">\n<em>State Prison</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his prior incarceration, parole status, and civil lawsuit against the state prison. Prior to trial, the defendant sought to exclude evidence of his \u201cprior bad acts,\u201d arrests, and convictions pursuant to New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). The State objected, arguing that the evidence would not be used as character evidence, but rather \u201cto establish the context of the defendant\u2019s relationship with the victim and why she permitted him to parole to her home.\u201d The State maintained that any potential prejudice caused by the evidence could be addressed with a curative instruction. Following a hearing, the court ruled that the State was allowed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">to give evidence about how [the defendant] met [the victim], through her brother. That [the defendant was] in prison at the time, and that [the victim] helped [the defendant] with a lawsuit while [he was] in the prison, against the prison, but nothing to do with the underlying facts of the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The defendant argues that, although relevant, the evidence was unfairly prejudicial under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403 because it conveyed to the jury his prior criminal history. \u201cWe have recognized that evidence that provides context to a witness\u2019s statements or actions may have significant probative value.\u201d <em>State v. Towle, </em>167 N.H. 315, 323 (2015). \u201cNevertheless, where the probative value of that evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, it must be excluded.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\"><em>Roy, </em>167 N.H. at 285 (quotation omitted). \u201cUnfair prejudice is not, of course, mere detriment to a defendant from the tendency of the evidence to prove guilt, in which sense all evidence offered by the prosecution is meant to be prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cRather, the prejudice required to predicate reversible error is an undue tendency to induce a decision against the defendant on some improper basis, commonly one that is emotionally charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">\u201cThe trial court is in the best position to gauge the prejudicial impact of particular testimony, and what steps, if any, are necessary to remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>that prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThus, we afford considerable deference to the trial court\u2019s determination in balancing prejudicial impact and probative worth.\u201d <em>Towle, </em>167 N.H. at 324. \u201cIn determining whether a ruling is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we consider whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary-decision made.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>167 N.H. at 284 (quotation omitted). We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling on such an issue absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See id. </em>\u201cTo show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Here, the court admitted the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior incarceration, parole status, and civil lawsuit against the state prison for the limited purpose of providing context as to how the victim and the defendant met. Although the extent of the details of the evidence gives us pause, we cannot conclude that the court unsustainably exercised its discretion by admitting it. <em>See State v. Dedrick, </em>132 N.H. 218, 226 (1989) (\u2018We will not overturn the superior court\u2019s decision on appeal simply because we might have ruled differently.\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by State v. Ford, </em>144 N.H. 57, 62-63 (1999), <em>and State v. Spencer, </em>149 N.H. 622, 625 (2003). The criminal conduct underlying the defendant\u2019s prior incarceration was not introduced at trial. <em>Cf. State v. Russo, </em>164 N.H. 585, 590-91 (2013) (holding that lack of specifics regarding defendant\u2019s prior criminal conduct reduced prejudicial effect of reference to his parole status). Nor were any of the terms of his parole revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Furthermore, the court provided two limiting instructions to the jury. At the end of the victim\u2019s testimony upon direct examination, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">During the testimony of [the victim] you heard that the [defendant] was in prison at the time that she became acquainted with him. I am instructing you that you may not speculate as to why [the defendant] was in prison. And you may not consider that evidence as to his bad character or any \u2014 character evidence at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">The parties have stipulated that [the defendant] has never been convicted of a sexual offense. I allowed that evidence for a limited purpose, and that was to offer an explanation of how [the defendant] and [the victim] came to know each other and how he came to be living in her home at the time the alleged incident happened, and that\u2019s the only purpose for which you may consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the evidence. In your deliberations you may not consider the evidence that he was in prison for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">Similarly, in its final jury instructions, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">In this case you heard evidence during trial that [the defendant] was in prison. You may not speculate about why he was in prison. The parties agreed that [the defendant] has never been convicted of a sexual offense, nor was he in prison for any accusation or conviction for a sexual offense. This evidence was introduced for the limited purpose of explaining how the alleged victim and the [defendant] became acquainted and how he came to live with her and her family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">You are not to consider this evidence as to the [defendant\u2019s] general character and you may not infer that because he committed a different crime, he may have committed one or more of the crimes with which he\u2019s charged. You may only consider the evidence that he was in prison for the limited purpose for which it was admitted and that\u2019s the context in which he met the [victim].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Jurors are presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See id. </em>at 591. Thus, the court\u2019s instructions obviated any unfair prejudice that might have been caused by the admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Given the limited purpose for which the evidence was admitted, the lack of any specifics regarding the defendant\u2019s prior criminal conduct, and the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions, we cannot conclude that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion when it admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior incarceration, parole status, and civil lawsuit against the state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\n<em>TV. Photograph of the Defendant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">At trial, the State sought to introduce a photograph of the defendant that depicted him smoking a cigarette, wearing a closely-fitted knit cap, and wearing a t-shirt displaying a picture of a sword and a skull, and the word \u201cRedemption.\u201d The photograph also showed tattoos on the defendant\u2019s arms. The defendant objected, arguing that the photograph was not relevant and was unfairly prejudicial. The State asserted that the photograph was necessary to its explanation of why the victim did not call the police immediately following the assaults. The State maintained that the victim was afraid of the defendant and, thus, wanted to use the photograph to show the jury that the defendant was \u201ca big scary guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The court ruled that the photograph was inadmissible because the victim never testified that the defendant\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d scared her, the jury could see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that the defendant was a \u201cbig guy\u201d without the photograph, and the t-shirt the defendant was wearing in the photograph was prejudicial. Subsequently, however, the court allowed the State to introduce a redacted copy of the photograph with the defendant\u2019s t-shirt and arm tattoos blacked out. The State showed the redacted photograph to D.L. during his direct examination and appears to have referenced the photograph in its closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The defendant argues that the redacted photograph had no probative value and was unfairly prejudicial. The State argues that this issue was not preserved for our review because although the defendant objected to admission of the photograph before its redaction, he did not specifically object to the admission of the redacted photograph. It also asserts that admission of the redacted photograph was not error, but, even if it was error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the defendant has preserved this issue for our review. We need not decide whether admission of the redacted photograph was erroneous because we agree with the State that any error was harmless. <em>See State v. Ramsey, </em>166 N.H. 45, 47-48 (2014) (applying harmless error review to admission of evidence'assumed to be in violation of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence and State and Federal Confrontation Clauses).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u201cAn error is harmless only if it is determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the verdict was not affected by the error.\u201d <em>State v. Wells, </em>166 N.H. 73, 82 (2014) (quotation omitted). The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn error may be harmless if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight and if the inadmissible evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIn determining whether an error was harmless, we consider the alternative evidence presented at trial as well as the character of the inadmissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Here, for the jury to convict the defendant of the aggravated felonious sexual assault charge, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he \u201cknowingly engaged in sexual penetration of [the victim] through concealment or by the element of surprise by digital penetration of her genital opening before she had an adequate chance to flee or resist because she was asleep in bed at the time.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2,I(i). The alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on this charge included the victim\u2019s testimony describing the sexual assault and her husband\u2019s corroborating testimony. It also included the defendant\u2019s own statements in which he sought a \u201cpass\u201d and apologized for his behavior. <em>See People v. Grathler, </em>858 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>N.E.2d 937, 943 (Ill. App. Ct. 2006) (a defendant\u2019s apologies to victim could be construed as demonstrating his consciousness of guilt). The alternative evidence also included the Facebook messages stating: \u201cI almost did the landlord\u2019s wife. Her husband walked in\u201d; \u201cshe\u2019s trying to play hard to get, Bro, I\u2019m gonna get mines\u201d; and \u201cHe came home from work and walked right in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">As to the simple assault charges, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant \u201cdid knowingly cause unprivileged physical contact to [the victim] by grabbing her buttocks\u201d and \u201cby grabbing her breasts.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 631:2-a. With respect to these charges, the alternative evidence included the victim\u2019s testimony describing the assaults. It also included D.L.\u2019s testimony that he saw the defendant, who was rubbing the victim\u2019s neck, go \u201cfrom the [victim\u2019s] neck down [her] arms to her chest down to her butt.\u201d D.L. further testified that while this was occurring, the victim \u201cwas telling [the defendant] . . . stop, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Finally, for the jury to convict the defendant of the criminal trespass charge, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he \u201cknowingly entered and remained in a bedroom in a residence ... an occupied structure adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons therein in defiance of an order to leave which was personally communicated to him by [the victim] the owner or other authorized person.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 635:2. With regard to this charge, the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt included the victim\u2019s testimony that she told the defendant to leave the bedroom after he \u201cdemanded the iPad.\u201d She also testified that she told him to \u201c[g]et out\u201d after he \u201cpopped the lock\u201d on the bedroom door and asked for the telephone. She stated that, over the course of the evening she told the defendant to get out of her bedroom \u201cbetween... eight and eleven times,\u201d and that after the last time she did not invite him to come in. Both the victim and her husband testified that the defendant returned to the bedroom around 2:00 a.m. on February 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Given the overwhelming nature of the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and the cumulative and inconsequential nature of the redacted photograph in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt, we conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the photograph did not affect the verdict. Thus, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
