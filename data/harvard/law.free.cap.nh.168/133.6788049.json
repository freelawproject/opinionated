Ball, appeals an order of the 9th Circuit Court \u2014 Nashua Family Division <em>{Ryan, </em>J.) denying his motion to terminate his obligation to support the parties\u2019 eldest child because she had turned 18 and had graduated from high school. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">The pertinent facts are as follows. The respondent and the petitioner, Glenda J. Ball, were married in 1994 and separated in 2004. They have three children: a daughter born in 1995, a son born in 1997, and another son born in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">In July 2005, the parties entered into a separation agreement in Massachusetts requiring the respondent to pay the petitioner $519 in weekly child support until the \u201cemancipation\u201d of the parties\u2019 children. The agreement\u2019s definition of \u201cemancipation,\u201d consistent with Massachusetts law, required child support to continue after a child had attained the age of 18 or had graduated from high school provided that certain conditions were met. <em>See </em>Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 208, \u00a7 28 (West 2007) (amended 2011). Under the agreement, the respondent was obligated to pay support for a child until the child reached age 23 if the child was \u201cattending a post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>secondary accredited educational training school or a two-year or four-year accredited college program as a full-time student\u201d and was \u201cdomiciled in the home of a parent and . . . principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance due to enrollment in the educational program.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The parties agreed that their agreement would \u201cbe construed and governed\u201d by Massachusetts law and that it would be incorporated and merged with their divorce decree. As they requested, the parties\u2019 Massachusetts divorce decree incorporated their separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">According to the respondent and not disputed by the petitioner, the parties and their children relocated from Massachusetts to New Hampshire in 2008. In the fall of 2008, the parties\u2019 Massachusetts divorce decree was registered in New Hampshire. <em>See </em>RSA 546-B:47 (2007) (repealed and reenacted 2015). At that time, the parties requested the New Hampshire court to approve a partial stipulation purporting to modify their Massachusetts decree. In their 2008 partial stipulation, the parties agreed that the definition of \u201cemancipation\u201d contained in their Massachusetts decree was thereby \u201cstricken\u201d and that New Hampshire law would apply. The parties also agreed that the respondent\u2019s child support obligation would \u201cbe payable in accordance with New Hampshire law . . . until the parties\u2019 youngest child reaches the age of 18 or graduates from high school whichever is later.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA461-A:14, IV (Supp. 2014). The court approved the stipulation and ordered the respondent to pay $516 in weekly child support. In December 2008, it increased the weekly child support amount to $559.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In 2013, the respondent filed a petition to modify his child support obligations, alleging that, because the parties\u2019 daughter was 18 and had graduated from high school, his obligation to support her should be terminated. The petitioner objected, asserting that the Massachusetts decree required the respondent to continue supporting the parties\u2019 daughter because she was \u201cpursuing post-secondary education in an accredited college program as a full time student,\u201d was \u201cdomiciled in [the petitioner\u2019s] home,\u201d and was \u201cprincipally dependent upon [the petitioner] for her maintenance due to her enrollment in college.\u201d <em>See </em>Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 208, \u00a7 28. Although the petitioner acknowledged that the parties had entered into the 2008 partial stipulation, which had been approved by' the New Hampshire court, she argued that the court had \u201clacked jurisdiction and authority to modify the Massachusetts Order regarding the duration that [the respondent] had to pay child support.\u201d Relying upon the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), <em>see </em>RSA ch. 546-B (2007) (repealed and reenacted 2015), the trial court agreed with the petitioner and denied the respondent\u2019s motion to modify. The respondent unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Resolving the issues in this appeal requires us to interpret UIFSA. Although the respondent argues that UIFSA does not apply to this case, we disagree. UIFSA applies because Massachusetts issued a child support order in 2005, and UIFSA governs the jurisdiction of New Hampshire courts to enforce or modify that order. <em>See </em>RSA 546-B:39-:46 (enforcing order), :47-:52 (modifying order). Our review of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of UIFSA is <em>de novo. See In the Matter of Yaman &amp; Yaman, </em>167 N.H. 82, 86 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u201cUIFSA is a model act adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws at the behest of Congress . . . .\u201d <em>In the Matter of Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. 354, 358 (2010) (quotation omitted). UIFSA has been enacted in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. <em>Id. </em>at 359. New Hampshire first enacted UIFSA in 1997, effective January 1, 1998. <em>See </em>Laws 1997, 263:32. Since then, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has amended UIFSA twice, once in 2001, and again in 2008. <em>Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 359. In 2015, New Hampshire repealed the 1996 version of UIFSA and \u00e9nacted the 2008 version, which included the 2001 amendments thereto. <em>See </em>Laws 2015, ch. 75. The 2015 amendments to New Hampshire\u2019s version of UIFSA will become effective on January 1, 2016. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">To interpret UIFSA, we rely upon our ordinary rules of statutory construction. <em>Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 359. Under those rules, we are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We construe all parts of a statute together to effectuate its overall purpose and avoid an absurd or unjust result. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">We also rely upon the official comments to UIFSA. <em>Id. </em>When interpreting a uniform law, such as UIFSA, \u201cthe intention of the drafters of a uniform act becomes the legislative intent upon enactment.\u201d <em>Hennepin County v. Hill, 777 </em>N.W.2d 252, 256 (Minn. Ct. App. 2010) (quotation and brackets omitted). In addition, we have considered later amendments to UIFSA when \u201cthey provide insight into the intended meaning of New Hampshire\u2019s existing statute.\u201d <em>Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 361. Further, we consider the interpretation of UIFSA by other jurisdictions. <em>See Hill, 777 </em>N.W.2d at 256-57. The opinions from courts in other jurisdictions are relevant \u201cbecause uniform laws should be interpreted to effect their general purpose to make uniform the laws of those states that enact them.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 257 (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 546-B:56 (providing that RSA chapter 546-B \u201cshall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this chapter among states enacting it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>B. UIFSA in General</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">UIFSA applies when more than one state is involved in child support proceedings. <em>Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 359. It consists of nine articles that supply procedural and jurisdictional rules for three types of child support proceedings: (1) proceedings to <em>establish </em>a child support order in the first instance when there is no prior child support order; (2) proceedings to <em>enforce </em>another state\u2019s existing child support order; and (3) proceedings to <em>modify </em>an existing child support order issued by another state. <em>See id. </em>at 360; <em>see also </em>RSA 546-B:31-:38 (Articles 4 and 5 \u2014 establishing order), :39-:46 (Article 6 \u2014 enforcing order), :47-:52 (Article 6 \u2014 modifying order). In this case; we are concerned with Article 6 of UIFSA, which applies to modification of child support orders issued by another jurisdiction. <em>See </em>RSA 546-B :47-:52.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The purpose of UIFSA is to avoid conflicting child support orders issued by courts in different states. <em>See Wills v. Wills, </em>745 N.W.2d 924, 926-27 (Neb. Ct. App. 2008). UIFSA relies upon the concept of \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d to ensure that only one child support order will be in effect at any given time. <em>See LeTellier v. LeTellier, </em>40 S.W.3d 490, 493 (Tenn. 2001). A state that issues a support order has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over it, and \u201c[n]o other state may modify that order\u201d as long as the issuing state retains continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Section 205 of UIFSA, codified in New Hampshire as RSA 546-B:7, sets forth the circumstances under which the issuing jurisdiction retains and loses its continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its own support order. <em>See Lunceford v. Lunceford, </em>204 S.W.3d 699, 702-03 (Mo. Ct. App. 2006). Under that provision, \u201c[a]s long as one of the individual parties or the child continues to reside in the issuing state, and as long as the parties do not agree to the contrary, the issuing tribunal has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its order \u2014 which in practical terms means that it may modify its order.\u201d Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 205 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 340 (2005); <em>see </em>RSA 546-B:7. By the same token, \u201cif all the relevant persons \u2014 the obligor, the individual obligee, and the child \u2014 have permanently left the issuing state, the issuing state no longer has an appropriate nexus with the parties or child to justify exercise of jurisdiction to modify.\u201d Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 205 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 340. \u201cAlthough the issuing state loses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>jurisdiction to modify the child support order if all the parties leave the state, until the order is modified by another state in accordance with UIFSA, the issuing state\u2019s order remains in effect not only in the issuing state .but also in any state in which the order has been registered.\u201d <em>Lunceford, </em>204 S.W.3d at 703; <em>see id. </em>at 704 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">However, Section 205 of UIFSA \u201cdoes not confer jurisdiction to modify on another tribunal.\u201d Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 205 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 341. Sections 611(a) and 613 of UIFSA govern when a state obtains continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify the child support order issued by another state. <em>See </em>Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 444-45. In New Hampshire, Section 611(a) is codified as RSA 546-B:49, I, and Section 613 is codified as RSA 546-B:51.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Section 611(a)(1) of UIFSA provides that one state may modify a child support order issued by another state when the original support order is registered in the new state and the new state finds that: (1) the child, the obligee, and the obligor no longer reside in the state that issued the original order; (2) the petitioner seeking modification is not a resident of the new state; and (3) the respondent is subject to personal jurisdiction in the new state. Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611(a)(1) (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 442; <em>see </em>RSA 546-B:49, 1(a); <em>see also Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u201cThere are two exceptions to the rule of [Section 611(a)(1)] requiring the petitioner to be a nonresident of the forum in which modification is sought.\u201d Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 445. \u201cFirst, under [Section 611(a)(2)] the parties may agree that a particular forum may serve to modify the order.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>RSA 546-B:49, 1(b) (providing that the parties may file written consents in the original jurisdiction to allow a new state to modify the support order). \u201cSecond, Section 613 ... applies if all parties have left the original issuing state and now reside in the same new forum state.\u201d Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 445; <em>see </em>RSA 546-B:51.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Once a new tribunal modifies the child support order, that tribunal \u201cbecomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d RSA 546-B:49, IV; <em>see </em>Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611(d) (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 443. \u201cThe order of the modifying tribunal becomes the operative \u2018controlling order\u2019 and the modifying tribunal assumes continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the only operative child support order.\u201d Unif. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 444; <em>see Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\n<em>C. Parties\u2019 Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The parties dispute whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction in 2008 to change the duration of the respondent\u2019s child support obligation from that set forth in the Massachusetts support order. The petitioner argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to shorten the duration because doing so would not have been allowed under Massachusetts law. <em>See </em>RSA 546-B:49, III; <em>see also </em>Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611(d) (amended 2001), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 255 (providing that, \u201c[i]n a proceeding to modify a child-support order, the law of the State that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support\u201d). The petitioner, however, conflates subject matter jurisdiction with choice of law. As explained below, we conclude that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the parties\u2019 petition to modify their Massachusetts support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is jurisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought; the extent to which a court can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of things.\u201d <em>Hemenway v. Hemenway, </em>159 N.H. 680, 683 (2010) (quotation and brackets omitted). Subject matter jurisdiction constitutes \u201ca tribunal\u2019s authority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cAbsent subject matter jurisdiction, a court order is void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684. \u201cA party may challenge subject matter jurisdiction at any time during the proceeding, including on appeal, and may not waive it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cA court lacks power to hear or determine a case concerning subject matters over which it has no jurisdiction.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Muller &amp; Muller, </em>164 N.H. 512, 516-17 (2013) (quotation omitted). We review, <em>de novo, </em>whether the trial court in this case had subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u201cThe family division is a court of limited jurisdiction, with exclusive power conferred by statute to decide cases in certain discrete areas,\u201d including child support. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 490-D:2, I, II (2010). Because the powers and jurisdiction of the family division are limited to those conferred by statute, we look to the relevant statutes to determine whether the family division had subject matter jurisdiction in this case to change the duration of the respondent\u2019s child support obligation from that set forth in the Massachusetts order. <em>See Muller, </em>164 N.H. at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The trial court in this case had subject matter jurisdiction under Section 613 of UIFSA, codified in New Hampshire as RSA 546-B:51, to rule upon the parties\u2019 request for modification. RSA 546-B:51,1, provides: \u201cIf all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>of the parties who are individuals reside in this state and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state\u2019s child support order in a proceeding to register that order.\u201d Under this provision, New Hampshire had jurisdiction in 2008 to adjudicate the parties\u2019 request to modify their Massachusetts support order because \u201call of the parties who are individuals reside[d] in this state and the child [did] not reside in the issuing state.\u201d RSA 546-B:51, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Nothing in the plain language of RSA 546-B:51 otherwise limits the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a request to modify the support order issued by another state. The remaining section of RSA 546-B-.51, RSA 546-B:51, II, merely provides that, when exercising jurisdiction under RSA 546-B:51, a New Hampshire court must apply certain UIFSA provisions, including Article 6, \u201cand the procedural and substantive law of this state,\u201d and that certain other UIFSA provisions not relevant to the instant case do not apply. <em>See </em>RSA 546-B:51, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The petitioner does not dispute that RSA 546-B:51 governs this case. Nor does she dispute that the court had jurisdiction in 2008 to modify the <em>amount </em>of child support that the respondent was required to pay. Instead, she relies upon RSA 546-B:49, III, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state.\u201d The petitioner contends that, pursuant to this provision, because Massachusetts law would not shorten the duration of the respondent\u2019s child support obligation under these circumstances, the New Hampshire court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to do so. RSA 546-B:49, III is the New Hampshire version of Section 611(c) of UIFSA. <em>See </em>Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 611(c) (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">For the purpose of addressing the petitioner\u2019s argument, we assume, without deciding, that RSA 546-B:49, III applies to this case. <em>See </em>RSA 546-B:51 (providing that Article 6, which includes RSA 546-B:49, III, applies to proceedings under RSA 546-B:51); <em>see also </em>Unif. Interstate Family Support Act \u00a7 613 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 Part IB U.L.A. 454 (explaining that \u201cSection 611(c) [of UIFSA codified in New Hampshire as RSA 546-B:49, III] forbidding modification of nonmodifiable aspects of the controlling order still applies\u201d when a proceeding is brought under Section 613 of UIFSA, codified in New Hampshire as RSA 546-B:51).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">We disagree with the petitioner, however, that the trial court\u2019s alleged failure to comply with RSA 546-B:49, III deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In this regard, we find <em>Scott &amp; Pierce </em>instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In that case, as in the instant case, the issuing state was Massachusetts. <em>Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 356. While in Massachusetts, the parties agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to lengthen the duration of the husband\u2019s child support obligation, and that modification was approved by a Massachusetts court. <em>Id. </em>at 856-57. Thereafter, although the husband moved to New Hampshire, the wife did not. <em>Id. </em>She later filed a petition in New Hampshire to modify the amount of weekly child support. <em>Id. </em>at 357. The New Hampshire court granted the wife\u2019s petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We concluded that the New Hampshire court had jurisdiction to act upon the wife\u2019s petition to modify the Massachusetts order \u201cbecause the parents and their children no longer resided in Massachusetts and [the wife], who sought modification, did not reside here, although [the husband] did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360; <em>see </em>RSA 546-B:49, I. We explained that, once the New Hampshire court modified the amount of weekly child support set forth in the Massachusetts order, \u201cNew Hampshire became the issuing state, assumed continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the child support order, and obtained the authority to apply its own substantive law to any provision of the child support order that could have been modified under Massachusetts law.\u201d <em>Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. at 360 (quotation omitted). We further explained that Massachusetts law continued to govern those aspects of the Massachusetts order that could not be modified under Massachusetts law. <em>Id. </em>at 360-61. Thus, RSA 546-B:49, III establishes when a New Hampshire court must follow the law of the issuing forum. It does not affect the jurisdiction of a New Hampshire court to adjudicate a request to modify a child support order issued by another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Accordingly, even if, as the petitioner contends, the trial court violated RSA 546-B:49, III by applying New Hampshire law to the duration of the respondent\u2019s child support obligation, such would constitute an error of law rather than a jurisdictional defect. Thus, because applying New Hampshire law to the duration of the respondent\u2019s child support obligation is not a jurisdictional defect, the trial court\u2019s 2008 order is not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Therefore, the trial court\u2019s alleged legal error in applying New Hampshire law when modifying the duration of the respondent\u2019s child support obligation could be waived. Here, regardless of whether the petitioner\u2019s challenge might be barred by res judicata (an argument the respondent does not make), we conclude that the petitioner waived the alleged error by entering into the 2008 stipulation and by not arguing in the 2008 proceedings that applying New Hampshire law to the duration of the respondent\u2019s child support obligation was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Because the 2008 order is not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and because the petitioner waived any legal error in the 2008 order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>approving the parties\u2019 stipulation, the trial court erred by not extinguishing the respondent\u2019s obligation to support the parties\u2019 eldest child as required by the court\u2019s 2008 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b163-4\">Dalianis, C.J., and HlCKS, Lynn, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
