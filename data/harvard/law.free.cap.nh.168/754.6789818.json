The trial court ruled that neither respondent had a duty to provide a defense to Todd in a civil stalking action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The summary judgment record reflects the following pertinent facts. Todd, a Massachusetts resident, is a member of the New Hampshire Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC). He has been a member of the AMC\u2019s paddling committee since 1989 and was the committee\u2019s co-chair in 2009 and 2010. Todd has also served as the AMC\u2019s webmaster. The webmaster is \u201cresponsible for maintaining and updating the Chapter website.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Sally Leonard is also a member of the AMC\u2019s paddling committee. In January 2014, Leonard filed a stalking petition against Todd. <em>See </em>RSA 633:3-a (Supp. 2014). Leonard alleged that Todd \u201chacked\u201d her computer and broke her vehicle\u2019s window after she had voiced her opinion at an AMC meeting that Todd should not be allowed to participate in a paddling committee event \u201cdue to his history of aggressive behavior toward females.\u201d Leonard further alleged that she was afraid for her well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">At all relevant times, Todd was insured under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy and an umbrella liability policy issued to him by Vermont Mutual. After the stalking petition was filed, Todd notified Vermont Mutual of the action and requested that it provide a defense under one or both of the policies. Vermont Mutual informed Todd that it did not believe that either policy covered the allegations in the stalking petition and declined to provide him with a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">The AMC was insured by Hanover under an employment practices liability (EPL) policy and a nonprofit directors, officers and organizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>liability (D &amp; 0) policy. Todd informed the AMC of the stalking petition and requested that it notify Hanover to provide him with a defense. Hanover declined to provide Todd with a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In March 2014, the Circuit Court (.Bamberger, J.) held a final hearing on the stalking petition. The court found that Leonard \u201cfailed to sustain [her] burden of proof,\u201d and, therefore, the court did not issue a restraining order against Todd. Todd incurred approximately $18,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs in defending against the stalking petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In June 2014, Todd filed the present declaratory judgment proceeding, seeking a declaration that Vermont Mutual and Hanover owed a duty to defend him against the stalking petition and to reimburse him for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in defending against the stalking petition. In addition, he sought attorney\u2019s fees and costs for bringing the declaratory judgment proceeding. <em>See </em>RSA 491:22-b (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In its motion, Vermont Mutual argued that Massachusetts law governs interpretation of the policies because the policies are Massachusetts policies that were \u201cissued to [Todd,] a Massachusetts resident, to provide insurance coverage for his Massachusetts home.\u201d The trial court determined that Vermont Mutual had no obligation to defend Todd against the stalking petition under either Massachusetts or New Hampshire law. The court further found that Hanover had no duty to defend Todd. Accordingly, the court granted the respondents\u2019 motions and denied Todd\u2019s motions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">\n<em>II. Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Bovaird v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Admin. Servs., </em>166 N.H. 755, 758 (2014) (quotation omitted). If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment. <em>N. Sec. Ins. Co. v. Connors, </em>161 N.H. 645, 649 (2011). We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Resolution of this dispute requires us to interpret the language in the relevant insurance policies. Interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>Our analysis in interpreting an insurance policy begins with an examination of the insurance policy language. <em>Great Am. Dining v. Philadelphia Indem. Ins. </em>Co., 164 N.H. 612, 616 (2013). We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words in context, \u201cand we construe the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). This is an objective standard. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf more than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and an interpretation provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Pursuant to RSA 491:22-a (2010), the burden of proving lack of insurance coverage is on the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\n<em>III. The Duty to Defend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">An insurer\u2019s obligation to defend its insured is determined by whether \u201cthe cause of action against the insured alleges sufficient facts in the pleadings to bring it within the express terms of the policy.\u201d <em>N. Sec. Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. at 650 (quotation omitted). In considering whether a duty to defend exists based upon the sufficiency of the pleadings, we consider the reasonable expectations of the insured as to his rights under the policy. <em>Id. </em>An insurer\u2019s obligation is not merely to defend in cases of perfect declarations, but also in cases in which, by \u201cany reasonable intendment of the pleadings, liability of the insured can be inferred, and neither ambiguity\u2019 nor inconsistency in the underlying writ can justify escape of the insurer from its obligation to defend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In cases of doubt as to whether the complaint against the insured alleges a liability of the insurer under the policy, the doubt must be resolved in the insured\u2019s favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\n<em>A. Vermont Mutual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">On appeal, Todd argues that the trial court erred by ruling that he was not entitled to a defense under the Vermont Mutual homeowner\u2019s and umbrella liability policies. Applying both New Hampshire and Massachusetts law, the trial court determined that Vermont Mutual did not owe Todd a duty to defend because the allegations in the stalking petition did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under either policy. The court further found that the actions alleged in the petition did not constitute an \u201coffense\u201d under the terms of the umbrella liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">\n<em>1. Choice of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">We first turn to the choice of law issue. Our analysis is confined to the arguments presented by the parties. Todd contends that Vermont Mutual\u2019s duty to defend must be determined based upon New Hampshire law, and not Massachusetts law. Vermont Mutual maintains that Massachusetts law need only be applied if we determine that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the policies under New Hampshire law. We hold that the trial court did not err in its interpretation of the policies under New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Hampshire law. Accordingly, we need not conduct a choice of law analysis. <em>Cf. In the Matter of Muchmore &amp; Jaycox, </em>159 N.H. 470, 472 (2009) (noting that there was no choice of law issue because parties agreed that New Hampshire law governed).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\n<em>2. \u201cOccurrence\u201d Under the Homeowner\u2019s and, Umbrella Liability Policies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We next examine whether the allegations in the stalking petition constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d under either of the Vermont Mutual policies. This analysis begins with an examination of the policies\u2019 language. <em>Amica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mutrie, </em>167 N.H. 108, 111 (2014). Under both policies, Vermont Mutual promises to defend an \u201cinsured\u201d against a suit or a claim for damages caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined in the policies as \u201can accident\u201d \u201cwhich results, during the policy period,\u201d in bodily injury or property damage. Thus, unless the alleged injury is the result of an accident, there is no \u201coccurrence,\u201d and the policies do not provide coverage. The policies do not define the term \u201caccident.\u201d Nonetheless, in construing the word \u201coccurrence\u201d in insurance policies with similar language, we have concluded that \u201caccident\u201d means \u201can undesigned contingency, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">We have \u201cdeveloped two inquiries to determine whether an insured\u2019s act was an accidental cause of injury, one subjective, the other objective.\u201d <em>Marikar v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 395, 398 (2004) (quotation omitted). Under these inquiries, \u201c[i]f the insured did not intend to inflict the injury on the victim by his intentional act, <em>and </em>the act was not so inherently injurious that the injury was certain to follow from it, the act as a contributing cause of injury would be regarded as accidental and an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Malcolm, </em>128 N.H. 521, 524 (1986) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">As to the first inquiry, we have explained that an insured\u2019s act is not an accidental contributing cause of injury when the insured actually intended to cause the injury that results. <em>Marikar, </em>151 N.H. at 398. This inquiry is subjective, analyzing the actual intent of the insured. <em>Id. </em>Under the second inquiry, an insured\u2019s intentional act cannot be accidental when it is so inherently injurious that \u201cit cannot be performed without a certainty that some injury will result.\u201d <em>Amica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>167 N.H. at 112 (quotation omitted). The insured\u2019s intent is irrelevant to the inherently injurious test; rather, the analysis is objective and is \u201cconducted from the standpoint of a reasonable person in the position of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Our concern in conducting the inherently injurious analysis is with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>intentional character of the insured\u2019s conduct and its injurious natural consequences. <em>Energynorth Natural Gas v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>146 N.H. 156, 161 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Against this framework, we review the allegations in the stalking petition. In the petition, Leonard alleged that, after she had spoken against having Todd participate in a paddling committee event, Todd \u201chacked\u201d her computer and shattered a window on her vehicle. Because the objective \u201cinherently injurious\u201d inquiry is dispositive, we need not analyze Todd\u2019s subjective intent. <em>See Marikar, </em>151 N.H. at 398 (confining review to objective inquiry because whether alleged conduct was inherently injurious was dispositive). We agree with the trial court that Leonard\u2019s allegations describe conduct that is inherently injurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201cAn act is inherently injurious if it is <em>certain </em>to result in <em>some </em>injury, although not necessarily the particular alleged injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). We conclude that hacking another person\u2019s computer is certain to result in some injury. The word \u201chack\u201d means \u201c[t]o surreptitiously break into the computer, network, servers, or database of another person or organization.\u201d Black\u2019s Law DICTIONARY 827 (10th ed. 2014). A \u201chacker\u201d is defined as \u201c[sjomeone who surreptitiously uses or changes the information in another\u2019s computer system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reasonable person in Todd\u2019s position would foresee that surreptitiously breaking into another person\u2019s computer to use or change the information in the computer system would lead to some injury \u2014 whether it be injury to the computer, to the person, or both. <em>See Energynorth Natural Gas, </em>146 N.H. at 164-65 (holding that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cintentional discharge of toxic waste into a body of water was certain to contaminate that body of water\u201d and was, therefore, inherently injurious). Thus, the activity of hacking alleged in the petition cannot be described as accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">We reach a similar conclusion with respect to the allegation that Todd shattered a window on Leonard\u2019s vehicle. Because the causation of injury to the vehicle itself is inherent in the act of shattering the vehicle\u2019s window, it cannot be accidental. Moreover, some degree of the fear Leonard alleged to have suffered is certainly the natural consequence of having her computer hacked and her vehicle\u2019s window shattered. <em>See Jespersen v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>131 N.H. 257, 261 (1988) (concluding that some degree of mental and physical distress claimed to be suffered by discharged employee was natural consequence of being discharged).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Todd argues that the trial court erred by failing to consider Vermont Mutual\u2019s denial letter, which he claims \u201cestablishes that[,] at the time it denied a duty to defend, Vermont Mutual could not determine whether the Petition alleged conduct by [Todd] that was expected or intended to result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>in injury to\u201d Leonard. Todd, however, offers no evidence that the court failed to consider Vermont Mutual\u2019s denial letter. Nonetheless, even if the trial court failed to consider the letter, we find no error as the language in the denial letter is irrelevant to the determination of whether Vermont Mutual had a duty to defend Todd. That determination required only an examination of the allegations in the stalking petition and the express terms of the policies. <em>See N. Sec. Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. at 650. A review of the trial court\u2019s order establishes that it did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Todd further contends that the trial court erred in finding that his alleged conduct was not accidental because \u201c[n]ot all things that one could consider \u2018hacking\u2019 are inherently injurious, and, without more in the pleading, it was reasonable to conclude [his] actions were potentially harmless.\u201d For example, he contends that the alleged hacking could mean that someone else obtained access to his email account and sent inappropriate emails to Leonard or that he sent Leonard an email that she considered inappropriate. The allegation in the petition, however, does not suggest such potentially harmless conduct. Rather, the allegation is that Todd himself hacked Leonard\u2019s computer. As explained above, the nature of hacking belies the possibility that such an activity is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\n<em>3. \u201cOffense\u201d Under the Umbrella Liability Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">We next address whether the trial court erred by determining that the allegations in the stalking petition did not constitute an \u201coffense\u201d under the Vermont Mutual umbrella liability policy. Under this policy, Vermont Mutual promises to \u201cdefend an insured against a claim or suit for damages.\u201d \u201cDamages\u201d is defined, in relevant part, to mean \u201cpersonal injury covered by this policy and caused by an offense.\u201d The policy defines \u201coffense\u201d as one or more of the following: false arrest, detention or imprisonment, or malicious prosecution;\u201d \u201clibel, slander, or defamation of character;\u201d or <em>\u201cinvasion of private occupancy, </em>wrongful eviction or wrongful entry.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The dispute in this case centers upon the meaning of \u201cinvasion of private occupancy.\u201d The policy does not define \u201cinvasion of private occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Todd argues that the trial court erred by ruling that this phrase unambiguously refers to real property offenses and, therefore, does not encompass hacking. Relying upon <em>Town of Goshen v. Grange Mutual Insurance Company, </em>120 N.H. 915 (1980), he maintains that the phrase is \u201cambiguous as a matter of law and does not require a physical invasion of real estate.\u201d In <em>Town of Goshen, </em>however, we did not address the issue of whether the phrase \u201cinvasion of private occupancy\u201d can reasonably be construed to provide coverage for claims unrelated to real property. <em>See Town of Goshen, </em>120 N.H. at 917-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>In <em>Town of Goshen, </em>we examined the phrase \u201cother Invasion of the Right of Private Occupancy\u201d in an insurance policy to determine whether it referred to more than the right to be free from physical intrusions onto land. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that there need not be \u201can appreciable and tangible interference\u201d with physical property to constitute an \u201cinvasion of the right of private occupancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917 (quotation omitted). As a result, we found that the allegations in the underlying complaint concerning the effect of the planning board\u2019s actions on the development of the complainant\u2019s property, which caused substantial damages and denied the complainant\u2019s right to the free enjoyment of his property without due process of law, constituted an \u201cinvasion of the right of private occupancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917-18 (quotation omitted). Because we found that the phrase \u201cother Invasion of the Right of Private Occupancy\u201d lacked clarity as to the scope of coverage, we determined that the policy should be construed against the insurance company and in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 918. We therefore held that the subject endorsement provided coverage for the civil rights violation claims at issue in that case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Thus, <em>Town of Goshen </em>involved an examination of the relevant policy language in the context of an alleged interference with the use of real property, <em>id. </em>at 917-18, whereas, here, the allegations involve claims relating to an interest in personal property. Although the policy language at issue in this case is similar to the language we construed in <em>Town of Goshen, </em>we conclude that this case is distinguishable because, to the extent that the phrase is ambiguous, when read in the context of this case, it cannot reasonably be interpreted to encompass claims unrelated to real property. <em>See Bartlett v. Commerce Ins. Co., </em>167 N.H. 521, 531 (2015) (explaining that we will construe an ambiguity against the insurer only \u201c[i]f one of the reasonable meanings of the language favors the policyholder\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">As relevant here, the word \u201coccupancy\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he act, state, or condition of holding, possessing, or residing in or on something; actual possession, residence, or tenancy, esp. of a dwelling or land\u201d and \u201c[t]he act of taking possession of something that has no owner (such as abandoned property) so as to acquire legal ownership.\u201d BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY, <em>supra </em>at 1247. The interpretation of the phrase as encompassing only claims involving real property is supported by its conjunction in the policy provision with the phrases \u201cwrongful eviction\u201d and \u201cwrongful entry.\u201d \u201c[Ejviction\u201d means \u201c[t]he act or process of legally dispossessing a person of land or rental property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673. \u201c[E]ntry\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he act, right, or privilege of entering real property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650. Reading the provision in its entirety, we conclude that the offenses contemplated by the \u201cinvasion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>private occupancy, wrongful eviction or wrongful entry\u201d provision in the umbrella liability policy constitute offenses against some interest in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Other courts have similarly interpreted analogous language. In <em>Nichols v. Great American Insurance Companies, </em>215 Cal. Rptr. 416, 421 (Ct. App. 1985), the California Court of Appeal interpreted the phrase \u201c\u2018other invasion of the right of private occupancy\u2019 \u201d in a business liability policy to determine whether it covered an action against the insureds for airwave piracy. The insureds argued that the complaint set forth an invasion of the right of private occupancy because it alleged that they had invaded the underlying plaintiff\u2019s \u201cexclusive right to \u2018occupy\u2019 a certain microwave channel or frequency.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>215 Cal. Rptr. at 421. The court rejected this assertion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201cOccupancy\u201d ordinarily refers to \u201cthe taking and holding possession of real property under a lease or tenancy at will.\u201d The association of \u201coccupancy\u201d with real property in the instant case is reinforced by its conjunction with the words \u201cwrongful entry or eviction.\u201d \u201cEviction\u201d is a term almost exclusively associated with real property. We perceive that the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d contemplated by the business liability policies was the \u201cwrongful entry, eviction or other invasion of the right to private occupancy\u201d relating to some interest in real property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 421 (citations omitted); <em>see also Liberty Mut. Ins. v. East Central Oklahoma Elec., </em>97 F.3d 383, 390-91 (10th Cir.1996); <em>Red Ball Leasing v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>915 F.2d 306, 312 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>Waranch v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em>266 Cal. Rptr. 827, 828-29 (Ct. App. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Todd contends that interpreting the phrase to refer only to interests in real property would be \u201cmore appropriate\u201d if the provision defined \u201coffense\u201d as \u201cwrongful eviction, wrongful entry or <em>other </em>invasion of private occupancy.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) We are not persuaded. When construing an insurance policy, we look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context and read the policy as a whole from the vantage point of an ordinary person. <em>Great Am. Dining, </em>164 N.H. at 616, 619. As we have found, when we do so, the policy, language referring to \u201cinvasion of private occupancy, wrongful eviction or wrongful entry\u201d pertains to claims involving an interest in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Moreover, the cases from other jurisdictions cited by Todd are inapposite because, unlike the claims here, they address claims relating to real property. <em>See City of Glendale v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>No. CV-12-380PHX-BSB, 2013 WL 1296418, at *1, 3-4 (D. Ariz. Mar. 29, 2013) (insured sought declaratory judgment that insurer obligated to defend against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>claims that insured as landlord interfered with and discriminated against tenant trying to lease out private hangar space causing lost rent, interest, and lost value of business); <em>New Castle County, DE v. National Union Fire Ins., </em>243 F.3d 744, 747-48 (3d Cir. 2001) (insured sought declaratory judgment that insurer obligated to defend against action alleging that zoning and permitting decisions denied real estate developer his due process and equal protection rights); <em>Baer v. Western World Ins. Co., </em>No. 982309F, 2000 WL 33171048, at *1 (Mass. Super. Ct. Dec. 19, 2000) (insured sought coverage for claims against him involving bodily injury from lead poisoning occurring while an individual resided in a property owned by insured). Thus, those cases do not address the question presented here regarding whether the phrase can reasonably be construed to apply more broadly to allegations involving personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Accordingly, given its context in the language of the policy, we conclude that the phrase applies to claims involving an interest in real property. Because the allegation that Todd hacked Leonard\u2019s computer does not involve real property, it is not covered by the policy provision at issue. The trial court did not err in determining that Vermont Mutual had no obligation, under the umbrella policy, to defend Todd against the stalking petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\n<em>B. Hanover</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Todd contends that the trial court erred in determining that Hanover was not obligated to provide a defense under either the EPL policy or the D &amp; O policy. The trial court concluded that Todd\u2019s alleged actions did not fall within the scope of his employment with the AMC and, therefore, he was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the terms of the EPL policy. As to the D &amp; O policy, the court determined that the conduct alleged in the stalking petition did not constitute a \u201cwrongful act\u201d under the policy terms. We will address Todd\u2019s challenges to the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding each policy in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">\n<em>1. EPL Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Hanover\u2019s EPL policy provides that Hanover \u201cwill pay on behalf of the \u2018insureds\u2019, all \u2018loss\u2019which [the insured is] legally obligated to pay because of \u2018claims\u2019 first made against [the insured] during the \u2018policy period\u2019 and reported to [Hanover] in accordance with [section VII of the policy] for any \u2018wrongful act\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d The policy defines \u201cinsured,\u201d in relevant part, as: \u201cAny \u2018executive\u2019 of the \u2018insured organization\u2019 while acting solely within the course and scope of employment with the \u2018insured organization,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cAny past, present or future \u2018employees\u2019 of the \u2018insured organization\u2019while acting solely within the course and scope of employment with the \u2018insured organization\u2019. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Assuming, without deciding, that Todd qualified as an \u201cexecutive\u201d or \u201cemployee\u201d of the AMC, we conclude that the trial court did not err by determining that Todd\u2019s alleged conduct of hacking a computer and shattering a vehicle\u2019s window did not fall within the course and scope of his employment with the AMC and, therefore, he was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the terms of the EPL policy. We have said that conduct falls within the scope of employment if: \u201c(1) it is of the kind the employee is employed to perform; (2) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits; and (3) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer.\u201d <em>Tessier v. Rockefeller, </em>162 N.H. 324, 342-43 (2011) (quotation and brackets omitted). Although we have utilized this test in cases involving claims predicated on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, see, e.g., id.; Porter v. City of Manchester, 151 </em>N.H. 30, 39-40 (2004), we agree with the trial court that it is instructive here. <em>See Federal Ins. Co. v. Sandusky, </em>No. 4:11-cv-02375, 2013 WL 785269, at *6 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In the stalking petition, Leonard alleged that, the morning after speaking out against Todd\u2019s participation in an AMC paddling committee event, she \u201cwoke up to find [her] computer had been hacked.\u201d She further claimed that, the following day, she \u201cwoke up to find a window shattered on [her] Jeep.\u201d These allegations do not support a conclusion that Todd\u2019s alleged actions were of the kind that the AMC employed him to perform as a member of the paddling committee or as a webmaster. Nor is it reasonable to conclude that the alleged actions were performed with a purpose to serve the AMC in either of those roles.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Todd argues that the trial court erred by disregarding a letter sent to him from the AMC suspending him from all activities and operations associated with the AMC pending resolution of the stalking petition. He maintains that the language in the letter stating that his \u201csuspension is to remain in place pending ... the determination by the AMC regarding the validity of the allegations <em>related to your conduct while participating in club sponsored activities and endeavors\u201d </em>demonstrates that his alleged conduct was within the course and scope of his employment. (Emphasis added.) As explained above, however, the question of whether there was a duty to defend requires a court to compare the policy language to the facts pleaded in the underlying suit to see if the claim falls within the express terms of the policy. <em>See N. Sec. Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. at 653. The AMC letter to Todd was immaterial to this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Nonetheless, relying upon <em>Alvarez v. Coregis Insurance Company, </em>74 Cal. Rptr. 2d 110 (Ct. App. 1998), Todd contends that the court erred by determining that the alleged acts did not occur while Todd was \u201cacting solely within the course and scope of employment.\u201d In <em>Alvarez, </em>the California Court of Appeal examined whether an insurance company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>obligated to defend an employee who was charged with embezzling funds from the insured-employer. <em>Alvarez, </em>74 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 111. The policy at issue provided coverage to insureds \u201cwhen acting solely within the scope of their duties, office, or employment\u201d for the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 112 (quotation omitted). It further provided that the insurer would defend against \u201cclaims for damages alleging fraud, dishonesty, criminal acts or omissions, or unlawful profit or advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Noting that there was no definition in the policy of the term \u201cacting solely within the scope,\u201d the court interpreted the phrase to mean \u201cthat the alleged acts of wrongdoing must be connected with the business of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113 (quotation omitted). The court determined that the insurer had a duty to defend the employee, in part, because the employee was \u201ccharged with misusing her position as [the employer\u2019s] bookkeeper to embezzle funds. Ergo, the alleged wrongdoing is clearly within the scope of [the employee\u2019s] \u2022 employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Relying upon this interpretation, Todd argues that the stalking petition could fairly be read to encompass acts that were connected with the business of the AMC because his relationship with Leonard \u201cderived solely from their joint membership on the Paddling Committee, and because [Leonard] attributed the alleged misconduct to actions that occurred at AMC meetings.\u201d Simply because Todd and Leonard\u2019s relationship derived solely from their respective membership in the AMC does not render the alleged conduct connected to the business of the AMC. Nor does Leonard\u2019s allegation that Todd\u2019s conduct occurred after she spoke out against him participating in a paddling committee event mean that his alleged conduct was connected to the business of the AMC. Indeed, it could not reasonably be said that hacking a computer and shattering the window on another committee member\u2019s vehicle relates to the business of the AMC paddling committee. <em>Cf. Federal Ins. Co., </em>2013 WL 785269, at *7 (concluding that defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of minors was not actuated by his work as an executive-level employee of insured non-profit organization and, thus, defendant was not acting in his capacity as an employee of non-profit organization; therefore, claims against defendant were not covered by organization\u2019s insurance policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\n<em>2. D &amp; 0 Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">We next address whether the trial court erred by concluding that Hanover had no obligation to defend Todd under the terms of the D <em>&amp; </em>0 Policy. Under the D &amp; 0 policy, Hanover promised to pay a \u201closs\u201d on behalf of each \u201cinsured individual\u201d for any \u201cwrongful acts\u201d to which the insurance applies, except for certain \u201closs\u201d in which the \u201c \u2018insured organization\u2019 pays to or on behalf of the \u2018insured individual[\u2019] as indemnification.\u201d The policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>defines \u201cwrongful act\u201d to mean, in relevant part, \u201c[a]ny actual or alleged act... committed or attempted by... [a]n \u2018insured individual\u2019 <em>in his or her capacity as an \u2018insured, individual\u2019 \u201d </em>or \u201c[a]ny <em>\u2018personal injury\u2019. \u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The trial court assumed that Todd was an \u201cinsured individual\u201d under the policy, but, nonetheless, ruled that he was not entitled to a defense because the stalking petition could not be read to allege that Todd committed a \u201cwrongful act.\u201d The court determined that Todd\u2019s \u201calleged actions were not committed in his capacity as AMC\u2019s webmaster or as a member of the paddling committee.\u201d It further concluded that the alleged acts did not constitute a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as defined in the policy. (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Todd argues that the trial court erred by determining that his alleged conduct was not committed in his capacity as an \u201cinsured individual.\u201d He contends that, because the allegations suggest that his alleged conduct was done in retaliation for Leonard speaking out against his participation in a paddling committee event, the alleged conduct \u201carises from and is directly related to [his] membership on the Paddling Committee.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">In this context, \u201ccapacity\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he role in which one performs an act; esp., someone\u2019s job, position, or duty.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY, <em>supra </em>at 249. Todd does not dispute the trial court\u2019s findings that the paddling committee is \u201cresponsible for planning, scheduling and implementing safe paddling and related activities\u201d and that the webmaster is \u201cresponsible for maintaining and updating the Chapter website.\u201d (Quotations omitted.) Given these responsibilities, it cannot be reasonably concluded that while allegedly hacking Leonard\u2019s computer or shattering her vehicle\u2019s window Todd was acting in his capacity as webmaster. Neither does the fact that Todd\u2019s alleged conduct occurred after Leonard spoke out against him participating in a paddling committee event reasonably support a conclusion that Todd was acting in his capacity as a paddling committee member when he allegedly committed the alleged conduct. <em>See Federal Ins. Co., </em>2013 WL 785269, at *7 (determining that there was nothing in the record \u201cto support the notion that Defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of minors was actuated by a purpose to serve\u201d non-profit organization, or was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with insured\u2019s role as an executive or employee of organization (quotation omitted)); <em>Sauter ex rel. Sauter v. Houston Cas. Co., </em>276 P.3d 358, 363 (Wash Ct. App. 2012) (concluding that, although insured\u2019s purpose in executing guaranty was to obtain line of credit for company, \u201cit does not follow that [insured], in so doing, was acting \u2018in his capacity\u2019 as CEO and manager \u2018on behalf of\u2019 \u201d company where facts clearly demonstrated that insured was acting in his personal capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Again relying upon the letter sent to him from the AMC, Todd contends that his alleged actions were committed in his capacity as an \u201cinsured individual.\u201d As we have explained, however, the letter from the AMC was immaterial to the trial court\u2019s determination of whether Hanover had a duty to defend Todd against the stalking petition. <em>See N. Sec. Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. at 658. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that Todd\u2019s alleged conduct was outside his capacity as an AMC paddling committee member or webmaster.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">Finally, with respect to the allegation that he hacked Leonard\u2019s computer, Todd argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the hacking did not constitute a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as defined in the D &amp; 0 Policy. Todd maintains that the trial court erred by interpreting the phrase \u201cother invasion of the right of privacy\u201d as referring only to claims involving an interest in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"ApgP\">Under the D <em>&amp; </em>0 Policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALTd\">\u201cPersonal Injury\u201d means any actual or alleged:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APr\">1. Defamation of character, libel, slander, or publication of material in violation of a person\u2019s right of privacy; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5u\">2. The wrongful entry or eviction or <em>other invasion of the right of privacy, </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAG\">3. False arrest, wrongful detention or imprisonment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-0\">Malicious prosecution; or xii</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVY\">Infringement of copyright or trademark, unauthorized use of title, plagiarism, or misappropriation of advertising ideas. lO</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">(Emphasis added.) The policy does not define the phrase \u201cother invasion of the right of privacy\u201d contained in the second definition of \u201cPersonal Injury\u201d (Definition 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Todd argues that, because in <em>Goshen </em>we found the language \u201cother invasion of the right of private occupancy\u201d did not require a physical invasion of real property, and held that language to be ambiguous, we should similarly find the language at issue in this case ambiguous and construe the provision against the insured. <em>See Goshen, </em>120 N.H. at 917-18. As explained, however, <em>Goshen </em>did not address the issue presented in this case \u2014 whether such language encompasses claims other than those involving an interest in real property. Reading the disputed language in the D &amp; 0 Policy in context, we conclude that it does not. <em>See Great Am. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number><em>Dining, </em>164 N.H. at 625 (\u201cWhere disputed terms are not defined in the policy, we construe them in context, and in the light of what a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to an ordinarily intelligent insured.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The \u201cinvasion of the right to privacy\u201d phrase in Definition 2 of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d immediately follows the phrase \u201cwrongful entry or eviction.\u201d As explained above, the words \u201centry\u201d and \u201ceviction\u201d relate to interests in real property. <em>See </em>BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY, <em>supra </em>at 650,673. It logically follows that the phrase \u201cother invasion of the right of privacy\u201d is \u201cintended to encompass actions of the same general type as, though not specifically embraced within, \u2018wrongful entry or eviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waranch, </em>266 Cal. Rptr. at 828-29 (applying principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to interpret phrase \u201c[o]ther invasion of the right of private occupancy\u201d (quotations omitted)). The \u201cother invasion of the right to privacy\u201d phrase \u201cis simply <em>part </em>of a more complete definition of \u2018personal injury\u2019 \u201d contained in Definition 2. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, we interpret the phrase \u201cother invasion of the right to privacy\u201d in Definition 2 as relating to claims involving interests in real property. <em>See Agway, Inc. v. Agway Petroleum Corp., </em>93-CV-557, 1993 WL 771008, at *20 (N.D. N.Y. Dec. 6, 1993) (interpreting identical phrase as referring to claims involving an invasion of real property).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Todd contends that the act of hacking \u201crequires an invasion of one\u2019s home\u201d because \u201cthe hacker must send and receive data\u201d and, therefore, the hacker \u201ccrosses the threshold of the victim\u2019s physical property.\u201d As explained above, however, we do not construe the act of hacking a computer to require the hacker to cross the threshold of the victim\u2019s real property. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 827 (defining \u201chack\u201d and \u201chacker\u201d). Although a hacker may intrude upon another\u2019s personal information as contained on his or her computer, we are not persuaded that this requires a physical invasion of real property so as to fall within the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the D &amp; O Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Accordingly, because Todd was not acting in his capacity as an \u201cinsured individual,\u201d and computer hacking does not fall within the definition of \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d we agree with the trial court that the allegations in the petition do not constitute a \u201cwrongful act\u201d under the D &amp; O Policy. We, therefore, conclude that Hanover had no duty to defend Todd.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b790-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and Lynn and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
