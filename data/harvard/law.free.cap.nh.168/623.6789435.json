Boutin, III, appeals his conviction, following a jury trial in Superior Court <em>(MacLeod, </em>J.), on one count of misdemeanor possession of marijuana. <em>See </em>RSA 318-B:2, I (2011). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">The jury could have found the following facts. On July 26, 2013, State Trooper McCarthy and Corporal Magoon of the Woodstock Police Department went to the defendant\u2019s residence to execute a warrant for his arrest and a warrant to search the premises for ammunition that the defendant was required to relinquish pursuant to a domestic violence order. A young girl, later identified as the defendant\u2019s daughter, answered the door and summoned the defendant from a back bedroom. The defendant was arrested without incident, and the police then began to search the residence. McCarthy testified that \u201cthere was an overwhelming odor of marijuana as soon as you walked into the apartment.\u201d He discovered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the source of the odor was the back bedroom from which the defendant had previously emerged. Inside the bedroom, McCarthy found, among other things, a substance that he believed to be marijuana. McCarthy photographed areas of the room before seizing certain items, including the suspected marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The defendant was charged with, among other things, possession of marijuana, and was tried before a jury. At trial, the State did not produce the marijuana seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment, but rather relied upon photographs and other documentary evidence, and the testimony of the police and the state laboratory worker who analyzed a sample of the seized marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">After the State rested its case, the defendant moved to dismiss the charge for possession of marijuana, arguing that \u201cthe state hasn\u2019t proven a prima facie case because there is no marijuana ... in evidence.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. The defendant again moved to dismiss at the close of his case, and the trial court again denied the motion. The defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana and now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in: (1) allowing a laboratory analyst to testify about a substance that was not introduced at trial; and (2) failing to dismiss the marijuana charge for insufficiency of the evidence. We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erroneously allowed the State\u2019s analyst to testify about the substance alleged to be marijuana. He argues that \u201cbecause the State failed to introduce the substance alleged to be marijuana into evidence, the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding that the substance tested by the analyst was the substance seized from [his] apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The State\u2019s analyst, Patrick Keough, a Criminalist II at the state police forensic laboratory, testified as an expert in the identification and analysis of controlled drugs. \u201cThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Laramie v. Stone, </em>160 N.H. 419, 429 (2010). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">\u201cOne of the most important prerequisites for the admission of the results of chemical tests for [drugs] is that the specimen analyzed shall be traced to the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Reenstierna, </em>101 N.H. 286, 287 (1958) (challenging admission of result of blood alcohol test in prosecution for driving under influence of intoxicating liquor). \u201cThe State is required to establish the essential links in the chain of evidence relied on to identify the [specimen] analyzed as being the [evidence] taken from the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Here, McCarthy testified that, after he seized evidence, including the marijuana, from the defendant\u2019s residence, he assigned each piece of evidence an identifier consisting of his initials \u2014 SAM \u2014 and a number. He then filled out an evidence examination request form, which instructs the laboratory whether to test or hold certain evidence, and secured the evidence in the evidence locker at the troop station. The evidence request form, which was entered as an exhibit, identified evidence sample SAM-3 as \u201cBaggie marijuana, straw, plastic container, rolling papers, [and] \u2018scraper,\u2019 \u201d and instructed the laboratory to test the evidence for marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Detective Sergeant Belanger of the state police testified that he transported the evidence in this case from the evidence locker to the state laboratory, having it in his possession the entire time. He also testified that he signed the evidence request form accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Keough testified that at the time the evidence was taken into the laboratory it was assigned a laboratory number, which is used to track evidence within the laboratory. That number is entered into the laboratory\u2019s evidence tracking system, and \u201clogged to a particular location in the laboratory,\u201d which, \u201c[is] a secure vault for the holding of evidence until it\u2019s analyz[ed].\u201d Keough testified that he retrieved the evidence in this case from the evidence locker and analyzed it. He testified that he examined the packaging of SAM-3 and determined that it was properly sealed. He performed a number of tests and concluded that the vegetative matter inside the packaging was marijuana. Thereafter, he logged the evidence back into the main evidence vault.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The defendant cites our observation that \u201c[g]aps in a chain of custody are most significant where the contested evidence is fungible, and not readily distinguishable by a unique feature or other identifying mark.\u201d <em>State v. Moscillo, </em>139 N.H. 79, 81 (1994). We noted in <em>Moscillo </em>that \u201c[generally, drug evidence is fungible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant contends that distinguishability of the evidence here was further diminished by McCarthy\u2019s use of his initials to identify the evidence, a practice the defendant contends McCarthy \u201clikely\u201d used on drug evidence in other investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Nevertheless, \u201cgaps in the chain [of custody] affect only the weight to be accorded proffered evidence,\u201d particularly when \u201cthe defendant produces no evidence of alteration or other foul play.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant contends that, although this rule might be warranted if the State had introduced the alleged marijuana or if the substance had, without the fault of the State, been lost or destroyed prior to trial, it should not apply when the State provides neither the substance nor \u201cany reasonable explanation for [its] absence.\u201d The defendant suggests no legal basis for this distinction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>and we can find none. We conclude that the State presented sufficient chain of custody evidence to allow its analyst to testify and, accordingly, we find that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion in admitting the analyst\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence challenge. \u201cA challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence raises a claim of legal error; therefore, our standard of review is <em>de </em>novo.\u201d <em>State v. Collyns, </em>166 N.H. 514, 517 (2014). \u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we view the evidence presented at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the State and uphold the jury\u2019s verdict unless no rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Graham, </em>142 N.H. 357, 360 (1997) (citation omitted). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The defendant argues that without the substance alleged to be marijuana in evidence at trial, \u201cno reasonable factfinder, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could have found that the substance was marijuana.\u201d The State counters that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s argument is against the weight of an overwhelming amount of legal authority holding that substantive drug charges may be proven beyond a reasonable doubt without admitting the actual drugs into evidence during trial, or even subjecting the drugs to forensic analysis.\u201d The State cites, for example, <em>United States v. Agueci, </em>310 F.2d 817 (2d Cir. 1962), in which the court held, with respect to the federal narcotics laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">[T]he jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance imported!,] sold, concealed, or adulterated was in fact a narcotic drug. . . . But it is not necessary that [this element] be proved by direct evidence. Just as with any other component of the crime, the existence of and dealing with narcotics may be proved by circumstantial evidence; there need be no sample placed before the jury, nor need there be testimony by qualified chemists as long as the evidence furnished ground for inferring that the material in question was narcotics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\"><em>Agueci, </em>310 F.2d at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Among the reasons given for this rule is that \u201c[illegal drugs will often be unavailable for scientific analysis because their nature is to be consumed.\u201d <em>United States v. Schrock, </em>855 F.2d 327, 334 (6th Cir. 1988). Thus, \u201ccourts have held that the government may establish the identity of a drug through cumulative circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The defendant cites this justification as a distinguishing factor between cases in which \u201ccircumstances outside the State\u2019s control \u2014 such as the defendant\u2019s dispossession of the substance prior to its seizure or the complete consumption of the substance during testing\u201d \u2014 and this case, in which, he alleges, \u201cthe prosecution is able to introduce the substance at issue, but simply chooses not to.\u201d We are not persuaded. In <em>Schrock, </em>upon which the defendant relies in part, the court noted that the rule is not only justified by \u201cthe limitations that [the] burden [of requiring scientific identification] would place on prosecutors,\u201d but that it also accords \u201cwith general evidentiary principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These principles, as alluded to in <em>Agueci, </em>310 F.2d at 828, establish that \u201c[a]though the State must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on all the essential elements [of the charged offense], it may rely on circumstantial, rather than direct, evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Noel, </em>119 N.H. 522, 527 (1979) (quotation omitted). We see no reason why this rule should not apply to proof that a substance is a controlled drug. Thus, even if the only evidence the State produced at trial had been circumstantial, introduction of the actual substance seized from the defendant\u2019s residence would not have been necessary to prove the substance was marijuana. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kelly, </em>14 F.3d 1169, 1174 (7th Cir. 1994) (\u201cA narcotics violation need not be proved by direct evidence; there is no need for a sample of the narcotics seized to be placed before the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Here, however, the State\u2019s evidence was not solely circumstantial. The State produced direct evidence through Keough that the substance he tested was marijuana. <em>See Wallace v. State, </em>215 S.E.2d 703, 705 (Ga. Ct. App. 1975) (holding that expert\u2019s testimony that powder tested by crime laboratory \u201ccontained cocaine was direct, not circumstantial\u201d evidence); <em>of. State v. Kelley, </em>159 N.H. 449, 454 (2009) (noting that \u201cchemical evidence does not constitute the sole form of direct evidence of [alcohol] impairment\u201d). In addition, as discussed above, the State presented sufficient chain of custody evidence for a rational jury to conclude that the substance tested by Keough was the same substance seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment. Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the defendant guilty of possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
