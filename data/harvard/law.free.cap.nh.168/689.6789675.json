The State argues that the trial court erred in ruling that the term \u201canother person,\u201d as used in RSA 638:26,1(a), refers to an actual, rather than a fictitious, person. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">The following facts are taken from the trial court\u2019s order or are undisputed by the parties. The defendant was charged with a number of offenses that arose from his \u201calleged use and attempted use of fraudulent credit cards, as well as his possession of the allegedly fraudulent credit cards and credit card numbers.\u201d He was indicted on three counts of identity fraud. <em>See </em>RSA 638:26. Each of these indictments charged that he \u201cpose[d] as Eli Watts with the purpose to defraud in order to obtain merchandise\u201d from a specific merchant. He was also indicted on several counts of receiving stolen property, <em>see </em>RSA 637:7 (2007); theft by unauthorized taking, <em>see </em>RSA 637:3 (2007); attempted theft by unauthorized taking, <em>see </em>RSA 629:1 (2007); RSA 637:3; theft by deception, <em>see </em>RSA 637:4 (2007); and attempted theft by deception, <em>see </em>RSA 629:1; RSA 637:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss all charges, arguing that the State had failed to \u201cprovide proof of the validity of the credit card numbers\u201d and proof that Eli Watts was a \u201cbona fide person.\u201d The State objected, arguing that it was not required to prove that Eli Watts was an \u201cidentifiable person\u201d; rather, the State argued, it was required to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>only that the defendant \u201cwas posing as someone other than himself in order to obtain the goods.\u201d At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the State conceded that Eli Watts was \u201ca person that the Defendant fabricated .... a fictitious person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">After the hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss with the exception of the three identity fraud charges. As to those charges, the court ruled that the \u201cplain language of [RSA 625:11, II] requires the State to prove, among other things, that [the defendant] posed as a \u2018natural person[,] corporation or unincorporated association.\u2019 \u201d In so ruling, the court considered the general definition of \u201cperson\u201d set forth in RSA 625:11, II (2007) of the Criminal Code. RSA 625:11, II provides: \u201c \u2018Person\u2019, \u2018he\u2019, and \u2018actor\u2019 include any <em>natural </em>person and, a corporation or an unincorporated association.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the State did not dispute that Eli Watts was \u201ca fictitious person,\u201d the court ruled that the indictments charging that the defendant \u201cpose[d] as Eli Watts\u201d were insufficient to allege that he posed as another person, as required by RSA 638:26, 1(a). The court specifically limited its ruling: \u201cThe court does not take up or decide here whether there are circumstances under which \u2018synthetic identity\u2019 fraud may be prosecuted under RSA 638:26 as it presently exists. \u2018Synthetic identity theft\u2019 occurs when \u2018someone creates a fictitious identity by combining personal information from one or more consumers with invented information, rather than using the identity of an existing individual.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The State filed a motion to reconsider the trial court\u2019s ruling, arguing, in part, that \u201cthe State did not intend to concede that Eli Watts is, in fact, a fictitious person. Rather, the State\u2019s argument has always been that it didn\u2019t matter whether Mr. Watts was a fictitious person or not.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, explaining that its original order \u201cwas based, in part, on the lack of dispute between the parties\u201d that \u201cEli Watts was a fictitious, as opposed to a natural, person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The dismissed charges were severed from the remaining indictments, and the State reserved the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal. The defendant pleaded guilty to six charges under a capped plea agreement, and the State <em>nolle prossed </em>the remaining charges. The State then filed this appeal, in which it identifies the issue before us as \u201c[w]hether RSA 638:26, 1(a) 2007, in referring to an actor who \u2018[p]oses as another person with the purpose to defraud,\u2019 requires the State to prove that the defendant posed as an actual person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">We note at the outset that the trial court\u2019s ruling was based upon the sufficiency of the indictments that charged the defendant with identity fraud. <em>See State v. Champagne, </em>125 N.H. 648, 651 (1984) (setting forth test to determine sufficiency of indictment). Accordingly, we would ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>address only the sufficiency of the language in the dismissed indictments. However, given the record upon which the trial court based its decision and the issue set forth in the State\u2019s notice of appeal, we conclude that the issue before us is whether RSA 638:26, 1(a) requires the State to prove that a defendant posed as an actual person to obtain a conviction for identity fraud. Consistent with the trial court\u2019s limited ruling, we do not address whether the evolving evidence in this case \u2014 including the State\u2019s subsequent discovery that there is an actual person named Eli Watts \u2014 might be sufficient to obtain a conviction under RSA 638:26, 1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">To resolve the limited issue on appeal, we must engage in statutory interpretation, which is a question of law. <em>State v. Mayo, </em>167 N.H. 443, 450 (2015). In doing so, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s legal analysis. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">RSA 638:26,1(a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of identity fraud when the person ... [p]oses as another person with the purpose to defraud in order to obtain money, credit, goods, services, or anything else of value.\u201d \u201c \u2018Pose\u2019 means to falsely represent oneself, directly or indirectly, as another person or persons.\u201d RSA 638:25, II (2007). As we previously stated, RSA 625:11, II provides: \u201c \u2018Person\u2019, \u2018he\u2019, and \u2018actor\u2019 include any natural person and, a corporation or an unincorporated association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Not unlike its argument in the trial court, the State\u2019s argument on appeal is, at best, fluid. In its brief, the State argues that, because the definition of \u201cperson\u201d found in RSA 625:11, II contains the word \u201cinclude,\u201d it should be construed expansively to include fictitious or synthetic identities. <em>See </em>Hoofnagle, <em>Identity Theft: Making the Known Unknowns Known, </em>21 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 97, 98 n.6 (2007) (\u201cAlthough there is no authoritative definition of synthetic identity theft, cases typically involve the use of an individual\u2019s real Social Security Number and date of birth with a false name and address.\u201d). At oral argument, however, the State contended that because the information on the magnetic strip of the credit card used by the defendant belonged to a real person, this case was not about synthetic fraud. This argument was not made in the trial court; nor is it a subsidiary question of the issue identified in the State\u2019s notice of appeal. Accordingly, we will not address it. <em>See, e.g., State v. Blackmer, </em>149 N.H. 47, 48-49 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">We turn then to the limited question before us: To obtain a conviction for identity fraud under RSA 638:26, 1(a), is the State required to prove that the identity assumed by the defendant belonged to an actual, rather than a fictitious, person? We conclude that the State is required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">To interpret the language of RSA 638:26, 1(a), we construe the Criminal Code according to the fair import of its terms and to promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>justice. <em>Mayo, </em>167 N.H. at 450; <em>see </em>RSA 625:3 (2007). We first examine the language found in the statute, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>State v. Maxfield, </em>167 N.H. 677, 679 (2015). We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Although the State contends that the use of the word \u201cinclude\u201d in RSA 625:11, II requires us to construe this definition expansively to include a \u201cfictitious person,\u201d we decline to apply such a broad construction in the absence of direction by the legislature. We have previously held that the use of the word \u201cincluding\u201d generally limits the applicability of a statute to entities of the same type as those identified therein. <em>See Conservation Law Found, v. N.H. Wetlands Council, </em>150 N.H. 1, 6 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">As the defendant observes, when \u201cthe legislature intends to refer to a noun and to some fictional representation of that noun, it [does] so expressly.\u201d For example, the legislature has identified robbery as a class B felony when the defendant was either \u201cactually armed with a deadly weapon\u201d or \u201cReasonably appeared to the victim to be armed with a deadly weapon.\u201d RSA 636:1, III (2007); <em>see also </em>RSA 649-B:4 (Supp. 2015) (prohibiting use of computer to \u201centice a child or another person believed by the person to be a child\u201d to commit certain enumerated acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that, to obtain a conviction for identity fraud under RSA 638:26, the State must prove that a defendant posed as an actual, rather than a fictitious, person. To the extent that the State seeks a broader application of the statute, the appropriate forum in which to seek that result is the General Court. <em>See, e.g., In the Matter of Kempton &amp; Kempton, </em>167 N.H. 785, 803 (2015) (recognizing that matters of public policy are reserved for the legislature).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-9\">\u00dcALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, Lynn, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
