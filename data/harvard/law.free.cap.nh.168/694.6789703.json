Husband and the petitioner, Holly Doherty (Wife), both appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">The relevant facts are as follows. The parties divorced in January 2010. They had two minor children at that time. They entered into a stipulation, which was incorporated into the divorce decree that the trial court approved; in the stipulation, they agreed upon, among other things, the amount of monthly alimony and child support to be paid by Husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">In July 2014, after one of the parties\u2019 children had reached majority, Husband filed a petition seeking a modification of his child support and alimony obligations. Thereafter, Wife filed a motion for contempt, in which she asserted that Husband had significant child support and alimony arrearages. Following a hearing in August 2014, the trial court issued the orders that are the subject of this appeal; in the orders, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>modified Husband\u2019s child support and alimony obligations and determined the amount of arrearages that he owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\n<em>I. Wife\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Wife argues that the trial court erred by: (1) including foster care payments that she received in her gross income for the purpose of modifying Husband\u2019s child support and alimony obligations; (2) terminating Husband\u2019s ongoing alimony obligation; and (3) concluding that it, a family division court, lacked jurisdiction to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement to share equally in certain litigation costs. \u201cWe will uphold an order on a motion to modify a support obligation absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Canaway &amp; Canaway, </em>161 N.H. 286, 289 (2010). We sustain the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidentiary support or tainted by error of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\n<em>A. Foster Care Payments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Turning to Wife\u2019s first argument, we provide the following background. In their stipulation, the parties agreed that, each month, Husband would pay Wife approximately $3,400 in child support and approximately $1,600 in alimony, for a monthly total of $5,000. They further agreed that alimony would continue for 15 years, and that if the child support obligation was reduced, alimony would be increased so as to maintain a total payment of $5,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">When deciding whether to modify Husband\u2019s child support and alimony obligations, the trial court found that, at the time of the parties\u2019 divorce, Wife\u2019s employment income was approximately $17,500 per month. However, at the time of the hearing in 2014, the trial court found that her monthly income comprised approximately $3,600 in employment income and approximately $5,700 that she received \u201cas a care provider for [two] disabled adults who reside[d] in her household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">After deciding to include the foster care payments in Wife\u2019s current income, the trial court concluded that it would be \u201cfair and equitable\u201d for Husband to pay $968 per month in child support pursuant to the child support guidelines. The trial court further determined that, because there had been a \u201csubstantial and unforeseen change in circumstances,\u201d a modification of alimony was justified. Given the change in the parties\u2019 incomes and expenses, a reduction in Wife\u2019s monthly mortgage payment, and Husband\u2019s inability to pay alimony in addition to child support and arrearage payments, the trial court decided to terminate Husband\u2019s ongoing alimony obligation. Both of these modifications were made retroactive to July 14,2014 \u2014 the date that Wife filed an objection to Husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>petition for modification, in which she sought enforcement of Husband\u2019s child support and alimony obligations. <em>See </em>RSA 458-C:7, II (2004) (\u201cAny child support modification shall not be effective prior to the date that notice of the petition for modification has been given to the [opposing party].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\">On appeal, Wife argues that, because the foster care payments that she received were \u201cuse[d] to clothe, feed and shelter the disabled adults in her care,\u201d those funds should not have been included in her gross income for the purposes of modifying Husband\u2019s child support obligations. In making this argument, she relies upon the definition of \u201cgross income\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV (2004), the definition of income under the federal tax code, and cases from other jurisdictions. Husband counters that the foster care payments were properly included in Wife\u2019s income because they constituted \u201cgross income\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV. Additionally, he asserts that the federal tax code\u2019s treatment of these payments has no bearing on whether they constitute \u201cgross income\u201d under New Hampshire law.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Resolving this issue requires us to engage in statutory interpretation, and, therefore, our review is <em>de novo. See In the Matter of Woolsey &amp; Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. 801, 803 (2012). We are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>In the Matter of Hampers &amp; Hampers, </em>166 N.H. 422, 433 (2014). We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written, and we will not consider what the legislature might have said or add words that the legislature did not include. <em>Id. </em>We interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\u201cGross income\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">all income from any source, . . . including, but not limited to, wages, salary,... and payments from other government programs <em>0except public assistance programs, </em>including aid to families with dependent children, <em>aid to the permanently and totally disabled, </em>supplemental security income, food stamps, <em>and general assistance received from a county or town).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">RSA 458-C:2, IV (emphases added). Wife asserts that the foster care payments that she received are excluded from the definition of \u201cgross income\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV as \u201caid to the permanently and totally disabled.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">RSA 167:6, VI (2014) states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">[A] person shall be eligible for aid to the permanently and totally disabled who is between the ages of 18 and 64 years of age inclusive; is a resident of the state; and is disabled as defined in the federal Social Security Act, Titles II and XVI and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>regulations adopted under such act, except that the minimum required duration of the impairment shall be 48 months, unless and until the department adopts a 12-month standard in accordance with RSA 167:3-j. In determining disability, the standards for \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d as used in the Social Security Act shall apply, including all work incentive provisions including Impairment Related Work Expenses, Plans to Achieve Self Support, and subsidies.... No person shall be eligible to receive such aid while receiving old age assistance, aid to the needy blind, or aid to families with dependent children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><em>See also </em>RSA 167:3-j (2014) (concerning minimum duration of impairment for aid to the permanently and totally disabled); <em>Petition of Kilton, </em>156 N.H. 632, 634 (2007) (noting that the aid to the permanently and totally disabled program \u201cis one of various public assistance programs administered by\u201d the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Here, Wife has not provided us with a record concerning the origins of the foster care payments. Thus, on the record before us, there is no evidence that the payments that she received were actually made under the aid to the permanently and totally disabled program; additionally, there is no evidence that the adults in her care met all of the statutory requirements to establish eligibility for such aid. <em>See </em>RSA 167:6, VI; <em>see also </em>RSA 167:3-j. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that those payments can be excluded from the definition of \u201cgross income\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV as \u201caid to the permanently and totally disabled.\u201d <em>See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. </em>Mgmt., 151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004) (noting that it is the burden of the appealing party to provide this court with a record sufficient to decide issues on appeal). Given the state of the record, we also cannot conclude that the payments derived from a \u201cpublic assistance program[],\u201d constituted \u201cgeneral assistance received from a county or town,\u201d or would otherwise fall within one of the other exceptions to \u201cgross income\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Accordingly, given the broad statutory definition of \u201cgross income,\u201d <em>see In the Matter of LaRocque &amp; LaRocque, </em>164 N.H. 148, 153 (2012), and because Wife has not demonstrated that the foster care payments are excluded from that definition, we conclude that the trial court properly included those payments in her \u201cgross income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Nevertheless, Wife asserts that, because the foster care payments are excluded from her gross income for tax purposes under the federal tax code, they should also be excluded from her gross income under RSA 458-C:2, IV. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 131(a) (2012) (\u201cGross income shall not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>amounts received by a foster care provider during the taxable year as qualified foster care payments.\u201d)- We disagree. We have repeatedly stated that how the \u201cfederal income taxation statutes define \u2018income\u2019 is of little relevance to our interpretation of gross income under the child support guidelines.\u201d <em>Hampers, </em>166 N.H. at 434 (quotation omitted); <em>see also, e.g., In the Matter of Maves &amp; Moore, </em>166 N.H. 564, 569 (2014) (same); <em>In the Matter of State &amp; Taylor, </em>153 N.H. 700, 704 (2006) (same). \u201cThis is so because the objectives of the child support guidelines differ from the objectives of the federal income taxation statutes.\u201d <em>Hampers, </em>166 N.H. at 435 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Moreover, we are not persuaded by Wife\u2019s reliance upon cases from other jurisdictions that have held that foster care payments received by a foster parent of children should be excluded from the foster parent\u2019s income. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Dunkle, </em>194 P.3d 462, 466 (Colo. App. 2008) (concluding that foster care payments were properly excluded from parent\u2019s gross income because, although received by parent, payments were children\u2019s income); <em>Matter of Paternity of M.L.B., </em>633 N.E.2d 1028, 1029 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994) (same); <em>Bryant v. Bryant, </em>218 S.W.3d 565, 569 (Mo. Ct. App. 2007) (same). Our task here is to interpret our child support statute and determine whether, under that statute, the foster care payments in this case should be included in Wife\u2019s gross income; the treatment of foster care payments under the definition of income in other states\u2019 statutes does not control our analysis. <em>See Maves &amp; Moore, </em>166 N.H. at 567-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Finally, to the extent that Wife attempts to assert a distinct and additional argument that \u201cgross income\u201d for child support purposes should be treated differently than income for alimony purposes, <em>see </em>RSA 458:19, IV (2004) (listing factors for trial courts to consider when determining alimony, including the \u201camount and sources of income\u201d of each party), we decline to address it because it was not adequately developed for appellate review, <em>see In the Matter of Thayer and Thayer, </em>146 N.H. 342, 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\n<em>B. Reducing Gross Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Wife next asserts that the trial court erred by failing to: (1) account for the reduction in the payments that she received when one of the foster adults in her care was removed from her home; and (2) deduct expenses that she incurred relating to the care of the foster adults. We agree with Wife on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Before the trial court issued its order on the parties\u2019 motions for reconsideration, Wife filed a motion in which she asserted that one of the two foster adults that she cared for no longer resided in her home, and, therefore, the foster care payments that she received each month were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>reduced from approximately $5,700 to $2,400. Although Husband did not dispute the payment reduction, the trial court never addressed the reduced payments. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Wife\u2019s gross income should have been adjusted to reflect the reduction in foster care payments. <em>Cf. Hampers, </em>166 N.H. at 442 (\u201cIt is undisputed that child support should be determined on the basis of present income.\u201d (quotation omitted)). The trial court\u2019s failure to account for that reduction was, therefore, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Moreover, we agree with Wife that the trial court should have deducted from her monthly foster care payments, and, thus, from her gross income, the reasonable and necessary expenditures that she incurred in providing for the foster adult remaining in her care. As we have explained, \u201cgross income\u201d under RSA 458-C:2 means the total amount available to parents for paying child support. <em>See id. </em>at 484; <em>see also Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 806 (explaining that \u201ccalculating a parent\u2019s ability to pay child support necessitates determining an actual ability to pay\u201d and concluding that the term \u201cself-employment income\u201d in RSA 458-C:2, TV \u201cpresupposes the deduction of legitimate business expenses\u201d). Thus, any portion of the foster care payments that were not \u201cavailable\u201d to Wife should not have been included in her gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s determination of Wife\u2019s monthly gross income, and remand for the trial court to determine the extent of the foster care payments that remained available to Wife, after deducting from the payments the reasonable and necessary expenses that Wife actually incurred and paid to care for the foster adult who remained in her home. <em>See Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 307 (holding that, to be deductible for purposes of determining \u201cself-employment income\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, TV, business expenses must be \u201cactually incurred and paid\u201d and \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for producing income (quotations omitted)). Because we are vacating the trial court\u2019s determination of Wife\u2019s gross income figure, and because the trial court relied, in part, upon that figure when deciding to modify Husband\u2019s child support obligation, we also remand for the trial court to recalculate that obligation. <em>See In the Matter of Albert &amp; McRae, </em>155 N.H. 259, 265 (2007) (vacating trial court\u2019s determination of party\u2019s gross income and remanding for recalculation of child support obligation).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">\n<em>C. Modification of Alimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Relying primarily upon our decision in <em>Laflamme v. Laflamme, </em>144 N.H. 524 (1999), Wife next argues that the trial court erred by revisiting Husband\u2019s alimony obligation because there was not a \u201csubstantial or unforeseen change in circumstances.\u201d Wife claims that the \u201conly substantial and unforeseen change in circumstances between the parties\u201d has been her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>decrease in monthly income, which, she argues, is not sufficient to justify reexamining Husband\u2019s alimony obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\">As we have stated, \u201c[t]he party requesting an alimony modification must show that a substantial change in circumstances has arisen since the initial award, making the current alimony amount either improper or unfair.\u201d <em>Canaway, </em>161 N.H. at 289 (quotation and brackets omitted). The trial court \u201cmust inquire into the changed circumstances of both parties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 290, and \u201cmust take into account <em>all </em>of the circumstances of the parties, including the terms of the stipulation,\u201d <em>In the Matter of Arvenitis &amp; Arvenitis, </em>152 N.H. 653, 655 (2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cChanges to a party\u2019s condition that are both anticipated and foreseeable at the time of the decree cannot rise to the level of a substantial change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of an alimony award.\u201d <em>Canaway, </em>161 N.H. at 289 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">In <em>Laflamme, </em>the trial court modified the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation based upon a finding that the defendant had sold assets and no longer had income to pay alimony due to his retirement. <em>Laflamme, </em>144 N.H. at 528. On appeal, we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision because the sale of assets and the defendant\u2019s retirement were both foreseeable and anticipated at the time of the divorce decree. <em>Id. </em>at 528-29. Accordingly, although there may have been a change in circumstances following the divorce decree, we concluded that those changes did not \u201crise to the level of a substantial change in circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of [the] alimony award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><em>Laflamme </em>is readily distinguishable. First, as the trial court here observed in its order, the parties\u2019 incomes and expenses had changed significantly since the divorce decree. <em>See Canaway, </em>161 N.H. at 290 (observing that trial court must inquire into changed circumstances of both parties). The trial court found that at the time of the divorce decree, Wife\u2019s monthly employment income was approximately $17,500, and her monthly expenses totaled approximately $16,300; Husband\u2019s monthly income was approximately $7,700, and his monthly expenses were approximately $10,100. By contrast, the trial court found that at the time of the final hearing on the petition for modification, Wife\u2019s monthly employment income was approximately $3,600, and her monthly expenses were approximately $11,300; Husband\u2019s monthly income was approximately $7,300, and his expenses were approximately $4,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Moreover, unlike <em>Laflamme, </em>in which the trial court found that both the defendant\u2019s retirement and the sale of his assets were anticipated by the parties at the time of the divorce decree, <em>see Laflamme, </em>144 N.H. at 528, here, there is nothing in the record that suggests that the changes to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>parties\u2019 finances were anticipated or foreseeable. In fact, the trial court explicitly found that \u201c[t]he parties . . . could not have anticipated the changes to their incomes and expenses at the time of the [f]inal [h]earing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Furthermore, the parties\u2019 stipulation contemplated reconsideration of Husband\u2019s alimony obligation under certain circumstances. <em>See Arvenitis, </em>152 N.H. at 655 (explaining that court must take into account all circumstances of parties, including terms of stipulations). The parties agreed that, if Wife was \u201csuccessful in reducing the monthly mortgage payment\u201d on the marital home, \u201cthe parties [would] re-evaluate the support obligations considering the reduction in the mortgage obligation.\u201d Wife concedes that she modified the terms of her mortgage, which had the effect of reducing her monthly mortgage payments; according to the trial court, her monthly mortgage payments were reduced from approximately $5,700 to $8,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Accordingly, in light of the trial court\u2019s finding that there had been unanticipated and unforeseeable significant changes in the parties\u2019 finances, the terms of the parties\u2019 stipulation, and the reduction in Wife\u2019s monthly mortgage payments, we conclude that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion by revisiting Husband\u2019s alimony obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Nonetheless, Wife asserts that, even if the trial court had the discretion to revisit and potentially modify the alimony award, it unsustainably exercised that discretion by eliminating Husband\u2019s alimony obligation. According to Wife, the significant decrease in her income supported continuation \u2014 rather than elimination \u2014 of alimony, and she also argues that the trial court erroneously cited Husband\u2019s inability to pay his child support and alimony arrearages as a reason to terminate alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">We, however, need not address whether the trial court\u2019s order eliminating alimony is unsupportable because of either the dramatic decrease in Wife\u2019s income or the trial court\u2019s reliance upon Husband\u2019s inability to pay certain arrearages. Because we are vacating for redetermination of Wife\u2019s gross income for child support purposes, and because the trial court relied, in part, upon that gross income figure when deciding to eliminate Husband\u2019s ongoing alimony obligation, we also vacate the alimony award and remand for redetermination of whether and to what extent ongoing alimony is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">\n<em>D. Jurisdiction of Trial Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Wife next argues that the trial court, a family division court, erred by concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to enforce a provision in the parties\u2019 stipulation. The disputed provision states that the parties would be \u201cequally responsible for payment of any and all legal fees incurred and/or judgments/settlements requiring them to compensate any party\u201d in a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>and ongoing boundary lawsuit. Although the trial court acknowledged the parties\u2019 agreement to divide such legal fees, it concluded that it could enforce only \u201cthe part of the debt that was incurred as of the date of the Divorce Decree,\u201d and that no part of the debt existed at that time. The trial court stated that \u201c[a]ny post-Decree debt to the firm the parties hired in the [boundary] lawsuit needs to be addressed in the context of the lawsuit, or in another forum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Wife asserts that the trial court had jurisdiction to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement to share the legal fees associated with the ongoing boundary lawsuit because such litigation costs were part of the marital debt that it could properly consider when distributing the marital estate. Husband counters that the trial court \u201ccorrectly held that its jurisdiction extends only as far as dividing the assets and debts of the parties as of the date of divorce, but not afterward,\u201d because it has no \u201clegal authority to assign post-divorce debt.\u201d We agree with Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Our decision in <em>Maldini v. Maldini, </em>168 N.H. 191 (2015), is instructive. In <em>Maldini, </em>the parties entered into a \u201cside agreement\u201d during their divorce mediation that allocated certain \u201cyet-to-be-assessed tax liabilities.\u201d <em>Maldini, </em>168 N.H. at 193 (quotation omitted). On appeal, we concluded that the family division had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce that side agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 194-96. We explained that \u201csuch unpaid tax liability falls within the broad category of marital debt that the family division can properly consider when distributing the marital estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. We further explained that \u201c[g]iven that the side agreement at issue concerned marital property, over which the family division has exclusive jurisdiction, that court \u2014 and not the superior court \u2014 remains the proper forum for addressing issues arising from the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Like the side agreement in <em>Maldini </em>that addressed yet-to-be-assessed tax liability, here, the parties\u2019 agreement encompassed yet-to-be-assessed expenses associated with the ongoing boundary suit. Thus, as in <em>Maldini, </em>we conclude that these anticipated litigation expenses fall \u201cwithin the broad category of marital debt that the family division can properly consider when distributing the marital estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. Because the trial court, a family division court, concluded otherwise, we reverse this aspect of the trial court\u2019s order and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\n<em>II. Husband\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">\n<em>A. Retroactive Alimony Modification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Husband first argues that the trial court erred by failing to retroactively modify his alimony obligation to a date earlier than July 14,2014. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>we have vacated the trial court\u2019s decision to eliminate his ongoing alimony obligation, we will address this issue because it is likely to arise upon remand. <em>See Figlioli v. R.J. Moreau Cos., </em>151 N.H. 618, 622 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">In determining July 14 to be the effective date of the alimony modification, the trial court explained that, because it did not receive a return of service of Husband\u2019s petition for modification of child support and alimony, the earliest date to which it could retroactively modify the obligations was July 14 \u2014 the date that Wife filed an objection to the petition, thus evidencing receipt of Husband\u2019s petition. <em>See </em>RSA 458-C:7, II (\u201cAny child support modification shall not be effective prior to the date that notice of the petition for modification has been given to the [opposing party].\u201d). Husband concedes that, pursuant to RSA 458-C:7, II, the trial court cannot retroactively modify his <em>child support </em>obligation prior to July 14 \u2014 the date that notice of the petition for modification was provided to Wife. However, he argues that, because alimony differs from child support and each is governed by different statutes, the same limitation does not apply to alimony modifications. Thus, he argues, the trial court had the ability to modify his alimony to a date prior to July 14. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Our decision in <em>In the Matter of Birmingham &amp; Birmingham, </em>154 N.H. 51 (2006), is controlling. In <em>Birmingham, </em>the respondent argued that the trial court erroneously denied his request to modify child support and alimony retroactive to a date before the petitioner received notice of the respondent\u2019s modification petition. <em>Birmingham, </em>154 N.H. at 57. We, however, concluded that the trial court did not err. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58. We explained that, after our review of case law and statutes concerning child support and alimony, \u201cthe trial court correctly ruled that, pursuant to RSA 458-C:7, II, it had no discretion to modify any child support order beyond the date of notice to the petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58 (quotations and brackets omitted). Although we observed that \u201c[t]here is no analogous statute that expressly limits the trial court\u2019s authority to grant a retroactive modification of alimony beyond the date of notice to the adverse party,\u201d we determined that \u201cour case law and our interpretation of the statutes governing the modification of alimony lead us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s authority to grant a retroactive modification of alimony beyond the date of notice to the adverse party is <em>similarly </em>limited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Thus, based upon <em>Birmingham, </em>we conclude that the trial court in this case had no authority to grant a retroactive modification of alimony to a date earlier than the date Wife received notice of Husband\u2019s petition for modification. <em>See id. </em>Nonetheless, because we used the phrase \u201csimilarly limited\u201d in <em>Birmingham </em>instead of \u201cidentically\u201d limited, Husband contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>that notice in the context of retroactive alimony modification is \u201cbroader\u201d than notice in the context of retroactive child support modification. Therefore, Husband asserts, the trial court had the authority to grant a retroactive modification of alimony to the date of the parties\u2019 stipulation in 2010, which, he claims, provided Wife with actual notice that his alimony obligation would change once the monthly mortgage payments were reduced. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Regardless of any ambiguity in the phrase \u201csimilarly limited,\u201d our decision in <em>Birmingham </em>effectively imported into retroactive alimony modifications the same notice requirements that are applicable to retroactive child support modifications. <em>See id. </em>We also observe that, although in <em>Birmingham </em>we invited the legislature to clarify the statutes governing the trial court\u2019s authority to grant a retroactive modification of alimony, <em>id., </em>the legislature has not amended those statutes, <em>see </em>RSA 458:14, :32 (2004). Thus, we assume that our holding in <em>Birmingham </em>conforms to legislative intent. <em>See Ichiban Japanese Steakhouse v. </em>Rocheleau, 167 N.H. 138, 143 (2014). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly ruled that it could not retroactively modify Husband\u2019s alimony obligation to a date prior to the date that Wife received notice of Husband\u2019s petition for modification \u2014 July 14, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\n<em>B. Child Support Arrearages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Husband next argues that the evidence presented to the trial court did not support the trial court\u2019s determination of the amount of his child support arrearages. At the hearing on the petition to modify, each party submitted records purporting to demonstrate the amount of child support that Husband had paid and still owed between the date of the parties\u2019 stipulation \u2014 in which Husband agreed to pay approximately $3,400 per month in child support \u2014 and July 2014. According to Wife\u2019s records, Husband\u2019s child support arrearages amounted to approximately $73,100. Husband\u2019s documents, however, purported to demonstrate an arrearage of approximately $47,400. After reviewing the documents provided by the parties, the trial court concluded that Wife\u2019s documents were \u201ccredible,\u201d and that Husband owed approximately $73,100 in child support arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">On appeal, Husband argues that the trial court\u2019s decision is not supported by the documentary evidence presented at the hearing. According to Husband, when the trial court adopted Wife\u2019s arrearage amount, it erroneously \u201cignored\u201d the allegedly more accurate records that he submitted, which included bank deposit receipts. In response, Wife contends that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s determination of child support arrearages because the trial court found the records that she submitted to be \u201ccredible.\u201d She argues that our task is not to reweigh the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>presented to the trial court, and she asserts that, because the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by the documentary evidence that she submitted, we should defer to the trial court\u2019s finding. <em>See In re Guardianship of E.L., </em>154 N.H. 292, 296 (2006) (explaining that \u201cwe do not reweigh the evidence to determine whether we would have ruled differently,\u201d and recognizing that the trier of fact \u201cis in the best position to measure the persuasiveness and credibility of evidence\u201d and that it \u201clies within the province of the trial court to accept or reject, in whole or in part, whatever evidence was presented\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\">As a threshold matter, the parties dispute the applicable standard of review. According to Wife, we should review this matter under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. By contrast, Husband claims that, because the trial court decided this issue solely based upon documentary evidence, we should give less deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>See Lawrence v. Philip Morris USA, </em>164 N.H. 93, 96-97 (2012) (concluding that, because trial court \u201crelied only upon a paper record and all of the documents from below are available for our perusal, we give less than ordinary deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings\u201d (quotation and ellipsis omitted)). We assume, without deciding, that Husband is correct that a less deferential standard applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Nonetheless, even under a less deferential standard, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred by ruling that Husband owes approximately $73,100 in child support arrearages. First, many of the bank deposit receipts that Husband has submitted on appeal \u2014 which he claims provide \u201cincontrovertible proof\u2019 that his child support arrearages total approximately $47,400 \u2014 are illegible. <em>See Bean, </em>151 N.H. at 250 (explaining that appealing party has burden of providing this court with a record sufficient to decide issues on appeal). Moreover, none of the bank deposit receipts that are legible indicates on its face that the money was actually paid for child support. Accordingly, under these circumstances, we disagree with Husband that the trial court was bound to use his records \u201cas the sole credible source of information for purposes of determining the child support arrearage\u201d and that the trial court erred by relying, instead, upon Wife\u2019s records. We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that Husband\u2019s child support arrearage amounted to approximately $73,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and CONBOY, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
