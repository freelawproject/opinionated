On appeal, she argues that the Superior Court <em>(Delker, </em>J.) erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained from a search of her vehicle. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">The trial court found the following facts when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. On June 7, 2012, Joseph Jennings was arrested on drug-related charges and released on personal recognizance bail to the custody of the defendant. That day, he was also served with a temporary order of protection that prohibited him, and third parties acting on his behalf, from contacting a certain woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Approximately 45 minutes after Jennings was released, the woman reported that the defendant was contacting her on Jennings\u2019s behalf, in violation of the protective order. Police Officer McGurren went to the woman\u2019s residence, where McGurren retrieved drug paraphernalia that the woman said belonged to Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">McGurren then went to the defendant\u2019s multi-family residence where it was \u201cpitch black outside.\u201d Because there was no available parking in front of the residence, McGurren pulled into the driveway, which \u201cwrapped around\u201d the back of the building. When she spotted the defendant\u2019s vehicle, she parked her cruiser in a way that her headlights illuminated the vehicle\u2019s interior. She saw two people making furtive movements in the vehicle\u2019s front seat. McGurren shined her spotlight on the vehicle and got out of her cruiser. The defendant then emerged from the passenger side of her vehicle and approached McGurren. Jennings, who had been in the driver\u2019s seat, also got out of the vehicle. The defendant began yelling at McGurren. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>McGurren ordered the defendant to stay back, she complied and stood approximately 10 feet away from the vehicle, although she continued to yell.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">McGurren placed Jennings under arrest for violating the protective order. As McGurren secured Jennings in her cruiser, the defendant was still yelling. Because of the furtive movements she had witnessed earlier, McGurren went to the defendant\u2019s vehicle and looked through the driver\u2019s side window where she saw what she believed to be drug paraphernalia, including two syringes, on the center console. McGurren then arrested the defendant for possession of a controlled drug. She secured the defendant in the cruiser of a second officer, who had arrived to assist. McGurren then seized the drug paraphernalia from the defendant\u2019s vehicle and transported Jennings to the police department. The second officer transported the defendant to the police department. At the police department, the defendant told McGurren that the syringes belonged to Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of her vehicle. She contended, among other arguments, that the warrantless search of her automobile violated the State and Federal Constitutions because \u201cit was done without reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause, and without her consent\u201d and there was not \u201ca valid exception to the warrant requirement\u201d to justify the search. The State objected to this argument, contending that the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement justified the search of the vehicle and the seizure of evidence from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The trial court ruled in favor of the State, concluding that, because the driveway was only semi-private, it was not \u201cdeserving of traditional curtilage protection.\u201d The court also concluded that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of her vehicle that were open to observation by anybody present in the driveway, and, thus, decided that McGurren\u2019s observation of the vehicle\u2019s contents did not constitute an unlawful search. Finally, the court concluded that McGurren\u2019s seizure of the evidence was lawful pursuant to the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred by: (1) determining that the rear parking area was not \u201cdeserving of traditional curtilage protection\u201d; and (2) implicitly deciding that McGurren needed neither a warrant nor an exception to the warrant requirement other than the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to search the defendant\u2019s vehicle. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous, and we review its legal conclusions <em>de novo. State v. Socci, </em>166 N.H. 464, 468 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\n<em>I. Curtilage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s curtilage argument, which she raises under both the State and Federal Constitutions. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 19; U.S. CONST, amend. IV. We address the defendant\u2019s argument first under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Part I, Article 19 provides that \u201c[e]very subject hath a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.\u201d The protection of a person\u2019s house extends to the home\u2019s \u201ccurtilage,\u201d or \u201cthe area immediately surrounding a dwelling house.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 300 (1987). \u201cThe boundaries and contents of the curtilage are not easily described.\u201d <em>State v. Pinkham, </em>141 N.H. 188, 190 (1996). \u201cCurtilage questions are fact-sensitive, and courts resolve them by examining the nature of the area at issue and then asking whether such an area is as deserving of protection from governmental intrusion as the house.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Under the New Hampshire Constitution, we have applied a reasonable expectation of privacy test to determine whether an area is within the curtilage, examining whether the defendant has a subjective expectation of privacy in that area and whether that expectation is reasonable. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>163 N.H. 169, 172-73 (2012); <em>see also State v. Goss, </em>150 N.H. 46, 48-49 (2003). In deciding whether the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy is reasonable, several factors have guided our inquiry, including: the nature of the intrusion, whether the police had a lawful right to be where they were, and the character of the location searched. <em>Smith, </em>163 N.H. at 173. We have analyzed the character of the location searched by referring to the following additional factors: the area\u2019s proximity to the dwelling; its inclusion within a general enclosure surrounding the dwelling; its use and enjoyment as an adjunct to the domestic economy of the family; and whether the defendant owned the place or controlled access to it and whether it was freely accessible to others. <em>Id. </em>No single factor has been dispositive; \u201cthe critical question these factors help to answer is whether a particular area claimed to be within the curtilage is necessary and convenient and habitually used for family purposes and carrying on domestic employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>accord Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301 (focusing upon whether an area is \u201cso intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home\u2019s \u2018umbrella\u2019 of [constitutional] protection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The United States Supreme Court has recently clarified that, under the Federal Constitution, a criminal defendant may also challenge a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>based upon a trespass theory. <em>See Florida v. Jardines, </em>133 S. Ct. 1409, 1414-15, 1417 (2013); see <em>also United States v. Jones, </em>132 S. Ct. 945, 949-52 (2012). According to the Court, constitutionally protected areas are those specifically listed in the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution: \u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects,\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. IV. <em>Jardines, </em>133 S. Ct. at 1414. The trespass theory \u201chas three requirements: a physical intrusion, on an enumerated interest (\u2018personsU houses, papers, and effects\u2019), that is not supported by an implicit license based on social norms.\u201d 3A Wright &amp; Welling, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 663 (4th ed. Supp. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The Court explained that, under the Federal Constitution, if the area into which the police intrude is a constitutionally protected area, then the defendant need not also show a reasonable expectation of privacy to establish a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>See Jardines, </em>133 S. Ct. at 1417; <em>see also Jones, </em>132 S. Ct. at 952 (stating that the \u201creasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been <em>added to, </em>not <em>substituted for, </em>the common-law trespassory test\u201d); <em>United States v. Duenas, </em>691 F.3d 1070, 1080-81 (9th Cir.2012) (explaining that in <em>Jones, </em>\u201cthe Court reaffirmed that the home and its curtilage are sacrosanct\u201d and that courts are not required \u201cto apply the reasonable expectation of privacy standard in addition to finding that the subject of the search was \u2018persons, houses, papers, or effects\u2019 \u201d (brackets omitted)). We have not yet addressed the trespass theory, as articulated by the Court in <em>Jardines </em>and <em>Jones, </em>under the State Constitution. <em>See Socci, </em>166 N.H. at 468-70 (applying trespass theory under Federal Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">On appeal, the defendant focuses primarily upon the federal test, arguing that \u201cMcGurren\u2019s nighttime entry onto the rear curtilage fell outside the boundaries of the implied invitation\u201d to members of the public to approach the house. <em>See Jardines, </em>133 S. Ct. at 1414-17. This argument elides over whether the area in question \u2014 here, the parking lot in the rear of the defendant\u2019s multi-family residence \u2014 is constitutionally protected. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The Supreme Court examines four factors to determine whether an area is included within the curtilage of a house: (1) \u201cthe proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home\u201d; (3) \u201cthe nature of the uses to which the area is put\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301. These factors are similar to those upon which we rely to determine whether a defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in an area is reasonable. <em>See Smith, </em>163 N.H. at 173. Thus, for the purposes of this appeal, whether the rear parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>lot is part of the curtilage of the defendant\u2019s residence involves analyzing essentially the same factors under both the State and Federal Constitutions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Here, the trial court found that McGurren had a legitimate reason for entering the property because she was there to arrest Jennings. The court also found that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was parked \u201cout in the open,\u201d and that the parking lot at issue served a multi-family residence rather than a single-family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The defendant does not challenge these factual findings on appeal. Instead, she argues that the trial court was compelled to find that the parking area was curtilage because it was \u201cbehind the house\u201d and \u201cwas not visible from the road.\u201d The defendant observes that there was no evidence that \u201cthere was a door at the rear of this house that visitors commonly used.\u201d Thus, she reasons, the parking area was \u201crear curtilage\u201d that \u201cfell outside the boundaries of. . . implied invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Based upon the trial court\u2019s factual findings, we hold that the parking area behind the defendant\u2019s home is not part of the curtilage. There is no evidence that the parking lot was bounded or enclosed or used for anything other than parking, which is not a \u201cprivate\u201d activity. <em>See United States v. Sparks, </em>750 F. Supp. 2d 384, 389 (D. Mass. 2010); <em>see also Pinkham, </em>141 N.H. at 191 (concluding that driveway was not entitled to traditional curtilage protection in part because portion at issue was not blocked from view by fences, shrubberies, or the house itself, driveway was not blocked by a gate, and driveway was not posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs). Moreover, the parking area was \u201cavailable for the shared benefit\u201d of the multi-family residence. <em>Sparks, </em>750 F. Supp. 2d at 389-90; <em>see also United States v. Rheault, </em>561 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2009) (explaining that \u201cit is beyond cavil. .. that a tenant lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of an apartment building\u201d (quotation omitted)). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the parking area behind the defendant\u2019s residence is not part of the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Our conclusion is consistent with the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions. <em>See Mack v. City of Abilene, </em>461 F.3d 547, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006) (parking space in apartment complex parking lot is not part of the curtilage of apartment); <em>United States v. Pyne, </em>175 F. App\u2019x 639, 641 (4th Cir. 2006) (concluding that apartment building\u2019s parking garage was not within curtilage); <em>United States v. Cruz Pagan, </em>537 F.2d 554, 558 (1st Cir.1976) (holding that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in a common parking garage of an apartment building). Because the Federal Constitution provides no greater protection than the State Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>under these circumstances, we reach the same result under both constitutions. <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301; <em>see also Smith, </em>163 N.H. at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\n<em>II. Search of Vehicle</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the search of her vehicle. The defendant does not directly challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that she had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of her vehicle that were open to observation by anybody present in the driveway. Nor does she challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that the officer\u2019s view of the contents of her vehicle did not constitute an unlawful search. Rather, on appeal, she contends that the trial court erred \u201cin construing the plain view doctrine as giving not merely the authority to seize the items [in her vehicle], but also the authority to enter a constitutionally-protected place without a warrant or [an] applicable exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The State argues that the defendant\u2019s appellate arguments about the search of the vehicle are differ\u00e9nt from those she made in the trial court and, therefore, are not preserved for our review. The defendant agrees that she never \u201cexplicitly point[ed] out the inability of the plain view doctrine to justify the police entry of the [vehicle],\u201d but contends that she was not required to do so to preserve her appellate arguments. She asserts that the preservation doctrine only \u201cprevents this Court from considering <em>issues </em>raised on appeal that were not presented in the trial court.\u201d (Quotation and brackets omitted.) According to the defendant, the doctrine allows the court to consider any argument made on appeal to support a claim even if that \u201cprecise argument\u201d was not also made in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">As the defendant rightly observes, \u201c[t]he purpose underlying our preservation rule is to afford the trial court an opportunity to correct any error it may have made before those issues are presented for appellate review.\u201d <em>State v. Town, </em>163 N.H. 790, 792 (2012). Based upon our review of the record submitted on appeal, we disagree with the defendant that the trial court had that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\"> In the trial court, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was general, asserting only that the search of her vehicle, without a warrant or an exception thereto, violated her State and Federal constitutional rights. At the hearing on her motion, the defendant argued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">I think, Judge, in terms of the \u2014 ultimately the \u2014 the search of the motor vehicle, I don\u2019t think that you can say that it\u2019s a search incident to arrest. I think there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s quite a bit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>law on that, and that once Mr. Jennings was secured in the back of the police vehicle there can\u2019t be any search of the \u2014 of the motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">I think also, when you\u2019re dealing with a situation where this vehicle apparently was \u2014 was parked, there\u2019s no evidence that it was running, it was on private property, it was on private property where the Defendant resided. There\u2019s no search incident to \u2014 search incident to arrest exception to that that would apply here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">In terms of plain view, Judge, I think that that\u2019s why I mentioned about was the officer there, was the officer validly in a place where the officer was allowed to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">And I would suggest, Your Honor, that the officer was not, generally speaking, as I indicated. But the issue then becomes after he\u2019s made the arrest that he \u2014 excuse me. After she made the arrest that she went there for, her work is done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">So not only is there generally a problem for lack of probable cause for being there in the first place, but then you have the additional issue of where she has to walk 20 feet to a vehicle, and does she have the right to be in that place at that time where whereupon she sees some items in a motor vehicle? We would say that she does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">As this excerpt from the hearing demonstrates, in the trial court, the defendant argued <em>only </em>that McGurren was not lawfully in the parking area from which she could observe the contents of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. She did not argue in the trial court, as she argues on appeal, that McGurren could not lawfully enter the vehicle to seize the evidence without either a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement other than plain view. <em>See Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 137 (1990) (explaining that for the plain view exception to the warrant requirement to apply, a police officer must \u201cbe lawfully located in a place from which the object can be plainly seen\u201d and \u201chave a lawful right of access to the object itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">To the extent that the defendant believed that the trial court improperly relied upon the plain view exception to the warrant requirement to justify the officer\u2019s entry into her vehicle, it was incumbent upon her to move for reconsideration. The trial court must have had the opportunity to consider any issues asserted by the defendant on appeal; thus, to satisfy this preservation requirement, any issues that could not have been presented to the trial court before its decision must be presented to it in a motion for reconsideration. <em>See LaMontagne Builders v. Bowman Brook Purchase Group, </em>150 N.H. 270, 274 (2003); <em>N.H. Dep\u2019t of Corrections v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>Butland, </em>147 N.H. 676, 679 (2002). The record on appeal, however, does not demonstrate that the defendant filed such a motion. <em>See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Although preservation \u201cis a limitation on the parties to an appeal and not the reviewing court,\u201d and, thus, we have the discretion to waive the preservation requirement, we decline to do so in this case. <em>Camire v. Gunstock Area Comm\u2019n, </em>166 N.H. 374, 377 (2014). As the State asserts, because the defendant did not raise her appellate argument in the trial court, \u201cthe trial court made very few (if any) relevant findings of fact or rulings of law.\u201d We agree with the State that the defendant\u2019s appellate argument was \u201cneither factually nor legally developed\u201d in the trial court. Thus, we decline to consider the argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">All issues that the defendant raised in her notice of appeal, but did not brief, are deemed waived. <em>See State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 519 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
