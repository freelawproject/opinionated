On appeal, Olson argues that the trial court erroneously determined that it was lawful for the Town to include on the official ballot for the annual Town meeting the phrase, <em>\u201cThe Selectmen do not recommend this </em>article,\u201d below each of the plaintiffs\u2019 20 warrant articles, which the plaintiffs had petitioned to include on the ballot. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">The relevant facts follow. On January 20,2015, the Town\u2019s three-member selectboard reviewed and discussed the 36 warrant articles to be placed on the ballot for the annual Town meeting scheduled for March 10, including 20 articles that the plaintiffs had petitioned to include on the ballot. The plaintiffs\u2019 articles included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>17) To see if the Town will vote to instruct the Chief of Police to not prosecute any matter relating to the use or possession of cannabis (marijuana) in compliance with Article IX and Article XIII of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">24) To see if the Town will vote to preclude any Town official and the use of any Town funds to cooperate with the National Security Agency (NSA).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">25) To see if the Town will vote to preclude the Town from accepting any Federal military equipment in the future and to require the immediate sale at public auction of any military equipment previously received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">31) To see if the Town will vote to instruct State Representative^] Steven Darrow, Robert Hull and Jeffrey Shackett to propose legislation to repeal the licensing of dogs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">32) To see if the Town will vote to preclude the Select Board (Selectmen) from placing any opinion of any Warrant Article on the Warrant, except for Warrants that appropriate funds or are otherwise required by RSA 3: VI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">At the January 20 meeting, one selectboard member moved that the ballot include the phrase \u201cthe Selectmen do not recommend this article\u201d relative to each of the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles. The motion passed unanimously. On January 26, the selectboard signed the warrant for the annual Town meeting. On the official ballot, appearing below each of the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles, was the notation: <em>\u201cThe Selectmen do not recommend this </em>article.\u201d On February 27, in response to citizen concern about the selectboard\u2019s inclusion of its recommendations on the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles, the selectboard met and voted unanimously to retain those recommendations on the official ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">On March 5, the plaintiffs filed their petition for injunctive and declaratory relief. The trial court held a final hearing on offers of proof and, on March 9, denied the petition, concluding that RSA 32:5, V-a authorizes the Town to place recommendations on any warrant article.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">At the annual meeting held thereafter, the voters rejected all of the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles by large margins. For instance, the article asking whether the Town would preclude the selectboard from \u201cplacing any opinion of any Warrant Article on the Warrant,\u201d except for articles concerning appropriations, was defeated by a vote of 81 in favor and 292 opposed. The plaintiffs unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>On appeal, Olson does not seek to invalidate the votes taken at the March 2015 annual meeting. Instead, he requests that we reverse the trial court\u2019s determination that the selectboard acted lawfully and remand to the trial court with instructions to grant permanent, prospective injunctive relief and consider the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees. Although any issues the plaintiffs raised in the trial court with regard to the March 2015 annual meeting are now moot, Olson\u2019s appeal is not moot because it presents legal issues that are of pressing public interest and are \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review.\u201d <em>Appeal of Hinsdale Fed. of Teachers, </em>133 N.H. 272, 276 (1990) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Our resolution of the issues on appeal requires that we engage in statutory interpretation. We review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Petition of Malisos, </em>166 N.H. 726, 729 (2014). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written, and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute itself for further indications of legislative intent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Olson first argues that the selectboard lacked authority under RSA 39:3 (2000) to insert its recommendations on the official ballot below each of the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles. RSA 39:3 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">Upon the written application of 25 or more registered voters or 2 percent of the registered voters in town, whichever is less, although in no event shall fewer than 10 registered voters be sufficient, presented to the selectmen or one of them not later than the . fifth Tuesday before the day prescribed for an annual meeting, the selectmen shall insert in their warrant for such meeting the petitioned article with only such <em>minor textual changes </em>as may be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">(Emphasis added.) Olson contends that the selectboard\u2019s recommendations on the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles constituted more than \u201cminor textual changes\u201d to those articles and, therefore, violated RSA 39:3. We disagree that the recommendations, which appeared in bolded, italicized text below each of the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles, constituted \u201ctextual changes\u201d to the articles themselves. We have reviewed Olson\u2019s remaining arguments regarding RSA 39:3 and conclude that they do not warrant further discussion. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Olson next asserts that the selectboard had no authority under RSA 32:5 (Supp. 2015) to insert its recommendations. RSA chapter 32 pertains to municipal budgets. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 32 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2015). RSA 32:5 concerns the preparation of municipal budgets and includes details regarding budget forms, certain procedural requirements, and the preparation of budget-related warrant articles. Under RSA 32:5, V:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">When any purpose of appropriation, submitted by a governing body or by petition, appears in the warrant as part of a special warrant article:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">(a) The article shall contain a notation of whether or not that appropriation is recommended by the governing body, and, if there is a budget committee, a notation of whether or not it is recommended by the budget committee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">(b) If the article is amended at the first session of the meeting in an official ballot referendum municipality, the governing body and the budget committee, if one exists, may revise its recommendation on the amended version of the special warrant article and the revised recommendation shall appear on the ballot for the second session of the meeting provided, however, that the 10 percent limitation on expenditures provided for in RSA 32:18 shall be calculated based upon the initial recommendations of the budget committee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">(c) Defects or deficiencies in these notations shall not affect the legal validity of any appropriation otherwise lawfully made; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">(d) All appropriations made under special warrant articles shall be subject to the hearing requirements of paragraphs I and II of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">RSA 32:3, VI (Supp. 2015) defines a \u201c[s]pecial warrant article\u201d as \u201cany article in the warrant for an annual or special meeting which proposes an appropriation by the meeting\u201d and meets certain requirements. (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">RSA 32:5, V-a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">The legislative body of any town, school district, or village district may vote to require that all votes by an advisory budget committee, a town, school district, or village district budget committee, and the governing body or, in towns, school districts, or village districts without a budget committee, <em>all votes of the governing body relative to budget items or any warrant articles shall be recorded votes and the numerical tally of any such vote </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>shall be printed in the </em>town, school district, or village district <em>warrant next to the affected warrant article. </em>Unless the legislative body has voted otherwise, if a town or school district has not voted to require such tallies to be printed in the town or school district warrant next to the affected warrant article, the governing body may do so on its own initiative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Olson argues that RSA 32:5, Y-a is \u201climited to budgetary matters\u201d and \u201cauthorizes only \u2018numerical tallies,\u2019 not recommendations,\u201d and, therefore, does not authorize a selectboard to include its recommendation regarding any warrant article that is unrelated to the town budget. Olson asserts: \u201cRSA 32:5, V-a says nothing of recommendations!,\u2022] [i]t allows the reporting of numerical tallies. . . . [0]nly . . . RSA 32:5, V \u2014 explicitly restricted to budgetary matters \u2014 allows recommendations to be printed.\u201d Olson reasons that, because RSA 32:5, V-a does not refer to selectboard recommendations and because RSA 32:5, V requires recommendations only for budget-related articles, a selectboard has no statutory authority to insert its recommendations on the official ballot for warrant articles that do not pertain to the budget. Accordingly, Olson concludes that, although RSA 32:5, V-a uses the phrase \u201cany warrant articles,\u201d that phrase does not \u201cliterally meant ] <em>every </em>possible warrant article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Town counters that the plain language of RSA 32:5, V-a \u201cindicates that [the] town meeting may <em>require </em>the selectmen to record their votes for or against recommendationfs] as tallies on the warrant, and ... [that] this is not limited to just budgetary items or special warrant articles, but [pertains] to \u2018any warrant articles.\u2019 \u201d The Town asserts that RSA 32:5, V-a expressly authorizes a selectboard \u201cto make and insert recommendations, in the event that town meeting has not required them to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We conclude that RSA 32:5, V-a is ambiguous. Although the word \u201cany\u201d means \u201cone, no matter what one: EVERY,\u201d Webster\u2019s THIRD NEW International Dictionary 97 (unabridged ed. 2002), we cannot interpret this word in isolation, <em>see Hogan v. Pat\u2019s Peak Skiing, LLC, </em>168 N.H. 71, 73 (2015). \u201c[W]e do not consider words and phrases in isolation, but rather within the context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Similarly, we must interpret RSA 32:5, V-a in the context of the overall statutory scheme. <em>See Holt v. Keer, </em>167 N.H. 232, 239 (2015). \u201cThis enables us to better discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Here, the purpose sought to be advanced by RSA chapter 32 is set forth in RSA 32:1 (2000), which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]t is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>legislature\u2019s . . . purpose to establish uniformity in the manner of appropriating and spending public funds in all municipal subdivisions to which this chapter applies.\u201d Given that purpose and the focus of RSA chapter 32 in general, and RSA 32:5 in particular, upon the preparation of municipal budgets, arguably, the word \u201cany\u201d was intended to refer to \u201cany appropriation-related warrant articles.\u201d On the other hand, we must interpret the language of RSA 32:5, V-a as written, and may not add language to it that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>See Petition of Malisos, </em>166 N.H. at 729. Moreover, if the legislature intended RSA 32:5, V-a to apply only to budget-related warrant articles, arguably, it could have easily said so. Thus, it is unclear whether, by using the word \u201cany\u201d to refer to \u201cwarrant articles,\u201d the legislature intended RSA 32:5, V-a to apply to all warrant articles, including warrant articles not related to the budget. Accordingly, we examine legislative history to aid our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\">RSA 32:5, V-a was first enacted in 2007, and applied only to budget items and warrant articles. <em>See </em>Laws 2007, 305:1. As first enacted, RSA 32:5, V-a provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">Any town may vote to require that all votes by an advisory budget committee, a town budget committee, and the governing body or, in towns without a budget committee, all votes of the governing body relative to budget items or warrant articles shall be recorded votes and the numerical tally of any such vote shall be printed in the town warrant next to the affected warrant article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><em>Id. </em>As the co-sponsor of the bill explained at a senate committee hearing, the bill that resulted in RSA 32:5, V-a, Senate Bill (SB) 58, was proposed in response to a constituent \u201cwho asked the local board of selectmen and budget committee to include the numeric vote totals on the municipal budget reports that also include a required recommendation from the same boards.\u201d Relative to the Recommendation for the Town Budget: Hearing on S.B. 58 before the Sen. Comm. on Pub. &amp; Mun. Affairs 1-2 (January 30, 2007) (statement of Sen. Joseph D. Kenney) (quotation omitted), <em>available at </em>http://gencourt.state.nh.us/SofS_Archives/2007/senate/SB58S.pdf. The co-sponsor further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Many of the New Hampshire budget committees have several members on them and often do not express a numeric vote on the budget for the public to see. This forces the public to go to the town halls to ask for the numeric vote and, in some cases, ask who voted for what.... The local boards need to be forthcoming with the numeric votes for budget recommendations in order to make it easier on the public ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 2 (quotation omitted). The other co-sponsor of SB 58 reiterated, \u201c[T]he voters that show up have to ask, \u2018Gee, did the selectmen all agree to that or didn\u2019t they agree to that?\u2019 They shouldn\u2019t have to go through that stuff. They should be able to see what the vote was.... People should know how their elected officials are voting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(statement of Sen. John S. Barnes).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In 2009, RSA 32:5, Y-a was amended by SB 38. <em>See </em>Laws 2009, 2:1. As amended, RSA 32:5, V-a provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">Any town may vote to require that all votes by an advisory budget committee, a town budget committee, and the governing body or, in towns without a budget committee, all votes of the governing body relative to budget items or <em>any </em>warrant articles shall be recorded votes and the numerical tally of any such vote shall be printed in the town warrant next to the affected warrant article. <em>If a town has not voted to require such tallies to be printed in the town warrant next to the affected warrant article, the governing body may do so on its own initiative.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphases added). The word \u201cany\u201d was added to the phrase \u201cwarrant articles\u201d after SB 38 was sent to the House of Representatives. <em>See </em>N.H.H.R. JOUR. 141 (2009); <em>see also </em>N.H.S. JOUR. 123-24 (2009). The suggestion to add the word \u201cany\u201d to the phrase \u201cwarrant articles\u201d was made by the House Committee on Municipal and County Government as a result of the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">Rep. Patten: This doesn\u2019t mean just budget items but other \u25a0 warrant articles also? [Judy Silva, New Hampshire Municipal Association]: This is only under RSA 32 so I would say it deals with money articles only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">Rep. Patten: Possible to put in the wording \u2018all warrant articles?\u2019 Silva: You can do what you want to determine the policy. <em>I think other statutes need to be examined since this deals only with the tally, not the recommendation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">Rep. Patten: Would Sen Bragdon be upset if we add this? Bragdon: As long as it doesn\u2019t slow the process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Relative to Placing Vote Tallies on Town and School District Ballots: Hearing on S.B. 38 before the H. Comm, on Mun. &amp; Cnty. Gov\u2019t (February 11, 2009) (emphasis added), <em>available at </em>http://gencourt.state.nh.us/SofS_ Archives/2009/house/SB38H.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">As the exchange demonstrates, the word \u201cany\u201d was intended to refer to <em>all </em>warrant articles, not \u201cmoney articles only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the amended bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>was returned to the Senate, Senator Bragdon, a sponsor of SB 38, explained the amendment as follows: \u201cThe House simply added the word \u2018any\u2019 before warrant articles, because the . . . original bill dealt with budgetary, financial warrant articles, and there are warrant articles before towns that don\u2019t have a dollar value with them, and they\u2019d like those vote tallies as well.\u201d N.H.S. JOUR. 123 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The legislative history also demonstrates, however, that RSA 32:5, V-a concerns only the printing of \u201cthe numerical tally\u201d of selectboard votes on the official ballot. It does <em>not </em>speak to including selectboard recommendations on the ballot. Although RSA 32:5, V mandates that the selectboard include its recommendations on the official ballot, it applies only to appropriation-related \u201cspecial warrant article[s].\u201d Because the legislature did not amend RSA 32:5, V, when it amended RSA 32:5, V-a, the two statutes appear to be incongruent.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\"> To interpret the two statutes as congruent, we rely upon our presumption \u201cthat the legislature would not pass an act that would lead to an absurd or illogical result,\u201d <em>Favazza v. Braley, </em>160 N.H. 349, 351 (2010), and conclude that it would be illogical to empower a selectboard to include its vote tallies \u201cin the town... warrant next to the affected warrant article,\u201d without also empowering it to inform the electorate of the recommendation reflected by its vote, RSA 32:5, V-a. Accordingly, we hold that RSA 32:5, V-a empowers a selectboard to include both its vote tally and its recommendation \u201cin the town . . . warrant next to the affected warrant article.\u201d RSA 32:5, V-a. Of course, if the legislature disagrees with our statutory interpretation, it is free, subject to constitutional limitations, to amend the pertinent statutes as it sees fit. <em>See Hogan, </em>168 N.H. at 75. Because the issue is not before us, we express no opinion as to whether the selectboard in this case violated RSA 32:5, V-a by including its recommendation below each of the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles -without also including the numerical tally of its unanimous vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Olson next contends that, by inserting its recommendation below each of the plaintiffs\u2019 warrant articles, the selectboard violated the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under Part I, Article 11 of the State Constitution. Part I, Article 11 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAll elections are to be free, and every inhabitant of the state of 18 years of age and upwards shall have an equal right to vote in any election.\u201d Olson asserts that the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to a \u201cfree election\u201d and to an \u201cequal right to vote\u201d were violated by the selectboard\u2019s actions. However, Olson\u2019s constitutional claims are premised expressly upon his assumption that, by inserting its recommendations, the selectboard acted without, or in contravention of, statutory authority. For instance, Olson argues: \u201cThis is not a case where the Town ... followed any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>law set down by the Legislature. Rather, the Town... decided to oppose the Plaintiffs\u2019 citizen-initiated petitions.\u201d Olson also argues: \u201cWithout authority, printing the recommendations of local government officials directly on the ballot \u2014 between the question and the circle to fill in \u2014 is mere inches away from having the Town pre-fill the ballots with the votes it desires.\u201d Additionally, Olson asserts: \u201c[T]he Town . . . has no lawful authority to include recommendations on the ballots.\u201d Olson further contends: \u201c[T]his is not a case where there is no statute to analyze \u2014 the Town[\u2019s]. .. actions are wholly without any statutory authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\">Olson does <em>not </em>argue that, even if the selectboard acted lawfully under the pertinent statutes, it nonetheless violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. Because Olson\u2019s constitutional claims are based upon a faulty premise, we reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Any issue that Olson raised in his notice of appeal, but did not brief, is deemed waived. <em>In re Estate of King, </em>149 N.H. 226, 230 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and HlCKS, CONBOY, and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
