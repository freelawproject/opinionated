Mutrie, individually and as trustee of the Beverly P. Mutrie Revocable Trust, engaged in reckless and wanton misconduct that resulted in their being shot and injured by her son. The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by: (1) not allowing their claim to proceed under the \u201creckless, wanton or willful acts of misconduct\u201d exception to RSA 507:8-h (2010) (amended 2013) (the \u201cFirefighter\u2019s Rule\u201d); (2) considering facts outside their writ; (3) denying them \u00e1 full opportunity for discovery; and (4) failing to hold the defendant liable as a property owner for allowing criminal conduct to occur on her property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The following facts are derived from the trial court\u2019s orders or are otherwise drawn from the record. The plaintiffs are four police officers who served on a drug task force. The police had received reports that the defendant\u2019s 29-year-old son was engaged in illegal drug activity at a property in Greenland where he lived. The property is owned by the Beverly P. Mutrie Revocable Trust, of which the defendant is the trustee. On April 12,2012, the plaintiffs were attempting to serve a search warrant on the defendant\u2019s son at the Greenland property. During the execution of the search warrant, the defendant\u2019s son shot and injured the plaintiffs. He then took his own life.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The plaintiffs sued the defendant, individually and in her capacity as trustee to recover for their injuries, alleging that she was responsible for their injuries because, \u201cwith the knowledge, information and belief\u2019 that her son was engaged in criminal activity, she \u201cdid recklessly and wantonly allow... criminal activity and conduct to take place at the subject property and otherwise directly and indirectly and wantonly and recklessly supported and facilitated [her son\u2019s] criminal activity at the subject property.\u201d The defendant filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is barred by the Firefighter\u2019s Rule. <em>See </em>RSA 507:8-h. The Firefighter\u2019s Rule, which we adopted in <em>England v. Tasker, </em>129 N.H. 467 (1987), prevents a police officer from recovering in a negligence action when the officer\u2019s injuries are caused by the same conduct that required the officer\u2019s official presence. <em>Tasker, </em>129 N.H. at 468-72. The rule rests upon public policy considerations: Police officers and firefighters \u201care paid to confront crises and allay dangers created by an uncircumspect citizenry,\u201d and \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to ask the citizen to compensate a public safety officer, already engaged at taxpayer expense, a second time for injuries sustained while performing the very service which he is paid to undertake for the citizen\u2019s benefit.\u201d <em>Boulter v. Eli &amp; Bessie Cohen Found., </em>166 N.H. 414, 418-19 (2014) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The legislature codified the Firefighter\u2019s Rule in 1993. <em>See </em>RSA 507:8-h; <em>Boulter, </em>166 N.H. at 419. The statute in effect at the time the plaintiffs brought their claim provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">Firefighters, emergency medical technicians .. . police officers and other public safety officers shall have no cause of action for injuries arising from negligent conduct which created the particular occasion for the officer\u2019s official engagement. However, this section does not affect such officer\u2019s causes of action for unrelated negligent conduct occurring during the officer\u2019s official engagement, or for other negligent conduct, or for reckless, wanton or willful acts of misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>RSA 507:8-h, I. The defendant argued that, even assuming that all of the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 writ were true, they did not establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct fit within the exception in the statute precluding application of the rule for \u201creckless, wanton or willful acts of misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant further contended that the plaintiffs could not show that her conduct caused their injuries. The plaintiffs objected, arguing that the defendant\u2019s conduct-fit within the exception. In their objection, the plaintiffs alleged additional facts that had not been referenced in their writ, including assertions that, despite knowing that her son was engaged in illegal conduct, the defendant provided him with housing, cars, financial assistance \u2014 including the payment of his legal defense costs \u2014 and weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Ruling on the motion to dismiss, the trial court noted that if the plaintiffs succeeded \u201cin stating a claim for reckless and wanton conduct on the defendant\u2019s part... the Fire[fighter\u2019s] Rule [would] not be applicable.\u201d The trial court decided that it would, \u201cin the interest of judicial economy,\u201d consider the allegations in the writ as well as the additional facts submitted by the parties because the plaintiffs\u2019 writ did not \u201ccontain any facts indicating <em>how\u201d </em>the defendant \u201crecklessly and wantonly supported and facilitated\u201d her son\u2019s activities. Accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \u201cas true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,\u201d the trial court concluded that, although the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201callegations sufficiently established] the defendant\u2019s knowledge of her son\u2019s criminal activities and potentially violent behavior,\u201d they could not establish that she acted recklessly. The trial court explained that the allegations that the defendant had provided her son with housing, cars, and financial assistance, and also paid his legal defense costs were insufficient to support a finding of reckless or wanton conduct because that assistance did not \u201cenable [her son] to shoot the police,\u201d nor did it \u201ccontribute to his decision to do so.\u201d Therefore, the trial court concluded, the defendant could not \u201creasonably be considered to have created or contributed to an unjustifiable risk of harm to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In regard to the allegation that the defendant provided her son with weapons despite knowing that he was engaged in criminal activity, the trial court explained that, although this allegation \u201ccould potentially establish a claim for reckless and wanton behavior,\u201d the plaintiffs did not \u201caffirmatively allege that the defendant provided [her son] with weapons that were used to injure the plaintiffs.\u201d Rather, \u201cthey ma[d]e several speculative claims that the defendant <em>may </em>have provided her son with weapons that he in turn <em>may </em>have used to injure the police.\u201d The trial court observed that these claims were \u201cnot facts\u201d but merely \u201cassumptions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The trial court scheduled an evidentiary hearing to provide the plaintiffs with an opportunity to present \u201csufficient affirmative evidence to demonstrate with reasonable probability that the defendant owned and provided guns to [her son], who then used those guns to injure the plaintiffs.\u201d The hearing was continued at the plaintiffs\u2019 request, and was not rescheduled. The defendant twice renewed her motion to dismiss. Ultimately, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that, because the plaintiffs had failed to identify any evidence that the defendant had owned and provided the gun that her son used to injure them, the plaintiffs could not show that the defendant engaged in reckless, wanton, or willful misconduct, as required to avoid dismissal under the Firefighter\u2019s Rule. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The plaintiffs first argue that the trial court prevented them from \u201cdeveloping the evidence of the entire nature of the [defendant\u2019s] knowledge, information, support, facilitation, protection and communications with [her son] relating to the long-term criminal activity at the [property\u201d when it: (1) denied their motion to compel discovery of the defendant\u2019s bank account records, documentation of the defendant\u2019s payment for her son\u2019s criminal defense, and information about her son\u2019s health care providers; and (2) granted the defendant\u2019s motion to quash a subpoena for the defendant\u2019s telephone records. The defendant responds that \u201cthe plaintiffs had ample opportunity to conduct discovery in this case,\u201d and that the information sought by the plaintiffs \u201cwas not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, especially given the trial court\u2019s ... finding that providing housing, cars and financial assistance could not support a finding of reckless, wanton or willful misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decisions on the management of discovery and the admissibility of evidence under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Petition of Stompor, </em>165 N.H. 735, 738 (2013). \u2018We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s order absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To meet this standard, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of their case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We conclude that the plaintiffs fail to meet this burden. Neither the subpoenaed telephone records nor the information sought by the plaintiffs in their motion to compel can be found to be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence given the narrow issue then before the trial court \u2014 whether the plaintiffs could provide \u201csufficient affirmative evidence\u201d to show that the defendant owned and provided the gun that her son used to injure the plaintiffs. <em>See N.H. Ball Bearings v. Jackson, </em>158 N.H. 421, 429 (2009) (\u201cAlthough discovery rules are to be given a broad and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>liberal interpretation, the trial court has discretion to determine the limits of discovery.\u201d). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion when it denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel, or when it granted the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the plaintiffs\u2019 subpoena for telephone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The plaintiffs next contend that the trial court improperly converted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment by considering facts outside the writ. We disagree. The plaintiffs themselves submitted additional facts that were not contained in their writ. Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the trial court\u2019s treatment of the pleadings is inconsistent with their submission of facts in addition to their writ. <em>See Chasam v. Village District of Eastman, </em>128 N.H. 807, 813 (1986). \u201cHaving acquiesced in the procedure employed, the plaintiffs cannot now object to the form of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the trial court did not treat the dismissal motion as a summary judgment motion. It simply considered additional factual allegations. Finally, as the trial court noted, it accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 affirmative allegations \u201cas true and view[ed] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs received the benefit of the presumption to which they were entitled. <em>See Plaisted v. LaBrie, </em>165 N.H. 194, 195 (2013) (stating standard of review for motion to dismiss). Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s consideration of facts outside of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The plaintiffs next argue that the trial court erred when it dismissed their claim, concluding that it did not fit within the exception to the Firefighter\u2019s Rule for reckless, wanton, or willful misconduct. <em>See </em>RSA 507:8-h. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, we consider whether the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \u2014 here, as supplemented by additional facts \u2014 are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. <em>Chatman v. Brady, </em>162 N.H. 362, 365 (2011). We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The plaintiffs contend that our decision in <em>Amica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Mutrie, </em>167 N.H. 108 (2014), is dispositive of whether their claim fits within the exception to the Firefighter\u2019s Rule for \u201creckless, wanton or willful acts.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 507:8-h. The plaintiffs assert that, when we concluded in <em>Arnica </em>that the defendant\u2019s \u201calleged knowing, reckless, and wanton support and facilitation of her son\u2019s criminal drug activity . . . was inherently injurious,\u201d <em>Amica, </em>167 N.H. at 114, we, in effect, also determined that the alleged acts of the defendant in the instant case were reckless. The defendant counters that <em>Arnica </em>has no bearing on the outcome here because it addressed a distinct issue \u2014 whether the plaintiffs\u2019 writ alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>conduct that fit within the coverage language of the insurance policies purchased by the defendant. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In <em>Arnica, </em>we considered only the question of whether the plaintiffs had alleged facts that could be construed to be an \u201coccurrence\u201d as was required to trigger coverage under the terms of the subject insurance policies. <em>See id. </em>at 111. The insurance policies defined an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). In their pleadings, the plaintiffs had alleged that the defendant knew of her son\u2019s involvement in dangerous drug activity, and that she \u201cdirectly and indirectly and wantonly and recklessly supported and facilitated\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>at 113 (quotation omitted). Assuming the truth of the allegations in the writ for the purpose of determining coverage, we concluded that \u201cbecause a reasonable person in [the defendant\u2019s] position would know that some harm would result from her alleged knowing, reckless, and wanton support and facilitation of her son\u2019s criminal drug activity, [the defendant\u2019s] conduct was inherently injurious, and, therefore, [could not] be considered accidental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. Therefore, we held that \u201cher conduct [did] not constitute an \u2018occurrence\u2019 as is necessary to trigger coverage under the [policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, in so ruling, we specifically stated that the facts relevant to the \u201cultimate determination of [the defendant\u2019s] liability\u201d were \u201cirrelevant to the narrow issue before the court.\u201d <em>Id.; see Jespersen v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>131 N.H. 257, 261 (1988) (concluding that insured\u2019s ultimate liability in underlying suit is irrelevant to determining insurer\u2019s duty to defend). Thus, in <em>Arnica </em>we accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the defendant \u201cdirectly and indirectly and wantonly and recklessly supported and facilitated\u201d illegal drug activity. <em>Amica, </em>167 N.H. at 113 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In contrast, here, we are asked to determine whether, based upon the assertion that the defendant provided her son with weapons, housing, cars, and financial assistance, the defendant engaged in reckless, wanton, or willful acts of misconduct. RSA 507:8-h; <em>see Beane v. Dana S. Beane &amp; Co., </em>160 N.H. 708, 711 (2010) (stating'that when deciding motion to dismiss, the \u201ctrial court need not accept allegations in the writ that are merely conclusions of law\u201d (quotation omitted)). In <em>Arnica, </em>we did not decide \u2014 either explicitly or implicitly \u2014 the question now before us: whether the alleged conduct, if proven, could be deemed to fit within the exception to the Firefighter\u2019s Rule, thus allowing the plaintiffs to pursue their claim against the defendant. <em>See </em>RSA 507:8-h.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The plaintiffs argue that the defendant engaged in \u201creckless, wanton or willful acts of misconduct\u201d when, knowing that her son was engaged in criminal activity, she provided him with housing, cars, weapons, and financial assistance. RSA 507:8-h. In support of their argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>plaintiffs rely on <em>Migdal v. Stamp, </em>132 N.H. 171 (1989). In that case, a 15-year-old child who lived with his parents was involuntarily hospitalized after he ransacked and vandalized the family home. <em>Migdal, </em>132 N.H. at 173. The day after he was released from the hospital into his parents\u2019 custody, he took \u201capproximately eight guns and 500 rounds of ammunition\u201d from an unsecured gun cabinet in the home and fired them throughout the house. <em>Id. </em>He then shot and injured a police officer who responded to the scene. <em>Id. </em>The officer sued the parents for failing to properly supervise their child. <em>Id. </em>at 173-74. The parents moved for summary judgment, asserting the Firefighter\u2019s Rule as a defense. <em>Id. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In <em>Migdal, </em>we observed that the Firefighter\u2019s Rule does not bar police officers from pursuing claims of reckless conduct \u2014 \u201cconduct evincing \u2018disregard of or indifference to consequences under circumstances involving danger to life or safety of others, although no harm was intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176 (quoting BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1142-43 (5th ed. 1979)). We concluded that the officer\u2019s allegations that the parents \u201cfailed to seek recommended medical treatment\u201d for their son and allowed him access to \u201can array of firearms and ammunition,\u201d despite their knowledge that their son \u201cwas suffering from mental and emotional instabilities,\u201d had \u201cexhibited dangerous propensities,\u201d and had ransacked and vandalized the house the day before, were \u201csufficient to establish a claim of reckless or wanton conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held, therefore, that the Firefighter\u2019s Rule did not bar the officer\u2019s claim against the parents. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The plaintiffs contend that <em>Migdal </em>is \u201cvery similar\u201d to this case, and that, therefore, the trial court erred when it concluded that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not fit within the exception to the Firefighter\u2019s Rule. The plaintiffs also assert that the trial court erred when it used the 2009 <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>definition of \u201creckless\u201d in its analysis, rather than the standard for recklessness set forth in <em>Migdal. Compare </em>BLACK\u2019S LAW Dictionary 1385 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201creckless\u201d as conduct \u201c[characterized by the creation of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm to others and by a conscious . . . disregard for or indifference to that risk\u201d), <em>with Migdal, </em>132 N.H. at 176. We are not convinced that there is a material difference between the two definitions; however, even assuming that a meaningful difference exists, it is of no consequence because we conclude that, under either definition, the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct does not fit within the exception to the Firefighter\u2019s Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The differences between the factual circumstances in the present case and those in <em>Migdal </em>are readily apparent. Unlike the parents in <em>Migdal </em>whose minor son lived in their home, the defendant did not live with her 29-year-old son, and there is no allegation that the defendant exercised control over his actions. <em>See id. </em>at 173. Further, in <em>Migdal, </em>the parents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>decision to leave their emotionally unstable minor son alone in the house with unsecured firearms directly resulted in their son gaining access to the weapon that was used to injure the plaintiff. <em>See id. </em>at 176. Thus, there was a causal connection between the parents\u2019 \u201cdisregard of or indifference to [the] consequences\u201d of their actions and the officer\u2019s injuries. <em>See id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Here, in contrast, even assuming that the defendant knew of her son\u2019s involvement in criminal activity, the plaintiffs have not identified any evidence that the defendant\u2019s actions directly or indirectly resulted in their injuries. The plaintiffs have failed to identify evidence that supports their allegation that the defendant provided her son with <em>any </em>weapons during the time that he lived at the Greenland property, let alone the weapons that he had in his possession at the time of the shooting. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs maintain that the fact that the police confiscated weapons and ammunition from the defendant\u2019s residence approximately two years before the shooting occurred is sufficient to show that the defendant provided her son with weapons. We are not persuaded. Instead, we agree with the trial court that the weapons \u201cseizure does not allow the Court to logically conclude that any weapon in the possession of the defendant\u2019s son two years later must have been supplied to him by her.\u201d Indeed, the plaintiffs now concede that \u201cthe weapon used to shoot [them] was not\u201d owned by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Additionally, the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining factual allegations, even if proven, are insufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries: as the trial court correctly observed, the alleged conduct \u201cdid not enable [the defendant\u2019s son] to shoot the police, nor did it contribute to his decision to do so.\u201d Indeed, given that the plaintiffs went to the Greenland property as a result of their suspicion that the defendant\u2019s son was engaged in criminal activity and had weapons in his possession, it is sheer speculation that the defendant could have prevented the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries had she refused to provide housing, cars, and financial assistance to her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Our ruling in <em>Migdal </em>that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were \u201csufficient to establish a claim of reckless and wanton conduct\u201d against the parents, also implicitly turned on the fact that the parents owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. <em>Migdal, </em>132 N.H. at 176; <em>see Macie v. Helms, </em>156 N.H. 222, 224 (2007) (\u201cThe concepts of duty and legal causation are closely related and must be considered together.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). Because they were responsible for their minor son\u2019s care and knew that he \u201cwas suffering from mental and emotional instabilities and exhibited dangerous propensities,\u201d <em>Migdal, </em>132 N.H. at 176, the parents had a duty to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>their son from causing bodily harm. <em>See </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 316 (1965) (parents have duty to \u201cexercise reasonable care\u201d in controlling minor child); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 319 (Duty of Those in Charge of Person Having Dangerous Propensities). The scope of the parents\u2019 duty of care was defined by what risks, if any, were reasonably foreseeable under the particular circumstances. <em>See Macie, </em>156 N.H. at 224. Thus, because it was reasonably foreseeable that leaving their emotionally unstable minor son alone in the house with \u201caccess to an array of dangerous firearms and ammunition\u201d would result in their son shooting another person, the parents owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. <em>Migdal, </em>132 N.H. at 173 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Here, however, the defendant did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs. Her son was an adult at the time of the shooting. Moreover, when the defendant provided her son with housing, cars, and financial assistance, she \u201ccould not reasonably have perceived that the series of events would occur and that [her son] would take the actions he did,\u201d causing the plaintiffs\u2019 eventual injury. <em>Macie, </em>156 N.H. at 226; <em>see Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., </em>162 N.E. 99, 100 (N.Y. 1928) (stating that a person only has a duty to prevent harm resulting from risks that \u201creasonable vigilance\u201d could perceive). Accordingly, given the differences between the circumstances in <em>Migdal </em>and the circumstances here, we disagree with the plaintiffs that <em>Migdal </em>requires us to conclude that their claim fits within the exception to the Firefighter\u2019s Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The plaintiffs next argue that the defendant\u2019s duties arising out of her ownership of the Greenland property compel the conclusion that her alleged conduct fits within the reckless, wanton, or willful acts exception to the Firefighter\u2019s Rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We have recognized three limited exceptions to the general rule that private citizens are not responsible for the unanticipated criminal acts of third parties: \u201c(1) where there is a special relationship between the parties; (2) where special circumstances exist including situations where the defendant\u2019s acts create an especial temptation and opportunity for the criminal misconduct; or (3) where the duty is voluntarily assumed.\u201d <em>Berry v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., </em>152 N.H. 407, 412 (2005) (quotation omitted). The plaintiffs, citing <em>Berry </em>and <em>Iannelli v. Burger King Corp., </em>145 N.H. 190 (2000), argue that the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In <em>Berry, </em>we explicitly observed that the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception does not give rise to individual liability in situations that the individual \u201cdid not create and over which [she] exercise[s] no control.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>152 N.H. at 415. \u2018Without sufficient control that would give rise to a duty, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>private citizen should be immune from civil liability for failure to prevent [the] criminal acts of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Iannelli, </em>we held that a restaurant had a duty to protect patrons from an assault on its premises because it exercised independent and affirmative control over the property, and \u201cunreasonably failed to alleviate\u201d a foreseeable risk of harm. <em>Iannelli, </em>145 N.H. at 194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Berry </em>and <em>Iannelli </em>are not controlling: here, the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries occurred on residential property, and there is no allegation that the defendant exercised control over her son\u2019s behavior. Further, as we observed above, the defendant\u2019s alleged provision of housing, cars, and financial assistance neither led to her son shooting the defendants, nor contributed to his decision to do so. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s role as the owner of the property where her son lived constituted a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d sufficient to give rise to a duty to prevent her son\u2019s criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Thus, because the plaintiffs were injured \u201cwhile responding in [their] professional capacity to the very type of situation for which [they were] paid and trained to cope,\u201d <em>Boulter, </em>166 N.H. at 420 (quotation omitted), and because they have failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct was \u201creckless, wanton or willful,\u201d we hold that the trial court did not err when it concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was barred by the Firefighter\u2019s Rule. RSA 507:8-h.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Finally, we observe that we would significantly and improvidently expand the liability of parents for the acts of their adult children if we were to adopt the arguments advanced by the plaintiffs. Generally, parents are not liable for the acts of their adult children. <em>See, e.g., Alioto v. Marnell, </em>520 N.E.2d 1284, 1286 (Mass. 1988) (finding no parental duty to supervise and control \u201cemancipated adult son\u201d who lived with parents); <em>Reinert v. Dolezel, </em>383 N.W.2d 148, 151 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985) (parents\u2019 duty to control child ends when child becomes an adult); <em>Hartsock v. Hartsock, </em>592 N.Y.S.2d 512, 513 (App. Div. 1993) (\u201cInasmuch as parents have no legal right to control their adult child\u2019s activities, they cannot be held liable for those activities ....\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 316 (stating that \u201c[a] parent is under a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control his <em>minor </em>child\u201d (emphasis added)). Imposing liability on parents based merely upon their provision of financial assistance or housing to their adult children would effectively force parents to choose between supporting an adult child for whatever reason and shielding themselves from liability by abandoning that child. \u201cFamilies would lose the option of choosing how and where their... troubled adult child will be cared for, unless they are willing to risk full liability for their child\u2019s actions.\u201d Morgridge, Comment, <em>When Does </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Parental Liability End?: Holding Parents Liable for the Acts of Their Adult Children, </em>22 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. 335, 356 (1990). \u201cThe danger of imposing liability on these parents is the possibility that society will punish parents who are trying to care for their troubled adult children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to expand a parent\u2019s liability in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-5\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
