The Act makes it a crime for a person who is \u201crequired to register\u201d under the Act and who \u201ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d knowingly to \u201cfai[l] to register or update a registration . . . .\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a). The question before us concerns the date on which this federal registration requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders convicted before the Act became law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">The Act defines the term \u201csex offender\u201d as including these pre-Act offenders. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(1); see <em>Carr </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 560 U.S. 438, 447, 130 S. Ct. 2229, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1152 (2010). It says that \u201c[a] sex offender</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-15\">[565 U.S. 435]</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-16\">shall register.\u201d \u00a7 16913(a). And it further says that <em>\u201c[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements </em>... to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter ....\u201d\u00a7 16913(d) (emphasis added). In our view, these provisions, read together, mean that the Act\u2019s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General specifies that they do apply. We reverse a Court of Appeals determination that, in effect, holds the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-19\">The new federal Act reflects Congress\u2019 awareness that pre-Act registration law consisted of a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration systems. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38045 (2008). The Act seeks to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>those systems more uniform and effective. It does so by repealing several earlier federal laws that also (but less effectively) sought uniformity; by setting forth comprehensive registration-system standards; by making federal funding contingent on States\u2019 bringing their systems into compliance with those standards; by requiring both state and federal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions (and to keep registration information current); and by creating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who violate the Act\u2019s registration requirements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a) (criminal provision); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16911(10), 16913-16916 (2006 ed. and Supp. III) (registration requirements); \u00a7 16925 (federal funding); \u00a7 129, 120 Stat. 600 (repeal of earlier laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The Act\u2019s criminal penalty applies to \u201c[w]ho[m]ever ... is required to register under [the Act].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a). It says that such a person (a federal sex offender or a nonfederal sex offender who travels in interstate commerce) must not knowingly fail \u201cto register or update a registration <em>as required by [the Act]Ibid, </em>(emphasis added); see Appendix, <em>infra, </em>at 446, 181 L.

Reg. 8897 (2007) (codified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>at 28 CFR \u00a7 72.3). Subsequently, the Attorney General promulgated further rules, regulations, and specifications. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030; 75 Fed. Reg. 81849 (2010); 76 Fed. Reg. 1630 (2011). The present case focuses upon the applicability of the Act\u2019s registration requirements to pre-Act offenders during the period between (1) July 27, 2006 (when the Act took effect) and (2) the moment when the Attorney General promulgated a valid rule specifying the registration requirements\u2019 applicability, namely, February 28, 2007 (or a later date if the February 28 specification was invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Billy Joe Reynolds, the petitioner, is a pre-Act offender. He was convicted of a Missouri sex offense in October 2001; he served four years in prison; he was released in July 2005; he then registered as a Missouri sex offender; but he moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updating his Missouri registration information (as Missouri law required) and without registering in Pennsylvania. A federal grand jury indicted him, charging him with, between September 16 and October 16, 2007, having \u201cknowingly failed to register and update a registration as required by [the Act].\u201d App. 13; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a). In the Government\u2019s view, Reynolds\u2019 failure to update his address information when he moved to Pennsylvania violated the requirement that a \u201csex offender\u201d update registration information within \u201c3 business days after each change of . . . residence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Reynolds moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that in September and October 2007 the Act\u2019s registration requirements had not yet become applicable to pre-Act offenders. He conceded that the Act had become law earlier (namely, in July 2006), and he conceded that the Attorney General had already (in February 2007) promulgated an</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">[565 U.S. 438]</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">Interim Rule specifying that the Act\u2019s registration requirements were applicable to pre-Act offenders. But he claimed that the Interim Rule was invalid because it violated both the Constitution\u2019s \u201cnon-delegation\u201d doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s (APA) requirement for \u201cgood cause\u201d to promulgate a rule without \u201cnotice and comment\u201d (as the Attorney General had done). See A. <em>L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 495, 529, 55 S. Ct. 837, 79 L. Ed. 1570 (1935) (nondelegation doctrine); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 553(b)(3)(B), (d)(3) (APA). Because the Interim Rule is invalid, he added, the law must treat him like a pre-Act offender who traveled interstate and violated the Act\u2019s registration requirements <em>before </em>the Attorney General specified their applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">The District Court rejected on the merits Reynolds\u2019 legal attack on the Interim Rule. But the Court of Appeals rejected Reynolds\u2019 argument without reaching those merits. 380 Fed. Appx. 125 (CA3 2010). That court thought that the Act\u2019s registration requirements apply to pre-Act offenders such as Reynolds (who was subject to a preexisting state-law registration requirement) from the date of the new law\u2019s enactment\u2014even in the absence of any rule or regulation by the Attorney General specifying that the new registration requirements apply. That being so, the validity of the Interim Rule could make no legal difference, for the Act required Reynolds to follow the new federal registration requirements regardless of any rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>The Courts of Appeals have reached different conclusions about whether the Act\u2019s registration requirements apply to pre-Act offenders prior to the time that the Attorney General specifies their applicability, <em>i.e., </em>from July 2006 until at least February 2007. Six Circuits have held that the Act\u2019s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General so specifies. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>632 F.3d 912, 922-927 (CA5 2011); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valverde, </em>628 F.3d 1159, 1162-1164 (CA9 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>583 F.3d 408, 414-419 (CA6 2009);</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">[565 U.S. 439]</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Hatcher, </em>560 F.3d 222, 226-229 (CA4 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>551 F.3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>528 F.3d 852, 856-859 (CA11 2008) <em>(per cu-riam). </em>Five Circuits have held that they apply from the date of the Act\u2019s enactment, and prior to any such specification, at least with respect to pre-Act offenders who had already registered under state law. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>627 F.3d 499, 506 (CA2 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiTomasso, </em>621 F.3d 17, 24 (CA1 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shenandoah, </em>595 F.3d 151, 163 (CA3 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>550 F.3d 926, 932 (CA10 2008); <em>United States </em>v. <em>May, </em>535 F.3d 912, 918-919 (CA8 2008). In light of this split, we agreed to consider the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">The question before us is whether the Act requires pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General validly specifies that the Act\u2019s registration provisions apply to them. We believe that it does not. For one thing, a natural reading of the textual language supports our conclusion. The text consists of four statements. See <em>supra, </em>at 436, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 940. <em>Statement One </em>says that \u201c[a] sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current.\u201d <em>Statement Two </em>says that a sex offender must initially register before completing his \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d (or, if the sentence does not involve imprisonment, within three days of conviction). <em>Statement Three </em>says that the sex offender must update a registration within three business days of any change of \u201cname, residence, employment, or student status.\u201d <em>Statement Four </em>says that \u201c[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">Read naturally, the <em>Fourth Statement </em>modifies the <em>First. </em>It specifically deals with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of a broad general class (all sex offenders) to which the <em>First</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABay\">[565 U.S. 440]</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\"><em>Statement </em>applies. And it therefore should control the Act\u2019s application to that subset. See <em>Gozlon-Peretz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 395, 407, 111 S. Ct. 840, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919 (1991) (specific statutory provision normally controls over one of more general application); see also <em>Bloate </em>v. <em>United States, </em>559 U.S. 196, 207, 130 S. Ct. 1345, 176 L. Ed. 2d 54 (2010) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">At the same time, the <em>Fourth Statement </em>says that the Attorney General has authority to specify the Act\u2019s \u201capplicability,\u201d not its \u201cnonapplica-bility.\u201d And it consequently is more naturally read as conferring the authority to <em>apply </em>the Act, not the authority to make exceptions. That is how we normally understand a term such as \u201cauthority to specify\u201d in the context of applying new rules to persons already governed by preexisting rules. If, for example, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>Major League Baseball Players Association and the team owners agreed that the Commissioner of Baseball \u201cshall have the authority to specify the applicability\u201d to the major leagues of the more stringent minor league drug testing policy, we should think that the minor league policy would not apply unless and until the commissioner so specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">For another thing, this reading of the Act efficiently resolves what Congress may well have thought were practical problems arising when the Act sought to apply the new registration requirements to pre-Act offenders. The problems arise out of the fact that the Act seeks to make more uniform a patchwork of pre-existing state systems. Doing so could require newly registering or reregistering \u201ca large number\u201d of pre-Act offenders. That effort could prove expensive. And it might not prove feasible to do so immediately. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38063 (recognizing these problems). Congress\u2019 concern about these problems is reflected in the Act\u2019s providing the States with three years to bring their systems into compliance with federal standards while permitting the Attorney General to extend that 3-year grace period to five years. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16924.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">These same considerations might have warranted different federal registration treatment of different categories of pre-Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">[565 U.S. 441]</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">offenders. Cf. 73 Fed. Reg. 38035-38036 and 38046-38047 (final Department of Justice guidelines allowing States to meet Act requirements without registering certain categories of pre-Act offenders); 76 Fed. Reg. 1635-1636 (supplemental guidelines allowing the same). At least Congress might well have so thought. And consequently, Congress might well have looked for a solution. Asking the Department of Justice, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine these pre-Act offender problems and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly could have represented one efficient and desirable solution (though we express no view on Reynolds\u2019 related constitutional claim). Cf. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16912(b), 16914(a)(7), (b)(7), 16919, 16941, 16945 (granting the Attorney General authority to administer various aspects of the Act). And that is just the solution that the Act\u2019s language says that Congress adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">Finally, our reading of the Act takes Congress to have filled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions) in a manner consistent with basic background principles of criminal law. The <em>Second Statement, </em>for example, says that a sex offender must register before completing his prison term, but the provision says nothing about when a pre-Act offender who completed his prison term pre-Act must register. Although a state pre-Act offender could not be prosecuted until he traveled interstate, there is no interstate requirement for a federal pre-Act offender. And to apply the Act to either of these pre-Act offenders from the date of enactment would require reading into the statute, silent on the point, some kind of unsaid equivalent <em>(e.g., </em>registering or updating within a \u201creasonable time\u201d or \u201cwithin three days of first post-Act travel in interstate commerce\u201d or \u201cas preexisting state law requires\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">Pre-Act offenders, aware of such complexities, lacunae, and difficulties, might, on their own, reach different conclusions about whether, or how, the new registration requirements applied to them. A ruling from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>the Attorney General, however,</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">[565 U.S. 442]</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">could diminish or eliminate those uncertainties, thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to avoid. Cf., <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 266, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997) (noting that \u201cthe canon of strict construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">The Government makes three principal arguments to the contrary. First, it says that our interpretation of the Act conflicts with one basic statutory purpose, namely, the \u201cestablish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901, that <em>includes </em>offenders who committed their offenses before the Act became law. The Act reflects that purpose when it defines \u201csex offender\u201d broadly to include any \u201cindividual who was convicted of a sex offense.\u201d \u00a7 16911(1). And we have recognized that purpose in stating that, in general, the Act\u2019s criminal provisions apply to any pre-Act offender required to register under the Act who later travels interstate and fails to register. See <em>Carr, </em>560 U.S., at 447, 130 S. Ct. 2229, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">The Act\u2019s history also reveals that many of its supporters placed considerable importance upon the registration of pre-Act offenders. See, <em>e.g., </em>H. R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, p. 24 (2005) (H. R. Rep.) (\u201c[Twenty] percent of sexual offenders are \u2018lost,\u2019 and there is a strong public interest in finding them and having them register with current information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes against children\u201d); 152 Cong. Rec. 15333 (2006) (statement of Sen. Cantwell) (\u201cChild sex offenders have exploited this stunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have been tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation\u2019s 560,000 sex offenders are \u2018lost\u2019 because State offender registry programs are not coordinated well enough\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 15338 (statement of Sen. Kyi) (\u201cThere currently are over 100,000 sex offenders in this country who are</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">[565 U.S. 443]</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">required to register but are \u2018off the system.\u2019 They are not registered. The penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that these individuals register\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 13050 (statement of Sen. Frist) (\u201cThere are currently 550,000 registered sex offenders in the U.S. and at least 100,000 of them are missing from the system. Every day that we don\u2019t have this national sex offender registry, these missing sex predators are out there somewhere\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">The difficulty with the Government\u2019s argument, however, is that it overstates the need for <em>instantaneous </em>registration of pre-Act offenders. Our different reading, we concede, involves implementation delay. But that delay need not be long (the Attorney General issued his Interim Rule 217 days after the effective date of the new law). And that delay can be justified by the need to accommodate other Act-related interests. See <em>supra, </em>at 440-442, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 942-944.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-14\">Second, the Government suggests that our reading leads to an absurd result. As it points out, the <em>Fourth Statement </em>grants the Attorney General the \u201cauthority to specify\u201d the registration requirements\u2019 applicability not only to pre-Act offenders but also to those convicted prior to the \u201cimplementation\u201d of the new Act \u201cin a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>ticular jurisdiction.\u201d Some jurisdictions might not implement the Act for up to five years. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16924; see also Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department Finds 24 Jurisdictions Have Substantially Implemented SORNA Requirements (July 28, 2011) (stating that as of July 28, 2011, 14 States had implemented the Act\u2019s requirements ), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ newsroom/pressreleases/2011/SMART_ PR-072811.htm (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Yet, the Government concludes, it is absurd to believe that Congress would have desired so long a delay in the application of its new registration requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">The problem with this argument, however, is that reading the two categories similarly (a matter which we need not</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">[565 U.S. 444]</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">decide) would not require a long delay in applying the registration requirements to post-Act offenders who committed a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement the new requirements. At most, that reading would require the Attorney General to promulgate a rule applicable to all preimplementation offenders. That rule could specify that the Act\u2019s preregistration provisions apply to some or to all those offenders. And it could do so quickly, well before a jurisdiction implements the Act\u2019s requirements. Indeed, the Attorney General\u2019s Interim Rule and the Department of Justice\u2019s final guidelines, both issued before any jurisdiction implemented the Act\u2019s requirements, state that the Act\u2019s requirements apply to \u201call sex offenders,\u201d including all preimplementation offenders. See 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \u00a7 72.3); 73 Fed. Reg. 38036; cf. Dept, of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department Announces First Two Jurisdictions To Implement Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (Sept. 23, 2009), http://www. ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/ 2009/SMART09154.htm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">Third, the Government argues against our interpretation on the ground that the Act says only that the Attorney General \u201cshall have <em>the authority </em>to specify the applicability\u201d of the Act\u2019s registration requirements to pre-Act offenders; it does not say that he <em>\u201cshall </em>specify\u201d or otherwise <em>require </em>him to do so. The Act\u2019s language, the Government continues, consequently gives the Attorney General the power <em>not </em>to specify anything; that power is inconsistent with Congress\u2019 intent to ensure the speedy registration of thousands of \u201clost\u201d pre-Act offenders, <em>supra, </em>at 442-443, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 944-945; and we can avoid this result only by reading the Act\u2019s registration requirements as applying immediately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders (though the Attorney General would have the power to make exceptions).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">This argument bases too much upon too little. There is no reason to believe that Congress feared that the Attorney General would refuse to apply the new requirements to pre-Act</p>\n<p id=\"ALYY5\">[565 U.S. 445]</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">offenders. See, <em>e.g., </em>H. R. Rep., at 23-24; Protecting Our Nation\u2019s Children From Sexual Predators and Violent Criminals: What Needs To Be Done? Hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., 4-13 (2005); Office of the Press Secretary, The White House, President Signs H. R. 4472, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (July 27, 2006), http://george wbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/ releases/2006/07/20060727 - 6. html. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>And there was no need for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic possibility. There is consequently no need to read the language unnaturally as giving the Attorney General the authority only to make exceptions from an implicit (unstated) rule that would otherwise apply the new registration requirements to all pre-Act offenders across the board and immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Finally, we note that some lower courts have read the Attorney General\u2019s specification authority as applying only to those pre-Act sex offenders unable to comply with the statute\u2019s \u201cinitial registration\u201d requirements. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(b). That, however, is not what the statute says. Rather, its <em>Fourth Statement, </em> \u00a7 16913(d), says that the Attorney General has the authority (1) to specify the applicability of the registration requirements to pre-Act (and preimplementation) offenders, <em>\u201cand\u201d </em>(2) to prescribe rules for their registration, <em>\u201cand\u201d </em>(3) to prescribe registration rules for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with the initial registration requirements. See <em>supra, </em>at 436, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 940. The word \u201cand\u201d means that the Attorney General\u2019s authority extends beyond those pre-Act \u201csex offenders who are unable to comply\u201d with the initial registration requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that  the Act\u2019s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General so specifies. Whether the Attorney General\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"ADEB\">[565 U.S. 446]</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">Interim Rule sets forth a valid specification consequently matters in the case before us. And we reverse the Third Circuit\u2019s judgment to the contrary. We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-12\">\u201cIn General.\u2014Whoever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-13\">\u201c(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-14\">\u201c(2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act by reason of a conviction under Federal law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice), the law of the District of Columbia, Indian tribal law, or the law of any territory or possession of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-15\">(B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-16\">(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-17\">\u201cshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-18\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-19\">\u201cRegistry requirements for sex offenders</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-20\">\u201c(a) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-21\">\u201cA sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student.

The Act\u2019s statement that \u201c [t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements\u201d to pre-Act sex offenders, \u00a7 16913(d), is best understood as conferring on the Attorney General an authority to make exceptions to the otherwise applicable registration requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-23\">To begin with, I do not share the Court\u2019s belief that to \u201cspecify the applicability\u201d more naturally means, in the present context, to \u201cmake applicable\u201d rather than to \u201cmake inapplicable.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 439-440, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 942-943. The example the Court gives, the Commissioner of Baseball\u2019s \u201c \u2018authority to specify the applicability\u2019 \u201d of more stringent minor-league drug testing policies to the major leagues, <em>ibid., </em>is entirely inapt, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>cause it deals with a policy that on its face is otherwise not applicable. Since the major leagues are not covered by the policies, the Commissioner\u2019s \u201c \u2018authority to specify [their] applicability\u2019 \u201d <em>can mean nothing else </em>but the authority to render them applicable. What we have here, however, is a statute that states in unqualified terms that \u201c[a] sex offender shall register,\u201d \u00a7 16913(a)\u2014and that the Court rightly believes was meant to cover pre-Act offenders.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The issue is whether \u201cspecify the applicability\u201d means that no pre-Act offenders need register unless the Attorney General says so, or rather</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">[565 U.S. 449]</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">that the Attorney General may excuse the unqualified requirement for pre-Act offenders. In <em>that </em>context, it seems to me that the latter meaning is more natural. One specifies the applicability of an application that already exists by describing or revising its contours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">I think it preferable to give \u201cspecify\u201d this meaning not only because here it is more natural, but also because the alternative is to read the statute as leaving it up to the Attorney General whether the registration requirement would <em>ever </em>apply to pre-Act offenders, even though registration of pre-Act offenders was (as the Court acknowledges) what the statute sought to achieve. For the statute does not <em>instruct </em>the Attorney General to specify; it merely gives him \u201cauthority\u201d to do so. In this respect, the provision at issue here stands in marked contrast to other provisions of the Act which clearly impose duties on the Attorney General. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 16912(b) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall issue guidelines and regulations to interpret and implement this subchapter\u201d); \u00a7 16917(b) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall prescribe rules for the notification of [certain] sex offenders\u201d); \u00a7 16919(a) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall maintain a national database\u201d); \u00a7 16926(a) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall establish and implement a Sex Offender Management Assistance program\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">The Court\u2019s response to this\u2014that \u201cthere was no need for a mandatory requirement to avoid [the] unrealistic possibility\u201d that the Attorney General would not specify, <em>ante, </em>at 445, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 946\u2014seems to me a fine answer to the question \u201cWhat mandatory requirements must a poorly drafted statute contain in order to be workable?\u201d It is an inadequate answer, however, to the question that is relevant here: \u201cWould Congress have written the provision this way if it wanted pre-Act offenders covered and did not think they were covered absent specification by the Attorney General?\u201d Intelligently drafted statutes make mandatory those executive acts essential to their functioning, <em>whether or not </em>those acts would likely occur anyway. It would have taken little effort (in</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">[565 U.S. 450]</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">fact, less effort) for Congress to write \u201cthe Attorney General shall specify the applicability\u201d instead of \u201c [t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability.\u201d The latter formulation confers discretion, and it is simply implausible that the Attorney General was given discretion to determine whether coverage of pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Act offenders (one of the purposes of the Act) should exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Indeed, it is not entirely clear to me that Congress can constitutionally leave it to the Attorney General to decide\u2014with no statutory standard whatever governing his discretion\u2014 whether a criminal statute will or will not apply to certain individuals. That seems to me sailing close to the wind with regard to the principle that legislative powers are nondelegable, see <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc., </em>531 U.S. 457, 472-476, 121 S. Ct. 903, 149 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2001); <em>Loving </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U.S. 748, 776-777, 116 S. Ct. 1737, 135 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and \u201c[i]t is our settled policy to avoid an interpretation of a federal statute that engenders constitutional issues if a reasonable alternative interpretation poses no constitutional question,\u201d <em>Gomez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>490 U.S. 858, 864, 109 S. Ct. 2237, 104 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1989). Construing the Act to give the Attorney General the power to <em>reduce </em>congressionally imposed requirements fits that bill, because such a power is little more than a formalized version of the time-honored practice of prosecutorial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">The Court points out that there might have been need for \u201cdifferent federal registration treatment of different categories of pre-Act offenders,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 440-441, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 943, and that absent a \u201cruling from the Attorney General\u201d pre-Act offenders would be uncertain \u201cabout whether, or how, the new registration requirements applied to them,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 441, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 943. But attending to those details would certainly come within the Attorney General\u2019s authority to \u201cspecify\u201d application of the Act\u2014and so would the temporary suspension of registration requirements pending the Attorney General\u2019s resolution of those details. And of course the uncertainty of where to</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">[565 U.S. 451]</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">register could form the basis for the Attorney General\u2019s exercise of his discretion not to prosecute in individual cases. Neither problem, it seems to me, justifies the extraordinary interpretation that this Act does not apply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General, in his discretion, says so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1048-11\"> The Court reaches this conclusion based on an inquiry into legislative history. See <em>ante, </em>at 442-443, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 944-945. That inquiry is quite superfluous, however, since the text of the Act itself makes clear that Congress sought to \u201cestablis [h] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex offenders],\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901, with \u201csex offender\u201d defined broadly to \u201cmea[n] an individual who <em>was </em>convicted of a sex offense,\u201d \u00a7 16911(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
