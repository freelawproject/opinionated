At Smith\u2019s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner, linked Smith to the crime. Boatner testified that he was socializing at a friend\u2019s house when Smith and two other gunmen entered the home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly thereafter began shooting, resulting in the death of five of Boatner\u2019s friends. In court Boatner identified Smith as the first gunman to come through the door. He claimed that he had been face to face with Smith during the initial moments of the robbery. No other witnesses and no physical evidence implicated Smith in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The jury convicted Smith of five counts of first-degree murder. The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed Smith\u2019s conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>797 So. 2d 193 (2001). The Louisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this Court. 2001-2416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So. 2d 1189; 537 U.S. 1201, 123 S. Ct. 1298, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1042 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">Smith then sought postconviction relief in the state courts. As part of his effort, Smith obtained files from the police investigation of his case, including those of the lead investigator, Detective John Ronquillo. Ron-quillo\u2019s notes contain</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">[565 U.S. 75]</p>\n<p id=\"b673-17\">statements by Boatner that conflict with his testimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from the night of the murder state that Boatner \u201ccould not . . . supply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic] they were black males.\u201d App. 252-253. Ron-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>quillo also made a handwritten account of a conversation he had with Boatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said he \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t see faces\u201d and \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 308. And Ron-quillo\u2019s typewritten report of that conversation states that Boatner told Ronquillo he \u201ccould not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 259-260.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Smith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose Ronquillo\u2019s notes violated this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). The state trial court rejected Smith\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, and the Louisiana Court of Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review. We granted certiorari, 564 U.S. 1004, 131 S. Ct. 2988, 180 L. Ed. 2d 821 (2011), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Under <em>Brady, </em>the State violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. See 373 U.S., at 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215. The State does not dispute that Boatner\u2019s statements in Ronquil-lo\u2019s notes were favorable to Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether Boatner\u2019s statements were material to the determination of Smith\u2019s guilt. We have explained that  \u201cevidence is \u2018material\u2019 within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>when there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>556 U.S. 449, 469-470, 129 S. Ct. 1769, 173 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2009). A reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant \u201cwould more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,\u201d only that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to \u201cundermine [ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Kyles </em>v.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">[565 U.S. 76]</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\"><em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">We have observed that  evidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the State\u2019s other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112-113, and n. 21, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976). That is not the case here. Boatner\u2019s testimony was the <em>only </em>evidence linking Smith to the crime. And Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements directly contradict his testimony: Boat-ner told the jury that he had \u201c[n]o doubt\u201d that Smith was the gunman he stood \u201cface to face\u201d with on the night of the crime, but Ronquillo\u2019s notes show Boatner saying that he \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t see faces\u201d and \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\u201d App. 196, 200, 308. Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements were plainly material.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The State and the dissent advance various reasons why the jury might have discounted Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements. They stress, for example, that Boatner made other remarks on the night of the murder indicating that he could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but not the others. That merely leaves us to speculate about which of Boatner\u2019s contradictory declarations the jury would have believed. The State also contends that Boatner\u2019s statements made five days after the crime can be explained by fear of retaliation. Smith responds that the record contains no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>evidence of any such fear. Again, the State\u2019s argument offers a reason that the jury <em>could </em>have disbelieved Boat-ner\u2019s undisclosed statements, but gives us no confidence that it <em>would. </em>have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The police files that Smith obtained in state postconviction proceedings contain other evidence that Smith contends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict. Because we hold that Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements alone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith\u2019s conviction, we have no need to consider his arguments that the other undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">[565 U.S. 77]</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b675-5\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b675-6\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"ACCg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The Court holds that Juan Smith is entitled to a new murder trial because the State, in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), did not disclose that the eyewitness who identified Smith at trial stated shortly after the murders that he could not identify any of the perpetrators. I respectfully dissent. In my view, Smith has not shown a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the jury would have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.). That materiality determination must be made \u201cin the context of the entire record,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976), and \u201cturns on the cumulative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the government,\u201d <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 421, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995). Applying these principles, I would affirm the judgment of the Louisiana trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The evidence presented at trial showed the following facts. On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several friends gathered at Rebe Espadron\u2019s home in New Orleans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in the kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car without a muffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen\u2019s outside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed their way through the door, demanding drugs and money. Tr. 153-154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man through the door put a gun in Boatner\u2019s face and pushed him backwards. <em>Id., </em>at 154-155. The men initially ordered Boatner and his friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand up. At that time, the man who had been the first one through the door placed his</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">[565 U.S. 78]</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">gun under Boatner\u2019s chin. <em>Id., </em>at 156-157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted him to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the head with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground. <em>Id., </em>at 157-158.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-19\">After hearing the commotion, Es-padron emerged from a back bedroom, where she had been when the men entered the house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to the kitchen, a man with a \u201ccovering\u201d over his mouth pointed his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. <em>Id., </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>70-71. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back toward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened fire. <em>Id., </em>at 71-72, 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A fifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally wounded and died later at the hospital. Of those originally gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner, who suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first man\u2019s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who escaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had remained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police also found a man named Phillip Young at the scene. Young was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the head. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never seen Young before, the police surmised that Young had been one of the perpetrators.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">New Orleans police officer Joseph Narcisse was a first responder to the scene of the shooting. He testified at trial that he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espadron\u2019s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the laceration to his head. According to Narcisse, \u201cMr. Boatner ... had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.\u201dM, at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further explained that Boat-ner \u201chad a description\u201d of the person that he saw, the details of which Nar-cisse could not recall. <em>Id., </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">[565 U.S. 79]</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Detective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the shootings, testified that Boatner had described the first man through the kitchen door as having a \u201cshort-type haircut,\u201d \u201ca lot of golds in his teeth,\u201d and \u201cbrown-ski[n].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that Boat-ner could describe no other perpetrator, but that Boatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the man initially came through the door and again when Boatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun to his chin. <em>Id., </em>at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Ronquillo also testified that, during the four months following the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person photograph arrays of potential suspects\u2014only one of which contained a picture of Smith. <em>Id., </em>at 89-100. Three weeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with one of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith. Ronquillo recalled that Boat-ner noted that one man in the array had a \u201csimilar haircut\u201d and \u201ca similar expression on his face\u201d as the \u201cgentleman that came into the house initially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,\u201d but that Boatner \u201cwas positive this wasn\u2019t the individual.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 97; see also 5 Record 828. A few months later, Ronquillo presented Boatner with the array that included a photograph of Smith. Tr. 99-101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo testified that Boatner identified Smith \u201cimmediately,\u201d stating, \u201c \u2018This is it. I\u2019ll never forget that face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 100. Of the 84 photographs that Boatner viewed, Smith\u2019s photograph was the only one that Boatner identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Boatner identified Smith again when he was called to the stand dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ing Smith\u2019s trial. Boatner testified that Smith\u2019s face was the \u201c[s]ame face,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 174, and that Smith\u2019s mouth was the \u201c[s]ame mouth\u201d \u201cfull of gold,\u201d ibid., as that of the</p>\n<p id=\"Ap4IR\">[565 U.S. 80]</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">first man who came through the kitchen door on the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that Smith\u2019s hair at trial was \u201cshaved on the sides\u201d as it was during the crime, but that \u201cthe top was a little bit lower\u201d at the time of the murders. <em>Id., </em>at 165. Boatner explained that, during the attack, he had focused on the first man through the door\u2014who was unmasked\u2014but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t notice\u201d the faces of any of the other assailants or whether they were masked. <em>Id., </em>at 154. On cross-examination, Boatner testified that he had described the first man\u2019s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the police. <em>Id., </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Smith of first-degree murder. Following the conclusion of direct review, Smith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief. Smith argued that the State had failed to disclose various police notes revealing favorable evidence material to Smith\u2019s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pre-trial statements by Boatner; statements by victim She-lita Russell and Espadron\u2019s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial statement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; statements by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling\u2019s fellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect Phillip Young. After holding a 4-day evidentiary hearing, the post-conviction judge\u2014who had also presided over Smith\u2019s 2-day trial\u2014denied Smith\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Like the postconviction court below, I conclude that Smith is not entitled to a new trial under <em>Brady. </em>In my view, Smith has not established a reasonable probability that the cumulative effect of this evidence would have caused the jury to change its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by Boatner, which the Court concludes are \u201cplainly material.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 76, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 574. First, a note by Ronquillo, documenting a</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">[565 U.S. 81]</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">conversation he had with Boatner at the scene, states that Boatner \u201ccould not . . . supply a description of the perpetrators other th[a]n they were black males.\u201d 5 Record 809. Second, a handwritten note by Ronquillo, documenting a phone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6, five days after the murders, states that \u201cBoatner . . . could not ID anyone because couldn\u2019t see faces . . . glanced at 1st one\u2014saw man\u2014through door\u2014can\u2019t tell if had\u2014faces covered didn\u2019t see anyone . . . Could not ID\u2014would not know them if\u2014I saw them.\u201d 13 <em>id., </em>at 2515. Ronquillo\u2019s typed summary of this note states that Boatner advised him that he \u201ccould not identify any perpetrators of the murder.\u201d 5 <em>id., </em>at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could have been used to impeach Boatner and Ron-quillo during cross-examination. But the statements are not material for purposes of <em>Brady </em>because they cannot \u201creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S., at 435, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490. When weighed against the substantial evidence that Boatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator, offered consistent descriptions of him on mul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tiple occasions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed statements do not warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo\u2019s on-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpetrator at the scene. Officer Nar-cisse testified that Boatner provided him with a description of the perpetrator whom Boatner saw. Narcisse\u2019s testimony thus corroborated Boat-ner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw the first man and described him to police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Narcisse\u2019s testimony also mitigated the impeachment</p>\n<p id=\"A6QAW\">[565 U.S. 82]</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">value of Ron-quillo\u2019s on-scene note by indicating that, although Boatner may have provided no detailed description to Ron-quillo at the scene, Boatner had described the first man to another officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In any event, Ronquillo\u2019s notes reflect that Boatner provided a description of the first perpetrator at the police station only a few hours after the shootings occurred. Tr. 403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked if he could \u201cdescribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.\u201d 5 Record 866. He responded: \u201cI can tell you about one, the one who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male with a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth . . . about my complexion, brown skinned.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>When asked, \u201c[Y]ou say you can\u2019t describe any of the other shooters besides the one who put the gun in your face after you opened the door,\u201d Boatner replied, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In his brief, Smith cites this station house statement as an example of favorable, undisclosed evidence. But this statement actually <em>corroborates </em>Boatner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw and described the first perpetrator to police and that he did not get a good look at the other assailants. Moreover, the description Boat-ner provided was consistent with Smith\u2019s appearance. The Court completely ignores Boatner\u2019s station house statement, but our cases instruct us to evaluate \u201cthe net effect of the evidence withheld by the State\u201d in assessing materiality. See <em>Kyles, supra, </em>at 421-422, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">[565 U.S. 83]</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The evidence not only shows that Boatner described the first perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the crime, but also that Boatner described him again three weeks later when he viewed a photograph array and eliminated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before the jury further indicated that, several months after the crime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array, after evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month investigative period. What is more, the reliability of Boat-ner\u2019s out-of-court identification was extensively tested during cross-examination at Smith\u2019s trial. In particular, Boatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith\u2019s picture in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect had tainted his identification. Boatner did not waver, responding, \u201cI picked out the person I seen come in that house that held a gun to my head and under my chin and the person that was there when all my friends died.\u201d Tr. 190 (Dec. 5, 1995). That Boatner credibly rejected defense counsel\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d theory is supported by the fact that Boatner did <em>not </em>identify cosuspect Robert Track-ling\u2014whose photograph was included in a separate array shown to Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified Smith\u2014even though Trackling\u2019s picture was next to Smith\u2019s in the same newspaper article. 5 Record 833, 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">When weighed against Boatner\u2019s repeated and consistent descriptions and confident out-of-court and in-court identifications, Boatner\u2019s March 6 statement is also immaterial. As an initial matter, Ronquillo\u2019s note of his March 6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contradiction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although the note states that Boatner \u201cdidn\u2019t see anyone,\u201d it also states that Boatner \u201cglanced at 1st one\u2014saw man\u2014 through door.\u201d 13 id., at 2515. The latter part is consistent with Boatner\u2019s repeated statements that he only saw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury would have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner\u2019s statement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five days after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">[565 U.S. 84]</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">were still at large. The jury would have considered Boat-ner\u2019s trial testimony that, following the murders of his friends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleeping, quit his job, and began drinking heavily\u2014so much so that he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treatment and grief counseling. Tr. 162-163, 170-171, 182 (Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6 note would have been further mitigated by the fact that, as Ron-quillo explained, \u201con the night of the incident [Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he gave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith\u2019s description.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009). And, following his March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed numerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetrator, and ultimately identified him as Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Of course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo\u2019s notes of Boat-ner\u2019s on-scene and March 6 statements, it might have believed that Boatner could not identify any of the perpetrators, but <em>a possibility </em>of a different verdict is insufficient to establish <em>a Brady </em>violation. See <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 291, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1999); see also <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S., at 109-110, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (\u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense\u201d). Rather, a \u201cpetitioner\u2019s burden is to establish a reasonable <em>probability </em>of a different result.\u201d <em>Strickler, supra, </em>at 291, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Instead of requiring Smith to show a reasonable probability that Boat-ner\u2019s undisclosed statements would have caused the jury to acquit, the Court improperly requires the <em>State </em>to show that the jury would have given Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements no weight. See <em>ante, </em>at 76, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 574-575 (\u201c[T]he State\u2019s argument offers a reason that the jury <em>could </em>have disbelieved Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements, but gives us no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>confidence that it <em>would </em>have done so\u201d). But Smith is not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury could have accorded some</p>\n<p id=\"AupQP\">[565 U.S. 85]</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">weight to Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements. Smith\u2019s burden is to show a reasonable probability that the jury would have accorded those statements sufficient weight to alter its verdict. In light of the record as a whole\u2014which the Court declines to consider\u2014Smith has not carried that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Smith also argues that statements by Shelita Russell and Dale Mims documented in Ronquillo\u2019s handwritten notes could have been used to impeach Boatner\u2019s identification of Smith because the statements indicate that the perpetrators were masked. One undated note, which contains several entries about various aspects of the investigation, states, \u201cfemale\u2014face down against cabinets\u2014conscious.\u201d On the next line, the note continues, \u201csaid\u2014in kitchen saw people barge in\u2014one\u2014black cloth across face\u2014first one through door\u2014[no further statement].\u201d 13 Record 2556. When cross-examined during the postconviction hearing about whether this note documented the statement of Russell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note was in his handwriting, but he testified that he never talked to Russell, that he did not know when the note was made, and that someone else could have relayed the information to him. Tr. 415-418 (Jan. 22, 2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I will assume, <em>argu-endo, </em>that, had this note been disclosed, it would have been admissible at Smith\u2019s trial as a dying declaration of Russell.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the note would have</p>\n<p id=\"Agq7X\">[565 U.S. 86]</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">had minimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith\u2019s assertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which the statement was made. Officer Narcisse testified that Russell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in \u201cbad condition.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995). Similarly, Reginald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay wounded, she was \u201cwhining\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t catch nothing [t]hat she said.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995). And, although Smith contends that the note says \u201cexactly\u201d that the \u201cfirst person through the door had a black cloth across his face,\u201d that is not how the note reads. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11 (hereinafter Reply Brief) (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). The note first states that the declarant \u201csaw people barge in,\u201d then states \u201cone\u2014black cloth across face\u2014 first one through door\u2014[no further statement].\u201d 13 Record 2556 (emphasis added). It is at least as logical to read this statement as indicating only that \u201cone\u201d of the \u201cpeople\u201d had a \u201cblack cloth across [his] face.\u201d Russell, suffering from fatal wounds, said nothing further after \u201cfirst one through door,\u201d and it is impossible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>know whether the \u201cfirst one\u201d was also the \u201cone\u201d with a \u201cblack cloth across [his] face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The second statement Smith identifies is that of Dale Mims, who lived down the street from Espadron\u2019s home and who heard the shooting. A note by Ronquillo states that Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron\u2019s home, \u201call wearing mask[s].\u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 2518. Like Russell\u2019s purported statement, this statement has minimal impeachment value in light of the record. Mims\u2019 undisclosed statement does not address whether some or all of the perpetrators were masked inside Espadron\u2019s home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, had Mims been called as a</p>\n<p id=\"AZx4O\">[565 U.S. 87]</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">witness at trial, he presumably would have testified, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that he was \u201cpositive\u201d that he only saw three perpetrators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were masked. Tr. 269, 271-273, 275 (Jan. 13, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Both Russell\u2019s purported statement and Mims\u2019 testimony are consistent with Boatner\u2019s testimony that he did not know whether any of the other perpetrators were masked, id., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with Officer Nar-cisse\u2019s and Espadron\u2019s testimony that the single perpetrator whom Espad-ron observed was wearing some sort of face covering, <em>id., </em>at 30-31 (Dec. 4, 1995); <em>id.., </em>at 71 (Dec. 5, 1995). Thus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but not all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that in no way undermines Boatner\u2019s consistent assertions that the only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Smith also contends that Ronquil-lo\u2019s undisclosed note documenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary is material for purposes of <em>Brady. </em>The note states that \u201cLeary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM ammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders] was typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], \u2018Mac[-]11\u2019 model type, semi automatic weapon.\u201d 5 Record 831. According to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary\u2019s trial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene \u201cwas fired by one particular weapon, one 9-millimeter handgun,\u201d Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an Intratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a \u201chandgun.\u201d Smith further argues that Leary\u2019s pretrial statement could have been used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution attempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that Shelita Russell\u2019s wounds could</p>\n<p id=\"ALnxp\">[565 U.S. 88]</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">have been inflicted by a 9-millimeter \u201chandgun,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by calling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under his chin was a 9-millimeter silver \u201chand gun,\u201d <em>id,, </em>at 157 (Dec. 5, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Contrary to Smith\u2019s contentions, Leary\u2019s pretrial statement does not undermine the evidence presented at trial. Leary\u2019s pretrial statement is consistent with his and Boatner\u2019s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11 pistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that such a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for Petitioner 48. Moreover, a \u201chandgun\u201d is simply \u201c[a] firearm that can be used with one hand,\u201d American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Heritage Dictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an Intratec or Mac-11 pistol can be used with one hand. Smith nonetheless insists that, \u201cas a colloquial matter, machine pistols of the Intratec or MAC-11 type would be considered automatic or semiautomatic weapons, rather than handguns.\u201d Reply Brief 18. But even assuming that Smith is correct, he fails to explain why Leary, a firearms expert, would have been expected to use colloquial rather than technical terminology.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The record also makes clear that, when Boatner used the term \u201chandgun,\u201d he did not understand it to exclude automatic or semiautomatic machine pistols. In the immediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at trial, Boatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a \u201cMa[c] 10\u201d or \u201cTech Nine\u201d \u201cUzi\u201d type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5, 1995); 5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that weapon as a</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">[565 U.S. 89]</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\u201chandgun,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 809. Moreover, Boatner\u2019s pretrial description of the silver or chrome \u201chandgun\u201d that the first man held was consistent with Leary\u2019s undisclosed statement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon. In his station house statement, Boatner described the first man\u2019s weapon as a \u201cbig,\u201d \u201cautomatic pistol.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 813, 866. Because Leary\u2019s pretrial statement is neither impeaching nor exculpatory, Leary\u2019s undisclosed statement cannot form the basis of a <em>Brady </em>violation. See <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S., at 281-282, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 (To make out a <em>Brady </em>violation, \u201c [t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and material undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert Trackling, a member of the \u201cCut Throat Posse\u201d street gang with which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric Rogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling. 5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an interview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which he described a conversation that he had with Trackling while in prison. During that conversation, Trackling described the murders at Espadron\u2019s home and stated that he had committed the crime along with \u201cFat, Buckle, and a guy they call uh, Short Dog.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 841. According to Rogers, Fat\u2019s real name was \u201cDarnell [Donielle] Banister,\u201d Buckle\u2019s real name was \u201cContez [Kintad] Phillips,\u201d and Short Dog\u2019s real name was \u201cJuan.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 843-844.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Smith contends that Rogers\u2019 interview was exculpatory in two respects. First, he points to the following comment by Rogers later during the interview: \u201cThey call Contez Philip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog that\u2019s what they call him, they call Robert Home.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 845. Smith suggests that Rogers\u2019 prior identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tion of \u201cShort Dog\u201d as \u201cJuan [Smith]\u201d was equivocal in light of his later statement</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">[565 U.S. 90]</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">that \u201cShort Dog\u201d was a man named \u201cRobert Home.\u201d Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that disclosure of Rogers\u2019 interview would have led the defense and the jury to learn of Rogers\u2019 allegation\u2014made for the first time 10 years after Smith\u2019s trial\u2014that the police had asked him to implicate Juan Smith as \u201cShort Dog.\u201d Tr. 284-285 (Jan. 13, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Neither argument is persuasive. If the jury had learned of Rogers\u2019 statement, it would have heard information directly <em>inculpating </em>Smith as \u201cShort Dog,\u201d a perpetrator of the shootings. Rogers\u2019 physical description of \u201cShort Dog\u201d\u2014\u201che[\u2019s] short[,] he[\u2019s] got golds going across his mouth [,] and . . . he\u2019s like built,\u201d 5 Record 844\u2014also corroborated Boat-ner\u2019s description of the first man through the door as having a \u201cmouth full of gold\u201d and a \u201cheavy\u201d build. Furthermore, Smith ignores other incul-patory information documented in Ronquillo\u2019s notes of Rogers\u2019 statement. Those notes reflect Trackling\u2019s own interview with police on June 1, 1995, in which Trackling identified Phillips, Bannister, and \u201cJuan Smith\u201d as the perpetrators of the murders at Espadron\u2019s home. <em>Id., </em>at 832; see also <em>id., </em>at 854-855. Trackling\u2019s statement only strengthens the inculpatory nature of Rogers\u2019 interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed Smith\u2019s suggestion that Rogers identified \u201cShort Dog\u201d as a man named \u201cRobert Home.\u201d When this statement is taken in context, it appears that Rogers was describing the nickname\u2014\u201cHome\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014of Robert Trackling, the \u201cRobert\u201d whom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">[565 U.S. 91]</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">See <em>id., </em>at 839-850. Indeed, Rogers\u2019 phraseology, \u201cthey call Robert <em>Home,\u201d </em>was consistent with his previous comments that \u201c[t]hey call Contez Philip <em>Buckle,\u201d </em>and \u201cthey call Darnell Banister <em>Fat.\u201d Id., </em>at 845 (emphasis added). Unsurprisingly, in the thousands of pages of record material, I have not found, nor have the parties cited, a single reference to anyone named \u201cRobert Home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">If the jury had heard Rogers\u2019 post-conviction testimony that police asked him to implicate Smith and that Trackling\u2019s description of the murders did not include Smith, Tr. 284-285 (Jan. 13, 2009), it would have weighed Rogers\u2019 allegation against Trackling\u2019s own statement to the police that Smith had participated in the murders at Espadron\u2019s home, 5 Record 832. The prosecution also would have called Smith\u2019s sister, Trin-ieze Smith, to testify that she believed her brother was known as \u201cShort Dog,\u201d as she did at the postconviction hearing. Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009). On this record, the undisclosed statements by Rogers and Trackling actually strengthen rather than weaken confidence in the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Finally, Smith argues that an undisclosed handwritten note by Ron-quillo documenting a statement by Phillip Young\u2014the man found injured at the scene and suspected of having participated in the crime\u2014is also material evidence warranting a new trial. At trial, Ronquillo testified that he</p>\n<p id=\"AWoP\">[565 U.S. 92]</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">met with Young while Young was hospitalized as a result of permanent brain damage suffered in the shootings. <em>Id., </em>at 102 (Dec. 5, 1995). According to Ronquillo, Young \u201cwas strapped to a chair. He really couldn\u2019t talk, [h]e mumbled. He could use his left hand, that was all. He couldn\u2019t walk or anything. He was fed through a tube by the people there. He was in really bad shape.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 102-103. When asked whether Young was able to communicate with him \u201cat all,\u201d Ronquillo responded, \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t understand anything that he was saying.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The undisclosed note from Ronquil-lo\u2019s meeting with Young reads as follows: \u201cShort Dog/Bucko/Fats\u2014No\u2014 Didn\u2019t shoot me\u2014No\u2014Not with me when went to house\u2014Yes\u2014one of people in house shot me\u2014No\u2014Not responsible\u2014\u2018Posse\u2019\u2014Didn\u2019t drive to house\u2014\u2018Posse\u2019\u2014Yes\u2014Knows names of perps\u2014Yes\u2014Drove in car\u2014Yes\u2014 girlfriend\u2019s car.\u201d 13 Record 2568. App. 311. Smith contends that this note is exculpatory in that it suggests that he was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Young\u2019s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes (as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact; \u201cShort Dog\u201d and a member of the \u201cCut Throat Posse.\u201d Such a concession would only have strengthened the in-culpatory value of the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that Smith was the \u201cShort Dog\u201d who committed the murders at Espadron\u2019s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of the note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is unclear whether Ronquillo\u2019s note reflects a statement by Young that the \u201cPosse\u201d was not responsible for shooting the victims or a statement that the \u201cPosse\u201d was not responsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that \u201cShort Dog\u201d and others were not with Young when he <em>went </em>to the <em>house </em>is certainly not a clear statement that \u201cShort Dog\u201d did not commit the murders, especially in light of evidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on the night of the</p>\n<p id=\"AJbd\">[565 U.S. 93]</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">murders.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, had the jury learned of Ronquillo\u2019s note, it would have presumably heard Ronquillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that he was not even sure whether his note actually reflected statements by Young, given that Young \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d was \u201cjumbled,\u201d could only \u201ckind of move his head,\u201d and sometimes would just sit and stare when Ron-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>quillo asked a question. Tr.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 423-424 (Jan. 22, 2009). Accordingly, Ron-quillo explained, \u201cI never had hide nor hair actually of what [Young] said.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo\u2019s note, of unclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop of doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communicated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence against the strongly inculpa-tory nature of Boatner\u2019s descriptions and identifications and Rogers\u2019 and Trackling\u2019s statements, which corroborated Boatner\u2019s identification. When all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it must be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"pAlc99\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"41\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASAAAAApAQAAAAC9gMlRAAAAkUlEQVR4nO3UMQrCQBAF0L+DhYWQI2jvJcxNcgTvkIOltLT1FMsKVgbyLWeKD9nAVpLp3mcGZmHYRKyXVfTsTRuaSgwUDMAr5gpNd/ocL24JA3KINQzo4klJHIDTffBcg+TIUAog+Yi5AsjlGmIJA779zdfQIEs++7CEAe8UXq1Bzs/JhyWqXtfuCtL+F/x30w9LN+ipAHac1wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"288\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The question presented here is not whether a prudent prosecutor should have disclosed the information that Smith</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">[565 U.S. 94]</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">identifies. Rather, the question is whether the cumulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence in Smith\u2019s case \u201cput[s] the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S., at 435, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490. When, as in this case, the Court departs from its usual practice of declining to review alleged misapplications of settled law to particular facts, <em>id., </em>at 456, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consider all of the facts. And, the Court certainly should not decline to review all of the facts on the assumption that the remainder of the record would only further <em>support </em>Smith\u2019s claims, as the Court appears to have done here. <em>Ante, </em>at 76, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 574-575.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Such an assumption is incorrect. Here, much of the record evidence confirms that, from the night of the murders through trial, Boatner consistently described\u2014with one understandable exception\u2014the first perpetrator through the door, that Boat-ner\u2019s description matched Smith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-court identifications implicating Smith. Some of the undisclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him at all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpatory value or because it actually inculpates him. Because what remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment and exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the whole record, I must dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that the State violated <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-11\">.

As Ronquillo noted at the postconviction hearing, \u201cthere were dead bodies everywhere,\u2019\u2019 and Boatner was \u201ca little shook up.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 402-403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse testified at trial that Boatner, while \u201cnot as frantic\u2019\u2019 as Espadron, was a \u201cbit emotional\u2019\u2019 when Narcisse encountered him at the scene. <em>Id., </em>at 34 (Dec. 4, 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\">. Russell did not make this statement to Officer Narcisse.

Louisiana law provides that \u201c[a] statement made by a declarant while believing that his death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what he believed to be his impending death[,]\u2019\u2019 is \u201cnot excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness.\u2019\u2019 La. Code Evid. Ann., Art. 804(B)(2) (West Supp. 2012). Assuming this statement was actually Russell\u2019s, it likely qualifies as a dying declaration. At trial, Boatner testified that, in the aftermath of the shooting, Russell told him, \u201cFeel like I\u2019m about to die.\u2019\u2019 Tr. 161 (Dec. 5, 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Espadron also testified that Russell told her, \u201cI\u2019m gonna die,\u2019\u2019 and, \u201cDon\u2019t let me die.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 73-74 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b681-12\">. Smith ridicules the \u201cexceedingly peculiar\u2019\u2019 notion that the perpetrators would have remained unmasked inside Espadron\u2019s home, only to mask themselves before leaving the scene.

Smith argues that Leary himself considered an \u201c[Intratec] or \u2018Mac[-]11\u2019 \u2019\u2019 model type to be different from a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith relies on the fact that Leary\u2019s pretrial statement indicated that the ammunition recovered from the scene did not come from the handgun recovered from Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders. <em>Id., </em>at 18. Leary\u2019s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun recovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith\u2019s representation. More importantly, Leary\u2019s statement suggests only that <em>Bannister\u2019s </em>handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at the scene, not that Leary did not consider an \u201c[Intratecl or \u2018Mac[-]11\u2019 \u2019\u2019 model type to be a handgun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b683-12\">.

Detective Byron Adams, who took Rogers\u2019 statement, did not testify at the postconviction hearing because he had died in the meantime.

Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undisclosed note to impeach Ronquillo\u2019s trial testimony that Young was not able to communicate with him \u201cat all.\u201d That argument lacks merit. Ronquillo\u2019s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that no communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he simply \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand anything that [Young] was <em>saying.\" </em>See Tr. 103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with the garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little, if any, impeachment value.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
