We consider whether \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d includes decisions of this Court that are announced after the last adjudication of the merits in state court but before the defendant\u2019s conviction becomes final.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In December 1993, petitioner Eric Greene and four co-conspirators robbed a grocery store in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the robbery, one of the men shot and killed the store\u2019s owner. The five were apprehended, and two of them confessed to taking part in the robbery. Greene did not confess, but he was implicated by the others\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">When the Commonwealth sought to try all of the co-conspirators jointly, Greene sought severance, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the confessions of his nontestifying codefendants should not be introduced at his trial. The trial court denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require redaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names. As redacted, the confessions replaced names with words like \u201cthis guy,\u201d \u201csomeone,\u201d and \u201cother guys,\u201d or with the word \u201cblank,\u201d or simply omitted the names without substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">A jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy. He appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was demanded by the rule announced in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968), that the Confrontation Clause forbids the prosecution to introduce a nontestify-ing codefendant\u2019s confession implicating the defendant in the crime. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction, holding that the redaction had cured any problem under <em>Bruton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-20\">Greene filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, raising the same <em>Bruton </em>claim. While that petition was pending, we held in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185, 195, 118 S. Ct. 1151, 140 L. Ed. 2d 294 (1998), that \u201cconsidered as a class,</p>\n<p id=\"b439-21\">[565 U.S. 37]</p>\n<p id=\"b439-22\">redactions that replace a proper name with an obvious blank, the word \u2018delete,\u2019 a symbol, or similarly notify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar enough to <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>unredacted confessions as to warrant the same legal results.\u201d The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the question whether ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>mission of the redacted confessions violated Greene\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. After the parties filed merits briefs, however, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Greene then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the introduction of his nontesti-fying codefendants\u2019 statements violated the Confrontation Clause. Adopting the report and recommendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court denied the petition. It concluded that since our decision in <em>Gray </em>was not \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d when the Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim, that court\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to,\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Palakovich, </em>606 F.3d 85 (2010). The majority held that the \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d referred to in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is the law at the time of the state-court adjudication on the merits. <em>Id., </em>at 99. The dissenting judge contended that it is the law at the time the conviction becomes final. <em>Id., </em>at 108. We granted certiorari. 563 U.S. 917, 131 S. Ct. 1813, 179 L. Ed. 2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Section 2254(d) of Title 28 U.S.C., as amended by AEDPA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cAn application for a writ of ha-beas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">[565 U.S. 38]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">\u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">The issue here pertains to the first exception. We have said that its standard of \u201ccontrary to, or involv[ing] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\u201d is \u201cdifficult to meet,\u201d because the purpose of AE-DPA is to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a \u201c \u2018guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,\u2019 \u201d and not as a means of error correction. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 102-103, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011) (quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 332, n. 5, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">In light of that objective, and relying upon the text of the provision, we held last Term, in <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 179 L. Ed. 2d 557 (2011), that  review under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the prisoner\u2019s claim on the merits. We said that the provision\u2019s \u201cbackward-looking language requires an examination of the state-court decision at the time it was made.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 182, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 179 L. Ed. 2d 557. The reasoning of <em>Cullen </em>determines the result here. As we explained, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) requires federal courts to \u201cfocu[s] on what a state court knew and did,\u201d and to measure state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>court decisions \u201cagainst this Court\u2019s precedents <em>as of \u2018the time the state court renders its decision.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Lockyer </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S. Ct. 1166, 155 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2003); emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Greene resists that conclusion by appealing to our decision in <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1989). <em>Teague </em>held that a prisoner seeking federal ha-beas relief may rely on new</p>\n<p id=\"At68\">[565 U.S. 39]</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">constitutional rules of criminal procedure announced before the prisoner\u2019s conviction became final. <em>Id., </em>at 310, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334 (plurality opinion); see also <em>Penry </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>492 U.S. 302, 313, 109 S. Ct. 2934, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1989) (affirming and applying <em>Teague </em>rule). Finality occurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and a petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become time barred or has been disposed of. <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 321, n. 6, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1987). Greene contends that, because finality marks the temporal cutoff for <em>Teague </em>purposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d under AE-DPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The analogy has been rejected by our cases. We have explained that AEDPA did not codify <em>Teague, </em>and that \u201cthe AEDPA and <em>Teague </em>inquiries are distinct.\u201d <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>536 U.S. 266, 272, 122 S. Ct. 2147, 153 L. Ed. 2d 301 (2002) <em>(per curiam). </em>The retroactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the merits\u2014which include Teague\u2014are quite separate from the relitigation bar imposed by</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">AEDPA; neither abrogates or qualifies the other. If \u00a7 2254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged to <em>Teague, </em>it would authorize relief when a state-court merits adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that <em>became </em>contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, <em>before the conviction became final.\u201d </em>The statute says no such thing, and we see no reason why <em>Teague </em>should alter AED-PA\u2019s plain meaning.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Greene alternatively contends that the relevant \u201cdecision\u201d to which the \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d criterion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme court that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision does not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits. This is an implausible</p>\n<p id=\"ARG_\">[565 U.S. 40]</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">reading of \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The text, we repeat, provides that  habeas relief</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">\u201cshall not be granted with respect to any claim that <em>was adjudicated, on the merits </em>in State court proceedings unless <em>the adjudication </em>of the claim . . . <em>resulted </em>in a <em>decision </em>that <em>was </em>contrary to, or <em>involved, </em>an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The words \u201cthe adjudication\u201d in the \u201cunless\u201d clause obviously refer back to the \u201cadjudicat[ion] on the merits,\u201d and the phrase \u201cresulted in a decision\u201d in the \u201cunless\u201d clause obviously refers to the decision produced <em>by that same adjudication on the merits. </em>A later affirmance of that decision on alternative procedural grounds, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>example, would not be a decision <em>resulting from </em>the merits adjudication. And much less would be (what is at issue here) a decision by the state supreme court not to hear the appeal\u2014that is, not to decide at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute, that the last state-court adjudication on the merits of Greene\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. 606 F.3d, at 92, and n. 1. The Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision predated our decision in <em>Gray </em>by nearly three months. The Third Circuit thus correctly held that <em>Gray </em>was not \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d against which it could measure the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision. 606 F.3d, at 99. The panel then concluded (and the parties do not dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision neither was \u201ccontrary to,\u201d nor \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of,\u201d any \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d that existed at the time. <em>Id., </em>at 106. Consequently, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">[565 U.S. 41]</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">We must observe that Greene\u2019s predicament is an unusual one of his own creation. Before applying for federal habeas, he missed two opportunities to obtain relief under <em>Gray: </em>After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed his appeal, he did not file a petition for writ of certiorari from this Court, which would almost certainly have produced a remand in light of the intervening <em>Gray </em>decision. \u201cWhere intervening developments . . . reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the litigation, [an order granting the petition, vacating the judgment below, and remanding the case (GVR)] is, we believe, potentially appropriate.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Chater, </em>516 U.S. 163, 167, 116 S. Ct. 604, 133 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1996) <em>(per curiam). </em>See, <em>e.g., Stanbridge </em>v. <em>New York, </em>395 U.S. 709, 89 S. Ct. 2033, 23 L. Ed. 2d 655 (1969) <em>(per curiam) </em>(GVR in light of <em>Bruton). </em>Nor did Greene assert his <em>Gray </em>claim in a petition for state postconviction relief. Having forgone two obvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to provide him relief by interpreting AE-DPA in a manner contrary to both its text and our precedents. We decline to do so, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\"> Whether \u00a7 2254(d)(1) would bar a federal habeas petitioner from relying on a decision that came after the last state-court adjudication on the merits, but fell within one of the exceptions recognized in <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S., at 311, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334 (plurality opinion), is a question we need not address to resolve this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
