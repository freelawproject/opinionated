Ct. 2811, 177 L. Ed. 2d 493 (2010), the Court rejected applicants\u2019 facial challenge to the Washington law authorizing the disclosure of referendum petitions but assured applicants that the disclosure could be blocked if a proper party could show that compelled disclosure would result in \u201c \u2018threats, harassment, or reprisals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 201, 130 S. Ct. 2811, 177 L. Ed. 2d 493. Today\u2019s order reveals that this assurance was empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">On remand, the District Court rejected applicants\u2019 as-applied challenge, relying primarily on a highly questionable interpretation of our precedents. The District Court reasoned that only a select few organizations\u2014what the court termed \u201cminor\u201d political parties and \u201cfringe\u201d groups\u2014may challenge the disclosure of the names of persons who sign a referendum petition. Case No. C09-5456, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119814 (WD Wash., Oct. 17, 2011), pp. 13-15. If a referendum succeeds or nearly succeeds (or if the referendum supports a position that has not been historically vilified), then, according to the District Court, disclosure of the names of the citizens who signed the petition cannot be shielded no matter how strong the evidence of threatened retaliation or how severe the nature of the threats. <em>Id., </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119814, at 15. Whether this is a correct interpretation of our cases presents an important question that merits serious appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The alternative basis for the District Court\u2019s holding\u2014that applicants did not present sufficient evidence of threatened harm\u2014also presents an important legal issue, namely, the type and quantity of proof that persons objecting to disclosure must adduce. As Judge N. R. Smith observed below, applicants adduced evidence that some supporters of the referendum \u201creceived death threats,\u201d \u201chad their children threatened,\u201d and suffered various indignities, Case No. 11-35854 (CA9, Nov. 16, 2011), p. 8 (dissenting opinion), but according to the District Court, this was not enough. Whether the standard of proof applied by the District Court provides any real protection for persons who are threatened with retaliation for asserting their First Amendment rights is an important issue that merits considered appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">There has been no such review in this case. When applicants took an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the panel denied the stay application over Judge Smith\u2019s protest that the majority had \u201crace[d] to decide the case at [a] preliminary stage based on incomplete information and without even reviewing the record.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>This Court now takes a similar approach. Particularly since the referendum at issue went down to defeat more than two years ago, the Court\u2019s haste is hard to understand. I would grant a stay at least until the Court has had an opportunity to review the record and to consider the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
