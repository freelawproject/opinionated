A sharply divided Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has declared unconstitutional a private association\u2019s efforts to memorialize slain police officers with white roadside crosses, holding that the crosses convey to a reasonable observer that the State of Utah is endorsing Christianity. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s opinion is one of the latest in a long line of \u201c \u2018religious display\u2019 \u201d decisions that, because of this Court\u2019s nebulous Establishment Clause analyses, turn on little more than \u201cjudicial predilections.\u201d See <em>Van Orden </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>545 U.S. 677, 696, 697, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring). Because our jurisprudence has confounded the lower courts and rendered the constitutionality of displays of religious imagery on government property anyone\u2019s guess, I would grant certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-28\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b479-29\">The Utah Highway Patrol Association (Association) is a private organization dedicated to supporting Utah Highway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Patrol officers and their families.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1998, the Association began commemorating officers who died in the line of duty by placing memorials, in the form of 12- by 6-foot white crosses, at or near locations where the officers were killed. The fallen officer\u2019s name, rank, and badge number are emblazoned across the full length of the horizontal beam of each memorial. The vertical beam bears the symbol of the Utah Highway Patrol, the year of the officer\u2019s death, and a plaque displaying the officer\u2019s picture, his biographical information, and details of his death. To date, the Association has erected 13 cross memorials.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The Association chose the cross because it believed that crosses are used both generally in cemeteries to commemorate the dead and specifically by uniformed services to memorialize those who died in the line of duty. The Association also believed that only the cross effectively and simultaneously conveyed the messages of death, honor, remembrance, gratitude, sacrifice, and safety that the Association wished to communicate to the public. Surviving family members of the fallen officers approved each memorial, and no family ever requested that the Association use a symbol other than the cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The private Association designed, funded, owns, and maintains the memorials. To ensure that the memorials would be visible to the public, safe to view, and near the spot of the officers\u2019 deaths, the Association requested and received permission from the State of Utah to erect some of the memorials on roadside public rights-of-way, at rest areas, and on the lawn of the Utah Highway Patrol office. In the permit, the State expressed that it \u201cneither approves or disapproves the memorial marker.\u201d Brief in Opposition 3, n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Respondents, American Atheists, Inc., and some of its members, sued several state officials, alleging that the State violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, because most of the crosses were on state property and all of the crosses bore the Utah Highway Patrol\u2019s symbol. The Association, a petitioner along with the state officials in this Court, intervened to defend the memorials. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. As an initial matter, the panel noted that this Court remains \u201csharply divided on the standard governing Establishment Clause cases.\u201d <em>American Atheists, Inc. </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>616 F.3d 1145, 1156 (2010). The panel therefore looked to Circuit precedent to determine the applicable standard and then applied the so-called \u201cLe7no7i/endorsement test,\u201d which asks whether the challenged governmental practice has the actual purpose of endorsing religion or whether it has that effect from the perspective of a \u201creasonable observer.\u201d Id<em>., </em>at 1156, 1157; see <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, </em>492 U.S. 573, 592-594, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1989) (modifying the three-pronged test of <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 91 S. Ct. 2105, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1971), which considered whether a government action has a secular purpose, has the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or fosters an excessive entanglement between government and religion). The court concluded that, even though the cross memorials had a secular purpose, they would nonetheless \u201cconvey to a reasonable observer that the state of Utah is endorsing Christianity.\u201d 616 F.3d, at 1160. This was so, the court concluded, because a cross is \u201cthe preeminent symbol of Christianity,\u201d and the crosses stood alone, on public land, bearing the Utah Highway Patrol\u2019s emblem. <em>Ibid. </em>According to the panel, none of the other \u201ccontextualizing facts\u201d sufficiently reduced the memorials\u2019 message of religious endorsement. <em>Id., </em>at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The Tenth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with four judges dissenting. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>dissenters criticized the panel for presuming that the crosses were unconstitutional and then asking whether contextual factors were sufficient to rebut that presumption. Instead, the dissenters argued, the panel should have considered whether the crosses amounted to an endorsement of religion in the first place in light of their physical characteristics, location near the site of the officer\u2019s death, commemorative purpose, selection by surviving family members, and disavowal by the State. 637 F.3d 1095, 1103-1105 (2010) (opinion of Kelly, J.). The dissenters also criticized the panel\u2019s \u201cunreasonable \u2018reasonable observer,\u201d\u2019 id<em>., </em>at 1104, describing him as \u201cbiased, replete with foibles, and prone to mistake,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1108 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). Noting that the court \u201ccontinue[d] to apply (or misapply) a reasonable observer/ endorsement test that has come under much recent scrutiny,\u201d the dissenters emphasized that the panel\u2019s decision was \u201cworthy of review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1109-1110 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Unsurprisingly, the Tenth Circuit relied on its own precedent, rather than on any of this Court\u2019s cases, when it selected the Le7no7i/endorsement test as its governing analysis. Our jurisprudence provides no principled basis by which a lower court could discern whether <em>Lemon/endorse</em>ment, or some other test, should apply in Establishment Clause cases. Some of our cases have simply ignored the <em>Lemon </em>or <em>Lemon </em>/endorsement formulations. See, <em>e.g., Zelman </em>v. <em>Simmons-Harris, </em>536 U.S. 639, 122 S. Ct. 2460, 153 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2002); <em>Good News Club </em>v. <em>Milford Central School, </em>533 U.S. 98, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151 (2001); <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>463 U.S. 783, 103 S. Ct. 3330, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1983). Other decisions have indicated that the Lemon/endorsement test is useful, but not binding. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>465 U.S. 668, 679, 104 S. Ct. 1355, 79 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1984) (despite <em>Lemon\u2019s </em>usefulness, we are \u201cunwillin[g] to be confined to any single test or criterion in this sensitive area\u201d); <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>McNair, </em>413 U.S. 734, 741, 93 S. Ct. 2868, 37 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1973) <em>(Lemon </em>provides \u201cno more than helpful signposts\u201d). Most recently, in <em>Van Orden, </em>545 U.S. 677, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607, a majority of the Court declined to apply the Le7no7i/endorsement test in upholding a Ten Commandments monument located on the grounds of a state capitol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet in another case decided the same day, <em>McCreary County </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., </em>545 U.S. 844, 859-866, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 162 L. Ed. 2d 729 (2005), the Court selected the Le77707i/endorsement test with nary a word of explanation and then declared a display of the Ten Commandments in a courthouse to be unconstitutional. See also <em>Van Orden, supra, </em>at 692, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cI join the opinion of The Chief Justice because I think it accurately reflects our current Establishment Clause jurisprudence\u2014or at least the Establishment Clause jurisprudence we currently apply some of the time\u201d). Thus, the Lemon/ endorsement test continues to \u201cstal[k] our Establishment Clause jurisprudence\u201d like \u201csome ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed and buried.\u201d <em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel </em>v. <em>Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., </em>508 U.S. 384, 398, 113 S. Ct. 2141, 124 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Since <em>Van Orden </em>and <em>McCreaiy, </em>lower courts have understandably expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>confusion. See <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky. </em>v. <em>Mercer Cty., </em>432 F.3d 624, 636 (CA6 2005) (after <em>McCreaiy </em>and <em>Van Orden, </em>\u201cwe remain in Establishment Clause purgatory\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This confusion has caused the Circuits to apply different tests to displays of religious imagery challenged under the Establishment Clause. Some lower courts have continued to apply the Le7no7i/endorsement test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Others have followed <em>Van Orden.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>One Circuit, in a case later dismissed as moot, applied both tests.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Respondents assure us that any perceived conflict is \u201cartificial,\u201d Brief in Opposition 8, because the lower courts have quite properly applied <em>Van Orden </em>to \u201cthe distinct class of Ten Commandments cases\u201d indistinguishable from <em>Van Orden </em>and have applied the Lemon/ endorsement test to other religious displays, Brief in Opposition 12, 16. But respondents\u2019 \u201cTen Commandments\u201d rule is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to attribute reason and order where none exists. Respondents offer no principled basis for applying one test to the Ten Commandments and another test to other religious displays that may have similar relevance to our legal and historical traditions. Indeed, that respondents defend the purportedly uniform application of one Establishment Clause standard to the \u201cTen Commandments\u2019 realm\u201d and another standard to displays of other religious imagery, <em>id., </em>at 16, speaks volumes about the superficiality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>and irrationality of a jurisprudence meant to assess whether government has made a law \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d See <em>Card </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>520 F.3d 1009, 1016 (CA9 2008) (describing \u201cRecent Developments in Ten Commandments Law\u201d). But even assuming that the lower courts uniformly under stand <em>Van Orden </em>to apply only to those religious displays \u201cfactually indistinguishable\u201d from the display in <em>Van Orden, </em>Brief in Opposition 16, that understanding conflicts with Justice Breyer\u2019s controlling opinion. Justice Breyer\u2019s concurrence concluded that there is \u201cno test related substitute for the exercise of legal judgment\u201d or \u201cexact formula\u201d in \u201cfact-intensive,\u201d \u201cdifficult borderline cases.\u201d 545 U.S., at 700, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (opinion concurring in judgment). Nothing in his opinion indicated that only Ten Commandments displays identical to the one in <em>Van Orden </em>call for a departure from the Lemon/ endorsement test.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">Moreover, the lower courts have <em>not </em>neatly confined <em>Van Orden </em>to similar Ten Commandments displays. In <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Loudoun County Pub. Sch., </em>418 F.3d 395, 402, and n. 8 (2005), the Fourth Circuit applied the <em>Van Orden </em>plurality opinion and Justice Breyer\u2019s concurring analysis to resolve an Establishment Clause challenge to a statute mandating recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. In <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Harris Cty., </em>461 F.3d 504, 511-512 (2006), dism\u2019d as moot on rehearing en banc, 485 F.3d 305 (2007), the Fifth Circuit applied <em>Van Orden </em>to a monument displaying an open Bible. And, in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Haskell Cty. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>568 F.3d 784, 796-797 (2009), the Tenth Circuit applied the Le7no7i/endorsement test to hold unconstitutional a Ten Commandments monument located on the grounds of a public building and surrounded by other secular monuments, facts materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Van Orden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Respondents further suggest that any variation among the Circuits concerning the Establishment Clause standard for displays of religious imagery is merely academic, for much like the traditional Le7no7i/endorsement inquiry, Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion in <em>Van Orden </em>considered the \u201ccontext of the display\u201d and the \u201cmessage\u201d it communicated. Brief in Opposition 8-12, and n. 5 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Van Orden, </em>545 U.S., at 701-702, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment); <em>id., </em>at 703, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (\u201cFor these reasons, I believe that the Texas display . . . might satisfy this Court\u2019s more formal Establishment Clause tests\u201d). I do not doubt that a given court could reach the same result under either test. See <em>ACLU Neb. Foundation </em>v. <em>Plattsmouth, </em>419 F.3d 772, 778, n. 8 (CA8 2005) (en banc) (upholding the constitutionality of a display of the Ten Commandments under either standard); <em>Trunk </em>v. <em>San Diego, </em>629 F.3d 1099, 1107, 1125 (CA9 2011) (concluding that the display of a cross was unconstitutional under either standard). The problem is that both tests are so utterly indeterminate that they permit different courts to reach inconsistent results. Compare <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zion, </em>927 F.2d 1401 (CA7 1991) (applying <em>Lemon/ </em>endorsement to strike down a city seal bearing a depiction of a cross), with <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>947 F.2d 147 (CA5 1991) (applying Le77707i/endorsement to uphold a city seal bearing a depiction of a cross); compare also <em>Plattsmouth, supra </em>(applying <em>Van Orden </em>to uphold a display of the Ten Commandments), with <em>Staley, supra </em>(applying <em>Van Orden </em>to strike down a display of a Bible). As explained below, it is \u201cthe very \u2018flexibility\u2019 of this Court\u2019s Establishment Clause precedent\u201d that \u201cleaves it incapable of consistent application.\u201d <em>Van Orden, supra, </em>at 697, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In <em>Allegheny, </em>a majority of the Court took the view that the endorsement test provides a \u201csound analytical framework for evaluating governmental use of religious symbols.\u201d 492 U.S., at 595, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); <em>id., </em>at 629, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(\u201cI . . . remain convinced that the endorsement test is capable of consistent application\u201d). That confidence was misplaced. Indeed, Justice Kennedy proved prescient when he observed that the endorsement test amounted to \u201cunguided examination of marginalia,\u201d \u201cusing little more than intuition and a tape measure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 675-676, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Since the inception of the endorsement test, we have learned that a creche displayed on government property violates the Establishment Clause, except when it does not.

Such arbitrariness is the product of an Establishment Clause jurisprudence that does nothing to constrain judicial discretion, but instead asks, based on terms like \u201ccontext\u201d and \u201cmessage,\u201d whether a hypothetical reasonable observer of a religious display could think that the government has made a law \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether a given court\u2019s hypothetical observer will be <em>\u201cany </em>beholder (no matter how unknowledgeable), or the <em>average </em>beholder, or . . . the \u2018ultrareasonable\u2019 beholder,\u201d <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. </em>v. <em>Pinette, </em>515 U.S. 753, 769, n. 3, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1995) (plurality opinion), is entirely unpredictable. Indeed, the Tenth Circuit stated below that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>its observer, although not \u201comniscient,\u201d would \u201cknow far more than most actual members of a given community,\u201d and then unhelpfully concluded that \u201c[h]ow much information we will impute to a reasonable observer is unclear.\u201d 616 F.3d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted). But even assuming that courts could employ observers of similar insight and eyesight, it is \u201cunrealistic to expect different judges ... to reach consistent answers as to what any beholder, the average beholder, or the ultrareasonable beholder (as the case may be) would think.\u201d <em>Pinette, supra, </em>at 769, n. 3, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">It comes as no surprise, then, that despite other cases holding that the combination of a Latin cross and a public insignia on public property does not convey a message of religious endorsement, see <em>Murray, supra; Weinbaum, supra, </em>the Tenth Circuit held otherwise. And, of course, the Tenth Circuit divided over what, exactly, a reasonable observer would think about the Association\u2019s memorial cross program.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">First, the members of the court disagreed as to what a reasonable observer would <em>see. </em>According to the panel, because the observer would be \u201cdriving by one of the memorial crosses at 55-plus miles per hour,\u201d he would not see the fallen officer\u2019s biographical information, but he would see that the \u201ccross conspicuously bears the imprimatur of a state entity . . . and is found primarily on public land.\u201d 616 F.3d, at 1160. According to the dissenters, on the other hand, if the traveling observer could see the police insignia on the cross, he should also see the much larger name, rank, and badge number of the fallen officer emblazoned above it. 637 F.3d, at 1108-1109 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.); <em>id,., </em>at 1104 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The dissenters would also have employed an observer who was able to pull over and view the crosses more thoroughly and would have allowed their observer to view four of the memorials located on side streets with lower speed limits. <em>Id., </em>at 1109 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Next, the members of the court disagreed about what a reasonable observer would <em>feel. </em>The panel worried that the use of a Christian symbol to memorialize fallen officers would cause the observer to think the Utah Highway Patrol and Christianity had \u201csome connection,\u201d leading him to \u201cfear that Christians are likely to receive preferential treatment from the [patrol]\u2014both in their hiring practices and, more generally, in the treatment that people may expect to receive on Utah\u2019s highways.\u201d 616 F.3d, at 1160. The dissenters\u2019 reasonable observer, however, would not take such a \u201cparanoid,\u201d \u201cconspiratorial view of life,\u201d \u201cconjur[ing] up fears of religious discrimination\u201d by a \u201c \u2018Christian police,\u2019 \u201d especially in light of the more plausible explanation that the crosses were simply memorials. 637 F.3d, at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The panel also emphasized that the \u201cmassive size\u201d of these crosses would heighten the reasonable observer\u2019s fear of discrimination and pros-elytization, unlike the \u201cmore humble spirit of small roadside crosses.\u201d 616 F.3d, at 1161-1162. The dissenters, by contrast, insisted that the size of the crosses was necessary to ensure that the reasonable observer would \u201ctake notice of the display and absorb its message\u201d of remembrance and to ensure that the crosses could contain all of the secular facts necessary to assuage the reasonable observer\u2019s fears. 637 F.3d, at 1105-1106 (opinion of Kelly, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Finally, the members of the court disputed what the reasonable observer would <em>know. </em>The panel acknowledged that the reasonable observer would recognize that the crosses commemorated death, but he would see only that the symbol \u201cmemorializes the death of a <em>Christian.\u201d </em>616 F.3d, at 1161. That the designers of the cross memorials were Mormons, or that Christians who revere the cross are a minority in Utah, would have no effect on him. <em>Id., </em>at 1163-1164. Conversely, the dissenters\u2019 reasonable observer would have known that the crosses were chosen by the fallen officer\u2019s family and erected by a private group without design approval from the State, and that most Utahns do not revere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the cross.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 637 F.3d, at 1110 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.); <em>id., </em>at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\">To any truly \u201creasonable observer,\u201d these lines of disagreement may seem arbitrary at best. But to be fair to the Tenth Circuit, it is our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that invites this type of erratic, selective analysis of the constitutionality of religious imagery on government property. These cases thus illustrate why \u201c [t]he outcome of constitutional cases ought to rest on firmer grounds than the personal preferences of judges.\u201d <em>Van Orden, </em>545 U.S., at 697, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Even if the Court does not share my view that the Establishment Clause restrains only the Federal Government, and that, even if incorporated, the Clause only prohibits \u201c \u2018actual legal coercion,\u2019 \u201d see <em>id., </em>at 693, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607, the Court should be deeply troubled by what its Establishment Clause jurisprudence has wrought. Indeed, five sitting Justices have questioned or decried the Le7no7i/endorsement test\u2019s continued use. <em>Salazar, </em>559 U.S., at 708, 720-721, 130 S. Ct. 1803, 176 L.

It is difficult to imagine an area of the law more in need of clarity, as the 46 <em>amici curiae </em>who filed briefs in support of certiorari confirm. Respondents tell us there is no reason to think that a case with facts similar to these will recur, Brief in Opposition 17, but if that counsels against certiorari here, this Court will never again hear another case involving an Establishment Clause challenge to a religious display. It is <em>this </em>Court\u2019s precedent that has rendered even the most minute aesthetic details of a religious display relevant to the constitutional question. We should not now abdicate our responsibility to clean up our mess because these disputes, by our own making, are \u201cfactbound.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This suit, which squarely implicates the viability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>application of the Le7no;i/endorsement test,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is as ripe a suit for certiorari as any.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAChiT\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"70\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAXkAAABGAQAAAAABI9lcAAAA3ElEQVR4nO2ULQ7CQBBGv5YGyY9DIBZOQLCYciqQRYEEB6chOI5RTRAYYEO2HUSTnRGMKA2CZMe9L/tmdlZsRKhVq7jeeSAI/y04mVkVWHjI7KpCgyvVFYr4zNEr2SrAgtuI6NnTAABARERutiZfdtFVgIiyakIr33OL9nGiAE+gXHY5qeAnoC97jFXwS+Mgs6kKXqCdeIxiZBRgoTRLjtz8pgAAJFWcphzZbKAAAEQEAHR3fKfyYs1ngP/IolLsEDujAO9Qo74VOjIbqtBgQhCCEIQgBCEIQfi98AaCBYtyMVV/iAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"377\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Concurring in <em>Allegheny, </em>Justice O\u2019Connor wrote that \u201cthe courts have made case-specific examinations\u201d of government actions in order to <em>avoid </em>\u201csweep-ling] away all government recognition and acknowledgment of the role of religion in the lives of our citizens.\u201d 492 U.S., at 623, 109 S.

But that is precisely the effect of this Court\u2019s repeated failure to apply the correct standard\u2014or at least a clear, workable standard\u2014for adjudicating challenges to government action under the Establishment Clause.

Moreover, it is undisputed that the State\u2019s position stemmed from its belief that \u201cif [the Association] were to change the shape of the memorial to reflect the religious symbol of the fallen trooper, rather than the shape of the cross, the memorial would no longer be a <em>secular </em>shape recognized as a symbol of death.\u201d App. to Brief in Opposition 9a-15a (emphasis added). That position is entirely consistent with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the purposes of the State and Association in permitting and implementing the memorial program were secular. In any event, that the State and Association, both defending the memorial program\u2019s constitutionality, took conflicting positions about whether it was impermissibly religious to use only crosses, or impermissibly religious to use other symbols reflective of the deceased\u2019s religious preference, only highlights the confusion surrounding the Establishment Clause\u2019s requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
