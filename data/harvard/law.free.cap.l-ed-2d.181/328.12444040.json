The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such grievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of respondent Archie Dixon\u2019s murder conviction. Because it is not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all, much less erred so transparently that no fair-minded jurist could agree with that court\u2019s decision, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"pARdU\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"49\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAUYAAAAxAQAAAACO/D2QAAAAv0lEQVR4nO2UsQ3CMBBF7ShIiAJlAxgEiQzCENClSzqYIhVDULIBEhtAkTooTQonn+Ii+UC/SJMG7O75nk9fp5MtzLjTRSNFY4L5g2ahrj52Bl8mrqrYFxSmyGkAAGUGfzYvBk56HvTTJwcxs9YXbV1TEHPXqD6XioOEWKlo7ZbBkDNaqzZxSkHMRptVSkHMux7rOeYAADjuVbTlg8GQ8zT3XZAkFMS8zXzRlgsOAIBeD8blDNwUu2TDrxjMPzPfBdy+BObVw7kAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"326\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer in order to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer,</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">[565 U.S. 25]</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">tied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling Hammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on top of him. Dixon then used Hammer\u2019s birth certificate and Social Security card to obtain a state identification card in Hammer\u2019s name. After using that identification card to establish ownership of Hammer\u2019s car, Dixon sold the vehicle for $2,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Hammer\u2019s mother reported her son missing the day after his murder. While investigating Hammer\u2019s disappearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three of which are relevant here. On November 4, 1993, a police detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is undisputed that this was a chance encounter\u2014 Dixon was apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own car, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The detective issued <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Dixon and then asked to talk to him about Hammer\u2019s disappearance. See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Dixon declined to answer questions without his lawyer present and left the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">As their investigation continued, police determined that Dixon had sold Hammer\u2019s car and forged Hammer\u2019s signature when cashing the check he received in that sale. Police arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of November 9. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. detectives intermittently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking with him for about 45 minutes total. Prior to the interrogation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon with <em>Miranda </em>warnings for fear that Dixon would again refuse to speak with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification card in Hammer\u2019s name and signing Hammer\u2019s name on the check, but said that Hammer had given him permission to sell the car. Dixon claimed not to know where Hammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might have left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the plausibility of Dixon\u2019s tale and told Dixon that Tim Hoffner was providing them more useful information. At one point a detective told</p>\n<p id=\"AWZA\">[565 U.S. 26]</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Dixon that \u201cnow is the time to say\u201d whether he had any involvement in Hammer\u2019s disappearance because \u201cif Tim starts cutting a deal over there, this is kinda like, a bus leaving. The first one that gets on it is the only one that\u2019s gonna get on.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a. Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew any thing about Hammer\u2019s disappearance, Hoffner had not told him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything he knew and that he had \u201c[n]othing whatsoever\u201d to do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Hammer\u2019s disappearance. <em>Id., </em>at 186a. At approximately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the detectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where he was booked on a forgery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer\u2019s grave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that Hammer was buried there. After concluding their inter view with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon transported back to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m. Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had heard the police had found a body and asked whether Hoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that Hoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, \u201cI talked to my attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his <em>Miranda </em>rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke with Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police, now using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted to murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion\u2019s share of the blame on Hoffner.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">At Dixon\u2019s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both Dixon\u2019s initial confession to forgery and his later confession to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal. The State did not dispute that Dixon\u2019s forgery confession was properly suppressed, but argued that the murder confession was admissible because Dixon had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings</p>\n<p id=\"A6yO\">[565 U.S. 27]</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">prior to that confession. The Ohio Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon\u2019s murder confession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convicted of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon\u2019s convictions and sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon\u2019s murder confession, the court applied <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that Dixon\u2019s confession to murder after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings was admissible because that confession and his prior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dixon, supra, </em>at 332-334, 805 N.E.2d, at 1050-1052; see <em>Elstad, supra, </em>at 318, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (\u201cWe hold today that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet un-coercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the state court decisions allowing the admission of his murder confession contravened clearly established federal law. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Houk, </em>627 F.3d 553 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d as set forth in this Court\u2019s holdings, or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts\u201d in light of the state court record. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see Harrington, </em>562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>U.S., at 100, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. The Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision contained three such egregious errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the <em>Miranda </em>decision itself clearly established that police could not speak to Dixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had refused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">[565 U.S. 28]</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">It is undisputed that Dixon was not in custody during his chance encounter with police on November 4. And this Court has \u201cnever held that a person can invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights antici-patorily, in a context other than \u2018custodial interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 182, n. 3, 111 S. Ct. 2204, 115 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1991); see also <em>Montejo </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>556 U.S. 778, 795, 129 S. Ct. 2079, 173 L. Ed. 2d 955 (2009)  \u201cIf the defendant is not in custody then <em>[.Miranda </em>and its progeny] do not apply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to \u201ccut a deal\u201d before his accomplice Hoffner did so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Court\u2014or any court\u2014holding that this common police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., <em>e.g., Elstad, supra, </em>at 317, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (\u201c[T]he Court has refused to find that a defendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his codefendant has turned State\u2019s evidence, does so involuntarily\u201d). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much less clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect to confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to issue the writ on this ground.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">[565 U.S. 29]</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme Court unreasonably applied this Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Elstad. </em>In that case, a suspect who had not received <em>Miranda </em>warnings confessed to burglary as police took him into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the suspect again confessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the later, warned confession was admissible because \u201cthere is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the suspect\u2019s initial in-culpatory statement, though technically in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>was voluntary. The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>statement was also voluntarily made.\u201d 470 U.S., at 318, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">As the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion explained, the circumstances surrounding Dixon\u2019s interrogations demonstrate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon\u2019s first interrogation, he received several breaks, was given water and offered food, and was not abused or threatened. He freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer\u2019s name, even stating that the police were \u201cwelcome\u201d to that information, and he had no difficulty denying that he had anything to do with Hammer\u2019s disappearance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N.E.2d, at 1049. Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolicited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer. Then, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights form which stated that he was acting of his own free will.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon\u2019s first interrogation involved \u201can intentional <em>Miranda </em>violation.\u201d 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334, 805 N.E.2d, at 1052. The court concluded, however, that \u201cas in <em>Elstad, </em>the breach of the <em>Miranda</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARok\">[565 U.S. 30]</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">procedures here involved no actual compulsion\u201d and thus there was no reason to suppress Dixon\u2019s later, warned confession. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S., at 318, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon\u2019s confession was inadmissible under <em>Elstad. </em>because it was the product of a \u201cdeliberate question-first, warn-later strategy.\u201d 627 F.3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth Circuit relied heavily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643 (2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Seibert, </em>police employed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of <em>Miranda </em>warnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert until she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20-minute break, gave Seibert <em>Miranda </em>warnings and led her to repeat her prior confession. 542 U.S., at 604-606, 616, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643 (plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert\u2019s second confession was inadmissible as evidence against her even though it was preceded by a <em>Miranda </em>warning. A plurality of the Court reasoned that \u201c[u]pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after making a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.\u201d 542 U.S., at 613, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643; see also <em>id., </em>at 615, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643 (detailing a \u201cseries of relevant facts that bear on whether <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>warnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to accomplish their object\u201d). Justice Kennedy concurred in</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">[565 U.S. 31]</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">the judgment, noting he \u201cwould apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case ... in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 622, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the type that concerned the Court in <em>Seibert </em>undermined the <em>Miranda </em>warnings Dixon received. In <em>Seibert, </em>the suspect\u2019s first, unwarned interrogation left \u201clittle, if anything, of incriminating potential left unsaid,\u201d making it \u201cunnatural\u201d not to \u201crepeat at the second stage what had been said before.\u201d 542 U.S., at 616-617, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643 (plurality opinion). But in this case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first, unwarned interrogation that he had \u201c[n]othing whatsoever\u201d to do with Hammer\u2019s disappearance. App. to Pet. for Cert. 186a. Thus, unlike in <em>Seibert, </em>there is no concern here that police gave Dixon <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then led him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because there was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon <em>contradicted </em>his prior unwarned statements when he confessed to Hammer\u2019s murder. Nor is there any evidence that police used Dixon\u2019s earlier admission to forgery to induce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon declared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer before the second interrogation session even began. As the Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was simply \u201cno nexus\u201d between Dixon\u2019s unwarned admission to forgery and his later, warned confession to murder. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N.E.2d, at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Moreover, in <em>Seibert </em>the Court was concerned that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings did not \u201ceffectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement\u201d because the unwarned and warned interrogations blended into one \u201ccontinuum.\u201d 542 U.S., at 612, 617, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643. Given all the circumstances of this case, that is not so here. Four hours passed between Dixon\u2019s unwarned interrogation and his receipt of <em>Miranda </em>rights, during which time he traveled from the police station to a separate jail and back again; claimed</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">[565 U.S. 32]</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">to have spoken to his lawyer; and learned that police were talking to his accomplice and had found Hammer\u2019s body. Things had changed. Under <em>Seibert, </em>this significant break in time and dramatic change in circumstances created \u201ca new and distinct experience,\u201d ensuring that Dixon\u2019s prior, unwarned interrogation did not undermine the effectiveness of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings he received before confessing to Hammer\u2019s murder. 542 U.S., at 615, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643; see also <em>id., </em>at 622, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cFor example, a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the <em>Miranda </em>warning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">The admission of Dixon\u2019s murder confession was consistent with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Court\u2019s precedents: Dixon received <em>Miranda </em>warnings before confessing to Hammer\u2019s murder; the effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by the sort of \u201ctwo-step interrogation technique\u201d condemned in <em>Seibert; </em>and there is no evidence that any of Dixon\u2019s statements was the product of actual coercion. That does not excuse the detectives\u2019 decision not to give Dixon <em>Miranda </em>warnings before his first interrogation. But the Ohio courts recognized that failure and imposed the appropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon\u2019s forgery confession and the attendant statements given without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Because no precedent of this Court required Ohio to do more, the</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">[565 U.S. 33]</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Sixth Circuit was without authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\">. In the Sixth Circuit\u2019s view, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s contrary conclusion that Dixon\u2019s confession was voluntary \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 2254(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit did not, however, purport to identify any mistaken factual finding. It differed with the Ohio Supreme Court only on the ultimate characterization of Dixon\u2019s confession as voluntary, and this Court\u2019s cases make clear that \u201cthe ultimate issue of 'voluntariness\u2019 is a legal question.\u2019\u2019 <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 110, 106 S. Ct. 445, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1985); see also <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 287, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991). This Court therefore addresses the question the Sixth Circuit should have addressed: whether the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-13\">. The only case the Sixth Circuit cited on this issue was <em>Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S. Ct. 2408, 57 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1978). <em>Mincey </em>involved the \u201cvirtually continuous questioning of a seriously and painfully wounded man on the edge of consciousness\u2019\u2019 who was in a hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and who \u201cclearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated\u2019\u2019 while in a \u201cdebilitated and helpless condition.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 399-401, 98 S. Ct. 2408, 57 L. Ed. 2d 290. There is simply nothing in the facts or reasoning of <em>Mincey </em>suggesting that any of Dixon\u2019s statements were involuntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">. <em>Seibert </em>was not decided until after the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this case, but was issued before this Court denied Dixon\u2019s petition for certiorari seeking review of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision. It is thus an open question whether <em>Seibert </em>was \u201cclearly established Federal law\u2019\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d). See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Spisak, </em>558 U.S. 139, 143, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595 (2010). It is not necessary to decide that question here because <em>Seibert </em>is entirely consistent with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Thus, if <em>Seibert </em>was clearly established law, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u2019\u2019 or \u201can unreasonable application of\u2019 <em>Seibert. </em>\u00a7 2254(d). And if <em>Seibert </em>was not clearly established law, <em>Seibert's </em>explication of <em>Elstad </em>further demonstrates that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Elstad.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\">. The Sixth Circuit also concluded that \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court erroneously placed the burden of proof on Dixon to prove that his confession was coerced.\u201d <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Houk, </em>627 F.3d 553, 558 (2010). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>But the Ohio Supreme Court clearly said that \u2018the state carries the burden of proving voluntariness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 332, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, 1050.
