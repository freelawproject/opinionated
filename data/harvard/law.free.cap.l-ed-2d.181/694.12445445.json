Those safeguards apart, admission of evidence in state trials is ordinarily governed by state law, and the reliability of relevant testimony typically falls within the province of the jury to determine. This Court has recognized, in addition, a due process check on the admission of eyewitness identification, applicable when the police have arranged suggestive circumstances leading the witness to identify a particular person as the perpetrator of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-16\">An identification infected by improper police influence, our case law holds, is not automatically excluded. Instead, the trial judge must screen the evidence for reliability pretrial. If there is \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968), the judge must disallow presentation of the evidence at trial. But if the indicia of reliability are strong enough to outweigh the corrupting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>effect of the police-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identification evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will ultimately determine its worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">We have not extended pretrial screening for reliability to cases in which the suggestive circumstances were not arranged by law enforcement officers. Petitioner requests that we do so because of the grave risk that mistaken identification will yield a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our decisions,</p>\n<p id=\"ANlU\">[565 U.S. 233]</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">however, turn on the presence of state action and aim to deter police from rigging identification procedures, for example, at a lineup, showup, or photograph array. When no improper law enforcement activity is involved, we hold, it suffices to test reliability through the rights and opportunities generally designed for that purpose, notably, the presence of counsel at postindictment lineups, vigorous cross-examination, protective rules of evidence, and jury instructions on both the fallibility of eyewitness identification and the requirement that guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Around 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, Joffre Ullon called the Nashua, New Hampshire, Police Department and reported that an African-American male was trying to break into cars parked in the lot of Ullon\u2019s apartment building. Officer Nicole Clay responded to the call. Upon arriving at the parking lot, Clay heard what \u201csounded like a metal bat hitting the ground.\u201d App. 37a-38a. She then saw petitioner Barion Perry standing between two cars. Perry walked toward Clay, holding two car-stereo amplifiers in his hands. A metal bat lay on the ground behind him. Clay asked Perry where the amplifiers came from. \u201c[I] found them on the ground,\u201d Perry responded. Id., at 39a.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Meanwhile, Ullon\u2019s wife, Nubia Bland\u00f3n, woke her neighbor, Alex Clavijo, and told him she had just seen someone break into his car. Clavijo immediately went downstairs to the parking lot to inspect the car. He first observed that one of the rear windows had been shattered. On further inspection, he discovered that the speakers and amplifiers from his car stereo were missing, as were his bat and</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">[565 U.S. 234]</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">wrench. Clavijo then approached Clay and told her about Blandon\u2019s alert and his own subsequent observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">By this time, another officer had arrived at the scene. Clay asked Perry to stay in the parking lot with that officer, while she and Clavijo went to talk to Bland\u00f3n. Clay and Clavijo then entered the apartment building and took the stairs to the fourth floor, where Blandon\u2019s and Clavijo\u2019s apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ments were located. They met Blan-d\u00f3n in the hallway just outside the open door to her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Asked to describe what she had seen, Bland\u00f3n stated that, around 2:30 a.m., she saw from her kitchen window a tall, African-American man roaming the parking lot and looking into cars. Eventually, the man circled Clavijo\u2019s car, opened the trunk, and removed a large box.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Clay asked Bland\u00f3n for a more specific description of the man. Bland\u00f3n pointed to her kitchen window and said the person she saw breaking into Clavijo\u2019s car was standing in the parking lot, next to the police officer. Perry\u2019s arrest followed this identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">About a month later, the police showed Bland\u00f3n a photographic array that included a picture of Perry and asked her to point out the man who had broken into Clavijo\u2019s car. Bland\u00f3n was unable to identify Perry.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Perry was charged in New Hampshire state court with one count of theft by unauthorized taking and one count of criminal mischief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before trial, he moved to suppress Blandon\u2019s identification on the ground that admitting it at trial would violate due process. Bland\u00f3n witnessed what</p>\n<p id=\"Ap5qT\">[565 U.S. 235]</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">amounted to a one-person showup in the parking lot, Perry asserted, which all but guaranteed that she would identify him as the culprit. <em>Id., </em>at 15a-16a.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The New Hampshire Superior Court denied the motion. <em>Id., </em>at 82a-88a. To determine whether due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at trial, the Superior Court said, this Court\u2019s decisions instruct a two-step inquiry. First, the trial court must decide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure. <em>Id., </em>at 85a. If they did, the court must next consider whether the improper identification procedure so tainted the resulting identification as to render it unreliable and therefore inadmissible. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972), and <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Perry\u2019s challenge, the Superior Court concluded, failed at step one: Blandon\u2019s identification of Perry on the night of the crime did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure \u201cmanufacture [d] ... by the police.\u201d App. 86a-87a. Bland\u00f3n pointed to Perry \u201cspontaneously,\u201d the court noted, \u201cwithout any inducement from the police.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 85a-86a. Clay did not ask Bland\u00f3n whether the man standing in the parking lot was the man Bland\u00f3n had seen breaking into Clavijo\u2019s car. <em>Ibid. </em>Nor did Clay ask Bland\u00f3n to move to the window from which she had observed the break-in. <em>Id., </em>at 86a.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">The Superior Court recognized that there were reasons to question the accuracy of Blandon\u2019s identification: The parking lot was dark in some locations; Perry was standing next to a police officer; Perry was the only African American man in the vicinity; and Bland\u00f3n was unable, later, to pick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Perry out of a photographic array. <em>Id., </em>at 86a-87a. But \u201c[b]ecause the police procedures were not unnecessarily suggestive,\u201d the court ruled that the reliability of Blandon\u2019s testimony was for the jury to consider. <em>Id., </em>at 87a.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">[565 U.S. 236]</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">At the ensuing trial, Bland\u00f3n and Clay testified to Blandon\u2019s out-of-court identification. The jury found Perry guilty of theft and not guilty of criminal mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">On appeal, Perry repeated his challenge to the admissibility of Blandon\u2019s out-of-court identification. The trial court erred, Perry contended, in requiring an initial showing that the police arranged the suggestive identification procedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry argued, suffice to trigger the court\u2019s duty to evaluate the reliability of the resulting identification before allowing presentation of the evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry\u2019s argument and affirmed his conviction. <em>Id., </em>at 9a-11a. Only where the police employ suggestive identification techniques, that court held, does the Due Process Clause require a trial court to assess the reliability of identification evidence before permitting a jury to consider it. <em>Id., </em>at 10a-11a.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion on the question whether the Due Process Clause requires a trial judge to conduct a preliminary assessment of the reliability of an eyewitness identification made under suggestive circumstances not arranged by the police. 563 U.S. 1020, 131 S. Ct. 2932, 180 L. Ed. 2d 224 (2011).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">[565 U.S. 237]</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">The Constitution, our decisions indicate, protects a defendant against a conviction based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by affording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as unworthy of credit. Constitutional safeguards available to defendants to counter the State\u2019s evidence include the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 343-345, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963); compulsory process, <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 408-409, 108 S. Ct. 646, 98 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1988); and confrontation plus cross-examination of witnesses, <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 18-20, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985) <em>(per curiam). </em>Apart from these guarantees, we have recognized, state and federal statutes and rules ordinarily govern the admissibility of evidence, and juries are assigned the task of determining the reliability of the evidence presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>at trial. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Ventris, </em>556 U.S. 586, 594, n., 129 S. Ct. 1841, 173 L. Ed. 2d 801 (2009) (\u201cOur legal system ... is built on the premise that it is the province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing witnesses.\u201d). Only when evidence \u201cis so extremely unfair that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice,\u201d <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 352, 110 S. Ct. 668, 107 L. Ed. 2d 708 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), have we imposed a constraint tied to the Due Process Clause. See, <em>e.g., Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217 (1959) (Due process prohibits the State\u2019s \u201cknowin[g] use [of] false evidence,\u201d because such use violates \u201cany concept of ordered liberty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated here, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving police-arranged identification procedures. In <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (1967), first of those decisions, a witness identified the defendant as her assailant after police officers brought</p>\n<p id=\"A7GA8\">[565 U.S. 238]</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">the defendant to the witness\u2019 hospital room. <em>Id., </em>at 295, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199. At the time the witness made the identification, the defendant\u2014the only African-American in the room\u2014was handcuffed and surrounded by police officers. <em>Ibid. </em>Although the police-arranged showup was undeniably suggestive, the Court held that no due process violation occurred. <em>Id., </em>at 302, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199. Crucial to the Court\u2019s decision was the procedure\u2019s necessity: The witness was the only person who could identify or exonerate the defendant; the witness could not leave her hospital room; and it was uncertain whether she would live to identify the defendant in more neutral circumstances. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">A year later, in <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968), the Court addressed a due process challenge to police use of a photographic array. When a witness identifies the defendant in a police-organized photo lineup, the Court ruled, the identification should be suppressed only where \u201cthe photographic identification procedure was so [unnecessarily] suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 384-385, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247. Satisfied that the photo array used by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in <em>Simmons </em>was both necessary and unlikely to have led to a mistaken identification, the Court rejected the defendant\u2019s due process challenge to admission of the identification. <em>Id., </em>at 385-386, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247. In contrast,  the Court held in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>California, </em>394 U.S. 440, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L. Ed. 2d 402 (1969), that due process required the exclusion of an eyewitness identification obtained through police-arranged procedures that \u201cmade it all but inevitable that [the witness] would identify [the defendant].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 443, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L. Ed. 2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Synthesizing previous decisions,  we set forth in <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972), and reiterated in <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977), the approach appropriately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement. The Court emphasized, first, that due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>use an</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">[565 U.S. 239]</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary. <em>Id., </em>at 107, 109, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140; <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S., at 198, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401. Even when the police use such a procedure, the Court next said, suppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S., at 112-113, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140; <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S., at 198-199, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A rule requiring automatic exclusion, the Court reasoned, would \u201cg[o] too far,\u201d for it would \u201ckee[p] evidence from the jury that is reliable and relevant,\u201d and \u201cmay result, on occasion, in the guilty going free.\u201d <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S., at 112, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140; see <em>id., </em>at 113, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (when an \u201cidentification is reliable despite an unnecessarily suggestive [police] identification procedure,\u201d automatic exclusion \u201cis a Draconian sanction,\u201d one \u201cthat may frustrate rather than promote justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Instead of mandating a <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule, the Court held that the Due Process Clause requires courts to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police conduct created a \u201csubstantial likelihood of misidentification.\u201d <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S., at 201, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401; see <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S., at 116, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. \u201c[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin\u201d of that evaluation, the Court stated in <em>Brathwaite. Id., </em>at 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. Where the \u201cindicators of [a witness\u2019] ability to make an accurate identification\u201d are \u201coutweighed by the corrupting effect\u201d of law enforcement suggestion, the identification should be suppressed. <em>Id., </em>at 114, 116, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. Otherwise, the evidence (if admissible in all other respects) should be submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Applying this \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach, <em>id., </em>at 110, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140, the Court held in <em>Biggers </em>that law enforcement\u2019s use</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">[565 U.S. 240]</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">of an unnecessarily suggestive showup did not require suppression of the victim\u2019s identification of her assailant. 409 U.S., at 199-200, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401. Notwithstanding the improper procedure, the victim\u2019s identification was reliable: She saw her assailant for a considerable period of time under adequate light, provided police with a detailed description of her attacker long before the showup, and had \u201cno doubt\u201d that the defendant was the person she had seen. <em>Id., </em>at 200, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, the Court concluded in <em>Brathwaite </em>that police use of an unnecessarily suggestive photo array did not require exclusion of the resulting identification. 432 U.S., at 114-117, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. The witness, an undercover police officer, viewed the defendant in good light for several minutes, provided a thorough description of the suspect, and was certain of his identification. <em>Id., </em>at 115, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>140. Hence, the \u201cindicators of [the witness\u2019] ability to make an accurate identification [were] hardly outweighed by the corrupting effect of the challenged identification.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 116, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Perry concedes that, in contrast to every case in the <em>Stovall </em>line, law enforcement officials did not arrange the suggestive circumstances surrounding Blandon\u2019s identification. See Brief for Petitioner 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (counsel for Perry) (\u201c[W]e do not allege any manipulation or intentional orchestration by the police.\u201d). He contends, however, that it was mere happenstance that each of the <em>Stovall </em>cases involved improper police action. The rationale underlying our decisions, Perry asserts, supports a rule requiring trial judges to pre-screen eyewitness evidence for reliability any time an identification is made under suggestive circumstances. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Perry\u2019s argument depends, in large part, on the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Brathwaite </em>that \u201creliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.\u201d 432 U.S., at 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. If reliability is the linchpin of admissibility</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">[565 U.S. 241]</p>\n<p id=\"ATboI\">under the Due Process Clause, Perry maintains, it should make no difference whether law enforcement was responsible for creating the suggestive circumstances that marred the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Perry has removed our statement in <em>Brathwaite </em>from its mooring, and thereby attributes to the statement a meaning a fair reading of our opinion does not bear. As just explained, <em>supra, </em>at 238-239, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 706-707,  the <em>Brathwaite </em>Court\u2019s reference to reliability appears in a portion of the opinion concerning the appropriate remedy <em>when the police use an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure. </em>The Court adopted a judicial screen for reliability as a course preferable to a <em>per se </em>rule requiring exclusion of identification evidence whenever law enforcement officers employ an improper procedure. The due process check for reliability, <em>Brathwaite </em>made plain, comes into play only after the defendant establishes improper police conduct. The very purpose of the check, the Court noted, was to avoid depriving the jury of identification evidence that is reliable, <em>notwithstanding </em>improper police conduct. 432 U.S., at 112-113, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Perry\u2019s contention that improper police action was not essential to the reliability check <em>Brathwaite </em>required is echoed by the dissent. <em>Post, </em>at 252, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 715. Both ignore  a key premise of the <em>Brathwaite </em>decision: A primary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances, the Court said, is to deter law enforcement use of improper lineups, showups, and photo arrays in the first place. See 432 U.S., at 112, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. Alerted to the prospect that identification evidence improperly obtained may be excluded, the Court reasoned, police officers will \u201cguard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>against unnecessarily suggestive procedures.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This deterrence rationale is inapposite in cases, like Perry\u2019s, in which the police engaged in no improper conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1970), another decision in the <em>Stovall </em>line, similarly shows that the Court has linked the due process check, not to suspicion of eyewitness testimony generally, but only to improper police arrangement of the circumstances surrounding an identification. The defendants in <em>Coleman </em>contended that a witness\u2019 in-court identifications violated due process, because a pretrial stationhouse lineup was \u201cso unduly prejudicial and conducive to irreparable misidentification as fatally to taint [the later identifications].\u201d 399 U.S., at 3, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected this argument. <em>Id., </em>at 5-6, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (plurality opinion), 13-14, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (Black, J., concurring), 22, n. 2, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), 28, n. 2, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (Stewart, J., dissenting). No due process violation occurred, the plurality explained, because nothing \u201cthe police said or did prompted [the witness\u2019] virtually spontaneous identification of [the defendants].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 6, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387. True, Coleman was the only person in the lineup wearing a hat, the plurality noted, but \u201cnothing in the record show[ed] that he was required to do so.\u201d <em>Ibid. See </em>also <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 163, 167, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986) (Where the \u201ccrucial element of police overreaching\u201d is missing, the admissibility of an allegedly unreliable confession is \u201ca matter to be governed by the evidentiary laws of the forum, . . . and not by the Due Process Clause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Perry and the dissent place significant weight on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (1967), describing it as a decision not anchored to improper police conduct. See Brief for Petitioner 12, 15, 21-22, 28; <em>post, </em>at 250-253, 256-258, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 714-716, 718-719. In fact,  the risk of police rigging was the very danger to which the Court responded in <em>Wade </em>when it recognized a defendant\u2019s right to counsel at postindictment, police-organized identification procedures. 388 U.S., at 233, 235-236, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149. \u201c[T]he confrontation <em>compelled by the State </em>between the accused and the</p>\n<p id=\"A0bn\">[565 U.S. 243]</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">victim or witnesses,\u201d the Court began, \u201cis peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 228, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (emphasis added). \u201cA major factor contributing to the high incidence of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification,\u201d the Court continued, \u201chas been the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which <em>the prosecution </em>presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). To illustrate the improper suggestion it was concerned about, the Court pointed to police-designed lineups where \u201call in the lineup but the suspect were known to the identifying witness, . . . the other participants in [the] lineup were grossly dissimilar in appearance to the suspect, . . . only the suspect was required to wear distinctive clothing which the culprit allegedly wore, . . . the witness is told by the police that they have caught the culprit after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>which the defendant is brought before the witness alone or is viewed in jail, .. . the suspect is pointed out before or during a lineup, . . . the participants in the lineup are asked to try on an article of clothing which fits only the <em>suspect.\u201d Id., </em>at 233, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149. Beyond genuine debate, then, prevention of unfair police practices prompted the Court to extend a defendant\u2019s right to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups. <em>Id., </em>at 235, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Perry\u2019s argument, reiterated by the dissent, thus lacks support in the case law he cites. Moreover, his position would open the door to judicial preview, under the banner of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifications. External suggestion is hardly the only factor that casts doubt on the trustworthiness of an eyewitness\u2019 testimony. As one of Perry\u2019s <em>amici </em>points out, many other factors bear on \u201cthe likelihood of misidentification,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 258, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 719\u2014for example, the passage of time between exposure to and identification of the defendant, whether the witness was under stress when he first encountered the suspect, how much time the witness had to observe the suspect, how far the witness was</p>\n<p id=\"ADT2\">[565 U.S. 244]</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">from the suspect, whether the suspect carried a weapon, and the race of the suspect and the witness. Brief for American Psychological Association as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9-12. There is no reason why an identification made by an eyewitness with poor vision, for example, or one who harbors a grudge against the defendant, should be regarded as inherently more reliable, less of a \u201cthreat to the fairness of trial,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 262, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 722, than the identification Bland\u00f3n made in this case. To embrace Perry\u2019s view would thus entail a vast enlargement of the reach of due process as a constraint on the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Perry maintains that the Court can limit the due process check he proposes to identifications made under \u201csuggestive circumstances.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-14. Even if we could rationally distinguish suggestiveness from other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry\u2019s limitation would still involve trial courts, routinely, in preliminary examinations.  Most eyewitness identifications involve some element of suggestion. Indeed, all in-court identifications do. Out-of-court identifications volunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve suggestive circumstances. For example, suppose a witness identifies the defendant to police officers after seeing a photograph of the defendant in the press captioned \u201ctheft suspect,\u201d or hearing a radio report implicating the defendant in the crime. Or suppose the witness knew that the defendant ran with the wrong crowd and saw him on the day and in the vicinity of the crime. Any of these circumstances might have \u201csuggested\u201d to the witness that the defendant was the person the witness observed committing the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">In urging a broadly applicable due process check on eyewitness identifications, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are a uniquely unreliable form of evidence. See Brief for Petitioner 17-22 (citing studies showing that</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">[565 U.S. 245]</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">eyewitness mis-identifications are the leading cause of wrongful convictions); Brief for American Psychological Association as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>14-17 (describing research indicating that as many as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>one in three eyewitness identifications is inaccurate). See also <em>post, </em>at 262-265, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 722-724. We do not doubt either the importance or the fallibility of eyewitness identifications. Indeed, in recognizing that defendants have a constitutional right to counsel at postindictment police lineups, we observed that \u201cthe annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S., at 228, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">We have concluded in other contexts, however, that the potential unreliability of a type of evidence does not alone render its introduction at the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair. See, <em>e.g., Ventris, </em>556 U.S., at 594, n., 129 S. Ct. 1841, 173 L. Ed. 2d 801 (declining to \u201ccraft a broa[d] exclusionary rule for uncorroborated statements obtained [from jailhouse snitches],\u201d even though \u201crewarded informant testimony\u201d may be inherently untrustworthy); <em>Dowling, </em>493 U.S., at 353, 110 S. Ct. 668, 107 L. Ed. 2d 708 (rejecting argument that the introduction of evidence concerning acquitted conduct is fundamentally unfair because such evidence is \u201cinherently unreliable\u201d). We reach a similar conclusion here: The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen such evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its creditworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Our unwillingness to enlarge the domain of due process as Perry and the dissent urge rests, in large part, on our recognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence. See <em>supra, </em>at 237, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 705. We also take account of other safeguards built into our adversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability. These protections include the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the eyewitness. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 845, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990) (\u201cThe central concern of the Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"A-rq\">[565 U.S. 246]</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant.\u201d). Another is the defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of an attorney, who can expose the flaws in the eyewitness\u2019 testimony during cross-examination and focus the jury\u2019s attention on the fallibility of such testimony during opening and closing arguments. Eyewitness-specific jury instructions, which many federal and state courts have adopted,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> likewise warn the jury to take care in appraising identification evidence. See, <em>e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Telfaire, </em>469 F.2d 552, 558-559 (CADC 1972) <em>(per curiam) </em>(D. C. Circuit Model Jury Instructions) (\u201cIf the identification by the witness may have been influenced by the circumstances under which the defendant was presented to him for identification, you should scrutinize the identification with great care.\u201d). See also <em>Ventris, </em>556 U.S., at 594, n., 129 S. Ct. 1841, 173 L. Ed. 2d 801 (citing jury instructions that informed jurors about the unreliability of uncorroborated jailhouse-informant testimony as a reason to</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">[565 U.S. 247]</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">resist a ban on such testimony); <em>Dowling, </em>493 U.S., at 352-353, 110 S. Ct. 668, 107 L. Ed. 2d 708. The constitutional requirement that the government prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt also impedes convictions based on dubious identification evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">State and Federal Rules of Evidence, moreover, permit trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact or potential for misleading the jury. See, <em>e.g., </em>Fed. Rule Evid. 403; N.H. Rule Evid. 403 (2011). See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 19-22 (inquiring whether the standard Perry seeks differs materially from the one set out in Rule 403). In appropriate cases, some States also permit defendants to present expert testimony on the hazards of eyewitness identification evidence. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Clopten, </em>2009 UT 84, \u00b6 33, 223 P.3d 1103, 1113 (\u201cWe expect . . . that in cases involving eyewitness identification of strangers or near-strangers, trial courts will routinely admit expert testimony [on the dangers of such evidence].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Many of the safeguards just noted were at work at Perry\u2019s trial. During her opening statement, Perry\u2019s cour-tappointed attorney cautioned the jury about the vulnerability of Bland-on\u2019s identification. App. 115a (Blan-d\u00f3n, \u201cthe eyewitness that the State needs you to believe [,] can\u2019t pick [Perry] out of a photo array. How carefully did she really see what was going on? . . . How well could she really see him?\u201d). While cross-examining Bland\u00f3n and Officer Clay, Perry\u2019s attorney constantly brought up the weaknesses of Blandon\u2019s identification. She highlighted: (1) the significant distance between Blandon\u2019s window and the parking lot, <em>id., </em>at 226a; (2) the lateness of the hour, <em>id., </em>at 225a; (3) the van that partly obstructed Blandon\u2019s view, <em>id., </em>at 226a; (4) Blandon\u2019s concession that she was \u201cso scared [she] really didn\u2019t pay attention\u201d to what Perry was wearing, <em>id., </em>at 233a; (5) Blandon\u2019s inability to describe Perry\u2019s facial features or other identifying marks, <em>id., </em>at 205a, 233a-235a; (6) Blandon\u2019s failure to pick Perry out of a photo array, <em>id., </em>at 235a; and (7)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">[565 U.S. 248]</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Perry\u2019s position next to a uniformed, gun-bearing police officer at the moment Bland\u00f3n made her identification, <em>id., </em>at 202a-205a. Perry\u2019s counsel reminded the jury of these frailties during her summation. <em>Id., </em>at 374a-375a (Bland\u00f3n \u201cwasn\u2019t able to tell you much about who she saw .... She couldn\u2019t pick [Perry] out of a lineup, out of a photo array .... [Bland\u00f3n said] [t]hat guy that was with the police officer, that\u2019s who was circling. Again, think about the context with the guns, the uniforms. Powerful, powerful context clues.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">After closing arguments, the trial court read the jury a lengthy instruction on identification testimony and the factors the jury should consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>when evaluating it. <em>Id., </em>at 399a-40la. The court also instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>id., </em>at 390a, 392a, 395a-396a, and specifically cautioned that \u201cone of the things the State must prove [beyond a reasonable doubt] is the identification of the defendant as the person who committed the offense,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 398a-399a.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal trials, protections availed of by the defense in Perry\u2019s case, we hold that the introduction of Blandon\u2019s eyewitness testimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its reliability, did not render Perry\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"Am26\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the New Hampshire courts\u2019 appraisal of our decisions. See <em>supra, </em>at 235-236, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 704-705. Finding no convincing reason to alter our precedent, we hold that [16] the Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement. Accordingly, the judgment of the New Hampshire Supreme Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\">. The dissent, too, appears to urge that all suggestive circumstances raise due process concerns warranting a pretrial ruling. See <em>post, </em>at 254, 257, 262-265, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 717, 718, 722-724. Neither Perry nor the dissent, however, points to a single case in which we have required pretrial screening absent a police arranged identification procedure. Understandably so, for there are no such cases. Instead, the dissent surveys our decisions, heedless of the police arrangement that underlies every one of them, and inventing a \u201clongstanding rule,\u2019\u2019 <em>post, </em>at 254, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 717, that never existed. Nor are we, as the dissent suggests, imposing a <em>mens rea </em>requirement, <em>post, </em>at 250, 255, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 714, 717, or otherwise altering our precedent in any way.  As our case law makes clear, what triggers due process concerns is police use of an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure, whether or not they intended the arranged procedure to be suggestive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-14\">.

Ed. 2d 1199 (concluding that whether a suggestive identification \u201cresulted in such unfairness that it infringed [the defendant\u2019s] right to due process of law\u201d is \u201copen to all persons to allege and prove\u201d); <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 113, 97 S.

Our cases thus establish</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">[565 U.S. 250]</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">a clear rule: The admission at trial of out-of-court eyewitness identifications derived from imper-missibly suggestive circumstances that pose a very substantial likelihood of misidentification violates due process. The Court today announces that that rule does not even \u201ccom[e] into play\u201d unless the suggestive circumstances are improperly \u201cpolice-arranged.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 232, 241, 181 L.

By rendering protection contingent on improper police arrangement of the suggestive circumstances, the Court effectively grafts a <em>mens rea </em>inquiry onto our rule. The Court\u2019s holding enshrines a murky distinction\u2014between suggestive confrontations intentionally orchestrated by the police and, as here, those inadvertently caused by police actions\u2014that will sow confusion. It ignores our precedents\u2019 acute sensitivity to the hazards of intentional and unintentional suggestion alike and unmoors our rule from the very interest it protects, inviting arbitrary results. And it recasts the driving force of our decisions as an interest in police deterrence, rather than reliability.

Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. Eyewitness evidence derived from suggestive circumstances, we have explained, is uniquely resistant to the ordinary tests of the adversary process. An eyewitness who has made an identification often becomes convinced of its accuracy. <em>\u201cRegardless of how the initial misidentification comes about, </em>the witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the image of the photograph rather than of the person actually seen, reducing the trustworthiness of subsequent . . . courtroom identification.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 383-384, 88 S.

Suggestion bolsters that confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">At trial, an eyewitness\u2019 artificially inflated confidence in an identification\u2019s accuracy complicates the jury\u2019s task of assessing witness credibility and reliability. It also impairs the defendant\u2019s ability to attack the eyewitness\u2019 credibility. <em>Stovall, </em>388 U.S., at 298, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199. That in turn jeopardizes the defendant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">[565 U.S. 253]</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">basic right to subject his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>accuser to meaningful cross-examination.

Ed. 2d 1149 (\u201c[C]ross-examination . . . cannot be viewed as an absolute assurance of accuracy and reliability . . . where so many variables and pitfalls exist\u201d). The end result of suggestion, whether intentional or unintentional, is to fortify testimony bearing directly on guilt that juries find extremely convincing and are hesitant to discredit. See <em>id.., </em>at 224, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (\u201c[A]t pretrial proceedings . . . the results might well settle the accused\u2019s fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality\u201d); <em>Gilbert, </em>388 U.S., at 273, 87 S.

(\u201cThe due process clause applies only to proceedings which result in a deprivation of life, liberty or property. . . . [I]f a constitutional violation results from a showup, it occurs in the courtroom, not in the police station\u201d). In short, \u201c \u2018what the <em>Stovall </em>due process right protects is an evidentiary interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S., at 113, n. 14, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">To protect that evidentiary interest, we have applied a two-step inquiry: First, the defendant has the burden of showing that the eyewitness identification was derived</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">[565 U.S. 254]</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">through \u201cimper-missibly suggestive\u201d means.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S., at 384, 88 S.

That step entails considering the witness\u2019 opportunity to view the perpetrator, degree of attention, accuracy of description, level of certainty, and the time between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>crime and pretrial confrontation, then weighing such factors against the \u201ccorrupting effect of the suggestive identification.\u201d <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S., at 108, 114, 97 S.

Ed. 2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The majority today creates a novel and significant limitation on our longstanding rule: Eyewitness identifications so impermissibly suggestive that they pose a very substantial likelihood of an unreliable identification will be deemed inadmissible at trial <em>only </em>if the suggestive circumstances were \u201cpolice-arranged.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 232, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 703. Absent \u201cimproper police</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">[565 U.S. 255]</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">arrangement,\u201d \u201cimproper police conduct,\u201d or \u201crigging,\u201d the majority holds, our two-step inquiry does not even \u201ccom[e] into play.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 233, 241-242, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 702, 708-709. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The majority does not simply hold that an eyewitness identification must be the product of police action to trigger our ordinary two-step inquiry. Rather, the majority maintains that the suggestive circumstances giving rise to the identification must be \u201cpolice-arranged,\u201d \u201cpolice rigg[ed],\u201d \u201cpolice-designed,\u201d or \u201cpolice-organized.\u201d Ante, at 232, 242-243, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 703, 709-710. Those terms connote a degree of intentional orchestration or manipulation. See Brief for Respondent 19 (no indication that police \u201cdeliberately tried to manipulate any evidence\u201d); Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18 (\u201c[N]o one deliberately arranged the circumstances to obtain an identification\u201d). The majority categorically exempts all eyewitness identifications derived from suggestive circumstances that were not police manipulated\u2014however suggestive, and however unreliable\u2014from our due process check. The majority thus appears to graft a <em>mens rea </em>requirement onto our existing rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">As this case illustrates, police intent is now paramount. As the Court acknowledges, Perry alleges an <em>\u201caccidental </em>showup.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 34 (emphasis added); see <em>ante, </em>at 235, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 704. He was the only African-American at the scene of the crime standing next to a police officer. For the majority, the fact that the police did not intend that showup, even if they inadvertently caused it in the course of a police procedure, ends the inquiry. The police were questioning the eyewitness, Bland\u00f3n, about the perpetrator\u2019s identity, and</p>\n<p id=\"AGobG\">[565 U.S. 256]</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">were intentionally detaining Perry in the parking lot\u2014but had not intended for Bland\u00f3n to identify the perpetrator from her window. Presumably, in the majority\u2019s view, had the police asked Bland\u00f3n to move to the window to identify the perpetrator, that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>have made all the difference. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">I note, however, that the majority leaves what is required by its arrangement-focused inquiry less than clear. In parts, the opinion suggests that the police must arrange an identification \u201cprocedure,\u201d regardless of whether they \u201cinten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 232-233, n. 1, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 703; see also <em>ante, </em>at 237-238, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 705-706. Elsewhere, it indicates that the police must arrange the \u201csuggestive circumstances\u201d that lead the witness to identify the accused. See <em>ante, </em>at 232, 240-241, 244, 248, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 702-703, 708, 710, 713. Still elsewhere it refers to \u201cimproper\u201d police conduct, <em>ante, </em>at 232-233, 239-243, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 702-703, 707-710, connoting bad faith. Does police \u201carrangement\u201d relate to the procedure, the suggestiveness, or both? If it relates to the procedure, do suggestive preproce-dure encounters no longer raise the same concerns? If the police need not \u201cinten [d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 233, n. 1, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 703, what makes the police action \u201cimproper\u201d? And does that mean that good-faith, unintentional police suggestiveness in a police-arranged lineup can be \u201cimper-missibly suggestive\u201d? If no, the majority runs headlong into <em>Wade. </em>If yes, on what basis\u2014if not deterrence\u2014does it distinguish unintentional police suggestiveness in an accidental confrontation?</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The arrangement-focused inquiry will sow needless confusion. If the police had called Perry and Bland\u00f3n to the police station for interviews, and Bland\u00f3n saw Perry being questioned, would that be sufficiently \u201cimproper police arrangement\u201d? If Perry had voluntarily come to the police station, would that change the result? Today\u2019s opinion renders the applicability of our ordinary inquiry contingent on a murky line-drawing exercise. Whereas our two-step inquiry focuses on overall reliability\u2014and could account for</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">[565 U.S. 257]</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">the spontaneity of the witness\u2019 identification and degree of police manipulation under the totality of the circumstances\u2014today\u2019s opinion forecloses that assessment by establishing a new and inflexible step zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The majority regards its limitation on our two-step rule as compelled by precedent. Its chief rationale, <em>ante, </em>at 237-243, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 705-710, is that none of our prior cases involved situations where the police \u201cdid not arrange the suggestive circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 240, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 708; see also <em>ante, </em>at 232, n. 1, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 703. That is not necessarily true, given the seemingly unintentional encounter highlighted in <em>Wade. </em>But even if it were true, it is unsurprising. The vast majority of eyewitness identifications that the State uses in criminal prosecutions are obtained in lineup, showup, and photograph displays arranged by the police. Our precedents reflect that practical reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">It is also beside the point. Our due process concerns were not predicated on the source of suggestiveness. Rather, \u201c [i]t is the likelihood of mis-identification which violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process,\u201d <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S., at 198, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401, and we are concerned with suggestion insofar as it has \u201ccorrupting effect[s]\u201d on the identification\u2019s reliability, <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>U.S., at 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. Accordingly, whether the police have created the suggestive circumstances intentionally or inadvertently, the resulting identification raises the same due process concerns. It is no more or less likely to misidentify the perpetrator. It is no more or less powerful to the jury. And the defendant is no more or less equipped to challenge the identification through cross-examination or prejudiced at trial. The arrangement-focused inquiry thus untethers our doctrine from the very \u201c \u2018evidentiary interest\u2019 \u201d it was designed to protect, inviting arbitrary results. <em>Id., </em>at 113, n. 14, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Indeed, it is the majority\u2019s approach that lies in tension with our precedents. Whereas we previously disclaimed the</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">[565 U.S. 258]</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">crabbed view of suggestiveness as \u201cthe result of police procedures intentionally designed to prejudice an accused,\u201d <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S., at 235, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149, the majority\u2019s focus on police rigging and improper conduct will revive it. Whereas our precedents were sensitive to intentional and unintentional suggestiveness alike, see <em>supra, </em>at 251-252, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 714-715, today\u2019s decision narrows our concern to intentionally orchestrated suggestive confrontations. We once described the \u201cprimary evil to be avoided\u201d as the likelihood of misiden-tification. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S., at 198, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401. Today\u2019s decision, however, means that even if that primary evil is at its apex, we need not avoid it at all so long as the suggestive circumstances do not stem from improper police arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The majority gives several additional reasons for why applying our due process rule beyond improperly police-arranged circumstances is unwarranted. In my view, none withstands close inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">First, the majority insists that our precedents \u201caim to deter police from rigging identification procedures,\u201d so our rule should be limited to applications that advance that \u201cprimary aim\u201d and \u201ckey premise.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 233, 241, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 703, 708 (citing <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S., at 112, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140). That mischar-acterizes our cases. We discussed deterrence in <em>Brathwaite </em>because Brathwaite challenged our two-step inquiry as <em>lacking </em>deterrence value. Brathwaite argued that deterrence demanded a <em>per se </em>rule excluding all suggestive identifications. He said that our rule, which probes the reliability of suggestive identifications under the totality of the circumstances, \u201ccannot be expected to have a significant deterrent impact.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 111, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">We rebutted Brathwaite\u2019s criticism in language the majority now wrenches from context: Upon summarizing Brathwaite\u2019s argument, we acknowledged \u201cseveral interests to be considered.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We then compared the two rules under each interest: First, we noted the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind <em>Wade </em>and its companion cases\u2014\u201cthe concern that the jury</p>\n<p id=\"A8lo\">[565 U.S. 259]</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">not hear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has aspects of reliability\u201d\u2014and found both approaches \u201cresponsive to this concern,\u201d but the <em>per se </em>rule to go \u201ctoo far\u201d in suppressing reliable evidence. 432 U.S., at 111-112, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. We noted a \u201csecond factor\u201d\u2014deterrence\u2014conceding that the <em>per se </em>rule had \u201cmore significant deterrent effect,\u201d but noting that our rule \u201calso has an influence on police behavior.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 112, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140. Finally, we noted a \u201cthird factor\u201d\u2014\u201cthe effect on the administration of justice\u201d\u2014describing the <em>per se </em>rule as having serious drawbacks on this front. <em>Ibid. </em>That was no list of \u201cprimary aim[s].\u201d Nor was it a ringing endorsement of the primacy of deterrence. We simply underscored, in responding to Brathwaite, that our rule was not without deterrence benefits. To the contrary, we clarified that deterrence was a subsidiary concern to reliability, the \u201cdriving force\u201d of our doctrine. It is a stretch to claim that our rule cannot apply wherever \u201c [t]his deterrence rationale is inapposite.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 242, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Second, the majority states that <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1970), held that \u201c[n]o due process violation occurred . . . because nothing \u2018the police said or did prompted\u2019 \u201d the identification and shows that our rule is linked \u201conly to improper police arrangement.\u201d Ante, at 242, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 709. That misreads the decision. In <em>Coleman, </em>the petitioners challenged a witness\u2019 in-court identification of them at trial on grounds that it had been tainted by a suggestive pretrial lineup. We held that no due process violation occurred because the in-court identification appeared to be \u201centirely based upon observations at the time of the assault and not at all induced by the conduct of the lineup,\u201d and thus could not be said to stem from an identification procedure \u201c \u2018so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d 399 U.S., at 5-6, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (plurality opinion). We then dismissed each of the asserted suggestive influences as having had no bearing on the identification at all: The petitioners claimed that the police intimated to the</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">[565 U.S. 260]</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">witness that his attackers were in the lineup; we found the record \u201cdevoid of evidence that anything the police said or did\u201d induced the identification. <em>Id., </em>at 6, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387. The petitioners claimed that they alone were made to say certain words; we found that the witness identified petitioners before either said anything. One petitioner claimed he was singled out to wear a hat; we found that the witness\u2019 identification \u201cd[id] not appear . . . based on the fact that he remembered that [the attacker] had worn a hat.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, far from indicating that improper police conduct is a prerequisite, <em>Coleman </em>merely held that there had been no influence on the witness. In fact, in concluding that the lineup was not \u201c \u2018so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman </em>indicates that the two-step inquiry is not truncated at the threshold by the absence of police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Third, the majority emphasizes that we should rely on the jury to determine the reliability of evidence. See <em>ante, </em>at 245-247, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 711-712. But our cases are rooted in the assumption that eyewitness identifications upend the ordinary expectation that it is \u201cthe province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing witnesses.\u201d <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Ventris, </em>556 U.S. 586, 594, n., 129 S. Ct. 1841, 173 L. Ed. 2d 801 (2009). As noted, jurors find eyewitness evidence unusually powerful and their ability to assess credibility is hindered by a witness\u2019 false confidence in the accuracy of his or her identification. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>disability in no way depends on the intent behind the suggestive circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">The majority\u2019s appeals to protecting the jury\u2019s domain, moreover, appeared in dissent after dissent from our decisions. See <em>Foster </em>v. <em>California, </em>394 U.S. 440, 447, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L. Ed. 2d 402 (1969) (Black, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he jury is the sole tribunal to weigh and determine facts\u201d and \u201cmust ... be allowed to hear eyewitnesses and decide for itself whether it can recognize the truth\u201d); <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S., at 395, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cThe weight of the evidence ... is not a question for the Court but for the jury\u201d). So</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">[565 U.S. 261]</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">too does the majority\u2019s assurance that other constitutional protections like the Sixth Amendment rights to compulsory process and confrontation can suffice to expose unreliable identifications. Compare <em>ante, </em>at 237, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 705, with <em>Foster, </em>394 U.S., at 448-449, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L. Ed. 2d 402 (Black, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe Constitution sets up its own standards of unfairness in criminal trials,\u201d including the Sixth Amendment \u201cright to compulsory process\u201d and \u201cright to confront . . . witnesses\u201d). So too does the majority\u2019s appeal to leave reliability to the rules of evidence. Compare <em>ante, </em>at 247, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 712, with <em>Foster, </em>394 U.S., at 448, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L. Ed. 2d 402 (Black, J., dissenting) (\u201c \u2018Rules of evidence are designed in the interests of fair trials\u2019 \u201d), and <em>Stovall, </em>388 U.S., at 306, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (Black, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he result ... is to put into a constitutional mould a rule of evidence\u201d). Those arguments did not prevail then; they should not prevail here.</p>\n<p id=\"AdsxE\">Fourth, the majority suggests that applying our rule beyond police-arranged suggestive circumstances would entail a heavy practical burden, requiring courts to engage in \u201cpreliminary judicial inquiry\u201d into \u201cmost, if not all, eyewitness identifications.\u201d Ante, at 243, 248, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 710, 713. But that is inaccurate. The burden of showing \u201cimpermissi-bly suggestive\u201d circumstances is the defendant\u2019s, so the objection falls to the defendant to raise. And as is implicit in the majority\u2019s reassurance that Perry may resort to the rules of evidence in lieu of our due process precedents, trial courts will be entertaining defendants\u2019 objections, pretrial or at trial, to unreliable eyewitness evidence in any event. The relevant question, then, is what the standard of admissibility governing such objections should be. I see no reason to water down the standard for an equally suggestive and unreliable identification simply because the suggestive confrontation was unplanned.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">It bears reminding, moreover, that we set a high bar for suppression. The vast majority of eyewitnesses proceed to testify before a jury. To date, <em>Foster </em>is the only case in which we have found a due process violation. 394 U.S., at</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">[565 U.S. 262]</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">443, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L. Ed. 2d 402. There has been no flood of claims in the four Federal Circuits that, having seen no basis for an ar-rangementbased distinction in our precedents, have long indicated that due process scrutiny applies to all suggestive identification procedures. See <em>Dunnigan </em>v. <em>Keane, </em>137 F.3d 117, 128 (CA2 1998); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bouthot, </em>878 F.2d 1506, 1516 (CA1 1989); <em>Thigpen </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>804 F.2d 893, 895 (CA6 1986); see also <em>Green </em>v. <em>Loggins, </em>614 F.2d 219, 223 (CA9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>1980). Today\u2019s decision nonetheless precludes even the possibility that an unintended confrontation will meet that bar, mandating summary dismissal of every such claim at the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Finally, the majority questions how to \u201crationally distinguish suggestiveness from other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence,\u201d such as \u201cpoor vision\u201d or a prior \u201cgrudge,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 244, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 710, and more broadly, how to distinguish eyewitness evidence from other kinds of arguably unreliable evidence, <em>ante, </em>at 244-245, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 710-711. Our precedents, however, did just that. We emphasized the \u201c \u2018formidable number of instances in the records of English and American trials\u2019 \u201d of \u201cmiscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken identification.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S., at 228, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149. We then observed that \u201c \u2018[t]he influence of improper suggestion upon identifying witnesses probably accounts for more miscarriages of justice than any other single factor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 229, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149. Moreover, the majority points to no other type of evidence that shares the rare confluence of characteristics that makes eyewitness evidence a unique threat to the fairness of trial. Jailhouse informants, cf. <em>ante, </em>at 245, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 711, unreliable as they may be, are not similarly resistant to the traditional tools of the adversarial process and, if anything, are met with particular skepticism by juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">It would be one thing if the passage of time had cast doubt on the empirical premises of our precedents. But just the opposite has happened. Avast body of scientific literature</p>\n<p id=\"ASEt\">[565 U.S. 263]</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">has reinforced every concern our precedents articulated nearly a half century ago, though it merits barely a parenthetical mention in the majority opinion. <em>Ante, </em>at 244-245, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 710-711. Over the past three decades, more than 2,000 studies related to eyewitness identification have been published. One State Supreme Court recently appointed a Special Master to conduct an exhaustive survey of the current state of the scientific evidence and concluded that \u201c [t]he research . . . is not only extensive,\u201d but \u201cit represents the \u2018gold standard in terms of the applicability of social science research to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. 208, 283, 27 A.3d 872, 916 (2011). \u201cExperimental methods and findings have been tested and retested, subjected to scientific scrutiny through peer-reviewed journals, evaluated through the lens of meta-analyses, and replicated at times in real-world settings.\u201d <em>Ibid..; </em>see also Schmechel, O\u2019Toole, Easterly, &amp; Lof-tus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors\u2019 Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46 Jurimetrics 177, 180 (2006) (noting \u201cnearly unanimous consensus among researchers about the [eyewitness reliability] field\u2019s core findings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The empirical evidence demonstrates that eyewitness misidentification is \u201c \u2018the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions in this country.\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Researchers have found that a staggering 76% of the first 250 convictions overturned due to DNA evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>since 1989 involved eyewitness mis-identification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">[565 U.S. 264]</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Study after study demonstrates that eyewitness recollections are highly susceptible to distortion by postevent information or social cues;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that jurors routinely overestimate the accuracy of eyewitness identifications;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that jurors place the greatest weight on eyewitness confidence in assessing identification<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> even though confidence is a poor gauge of accuracy;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that suggestiveness can stem from sources beyond police-orchestrated procedures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The majority today nevertheless adopts an artificially narrow conception</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">[565 U.S. 265]</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">of the dangers of suggestive identifications at a time when our concerns should have deepened.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">There are many reasons why Perry\u2019s particular situation might not violate due process. The trial court found that the circumstances surrounding Blandon\u2019s identification did not rise to an impermissibly suggestive level. It is not at all clear, moreover, that there was a very substantial likelihood of misidentification, given Blandon\u2019s lack of equivocation on the scene, the short time between crime and confrontation, and the \u201cfairly well lit\u201d parking lot. App. 56. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>The New Hampshire Supreme Court, however, never made findings on either point and, under the majority\u2019s decision today, never will.</p>\n<p id=\"pAjYW6\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"50\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARUAAAAzAQAAAACRF6HQAAAAtklEQVR4nO3UIQ7CQBAF0N9JLQEPogdB9AAcBosCFCg8t6lAYLjDCjyQJrANsB+5kx3RCoKh497P3820YjOibRpprQB9p+/8Yyfo4GUhAJ46vlt8cR+uz9FvORoIEA56y62FAOJcjPOqMsgI7GQe80nuEjQgeV0yjmMKD5JexzcDLwBOK7XnHhYkB5t4MoyHKXwOcDSNJ0MxMxAgFIX6JWVpQXLxUNfXlxSdv6ttunSy/g3/SecDKc7QukU2bzkAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"276\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The Court\u2019s opinion today renders the defendant\u2019s due process protection contingent on whether the suggestive circumstances giving rise to the eyewitness identification stem from improper police arrangement. That view lies in tension with our precedents\u2019 more holistic conception of the dangers of suggestion and is untethered from the evidentiary interest the due process right protects. In my view, the ordinary two-step inquiry should apply, whether the police created the suggestive circumstances intentionally or inadvertently. Because the New Hampshire Supreme Court truncated its inquiry at the threshold, I would vacate the judgment and remand for a proper analysis. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-13\">. Because the facts of this case involve police action, I do not reach the question whether due process is triggered in situations involving no police action whatsoever.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\">. <em>Wade </em>held that the dangers of pretrial identification procedures necessitated a right to counsel; that same day, <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (1967), held that a defendant ineligible for the <em>Wade </em>rule was still entitled to challenge the confrontation as a due process violation. Because the two were companion cases advancing interrelated rules to avoid unfairness at trial resulting from suggestive pretrial confrontations, Wade's exposition of the dangers of suggestiveness informs both contexts. See <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 112, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977) <em>(\u201cWade </em>and its companion cases reflect the concern that the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has aspects of reliability\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">. Our precedents refer to \u201cimpermissibly,\u201d \u201cunnecessarily,\u201d and \u201cunduly\u201d suggestive circumstances interchangeably. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 105, n. 8, 107-108, 110, 112-113, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (\u201cimpermissibly\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily\u201d); <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 196-199, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972) (same); <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 3-5, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L.

Ed. 2d 1247 (1968) (same). The Circuits have followed suit. <em>E.g., Thigpen </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>804 F.2d 893, 895 (CA6 1986) (\u201cunduly\u201d); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Loggins, </em>614 F.2d 219, 223 (CA9 1980) (\u201cunnecessarily or impermissibly\u201d). All reinforce our focus not on the act of suggestion, but on whether the suggestiveness rises to such a level that it undermines reliability. Police machinations can heighten the likelihood of misidentification, but they are no prerequisite to finding a confrontation \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of. . . misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S., at 384, 88 S.
