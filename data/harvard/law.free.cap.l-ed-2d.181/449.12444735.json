We hold that the BIA\u2019s approach is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The legal background of this case is complex, but the principle guiding our decision is anything but.  When an administrative agency sets policy, it must provide a reasoned explanation for its action. That is not a high bar, but it is an unwavering one. Here, the BIA has failed to meet it.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from admission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously admitted. Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different procedural settings, with an alien seeking entry (whether for the first time or upon return from a trip abroad) placed in an \u201cexclusion proceeding\u201d and an alien already here channeled to a \u201cdeportation proceeding.\u201d See <em>Landon </em>v. <em>Plasencia, </em>459 U.S. 21, 25-26, 103 S. Ct. 321, 74 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">[565 U.S. 46]</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">(comparing the two). Since that time, the Government has used a unified procedure, known as a \u201cremoval proceeding,\u201d for exclusions and deportations alike. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229, 1229a. But the statutory bases for excluding and deporting aliens have always varied. Now, as before, the immigration laws provide two separate lists of substantive grounds, principally involving criminal offenses, for these two actions. One list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien excludable (or in the term the statute now uses, \u201cinadmissible\u201d), see \u00a7 1182(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), while another\u2014sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent\u2014list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien deportable from the country, see \u00a7 1227(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">An additional, historic difference between exclusion and deportation cases involved the ability of the Attorney General to grant an alien discretionary relief. Until repealed in 1996, \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 187, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994 ed.), authorized the Attorney General to admit certain ex-cludable aliens. See also \u00a7 136(p) (1926 ed.) (predecessor provision to \u00a7 212(c)). The Attorney General could order this relief when the alien had lawfully resided in the United States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country, unless the alien was excludable on one of two specified grounds. See \u00a7 1182(c) (1994 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But by its terms, \u00a7 212(c) did not apply when an alien was being deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">[565 U.S. 47]</p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">This discrepancy threatened to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>duce an odd result in a case called <em>Matter of L-, </em>1 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1 (1940), leading to the first-ever grant of discretionary relief in a deportation case. L- was a permanent resident of the United States who had been convicted of larceny. Although L-\u2019s crime made him inadmissible, he traveled abroad and then returned to the United States without any immigration official\u2019s preventing his entry. A few months later, the Government caught up with L- and initiated a deportation action based on his larceny conviction. Had the Government apprehended L- at the border a short while earlier, he would have been placed in an exclusion proceeding where he could have applied for discretionary relief. But because L- was instead in a deportation proceeding, no such relief was available. Responding to this apparent anomaly, Attorney General Robert Jackson (on referral of the case from the BIA) determined that L-could receive a waiver: L-, Jackson said, \u201cshould be permitted to make the same appeal to discretion that he could have made if denied admission\u201d when returning from his recent trip. <em>Id., </em>at 6. In accord with this decision, the BIA adopted a policy of allowing aliens in deportation proceedings to apply for discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c) whenever they had left and reentered the country after becoming deportable. See <em>Matter of S-, </em>6 I. &amp; N. Dec. 392, 394-396 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">But this approach created another peculiar asymmetry: Deportable aliens who had traveled abroad and returned could receive \u00a7 212(c) relief, while those who had never left could not. In <em>Francis </em>v. <em>INS, </em>532 F.2d 268 (1976), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that this disparity violated equal protection. Id., at 273 (\u201c[A]n alien whose ties with this country are so strong that he has never departed after his initial entry should receive at least as much consideration as an individual who may leave and return from time to time\u201d). The BIA acquiesced in the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, <em>see Matter of Silva, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 26 (1976), thus applying \u00a7 212(c) in deportation proceedings regardless of an alien\u2019s travel history.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">[565 U.S. 48]</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">All this might have become academic when  Congress repealed \u00a7 212(c) in 1996 and substituted a new discretionary remedy, known as \u201ccancellation of removal,\u201d which is available in a narrow range of circumstances to excludable and deportable aliens alike. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. But in <em>INS </em>v. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2001), this Court concluded that the broader relief afforded by \u00a7 212(c) must remain available, on the same terms as before, to an alien whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s repeal. We reasoned that aliens had agreed to those pleas with the possibility of discretionary relief in mind and that eliminating this prospect would ill comport with \u201c \u2018familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 323, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (quoting <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 270, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994)). Accordingly, \u00a7 212(c) has had an afterlife for resident aliens with old criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">When the BIA is deciding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to <em>exclude </em>such an alien, applying \u00a7 212(c) is an easy matter. The Board first checks the statutory ground that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified as the basis for exclusion; the Board may note, for example, that DHS has charged the alien with previously committing a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude,\u201d see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Unless the charged ground is one of the pair falling outside \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s scope, see n. 1, <em>supra, </em>the alien is eligible for discretionary relief. The Board then determines whether to grant that relief based on such factors as \u201cthe seriousness of the offense, evidence of either rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the alien\u2019s residence, the impact of deportation on the family, the number of citizens in the family, and the character of any service in the Armed Forces.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S., at 296, n. 5, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">By contrast, when the BIA is deciding whether to <em>deport </em>an alien, applying \u00a7 212(c) becomes a tricky business. Recall</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">[565 U.S. 49]</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">that \u00a7 212(c) applies on its face only to exclusion decisions. So the question arises: How is the BIA to determine when an alien should receive \u00a7 212(c) relief in the deportation context?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">One approach that the BIA formerly used considered how the alien would fare in an exclusion proceeding. To perform this analysis, the Board would first determine whether the criminal conviction making the alien deportable fell within a statutory ground for exclusion. Almost all convictions did so, largely because the \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude\u201d ground encompasses so many offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Assuming that threshold inquiry were met, the Board would mimic its approach in exclusion cases\u2014first making sure the statutory ground at issue was not excepted from \u00a7 212(c) and then conducting the multi-factor analysis. See <em>Matter of Tanori, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 566, 567-568 (1976); <em>In re Manzueta, </em>No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892 (BIA, Dec. 1, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">A second approach is the one challenged here; definitively adopted in 2005 (after decades of occasional use), it often is called the \u201ccomparable-grounds\u201d rule. See, <em>e.g., De la Rosa </em>v. <em>United States AG, </em>579 F.3d 1327, 1332 (CA11 2009). That approach evaluates whether the ground for deportation charged in a case has a close analogue in the statute\u2019s list of exclusion grounds. See <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 728 (2005); <em>In re Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766, 772-773 (2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the deportation ground consists of a set of crimes \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to the set of offenses making up an exclusion ground, then the alien can seek \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 728. But if the deportation ground</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6jO\">[565 U.S. 50]</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">charged covers significantly different or more or fewer offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is not eligible for a waiver. Such a divergence makes \u00a7 212(c) inapplicable even if the particular offense committed by the alien falls within an exclusion ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Two contrasting examples from the BIA\u2019s cases may help to illustrate this approach. Take first an alien con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>victed of conspiring to distribute cocaine, whom DHS seeks to deport on the ground that he has committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d involving \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Under the comparable-grounds rule, the immigration judge would look to see if that deportation ground covers substantially the same offenses as an exclusion ground. And according to the BIA in <em>Matter of Meza, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 257 (1991), the judge would find an adequate match\u2014the exclusion ground applicable to aliens who have committed offenses \u201crelating to a controlled substance,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Now consider an alien convicted of first-degree sexual abuse of a child, whom DHS wishes to deport on the ground that he has committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d involving \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). May this alien seek \u00a7 212(c) relief? According to the BIA, he may not do so\u2014not because his crime is too serious (that is irrelevant to the analysis), but instead because no statutory ground of exclusion covers substantially the same offenses. To be sure, the alien\u2019s own offense is a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and so fits within an exclusion ground. Indeed, that will be true of most or all offenses included in this deportation category. See <em>supra, </em>at 49, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 458. But on the BIA\u2019s view, the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d exclusion ground \u201caddresses a distinctly different and much broader category of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor charge.\u201d <em>Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 728. And the much greater sweep</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">[565 U.S. 51]</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">of the exclusion ground prevents the alien from seeking discretionary relief from deportation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Those mathematically inclined might think of the comparable-grounds approach as employing Venn diagrams. Within one circle are all the criminal offenses composing the particular ground of deportation charged. Within other circles are the offenses composing the various exclusion grounds. When, but only when, the \u201cdeportation circle\u201d sufficiently corresponds to one of the \u201cexclusion circles\u201d may an alien apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Petitioner Joel Judulang is a native of the Philippines who entered the United States in 1974 at the age of eight. Since that time, he has lived continuously in this country as a lawful permanent resident. In 1988, Judulang took part in a fight in which another person shot and killed someone. Judulang was charged as an accessory and eventually pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. He received a 6-year suspended sentence and was released on probation immediately after his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">In 2005, after Judulang pleaded guilty to another criminal offense (this one involving theft), DHS commenced an action to deport him. DHS charged Judulang with having com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>mitted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d involving \u201ca crime of violence,\u201d based on his old manslaughter conviction. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Immigration Judge</p>\n<p id=\"A_dxc\">[565 U.S. 52]</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">ordered Judulang\u2019s deportation, and the BIA affirmed. As part of its decision, the BIA considered whether Judulang could apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief. It held that he could not do so because the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion ground, including the one for crimes involving moral turpitude. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied Judulang\u2019s petition for review in reliance on circuit precedent upholding the BIA\u2019s comparable-grounds approach. <em>Judulang </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>249 Fed. Appx. 499, 502 (2007) (citing <em>Abebe </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 1092 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">We granted certiorari, 563 U.S. 935, 131 S. Ct. 2093, 179 L.

Agencies, the BIA among them, have expertise and experience in administering their statutes that no court can properly ignore. But courts retain a role, and an important one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking. When reviewing an agency action, we must assess, among other matters, \u201c \u2018whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Farm, </em>463 U.S., at 43, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443 <em>(quoting Bowman Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S. Ct. 438, 42 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1974)). That task involves examining the reasons for agency decisions\u2014or, as the case may be, the absence of such reasons. See <em>FCC </em>v. <em>Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>556 U.S. 502, 515, 129 S. Ct. 1800, 173 L. Ed. 2d 738 (2009) (noting \u201cthe requirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The BIA has flunked that test here. By hinging a deportable alien\u2019s eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories\u2014a matter irrelevant to the alien\u2019s fitness to reside in this country\u2014the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The parties here spend much time disputing whether the BIA must make discretionary relief available to deportable and excludable aliens on identical terms. As this case illustrates, the comparable-grounds approach does not do so. If Judulang were seeking entry to this country, he would be</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">[565 U.S. 54]</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief; voluntary manslaughter is \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude,\u201d and so his conviction falls within an exclusion ground. But Judulang cannot apply for relief from deportation because the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d ground charged in his case does not match any exclusion ground (including the one for \u201cturpitu-dinous\u201d crimes). See <em>infra, </em>at 57, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 463. Judulang argues that this disparity is impermissible because <em>any </em>disparity between excludable and deportable aliens is impermissible: If an alien may seek \u00a7 212(c) relief in an exclusion case, he also must be able to seek such relief in a deportation case. See Brief for Petitioner 47-51.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But the Government notes that the immigration laws have always drawn distinctions between exclusion and deportation. See Brief for Respondent 51. And the Government presses a policy reason for making \u00a7 212(c) relief more readily available in exclusion cases. Doing so, it argues, will provide an incentive for some resident aliens <em>(i.e., </em>those eligible for a waiver from exclusion, but not deportation) to report themselves to immigration officials, by applying for advance permission to exit and reenter the country. In contrast, applying \u00a7 212(c) uniformly might lead all aliens to \u201ctry to</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">[565 U.S. 55]</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">evade immigration officials for as long as possible,\u201d because they could in any event \u201cseek [discretionary] relief if caught.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">In the end, we think this dispute beside the point, and we do not resolve it. The BIA may well have legitimate reasons for limiting \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s scope in deportation cases. But still, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>must do so in some rational way. If the BIA proposed to narrow the class of deportable aliens eligible to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief by flipping a coin\u2014 heads an alien may apply for relief, tails he may not\u2014we would reverse the policy in an instant. That is because  agency action must be based on non-arbitrary, \u201c \u2018relevant factors,\u2019 \u201d <em>State Farm, </em>463 U.S., at 43, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443 (quoting <em>Bowman Transp., </em>419 U.S., at 285, 95 S. Ct. 438, 42 L. Ed. 2d 447), which here means that the BIA\u2019s approach must be tied, even if loosely, to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigration system. A method for disfavoring de-portable aliens that bears no relation to these matters\u2014that neither focuses on nor relates to an alien\u2019s fitness to remain in the country\u2014is arbitrary and capricious. And that is true regardless whether the BIA might have acted to limit the class of deportable aliens eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief on other, more rational bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The problem with the comparable-grounds policy is that it does not impose such a reasonable limitation. Rather than considering factors that might be thought germane to the deportation decision, that policy hinges \u00a7 212(c) eligibility on an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions. Recall that the BIA asks whether the set of offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an exclusion ground. But so what if it does? Does an alien charged with a particular deportation ground become more worthy of relief because that ground happens to match up with another? Or less worthy of relief because the ground does not? The comparison in no way changes the alien\u2019s prior offense or his other attributes and circumstances. So it is difficult to see why that comparison should matter. Each</p>\n<p id=\"AGbrC\">[565 U.S. 56]</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">of these statutory grounds contains a slew of offenses. Whether each contains the same slew has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to seek a waiver.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">This case well illustrates the point. In commencing Judulang\u2019s deportation proceeding, the Government charged him with an \u201caggravated felony\u201d involving a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d based on his prior manslaughter conviction. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a-12a. That made him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d deportation ground does not sufficiently overlap with the most similar exclusion ground, for \u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude.\u201d The problem, according to the BIA, is that the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d ground includes a few offenses\u2014simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use of a vehicle\u2014that the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d ground does not. See <em>Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 772-773; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29, 40-41. But this statutory difference in no way relates to Judulang\u2014or to most other aliens charged with committing a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Perhaps aliens like Judulang should be eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, or perhaps they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>not. But that determination is not sensibly made by establishing that simple assaults and minor burglaries fall outside a ground for exclusion. That fact is as extraneous to the merits of the case as a coin flip would be. It makes Judulang no less deserving of the opportunity to seek discretionary relief\u2014just as its converse (the inclusion of simple assaults and burglaries in the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d exclusion ground) would make him no more so.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">[565 U.S. 57]</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Or consider a different head-scratching oddity of the comparable-grounds approach\u2014that it may deny \u00a7 212(c) eligibility to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely inside an exclusion ground. The BIA\u2019s <em>Blake </em>decision, noted earlier, provides an example. See <em>supra, </em>at 50, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 458-459. The deportation ground charged was \u201caggravated felony\u201d involving \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d; the closest exclusion ground was, once again, a \u201ccrime [of] moral turpitude.\u201d 23 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 727. Here, the BIA\u2019s problem was not that the deportation ground covered too many offenses; all or virtually all the crimes within that ground also are crimes of moral turpitude. Rather, the BIA objected that the deportation ground covered too few crimes\u2014or put oppositely, that \u201cthe moral turpitude ground of exclusion addresses a . . . much broader category of offenses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 728. But <em>providing </em>relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of aliens hardly justifies <em>denying </em>relief in deportation cases to a subset of that group.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (The better argument would surely be the reverse\u2014that giving relief in the one context supports doing so in the other.) Again, we do not say today that the BIA must give all deportable aliens meeting \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s requirements the chance to apply for a waiver. See <em>supra, </em>at 55-56, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 461-462. The point is instead that the BIA cannot make that opportunity turn on the meaningless matching of statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">And underneath this layer of arbitrariness lies yet another, because the outcome of the Board\u2019s comparable-grounds analysis itself may rest on the happenstance of an immigration official\u2019s charging decision. This problem arises because an alien\u2019s prior conviction may fall within a number of deportation grounds, only one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground. Consider, for example, an alien who entered the country in 1984 and committed voluntary</p>\n<p id=\"ATfNq\">[565 U.S. 58]</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">manslaughter in 1988. That person could be charged (as Judulang was) with an \u201caggravated felony\u201d involving a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). If so, the alien could not seek a waiver because of the absence of a comparable exclusion ground. But the alien also could be charged with \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years . . . after the date of admission,\u201d see \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). And if that were the deportation charge, the alien <em>could, </em>apply for relief, because the ground corresponds to the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d ground used in exclusion cases. See <em>In re Salmon, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 734 (1978). So everything hangs on the charge. And the Government has provided no reason to think that immigration officials must adhere to any set scheme in deciding what charges to bring, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>that those officials are exercising their charging discretion with \u00a7 212(c) in mind. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-36. So at base everything hangs on the fortuity of an individual official\u2019s decision. An alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation; an identically situated alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In a foundational deportation case, this Court recognized the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in this country, and reversed an agency decision that would \u201cmake his right to remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious.\u201d <em>Delgadillo </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>332 U.S. 388, 391, 68 S. Ct. 10, 92 L. Ed. 17 (1947). We think the policy before us similarly flawed.  The comparable-grounds approach does not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien (or any group of aliens) should be deported. It instead distinguishes among aliens\u2014decides who should be eligible for discretionary relief and who should not\u2014solely by comparing the metes and bounds of diverse statutory categories into which an alien falls. The resulting Venn diagrams have no connection to the goals of the deportation process or the rational operation of the immigration laws. Judge Learned Hand wrote in</p>\n<p id=\"AzkW6\">[565 U.S. 59]</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">another early immigration case that deportation decisions cannot be made a \u201csport of chance.\u201d See <em>Di Pasquale </em>v. <em>Karnuth, </em>158 F.2d 878, 879 (CA2 1947) (quoted in <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 455, 83 S. Ct. 1804, 10 L. Ed. 2d 1000 (1963)). That is what the comparable-grounds rule brings about, and that is what the APA\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is designed to thwart.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The Government makes three arguments in defense of the comparable-grounds rule\u2014the first based on statutory text, the next on history, the last on cost. We find none of them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The Government initially contends that the comparable-grounds approach is more faithful to \u201cthe statute\u2019s language,\u201d Brief for Respondent 21\u2014or otherwise said, that \u201clifting that limit \u2018would take immigration practice even further from the statutory text,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 22 (quoting <em>Matter of Hernandez-Casillas, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 262, 287 (1990)). In the Government\u2019s view, \u00a7 212(c) is \u201cphrased in terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion\u201d; that phrasing, says the Government, counsels a comparative analysis of grounds when applying \u00a7 212(c) in the deportation context. Brief for Respondent 21; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 34 (\u201c[T]he reason [the comparable-grounds approach] makes sense is because the statute only provides for relief from grounds of . . . exclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The first difficulty with this argument is that it is based on an inaccurate description of the statute.  Section 212(c) instructs that certain resident aliens \u201cmay be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General\u201d notwithstanding any of \u201cthe provisions of subsection (a) . . . (other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994 ed.). Subsection (a) contains the full list of exclusion grounds; paragraphs (3) and (9)(C) (which deal with national security</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">[565 U.S. 60]</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">and international child abduction) are two among these. What \u00a7 212(c) actually says, then, is that the Attorney General may admit any excludable alien, except if the alien is charged with two specified grounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>And that means that once the Attorney General determines that the alien is <em>not </em>being excluded for those two reasons, the ground of exclusion no longer matters. At that point, the alien is eligible for relief, and the thing the Attorney General waives is not a particular exclusion ground, but the simple denial of entry. So the premise of the Government\u2019s argument is wrong. And if the premise, so too the conclusion\u2014that is, because \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s text is <em>not </em>\u201cphrased in terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion,\u201d Brief for Respondent 21, it cannot counsel a search for corresponding grounds of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">More fundamentally,  the comparable-grounds approach would not follow from \u00a7 212(c) even were the Government right about the section\u2019s phrasing. That is because \u00a7 212(c) simply has nothing to do with deportation: The provision was not meant to interact with the statutory grounds for deportation, any more than those grounds were designed to interact with the provision. Rather, \u00a7 212(c) refers solely to exclusion decisions; its extension to deportation cases arose from the agency\u2019s extra-textual view that some similar relief should be available in that context to avoid unreasonable distinctions. Cf., <em>e.g., Matter of L-, </em>1 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 5; see also <em>supra, </em>at 47, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 457.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the text of \u00a7 212(c), whether or</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">[565 U.S. 61]</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">not phrased in terms of \u201cwaiving grounds of exclusion,\u201d cannot support the BIA\u2019s use of the comparable-grounds rule\u2014or, for that matter, any other method for extending discretionary relief to deportation cases. We well understand the difficulties of operating in such a text-free zone; indeed, we appreciate the Government\u2019s yearning for a textual anchor. But \u00a7 212(c), no matter how many times read or parsed, does not provide one.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">In disputing Judulang\u2019s contentions, the Government also emphasizes the comparable-grounds rule\u2019s vintage. See Brief for Respondent 22-23, 30-43. As an initial matter, we think this a slender reed to support a significant government policy.  Arbitrary agency action becomes no less so by simple dint of repetition. (To use a prior analogy, flipping coins to determine \u00a7 212(c) eligibility would remain as arbitrary on the thousandth try as on the first.) And longstanding capriciousness receives no special exemption from the APA. In any event, we cannot detect the consistency that the BIA claims has marked its approach to this issue. To the contrary, the BIA has repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying \u00a7 212(c) to deportable aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Prior to 1984, the BIA endorsed a variety of approaches. In <em>Matter of T-, </em>5 I. &amp; N. Dec. 389, 390 (1953), for example, the BIA held that an alien was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because her \u201cground of deportation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>did not appear in the exclusion statute. That decision anticipated the comparable-grounds approach that the BIA today uses. But in <em>Tanori, </em>the BIA pronounced that a deportable alien could apply for a waiver because \u201cthe same facts\u201d\u2014in that case, a marijuana conviction\u2014would have allowed him to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief in an exclusion proceeding. 15 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 568. That approach is more nearly similar to the one Judulang urges here. And then, in <em>Matter of Granados, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 726, 728 (1979), the BIA tried to have it both ways: It denied \u00a7 212(c) eligibility <em>both </em>because the deportation ground charged did not correspond to, <em>and </em>because the alien\u2019s prior</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">[565 U.S. 62]</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">conviction did not fall within, a waivable ground of exclusion. In short, the BIA\u2019s cases were all over the map.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The Government insists that the BIA imposed order in <em>Matter of Wadud, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 182, 185-186 (1984), when it held that a deportable alien could not seek \u00a7 212(c) relief unless the deportation ground charged had an \u201canalogous ground of inadmissibility.\u201d See Brief for Respondent 40-41. But the BIA\u2019s settlement, if any, was fleeting. Just seven years later, the BIA adopted a new policy entirely, extending \u00a7 212(c) eligibility to \u201caliens deportable under any ground of de-portability except those where there is a comparable ground of exclusion which has been specifically excepted from section 212(c).\u201d <em>Hernandez-Casillas, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 266. That new rule turned the comparable-grounds approach inside-out, allowing aliens to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief in deportation cases except when the ground charged corresponded to an exclusion ground that could <em>not </em>be waived. To be sure, the Attorney General (on referral of the case from the BIA), disavowed this position in favor of the more standard version of the comparable-grounds rule. <em>Id., </em>at 287. But even while doing so, the Attorney General stated that \u201can alien subject to deportation must have the same opportunity to seek discretionary relief as an alien . . . subject to exclusion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That assertion is exactly the one Judulang makes in this case; it is consonant not with the comparable-grounds rule the BIA here defends, but instead with an inquiry into whether an alien\u2019s prior conviction falls within an exclusion ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Given these mixed signals, it is perhaps not surprising that the BIA continued to alternate between approaches in the years that followed. Immediately after the Attorney General\u2019s opinion in <em>Hernandez-Casillas, </em>the BIA endorsed the comparable-grounds approach on several occasions. See <em>Meza, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 259; <em>Matter of Montenegro, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 603, 604-605 (1992); <em>Matter of Gabryelsky, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 750, 753-754 (1993); <em>In re Esposito, </em>21 I. &amp; N.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">[565 U.S. 63]</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Dec. 1, 6-7 (1995); <em>In re Jimenez-Santillano, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 567, 571-572 (1996). But just a few years later, the BIA issued a series of unpublished opinions that asked only whether a deportable alien\u2019s prior conviction fell within an exclusion ground. See, e.g., <em>In re Manzueta, </em>No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892 (Dec. 1, 2003). Not until the BIA\u2019s decisions in <em>Blake </em>and <em>Brieva-Perez </em>did the pendulum stop swinging. That history hardly supports the Government\u2019s view of a consistent agency practice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"AC27\">The Government finally argues that the comparable-grounds rule saves time and money. The Government claims that comparing deportation grounds to exclusion grounds can be accomplished in just a few \u201cprec-edential decision [s],\u201d which then can govern broad swaths of cases. See Brief for Respondent 46. By contrast, the Government argues, Judulang\u2019s approach would force it to determine whether each and every crime of conviction falls within an exclusion ground. Further, the Government contends that Judulang\u2019s approach would grant eligibility to a greater number of deportable aliens, which in turn would force the Government to make additional individualized assessments of whether to actually grant relief. <em>Id., </em>at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Once again, the Government\u2019s rationale comes up short.  Cost is an important factor for agencies to consider in many</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">[565 U.S. 64]</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">contexts. But cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary agency policy. (If it could, flipping coins would be a valid way to determine an alien\u2019s eligibility for a waiver.) And in any event, we suspect the Government exaggerates the cost savings associated with the comparable-grounds rule. Judulang\u2019s proposed approach asks immigration officials only to do what they have done for years in exclusion cases; that means, for one thing, that officials can make use of substantial existing precedent governing whether a crime falls within a ground of exclusion. And Judulang\u2019s proposal may not be the only alternative to the comparable-grounds rule. See <em>supra, </em>at 55-56, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 461-462. In rejecting that rule, we do not preclude the BIA from trying to devise another, equally economical policy respecting eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, so long as it comports with everything held in both this decision and <em>St. Cyr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We must reverse an agency policy when we cannot discern a reason for it. That is the trouble in this case. The BIA\u2019s comparable-grounds rule is unmoored from the purposes and concerns of the immigration laws. It allows an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions to govern a matter of the utmost importance\u2014whether lawful resident aliens with longstanding ties to this country may stay here. And contrary to the Government\u2019s protestations, it is not supported by text or practice or cost considerations. The BIA\u2019s approach therefore cannot pass muster under ordinary principles of administrative law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is hereby reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-17\">.

Careful readers may note that the example involving controlled substances offered in the last paragraph also involves an exclusion ground that sweeps more broadly than the deportation ground charged. The deportation ground requires \u201ctrafficking\u201d in a controlled substance, whereas the exclusion ground includes all possession offenses as well. The BIA nonetheless held in <em>Meza </em>that the degree of overlap between the two grounds was sufficient to make the alien eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. That holding reveals the broad discretion that the BIA currently exercises in deciding when two statutory grounds are comparable <em>enough.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-13\">.

Ed. 2d 694 (1984), to govern judicial review of an agency\u2019s statutory interpretations. See Brief for Respondent 19. Were we to do so, our analysis would be the same, because under <em>Chevron </em>step two, we ask whether an agency interpretation is \u201c \u2018arbitrary or capricious in substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayo Found. for Med.

Dec. 766 (2005), is not an interpretation of any statutory language\u2014nor could it be, given that \u00a7 212(c) does not mention deportation cases, see <em>infra, </em>at 60-61, 181 L.

Judulang also argues that the BIA is making an impermissible distinction between two groups of deportable aliens\u2014those who have recently left and returned to the country and those who have not.

See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16-18. That is the kind of distinction the Second Circuit held in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>INS, </em>532 F.2d 268 (1976), violated equal protection. See <em>supra, </em>at 47, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 457. But the Government contends that it is drawing no such line\u2014that it is applying the comparable-grounds policy to all deportable aliens.

The case would be different if Congress had intended for \u00a7 212(c) relief to depend on the interaction of exclusion grounds and deportation grounds.

See <em>Blake, </em>489 F.3d, at 102 (Congress never contemplated, in drafting the immigration laws, \u201cthat its grounds of deportation would have any connection with the grounds of exclusion\u2019\u2019 in the application of \u00a7 212(c)); see also <em>infra, </em>at 60-61, 181 L.

That amendment prohibited the Attorney General from granting discretionary relief to aliens deportable on several specified grounds. See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1277 (effective Apr. 24, 1996). The change does not affect our analysis, nor does the Government argue it should. As the Government notes, the amendment \u201cdid not speak to the viability of the Board\u2019s\u2019\u2019 comparable-grounds rule, but instead made categorically ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief \u201cthose deportable by reason of certain crimes.\u2019\u2019 Brief for Respondent 20. Presumably, Congress thought those crimes particularly incompatible with an alien\u2019s continued residence in this country.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b566-11\">. Because we find the BIA\u2019s prior practice so unsettled, we likewise reject Judulang\u2019s argument that <em>Blake </em>and <em>Brieva-Perez </em>were impermissibly retroactive. To succeed on that theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Judulang would have to show, at a minimum, that in entering his guilty plea, he had reasonably relied on a legal rule from which <em>Blake </em>and <em>Brieva-Perez </em>departed. See <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 270, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994) (stating that retroactivity analysis focuses on \u201cconsiderations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations\u2019\u2019). The instability of the BIA\u2019s prior practice prevents Judulang from making this showing: The BIA sometimes recognized aliens in Judulang\u2019s position as eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, but sometimes did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
