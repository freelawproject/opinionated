The first,  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), provides that a habeas petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal a federal district court\u2019s final order in a habeas proceeding. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). The COA may issue only if the petitioner has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2), and \u201cshall indicate which specific issue\u201d satisfies that showing, \u00a7 2253(c)(3). We hold that \u00a7 2253(c)(3) is not a jurisdictional requirement. Accordingly, a judge\u2019s failure to \u201cindicate\u201d the requisite constitutional issue in a COA does not deprive a court of appeals of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the habeas petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The second provision,  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), establishes a 1-year limitations period for state prisoners to file federal habeas petitions, running from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d We hold that, for a state prisoner who does not seek review in a State\u2019s highest court, the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d on the date that the time for seeking such review expires.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">[565 U.S. 138]</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">Petitioner Rafael Gonzalez was convicted of murder in Texas state court. The intermediate state appellate court, the Texas Court of Appeals, affirmed Gonzalez\u2019s conviction on July 12, 2006. Gonzalez then allowed his time for seeking discretionary review with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (Texas CCA)\u2014the State\u2019s highest court for criminal appeals\u2014to expire on August 11, 2006. Tex. Rule App. Proc. 68.2(a) (2011). The Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate on September 26, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-18\">After Gonzalez, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>petitioned unsuccessfully for state ha-beas relief, he filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 on January 24, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. His petition alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the nearly 10-year delay between his indictment and trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The District Court, without discussing Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional claims, dismissed Gonzalez\u2019s petition as time barred by the 1-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Although Gonzalez argued that his judgment had not become final until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate, the District Court held that Gonzalez\u2019s judgment had become final when his time for seeking discretionary review in the Texas CCA expired on August 11, 2006. Counting from that date, and tolling the limitations period for the time during which Gonzalez\u2019s state habeas petition was pending, Gonzalez\u2019s limitations period elapsed on December 17, 2007\u2014 over a month before he filed his federal habeas petition. The District Court denied a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Gonzalez applied to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for a COA on two grounds: (1) his habeas petition was timely, and (2) his Sixth Amendment speedy-trial right was violated. A Court of Appeals Judge granted a COA on the question \u201cwhether the habeas application was timely filed because Gonzalez\u2019s conviction became final, and thus the limitation [s] period commenced, on the date the intermediate</p>\n<p id=\"A8Em\">[565 U.S. 139]</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">state appellate court issued its mandate.\u201d App. 347. The COA did not mention the Sixth Amendment question.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. 623 F.3d 222 (2010). Acknowledging that a sister Circuit had run the limitations period from the date of a state court\u2019s issuance of a mandate, the Court of Appeals deemed the mandate\u2019s issuance \u201cirrelevant\u201d to determining finality under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). <em>Id., </em>at 224, 226 (disagreeing with <em>Riddle </em>v. <em>Kemna, </em>523 F.3d 850 (CA8 2008) (en banc)). The Court of Appeals held that because a judgment becomes final at \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review,\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), the limitations period begins to run for petitioners who fail to appeal to a State\u2019s highest court when the time for seeking further direct review in the state court expires. The Court of Appeals therefore concluded that Gonzalez\u2019s conviction became final on August 11, 2006, and his habeas petition was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The Court of Appeals did not address Gonzalez\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim or discuss whether the COA had been improperly issued. Nor did the State allege any defect in the COA or move to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Gonzalez petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. In its brief in opposition, the State argued for the first time that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal because the COA identified only a procedural issue, without also \u201cindicat[ing]\u201d a constitutional issue as required by \u00a7 2253(c)(3). We granted certiorari to decide two questions, both of which implicate splits in authority: (1) whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal, notwithstanding the \u00a7 2253(c)(3) defect;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) whether Gonzalez\u2019s habeas petition was time</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">[565 U.S. 140]</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1) due to the date on which his judgment became final.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 564 U.S. 1003, 131 S. Ct. 2989, 180 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">We first consider whether the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of Appeals had jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Section 2253, as amended by AE-DPA, governs appeals in habeas corpus proceedings. The first subsection,  \u00a7 2253(a), is a general grant of jurisdiction, providing that district courts\u2019 final orders in habeas proceedings \u201cshall be subject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). The second, \u00a7 2253(b), limits jurisdiction over a particular type of final order. See \u00a7 2253(b)  \u201cThere shall be no right of appeal from a final order in a proceeding to test the validity of a warrant [of] remov[al] . . .\u201d). This case concerns the third, \u00a7 2253(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201c(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeal-ability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAO_8\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"43\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAfMAAAAqAQAAAACPMo+1AAAAe0lEQVR4nO2UMQ5AQBBFZ1WO5QhuxFGUbsEh9DgBpUTs12B+EIWtNplfvUzmze/GQUIyJkG6iPnmmx+9P9NoIG6JS0V/9zvaq4lzRVTK63Ur+ezh5+aJl3v/7xx+9t7vnpsiIpIqAgAwQdMTN8SF4nbC4Ox/m2+++ZH6OweFT7Uw4ljgAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"499\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201c(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u201c(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">When, as here, the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the petitioner seeking a COA must show both \u201cthat</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">[565 U.S. 141]</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">In this case, the Court of Appeals Judge granted a COA that identified a debatable procedural ruling, but did not \u201cindicate\u201d the issue on which Gonzalez had made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as required by \u00a7 2253(c)(3). The question before us is whether that defect deprived the Court of Appeals of the power to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">This Court has endeavored in recent years to \u201cbring some discipline\u201d to the use of the term \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Shinseki, </em>562 U.S. 428, 435, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159 (2011). Recognizing our \u201cless than meticulous\u201d use of the term in the past, we have pressed a stricter distinction between truly jurisdictional rules, which govern \u201ca court\u2019s adjudicatory authority,\u201d and nonjurisdictional \u201cclaim processing rules,\u201d which do not. <em>Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 454-455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004).  When a requirement goes to subject-matter jurisdiction, courts are obligated to consider <em>sua sponte </em>issues that the parties have disclaimed or have not presented. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S. Ct. 1781, 152 L. Ed. 2d 860 (2002). Subject-matter jurisdiction can never be waived or forfeited. The objections may be resurrected at any point in the litigation, and a valid objection may lead a court midway through briefing to dismiss a complaint in its entirety. \u201c[M]any months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of work on the part of the attorneys and the court may be wasted.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>562 U.S., at 435, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159. Courts, we have said, should not lightly attach those \u201cdrastic\u201d consequences to limits Congress has enacted. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">We accordingly have applied the following principle:  A rule is jurisdictional \u201c[i]f the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">[565 U.S. 142]</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">(2006). But if \u201cCongress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as non-jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That dear-statement principle makes particular sense in this statute, as we consider\u2014 against the backdrop of \u00a7 2253(a)\u2019s clear jurisdictional grant to the courts of appeals and \u00a7 2253(b)\u2019s clear limit on that grant\u2014the extent to which Congress intended the COA process outlined in \u00a7 2253(c) to further limit the courts of appeals\u2019jurisdiction over habeas appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Here,  the only \u201cclear\u201d jurisdictional language in \u00a7 2253(c) appears in \u00a7 2253(c)(1). As we explained in <em>Miller-El </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931 (2003), \u00a7 2253(c)(1)\u2019s plain terms\u2014 \u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals\u201d\u2014establish that \u201cuntil a COA has been issued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 336, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931. The parties thus agree that \u00a7 2253(c)(1) is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">[565 U.S. 143]</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The parties also agree that  \u00a7 2253(c)(2) is nonjurisdictional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That is for good reason. Section 2253(c)(2) speaks only to <em>when </em>a COA may issue\u2014upon \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d It does not contain \u00a7 2253(c)(l)\u2019s jurisdictional terms. See <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) (  \u201c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally . . .\u201d). And it would be passing strange if, after a COA has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>issued, each court of appeals adjudicating an appeal were dutybound to revisit the threshold showing and gauge its \u201csubstantial [ity]\u201d to verify its jurisdiction. That inquiry would be largely duplicative of the merits question before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">It follows that  \u00a7 2253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well. Like \u00a7 2253(c)(2), it too reflects a threshold condition for the issuance of a COA\u2014 the COA\u2019s indication of \u201cwhich specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\u201d It too \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [appeals] courts.\u201d <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (internal quotation marks omitted). The unambiguous jurisdictional terms of \u00a7\u00a7 2253(a), (b), and (c)(1) show that Congress would have spoken in clearer terms if it intended \u00a7 2253(c)(3) to have similar jurisdictional force. Instead, the contrast underscores that the failure to obtain a COA is jurisdictional, while a COA\u2019s failure to indicate an issue is not. A defective COA is not equivalent to the lack of any COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">It is telling, moreover, that Congress placed the power to issue COAs in the hands of a \u201ccircuit justice or judge.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">[565 U.S. 144]</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">would seem somewhat counterintuitive to render a panel of court of appeals judges powerless to act on appeals based on COAs that Congress specifically empowered one court of appeals judge to grant. Indeed,  whereas \u00a7 2253(c)(2)\u2019s substantial-showing requirement at least describes a burden that \u201cthe applicant\u201d seeking a COA bears, \u00a7 2253(c)(3)\u2019s indication requirement binds only the judge issuing the COA. Notably, Gonzalez advanced both the timeliness and Sixth Amendment issues in his application for a COA. A petitioner, having successfully obtained a COA, has no control over how the judge drafts the COA and, as in Gonzalez\u2019s case, may have done everything required of him by law. That fact would only compound the \u201cun-fai[r] prejudice\u201d resulting from the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals and remands that jurisdictional treatment would entail. <em>Henderson, </em>562 U.S., at 434, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Treating \u00a7 2253(c)(3) as jurisdictional also would thwart Congress\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>intent in AEDPA \u201cto eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process.\u201d <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">[565 U.S. 145]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">631, 648, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (2010). The COA process screens out issues unworthy of judicial time and attention and ensures that frivolous claims are not assigned to merits panels. Once a judge has made the determination that a COA is warranted and resources are deployed in briefing and argument, however, the COA has fulfilled that gatekeeping function. Even if additional screening of already-issued COAs for \u00a7 2253(c)(3) defects could further winnow the cases before the courts of appeals, that would not outweigh the costs of further delay from the extra layer of review. This case, in which the alleged defect would be dispositive, exemplifies those inefficiencies; the State requests that we vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the appeal based on a \u00a7 2253(c)(3) defect that it raised for the first time in response to a petition for certiorari. And delay would be particularly fruitless in the numerous cases where, as here, the district court dismissed the petition on procedural grounds and the court of appeals affirms, without having to address the omitted constitutional issue at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The State, aided by the United States as <em>amicus curiae, </em>makes several arguments in support of jurisdictional treatment of \u00a7 2253(c)(3). None is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">First, the State notes that although \u00a7 2253(c)(3) does not speak in jurisdictional terms, it refers back to \u00a7 2253(c)(1), which does. The State argues that it is as if \u00a7 2253(c)(1) provided: \u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeal-ability <em>that shall indicate the specific issue or issues that satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2), </em>an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals.\u201d The problem is that the statute provides no such thing. Instead, Congress set off the requirements in distinct paragraphs and, rather than mirroring their terms, excluded the jurisdictional terms in one from the other. Notably, the State concedes that \u00a7 2253(c)(2) is nonjuris-dictional, even though it too cross-references \u00a7 2253(c)(1) and is cross-referenced by \u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">[565 U.S. 146]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">Second, the State seizes on the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 2253(c)(3), arguing that an omitted indication renders the COA no COA at all. But  calling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not mandatory or that a timely objection can be ignored. If a party timely raises the COA\u2019s failure to indicate a constitutional issue, the court of appeals panel must address the defect by considering an amendment to the COA or remanding to the district judge for specification of the issues.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This Court, moreover, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>long \u201crejected the notion that \u2018all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henderson, </em>562 U.S., at 439, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159; see also <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>560 U.S. 605, 620, 130 S. Ct. 2533, 177 L. Ed. 2d 108 (2010) (statute\u2019s reference to \u201c \u2018shall\u2019 \u201d alone does not render statutory deadline jurisdictional). Nothing in \u00a7 2253(c)(3)\u2019s prescription establishes that an omitted indication should remain an open issue throughout the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Third, the United States argues that the placement of \u00a7 2253(c)(3) in a section containing jurisdictional provisions signals that it too is jurisdictional.  In characterizing certain requirements as nonjurisdictional, we have on occasion observed their \u201c \u2018separation]\u2019 \u201d from jurisdictional provisions. <em>E.g., Reed Elsevier, Inc. </em>v. <em>Muchnick, </em>559 U.S. 154, 162, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2010)); <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. The converse, however,</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">[565 U.S. 147]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">is not necessarily true: Mere proximity will not turn a rule that speaks in nonjurisdictional terms into a jurisdictional hurdle. In fact, \u00a7 2253(c)(3)\u2019s proximity to \u00a7\u00a7 2253(a), (b), and (c)(1) highlights the absence of clear jurisdictional terms in \u00a7 2253(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Finally, the State analogizes a COA to a notice of appeal, pointing out that both a notice and its contents are jurisdictional prerequisites.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1) provides that a notice of appeal must: \u201c(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal\u201d; \u201c(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\u201d; and \u201c(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.\u201d We have held that \u201cRule 3\u2019s dictates are jurisdictional in nature.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S. Ct. 678, 116 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">We reject this analogy. We construed the content requirements for notices of appeal as jurisdictional because we were \u201cconvinced that the harshness of our construction [wa]s \u2018imposed by the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 318, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1988).  Rule 4, we noted, establishes mandatory time limits for filing a notice of appeal. Excusing a failure to name a party in a notice of appeal, in violation of Rule 3, would be \u201cequivalent to permitting courts to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal,\u201d in violation of Rule 4. <em>Id., </em>at 315, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285. And \u201ctime limits for filing a notice of appeal have been treated as jurisdictional in American law for well over a century.\u201d <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 209, n. 2, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007). Accordingly, the Advisory Committee Note \u201cmakes no distinction among the various requirements of Rule 3 and Rule 4,\u201d treating them \u201cas a single jurisdictional threshold.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>487 U.S., at 315, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285; see also <em>id., </em>at 316, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285 (\u201c[T]he Advisory Committee viewed the requirements of Rule 3 as jurisdictional in nature\u201d). Here, we find no similar basis for treating the paragraphs of \u00a7 2253(c) as a single jurisdictional threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Moreover, in explaining why the naming requirement was jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tional in <em>Torres, </em>we reasoned that an unnamed party</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">[565 U.S. 148]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">leaves the notice\u2019s \u201cintended recipient[s]\u201d\u2014the appellee and court\u2014\u201cunable to determine with certitude whether [that party] should be bound by an adverse judgment or held liable for costs or sanctions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 318, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285. The party could sit on the fence, await the outcome, and opt to participate only if it was favorable. That possibility of gamesmanship is not present here. Unlike the party who fails to submit a compliant notice of appeal, the habeas petitioner who obtains a COA cannot control how that COA is drafted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And whereas a party\u2019s failure to be named in a notice of appeal gives absolutely no \u201cnotice of [his or her] appeal,\u201d a judge\u2019s issuance of a COA reflects his or her judgment that the appeal should proceed and supplies the State with notice that the habeas litigation will continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Because we conclude that \u00a7 2253(c)(3) is a nonjurisdictional rule, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">We next consider whether Gonzalez\u2019s habeas petition was time barred. AEDPA establishes a 1-year limitations period for state prisoners to file for federal habeas relief, which \u201crun[s] from the latest of\u2019; four specified dates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">[565 U.S. 149]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">This case concerns the first of those dates: \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The question before us is when the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d if a petitioner does not appeal to a State\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">In construing the language of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), we do not write on a blank slate. In <em>Clay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88 (2003), we addressed  AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations for federal prisoners seeking postconviction relief. See \u00a7 2255(f)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (beginning 1-year period of limitations from \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final\u201d). We held that the federal judgment becomes final \u201cwhen this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari,\u201d or, if a petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>does not seek certiorari, \u201cwhen the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 527, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88. In so holding, we rejected the argument that, if a petitioner declines to seek certiorari, the limitations period \u201cstarts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its mandate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 529, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>555 U.S. 113, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2009), we described <em>Clay\u2019s </em>interpretation as comporting \u201cwith the most natural reading of the statutory text\u201d and saw \u201cno reason to depart\u201d from it in \u201cconstruing the similar language of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\u201d 555 U.S., at 119, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475. The state court had permitted Jimenez to file an out-of-time direct appeal. We held that this \u201creset\u201d the limitations period; Jimenez\u2019s judgment would now become final at \u201cthe conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">[565 U.S. 150]</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">of that [out-of-time] appeal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 120-121, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475. Because Jimenez did not seek certiorari, we made no mention of when the out-of-time appeal \u201ccon-clu[ded].\u201d Rather, we held that his judgment became final when his \u201ctime for seeking certiorari review in this Court expired.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 120, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475. Nor did we mention the date on which the state court issued its mandate. Both <em>Clay </em>and <em>Jimenez </em>thus suggested that  the direct review process either \u201cconcludes\u201d or \u201cexpires,\u201d depending on whether the petitioner pursues or forgoes direct appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We now make clear what we suggested in those cases:  The text of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), which marks finality as of \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review,\u201d consists of two prongs. Each prong\u2014the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d and the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d\u2014 relates to a distinct category of petitioners. For petitioners who pursue direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment becomes final at the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d\u2014 when this Court affirms a conviction</p>\n<p id=\"AskZq\">[565 U.S. 151]</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">on the merits or denies a petition for certiorari. For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d\u2014when the time for pursuing direct review in this Court, or in state court, expires. We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that because Gonzalez did not appeal to the State\u2019s highest court, his judgment became final when his time for seeking review with the State\u2019s highest court expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Gonzalez offers an alternative reading of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A): Courts should determine both the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d and the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d for every petitioner who does not seek cer-tiorari, then start the 1-year clock from the \u201clatest of\u2019 the two dates. Gonzalez rejects our uniform definition of the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d as the date on which this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a petition for certiorari. In his view, whenever a petitioner does not seek certiorari, the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d is the date on which state law marks finality\u2014in Texas, the date on which the mandate issues. <em>Ex parte Johnson, </em>12 S.W.3d 472, 473 (Crim. App. 2000) <em>(per curiam). </em>Applying this approach, Gonzalez contends that his habeas petition was timely because his direct review \u201cconcluded\u201d when the mandate issued (on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>September 26, 2006), later than the date on which his time for seeking Texas CCA review \u201cexpired\u201d (August 11, 2006). We find his construction of the statute unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">First, Gonzalez lacks a textual anchor for his later-in-time approach.  The words \u201clatest of\u2019 do not appear anywhere in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Rather, they appear in \u00a7 2244(d)(1) and refer to the \u201clatest of\u2019 the dates in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D)\u2014 the latter three of which are inapplicable here. Nothing in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) contemplates any conflict between the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d and the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such review,\u201d much less instructs that the later of the two shall prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Nor is Gonzalez\u2019s later-in-time reading necessary to give both prongs of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) full effect. Our reading does so by applying one \u201cor\u201d the other, depending on whether the direct review process concludes or expires. Treating the judgment as final on one date \u201cor\u201d the other is consistent with the disjunctive language of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Second, Gonzalez misreads our precedents. Gonzalez asserts that in <em>Jimenez, </em>we made a later-in-time choice between the two prongs. That is mistaken. Rather, we chose between two \u201cexpiration\u201d dates corresponding to different appeals: Jimenez initially failed to appeal to the Texas Court of Appeals and that appeal became final when his \u201ctime for seeking discretionary review . . . expired.\u201d 555 U.S., at 117, 119, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475. When Jimenez was later allowed to file an out-of-time appeal, he pursued appeals with both the Texas Court of Appeals and Texas CCA; the out-of-time appeal thus became</p>\n<p id=\"AkvW\">[565 U.S. 152]</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">final when his \u201c[t]ime for seeking certiorari review . . . with this Court expired.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 116, 120, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475. We adopted the out-of-time appeal\u2019s date of finality over the initial appeal\u2019s date of finality. <em>Id., </em>at 119-121, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475. Critically, by deeming the initial appeal final at the expiration of time for seeking review in state court, and the out-of-time appeal final at the expiration of time for seeking certio-rari in this Court, we reinforced Clay\u2018s suggestion that  the \u201cexpiration\u201d prong governs all petitioners who do not pursue direct review all the way to this Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Third, Gonzalez argues that AED-PA\u2019s federalism concerns and respect for state-law procedures mean that we should not read \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) to disregard state law. We agree. That is why a state court\u2019s reopening of direct review will reset the limitations period. 555 U.S., at 121, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475. That is also why, just as we determine the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking [direct] review\u201d from this Court\u2019s filing deadlines when petitioners forgo certiorari, we look to state-court filing deadlines when petitioners forgo state court appeals. Referring to state-law procedures in that context makes sense because such deadlines are inherently court specific. There is no risk of relying on \u201cstate-law rules that may differ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>from the general federal rule.\u201d <em>Clay, </em>537 U.S., at 531, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">By contrast, Gonzalez urges us to scour each State\u2019s laws and cases to determine how it defines finality for every petitioner who forgoes a state-court appeal. That approach would usher in state-by-state definitions of the conclusion of direct review. It would be at odds with the uniform definition we adopted in <em>Clay </em>and accepted in the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) context in <em>Jimenez. </em>And it would pose serious administrability</p>\n<p id=\"A30IZ\">[565 U.S. 153]</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">concerns. Even if roughly \u201chalf of the States define the conclusion of direct review as the issuance of the mandate or similar process,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 40, that still leaves half with either different rules or no settled rules at all.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Fourth, Gonzalez speculates that our reading will rob some habeas petitioners of the full 1-year limitations period. Gonzalez asserts that our reading starts the clock running from the date that his time for seeking Texas CCA review expired, even though, under Texas law, he could not file for state habeas relief until six weeks later, on the date the Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07, \u00a7 3(a) (Vernon Supp. 2011). His inability to initiate state habeas proceedings during those six weeks, he argues, reduced his 1-year federal ha-beas filing period by six weeks. We expect, however, that it will be a rare situation where a petitioner confronting similar state laws faces a delay in the mandate\u2019s issuance so excessive that it prevents him or her from filing a federal habeas petition within a year.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A petitioner who has exhausted his or her claims in state court need not await state habeas proceedings to seek federal habeas relief on those claims. To the extent a petitioner has had his or her federal filing period severely truncated by a delay in the mandate\u2019s issuance and has unexhausted claims that must be raised on state habeas review,</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">[565 U.S. 154]</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">such a petitioner could file a request for a stay and abeyance from the federal district court. See <em>Rhines </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>544 U.S. 269, 277, 125 S. Ct. 1528, 161 L. Ed. 2d 440 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Finally, Gonzalez argues, as an alternative to his later-in-time construction, that his petition should be considered timely because it was filed within a year of when his time for seeking this Court\u2019s review\u2014as opposed to the Texas CCA\u2019s review\u2014 expired.  We can review, however, only judgments of a \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d or of a lower state court if the \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d has denied discretionary review. This Court\u2019s Rule 13.1; see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a) (2006 ed.). Because Gonzalez did not appeal to the Texas CCA, this Court would have lacked jurisdiction over a petition for certiorari from the Texas Court of Appeals\u2019 decision affirming Gonzalez\u2019s conviction. We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>decline to incorporate the 90-day period for seeking certiorari in determining when Gonzalez\u2019s judgment became final.</p>\n<p id=\"pAbb0\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"33\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAScAAAAhAQAAAACzD1BFAAAAn0lEQVR4nO2UMQoCQQxF/wxiq429egKv4Kk8ht5IvI5YbLeDrPMsBkxgA26xlZjuJf8nGRiS0PcgTxBJf9UvqYpPBdBUD18IYPa9nouLZSLIktSvnS8EgHJa8YkAapak5fVg9hAAuOFiDK2X9v5BEQCw8fYxtF6v3dbcEWRJGo6dFUIA6PqzzQigJiTVe7EpAbQ7kQe3SgRz/ok06X69AQNGt1uNZvWqAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"295\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In sum, we hold that \u00a7 2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule. Here, the COA\u2019s failure to \u201cindicate\u201d a constitutional issue did not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal. We further hold that, with respect to a state prisoner who does not seek review in a State\u2019s highest court, the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) when the time for seeking such review expires\u2014here, August 11, 2006. We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that Gonzalez\u2019s federal habeas petition was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-14\">. The Circuits have divided over whether a defect in a COA is a jurisdictional bar.

We have also held that  \u201ccontext, including this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.\u2019\u2019 <em>Reed Elsevier, Inc. </em>v. <em>Muchnick, </em>559 U.S. 154, 168, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2010). Here, however, even though the requirement of a COA (or its predecessor, the certificate of probable cause (CPC)) dates back to 1908, Congress did not enact the indication requirement until 1996. There is thus no \u201clong line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by Congress\u2019\u2019 on which to rely. <em>Union Pacific R. Co. </em>v. <em>Locomotive Engineers, </em>558 U.S. 67, 82, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">The issuance of a CPC, like the issuance of a COA, was jurisdictional. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, <em>post, </em>at 161-163, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 643-644 (opinion of Scalia, J.), that fact does not suggest that the indication requirement is jurisdictional as well. If anything, the inference runs the other way. For nearly a century, a judge\u2019s granting or withholding of a CPC, absent any indication of issues, was the fully effective \u201cexpression of opinion,\u2019\u2019 <em>post, </em>at 161, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 643, required for an appeal to proceed. AEDPA\u2019s new requirement that judges indicate the specific issues to be raised on appeal has no predecessor provision\u2014indeed, it is the primary difference between a CPC and COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\">.

None of our cases addressing those provisions, moreover, recognized or relied on the sweeping \u201crule\u2019\u2019 that the dissent now invokes, whereby this Court should enforce as jurisdictional all \u201cprocedural conditions for appealing a case from one Article III court to another.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ibid.; </em>but see, <em>e.g., post, </em>at 160, n. 2, 181 L.

In its entirety, the section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-18\">\u201c(a) In a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding under section 2255 before a district judge, the final order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-19\">\u201c(b) There shall be no right of appeal from a final order in a proceeding to test the validity of a warrant to remove to another district or place for commitment or trial a person charged with a criminal offense against the United States, or to test the validity of such person\u2019s detention pending removal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-20\">[565 U.S. 156]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-21\">\u201c(c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeal-ability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-22\">\u201c(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>tention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">\u201c(B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">\u201c(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201c(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante, </em>at 142, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 631, all three subsections\u2014(a), (b), and (c)\u2014clearly speak to the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals. Subsection (a) gives appellate jurisdiction to \u201cthe court of appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held\u201d; subsection (b) carves out certain classes of cases from that appellate jurisdiction; and subsection (c) imposes a procedural hurdle to the exercise of that appellate jurisdiction\u2014a judge\u2019s issuance of a certificate of appealability, see <em>Miller-El </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Paragraph 2253(c)(3) says that a certificate of appealability (or COA) must \u201cindicate\u201d which issue or issues in the case involve a substantial showing of a constitutional violation. Everyone agrees that the certificate issued below contains no such indication. See <em>ante, </em>at 141, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 630. It appears, in fact, that the issuing judge never considered whether any of Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional claims satisfied paragraph (2). As far as we know, <em>no </em>federal judge has ever determined that Gonzalez \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Court <em>does not even suggest that he </em>has\u2014but it goes on to decide the statute-of-limitations issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Its basis for proceeding in this fashion is the remarkable statement that \u201c[a] defective COA is not equivalent to the</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">[565 U.S. 157]</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">lack of any COA.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 143, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 632. That is simply not true with respect to a significant defect in a legal document. Would one say that a deed which lacks the words of conveyance is not equivalent to the lack of a deed? Or that a passport which lacks the Secretary of State\u2019s affirmance of the bearer\u2019s citizenship is not equivalent to the lack of a passport? Minor technical defects are one thing, but a defect that goes to the whole purpose of the instrument is something else. And the <em>whole purpose </em>of the certificate-of-appealability procedure is to make sure that, before a case can proceed to the court of appeals, a judge has made the determination that it presents a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. To call something a valid certificate of appealability which does not contain the central finding that is the whole purpose of a certificate of appealability is quite absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">The Court says that \u201c[o]nce a judge has made the determination that a COA is warranted and resources are deployed in briefing and argument, . . . the COA has fulfilled [its] gate-keeping function.\u201d Ante, at 145, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 633. But of course it has <em>not </em>done so\u2014it has performed no gate-keeping function whatever\u2014if \u201cthe determination that a COA is warranted\u201d has not been accompanied by the issuing judge\u2019s opinion required to support the determination: that there is an issue as to which the applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). As the very next sentence of today\u2019s opinion discloses, what the <em>Court </em>means by \u201chas fulfilled [its] gatekeeping function\u201d is simply that it will not be worth the trouble of going back, since that would \u201cnot outweigh the costs of further delay,\u201d <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">That is doubtless true, and it demonstrates the hollowness of the Court\u2019s assurance that \u201ccalling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not mandatory or that a timely objection can be ignored,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 146, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 633. That statement is true enough as a general proposition: Calling the numerosity requirement in <em>Arbaugh v.Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006), nonjurisdictional, for example, did not eliminate it, where</p>\n<p id=\"AOHk0\">[565 U.S. 158]</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">protest was made, as a continuing mandatory requirement for relief on the merits, <em>id., </em>at 516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. Even the time-of-filing requirement in <em>Eberhart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 126 S. Ct. 403, 163 L. Ed. 2d 14 (2005) <em>(per curiam), </em>continued to have \u201cbite\u201d even though it was held nonjurisdictional: It prevented relief when the failure to observe it was properly challenged, <em>id., </em>at 19, 126 S. Ct. 403, 163 L. Ed. 2d 14. But the Court has managed to create today a \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement which\u2014precisely because it will not be worth the trouble of going back\u2014has no practical, real-world effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> What is the consequence when the issuing judge, over properly preserved objection, produces a COA like the one here, which does not contain the required opinion? None whatever. The habeas petitioner already has what he wants, argument before the court of appeals. The government, for its part, is either confident in its view that there has been no substantial showing of denial of a constitutional right\u2014in which case it is just as easy (if not easier) to win before three judges as it is before one; or else it is not\u2014in which case a crusade to enforce \u00a7 2253(c) is likely to yield nothing but additional litigation expenses. As for the three-judge panel of the court of appeals, it remains free, as always, to choose whichever mandatory-but-not-jurisdictional basis it wishes for resolving the case. Cf. <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 93-94, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998). Why not choose the one that is sure to be final and that might avoid embarrassing a colleague? No one has any interest in enforcing the \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement. Which is perhaps why, as I proceed to discuss, mandatory requirements for court-to-court appeal are always made jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">[565 U.S. 159]</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Past Treatment of Similar Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">As the Court acknowledges, \u201c \u2018context, including this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.\u2019\u201d Ante, at 142, n. 3, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 631 (quoting <em>Reed Elsevier, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Muchnick, </em>559 U.S. 154, 168, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2010)). Thus, we have said that a requirement prescribed as a condition to obtaining judicial review of agency action is quite different (nonjurisdic-tional) from a requirement prescribed as a condition to appeal from one court to another (jurisdictional). See <em>Henderson, </em>562 U.S., at 434, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159. We have <em>always\u2014always, without </em>exception\u2014 held that procedural conditions for appealing a case from one Article III court to another are jurisdictional. When an appeal is \u201cnot taken within the time prescribed by law,\u201d the \u201cCourt of Appeals [is] without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>George </em>v. <em>Victor Talking Machine Co., </em>293 U.S. 377, 379, 55 S. Ct. 229, 79 L. Ed. 439 (1934) <em>(per curiam); </em>see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229-230, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1960). When a party\u2019s name is not listed in the notice of appeal, as the F ederal Rules of Appellate Procedure require, the court has no jurisdiction over that party\u2019s appeal. <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 314-315, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">When this Court reviewed cases by writ of error, the law required that the lower-court record be filed with the Court \u201cbefore the end of the term next succeeding the issue of the writ.\u201d <em>Edmonson </em>v. <em>Bloomshire, </em>7 Wall. 306, 309, 19 L. Ed. 91 (1869). The Court routinely dismissed cases that did not comply with that requirement. See, <em>e.g., Mesa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>2 Black 721, 722, 17 L. Ed. 350 (1863) <em>(per curiam); Edmonson, supra, </em>at 309-310, 19 L. Ed. 91; <em>Steamer Virginia </em>v. <em>West, </em>19 How. 182, 183, 15 L. Ed. 594 (1857). The same jurisdictional treatment was accorded to failure to serve notice on the defendant in error within the succeeding Term, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>6 How. 106, 112-113, 12 L. Ed. 363 (1848); <em>Villabolos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>6 How. 81, 88, 91, 12 L. Ed. 352 (1848), and to failure to file the writ of error with the clerk of the lower court, see, e.g., <em>Credit Co. </em>v. <em>Arkansas Central R. Co., </em>128 U.S. 258, 261, 9 S. Ct. 107, 32 L. Ed. 448 (1888); <em>Scarborough </em>v. <em>Pargoud, </em>108 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">[565 U.S. 160]</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">567, 2 S. Ct. 877, 27 L. Ed. 824 (1883). Today, when a petition for cer-tiorari in a civil case is not filed within the time prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c), this Court lacks jurisdiction. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>NRA Political Victory Fund, </em>513 U.S. 88, 90, 115 S.

And Chief Justice Chase wrote, in a case dismissing an appeal for failure to file in time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201cIn the Judiciary Act of 1789, and in many acts since, Congress has provided for [appellate courts\u2019] exercise [of jurisdiction] in such cases and classes of cases, and under such regulations as seemed to the legislative wisdom convenient and appropriate.

Ed. 163 (1866).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Jurisdictional Nature of Predecessor Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">But similarity to a general type of provision that has always been held jurisdictional is not all that supports the jurisdictional character of \u00a7 2253(c)(3). Its very predecessor statute made a judge\u2019s expression of opinion a condition of appellate jurisdiction. The certificate of probable cause, of which the COA was born, arrived on the scene over 100 years ago in \u201cAn Act Restricting in certain cases the right of appeal to the Supreme Court in habeas corpus proceedings,\u201d Act of Mar. 10, 1908, ch. 76, 35 Stat. 40:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">\u201c[F]rom a final decision by a court of the United States in a proceeding in habeas corpus where the detention complained of is by virtue of process issued out of a State court no appeal to the Supreme Court shall be allowed unless the United States court by which the final decision was rendered or a justice of the Supreme Court shall be of opinion that there exists probable cause for an appeal, in which event, on allowing the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">[565 U.S. 162]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-13\">same, the said court or justice shall certify that there is probable cause for such allowance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">The last version of this statute, before it was amended to its current form in AEDPA, provided for issuance of the certificate of probable cause by a circuit judge instead of a justice. See \u00a7 2253, 62 Stat. 967 (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a72253 (1946 ed., Supp. II)). Even applying the Court\u2019s simplistic rule that the jurisdictional restriction must be contained in the very same paragraph as the procedural requirement, there is no doubt that under this statute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>judge\u2019s certification <em>that there was probable cause for an appeal </em>was jurisdictional. See, <em>e.g., Ex parte Patrick, </em>212 U.S. 555, 29 S. Ct. 686, 53 L. Ed. 650 (1908) <em>(per curiam); Bilik </em>v. <em>Strassheim, </em>212 U.S. 551, 29 S. Ct. 649, 29 S. Ct. 684, 53 L. Ed. 649 (1908) <em>(per curiam). </em>There is no reason whatever to think that Congress rendered the statement of opinion unnecessary for jurisdiction by (1) extending the requirement for it to \u00a7 2255 proceedings; (2) requiring the opinion to address a more specific point (not just probable cause for an appeal but presence of an issue presenting a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) giving the document in which the judge <em>is required to express the opinion </em>a name (\u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d)\u2014so that now a \u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d without opinion will suffice.

Ed. 2d, at 633. That case flatly contradicts today\u2019s holding. In <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285, we dealt with Rule 3(c)(1) of the F ederal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 3(a) of those Rules makes a notice of appeal necessary to appellate jurisdiction\u2014just as \u00a7 2253(c)(1) makes a certificate of appealability necessary. And Rule 3(c)(1), which, like \u00a7 2253(c)(3), does not contain jurisdictional language, says what the requisite notice of appeal must contain\u2014just as \u00a7 2253(c)(3) says what the requisite certificate of appealability must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">\u201cThe notice of appeal must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201c(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice . . . ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">\u201c(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201c(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">[565 U.S. 164]</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In <em>Torres </em>we held that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over the appeal of a party not properly named in the notice of appeal. 487 U.S., at 314-315, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285. The parallel is perfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The Court claims that the jurisdictional consequences of Rule 3(c) were \u201c \u2018 \u201cimposed by the legislature,\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 147, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 634 (quoting <em>Torres, supra, </em>at 318, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285), which according to the Court\u2019s analysis \u201c\u2018clearly state[d],\u2019\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 141, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 631 (quoting <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097), that Rule 3(c) is jurisdictional. But the Legislature there did <em>precisely </em>what it did here: made a particular document necessary to jurisdiction and then specified what that document must contain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I certainly agree that that is a clear statement that a document with the requisite content is necessary to jurisdiction. But the Court does not. So to distinguish <em>Torres </em>it has to find something <em>else </em>in Rule 3(c) that provided a \u201cclear statement\u201d of what \u201cCongress intended,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 142, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 631. The best it can come up with, <em>ante, </em>at 147, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 634, is an unclear statement, and that not from Congress but from Advisory Committee Notes referred to in the <em>Torres </em>opinion. Such Notes are (of course) \u201cthe product of the Advisory Committee, and not Congress,\u201d and \u201cthey are transmitted to Congress before the rule is enacted into law.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 64, n. 6, 122 S. Ct. 1043, 152 L. Ed. 2d 90 (2002). They are, in other words, a species of legislative history. I know</p>\n<p id=\"AWGNN\">[565 U.S. 165]</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">of no precedent for the proposition that legislative history can satisfy a clear-statement requirement imposed by this Court\u2019s opinions. Does today\u2019s distinguishing of <em>Torres </em>mean that legislative history can waive the sovereign immunity of the United States? See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nordic Village, Inc., </em>503 U.S. 30, 33-34, 112 S. Ct. 1011, 117 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1992). Or abrogate the sovereign immunity of the States? See <em>Atascadero State Hospital </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>473 U.S. 234, 242, 105 S. Ct. 3142, 87 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1985). Or give retroactive effect to new legislation? See <em>Greene </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 U.S. 149, 160, 84 S. Ct. 615, 11 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1964). Or foreclose review of agency actions? See <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967). Today\u2019s opinion is in this respect a timebomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>To make matters worse, the Advisory Committee Note considered by the <em>Torres </em>Court\u2014as \u201csupport for [its] view,\u201d 487 U.S., at 315, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285\u2014did <em>not </em>clearly say that Rule 3(c)\u2019s requirements were jurisdictional. It said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u201c \u2018Rule 3 and Rule 4 combine to require that a notice of appeal be filed with the clerk of the district court within the time prescribed for taking an appeal. Because <em>the timely filing of a notice of appeal </em>is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 224 [80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259] (1960), compliance with the provisions of those rules <em>is of the utmost importance.\u2019\u201d Id., </em>at 315, 108 S. Ct. 2405, 101 L. Ed. 2d 285 (quoting 28 U.S.C. App., p. 467 (1982 ed.); brackets omitted; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">To say that timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and that placing within the notice of appeal what Rule 3 says it must contain is <em>\u201cof the utmost importance,\u201d </em>does not remotely add up to a clear statement that placing within the notice of appeal what Rule 3 says it must contain is <em>jurisdictional. </em>There is simply no principled basis for saying that <em>Torres </em>satisfies the \u201cclear-statement principle,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 142, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 631, except the commonsense notion that when a document is</p>\n<p id=\"At1D\">[565 U.S. 166]</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">made jurisdictional, and the required contents of that document specified, a document that does not contain those contents cannot confer jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The Court is not willing to say that <em>Torres </em>is no longer good law, but I doubt whether future litigants will be so coy. They know that in the past, to avoid the uncongenial rigidity of the rule that procedures attending court-to-court appeals are jurisdictional, we have performed wondrous contortions to find compliance with those rules. For example, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S. Ct. 678, 116 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1992), we held that an \u201cinformal brief\u2019 filed after a defective notice of appeal counted as a valid notice of appeal. In <em>Foman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 181, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962), we held that a notice of appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment was also a notice of appeal from the underlying judgment. And in <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 270, 108 S. Ct. 2379, 101 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1988), we held that a prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal was \u201cfiled\u201d when it was delivered to prison authorities for forwarding to the District Court. These (shall we say) creative interpretations of the procedural requirements were made necessary by the background principle that is centuries old: \u201c [I]f the mode prescribed for removing cases by writ of error or appeal be too strict and technical, and likely to produce inconvenience or injustice, it is for Congress to provide a remedy by altering the existing laws; not for the court.\u201d <em>Curry, </em>46 How., at 113, 12 L. Ed. 363. But if we have been willing to expose ourselves to ridicule in order to approve implausible compliance with procedural pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>requisites to appeal, surely we may be willing to continue and expand the process</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">[565 U.S. 167]</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">of simply converting those obnoxious prerequisites into the now favored \u201cclaims processing rules,\u201d enabling us to avoid unseemly contortions by simply invoking the ever-judge-friendly principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">What began as an effort to \u201c \u2018bring some discipline\u2019 to the use of the term \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 141, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 630 (quoting <em>Henderson, </em>562 U.S., at 435, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159), shows signs of becoming a libertine, liberating romp through our established jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">A few remaining points raised by the Court\u2019s opinion warrant response.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The Court holds that the requirement imposed by paragraph (c)(2) (that a COA may issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d) is not jurisdictional, and says that \u201c [i] t follows that \u00a7 2253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 143, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 632. I need not reach the issue whether (c)(2) is jurisdictional\u2014though it seems to me that the Court disposes rather summarily of the Solicitor General\u2019s view that it is. And I need not confront the Court with the back-at-you argument that if (c)(3) is jurisdictional (as I think) then (c)(2) is as well. For whether one runs it backwards or forwards, the argument is a bad one. Assuming that (c)(2) is nonjurisdictional, it does not at all \u201cfollow\u201d that (c)(3) is nonjuris-dictional as well. Paragraph (c)(3) is jurisdictional not because it is located in subsection (c), but because it describes the required content of a COA. Paragraph (c)(2) does not; it sets forth the criterion for a COA\u2019s issuance. A judge may apply that criterion erroneously but still produce a COA that (as paragraph (c)(3) requires) \u201cindicate[s] which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\u201d It no more follows that the erroneousness of the judge\u2019s indication must destroy the jurisdiction that the COA creates, than it followed under the predecessor statute that the erroneousness of the certification of probable cause for an appeal destroyed</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">[565 U.S. 168]</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">the jurisdiction that the certification created.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The two issues are quite separate: what the judge must find, and what the COA (or certification) must contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The Court points out that Gonzalez raised the Sixth Amendment issue in his application for a COA, that \u201c[a] petitioner, having successfully obtained a COA, has no control over how the judge drafts the COA,\u201d and that the petitioner, \u201cas in Gonzalez\u2019s case, may have done everything required of him by law.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 144, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 632. Perhaps it is true that the defective COA was not at all Gonzalez\u2019s fault\u2014though he could have promptly moved to amend it. But no-fault elimination of jurisdiction is not forbidden. In <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007), we enforced a time limit on notice of appeal where the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Court had purported to extend the time to file and the appellant had complied with the court\u2019s order. <em>Id., </em>at 207, 213-214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96. It did not matter that the fault lay with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Finally, the Court points out that treating \u00a7 2253(c)(3) as jurisdictional would waste a lot of time. \u201cEven if additional screening of already-issued COAs for \u00a7 2253(c)(3) defects could further winnow the cases before the courts of appeals, that would not outweigh the costs of further delay from the extra layer of review.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 145, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 633. But that is not an argument directed to the statute before us; it is an argument directed against enforcement of <em>all </em>jurisdictional requirements <em>(all </em>of which, I suspect, are the object of the Court\u2019s mounting disfavor). And the argument may not even be true, except in the (presumably rare) case where the jurisdictional prescription is disregarded. Over the long term,</p>\n<p id=\"AnFCq\">[565 U.S. 169]</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">the time saved to judges and lawyers by an <em>enforceable </em>requirement that appeals be screened by a single judge may vastly outweigh the time wasted by the occasional need for enforcement. That, it seems to me, is what Congress believed.</p>\n<p id=\"pApb65\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"30\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAScAAAAeAQAAAABGI+U9AAAAt0lEQVR4nO3SMQ5BQRDG8f+bPIkoxA04iISDOASdjo5TqBxC6QYSN6BQP9EoXvZT7iQ7xSvoTPfLfJOd3SyStFGupBLJAJ3JlbYBjC7VLYWkw9qtMn2WSAas/NA9ggHrd25UTRPAgMXLzZ8eESS1Y7fKe1YiGWATN17PAxjw8qnHPIABV/9oxzqCpN3SrTK8lUgG7Pt5WqNRAAMuvdyoDoMIkpK/fLspkb75Jyp1COmbJ/5Tv0h9AOe0zdVSCmtsAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"295\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Terminology is destiny. Today\u2019s holding, and the erosion of our prior jurisprudence that will perhaps follow upon it, is foreshadowed and facilitated by the unfortunate terminology with which we have chosen to accompany our campaign to \u201cbring some discipline\u201d to determinations of jurisdiction. We have said that the universe of rules placing limitations upon the courts is divided into (1) \u201cclaims processing rules,\u201d and (2) jurisdiction-removing rules. Unless our prior jurisprudence is to be repudiated, that is a false dichotomy. The requirement that the unsuccessful litigant file a timely notice of appeal, for example, is (if the term is to have any meaning) a claims processing rule, ordering the process by which claims are adjudicated. Yet as discussed above, that, and all procedures that must be followed to proceed from one court to another, have always been deemed jurisdictional. The proper dichotomy is between claims-processing rules that are jurisdictional, and those that are not. To put it otherwise suggests a test for jurisdiction that is not to be found in our cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">[565 U.S. 170]</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">At the end of the day, the indication requirement in \u00a7 2253(c)(3) is \u201c \u2018imposed by the legislature and not by the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Torres, </em>487 U.S., at 318, 108 S.

Whether or not its enforcement leads to a harsh result, wastes time in this particular case, or (though the Court does not give this as a reason) prevents us from reaching a Circuit conflict we are dying to resolve, we are obliged to enforce it.

But these actions are unsurprising in a world in which there was the possibility that this Court would treat \u00a7 2253(c)(3) as a jurisdictional requirement and a Court of Appeals had already done so. The New World of the Court\u2019s making, in which it is <em>certain </em>that an issuing judge\u2019s failure to identify any issue justifying a COA will not have jurisdictional consequences, is yet unexplored.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\">.

Ed. 2d 867 (2004), we said by way of dictum the following: \u201cClarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u2019\u2019 Unless an appeal lacking a timely filing of a notice of appeal can be considered one that falls outside the appellate court\u2019s \u201csubject-matter jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 (which would be an odd usage), <em>Kontrick's </em>dictum effectively announced today\u2019s decision, the overruling of <em>Torres and Browder </em>v. <em>Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., </em>434 U.S. 257, 98 S. Ct. 556, 54 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1978), and the elimination of jurisdictional treatment for all procedural requirements for appeal. That the announcement has not been heeded is demonstrated by <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007) (decided after <em>Kontrick), </em>which (over the dissent of the author of <em>Kontrick) </em>reaffirmed <em>Browder. </em>I confess error in joining the quoted portion of <em>Kontrick.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
