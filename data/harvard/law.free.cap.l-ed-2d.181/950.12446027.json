Ct. 3, 63 L. Ed. 97 (1918). And since amended in 1978, see 92 Stat. 1069, the FMIA requires all slaughterhouses to comply with the standards for humane handling and slaughter of animals set out in the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 (HMSA), 72 Stat. 862, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 <em>et seq., </em>which originally applied only to slaughterhouses selling meat to the Federal Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">The Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility for administering the FMIA to promote its dual goals of safe meat and humane slaughter. Over the years, the FSIS has issued extensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals and meat, as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses\u2019 operations and facilities. See 9 CFR \u00a7 300.1 <em>et seq. </em>(2011). The FSIS employs about 9,000 inspectors, veterinarians, and investigators to implement its inspection re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>gime and enforce its humane-handling requirements. See Hearings on 2012 Appropriations before the Subcommittee on Agriculture of the House Committee on Appropriations, 112th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. IB, p. 921 (2011). In fiscal year 2010, those personnel examined about 147 million head of livestock and carried out more than 126,000 \u201chumane handling verification procedures.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 942-943.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">The FSIS\u2019s inspection procedure begins with an \u201cante-mortem\u201d examination of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse. See 9 CFR \u00a7 309.1. If the inspector finds no evidence of disease or injury, he approves the animal for slaughter. If, at the other end of the spectrum, the inspector sees that an animal is dead or dying, comatose, suffering from a high fever, or afflicted with a serious disease or condition, he designates the animal as \u201cU. S. Condemned.\u201d See \u00a7 309.3; \u00a7 311.1 <em>et seq. </em>(listing diseases requiring condemnation). A condemned animal (if not already dead) must be</p>\n<p id=\"AcFZS\">[565 U.S. 457]</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food is produced, and no part of its carcass may be sold for human consumption. See \u00a7 309.13(a); 21U.S.C. \u00a7 610(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">The inspector also has an intermediate option: If he determines that an animal has a less severe condition\u2014or merely suspects the animal of having a disease meriting condemnation\u2014he classifies the animal as \u201cU. S. Suspect.\u201d See 9 CFR \u00a7 309.2. That category includes all nonambu-latory animals not found to require condemnation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See \u00a7 309.2(b). Suspect livestock must be \u201cset apart,\u201d specially monitored, and (if not reclassified because of a change in condition) \u201cslaughtered separately from other livestock.\u201d \u00a7 309.2(n). Following slaughter, an inspector decides at a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d examination which parts, if any, of the suspect animal\u2019s carcass may be processed into food for humans. See 9 CFR pts. 310, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">The regulations implementing the FMIA additionally prescribe methods for handling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process. Those rules apply from the moment a truck carrying livestock \u201centers, or is in line to enter,\u201d a slaughterhouse\u2019s premises. Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS Directive 6900.2, ch. II(I) (rev. Aug. 15, 2011). And they include specific provisions for the humane treatment of animals that cannot walk. See 9 CFR \u00a7 313.2(d). Under the regulations, slaughterhouse employees may not drag conscious, nonambula-tory animals, see \u00a7 313.2(d)(2), and may move them only with \u201cequipment suitable for such purposes,\u201d \u00a7 313.2(d)(3). Similarly, employees must place nonambulatory animals, as well as other sick and disabled livestock, in covered pens sufficient to protect</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">[565 U.S. 458]</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">the animals from \u201cadverse climatic conditions.\u201d See \u00a7 313.2(d)(1); \u00a7 313.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">The FMIA contains an express preemption provision, at issue here, addressing state laws on these and similar matters. That provision\u2019s first sentence reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-12\">\u201cRequirements within the scope of this [Act] with respect to premises, facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>provided under . . . this [Act], which are in addition to, or different than those made under this [Act] may not be imposed by any State.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">In 2008, the Humane Society of the United States released an undercover video showing workers at a slaughterhouse in California dragging, kicking, and electroshocking sick and disabled cows in an effort to move them. The video led the Federal Government to institute the largest beef recall in U. S. history in order to prevent consumption of meat from diseased animals. Of greater relevance here, the video also prompted the California legislature to strengthen a preexisting statute governing the treatment of nonambulatory animals and to apply that statute to slaughterhouses regulated under the FMIA. See <em>National Meat Assn. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>599 F.3d 1093, 1096 (CA9 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">As amended, the California law\u2014 \u00a7 599f of the state penal code\u2014provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-7\">\u201c(a) No slaughterhouse, stockyard, auction, market agency, or dealer shall buy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-8\">[565 U.S. 459]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-9\">\u201c(b) No slaughterhouse shall process, butcher, or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human consumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-10\">\u201c(c) No slaughterhouse shall hold a nonambulatory animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize the animal\u201d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 599f (West 2010).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">The maximum penalty for violating any of these prohibitions is one year in jail and a $ 20,000 fine. See \u00a7 599f(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA) is a trade association representing meatpackers and processors, including operators of swine slaughterhouses. It sued to enjoin the enforcement of \u00a7 599f against those slaughterhouses, principally on the ground that the FMIA preempts application of the state law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court granted the NMA\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, reasoning that \u00a7 599f is expressly preempted because it requires swine \u201cto be handled in a manner other than that prescribed by the FMIA\u201d and its regulations. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the injunction. According to that court, the FMIA does not expressly preempt \u00a7 599f because the state law regulates only \u201cthe kind of animal that may be slaughtered,\u201d and not the inspection or slaughtering process itself. 599 F.3d, at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-14\">We granted certiorari, 564 U.S. 1036, 131 S. Ct. 3083, 180 L. Ed. 2d 884 (2011), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">The FMIA\u2019s preemption clause sweeps widely\u2014and in so doing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>blocks the applications of \u00a7 599f challenged here. The clause prevents a State from imposing any additional or different\u2014even if non-conflicting\u2014requirements that fall</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">[565 U.S. 460]</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">within the scope of the Act and concern a slaughterhouse\u2019s facilities or operations. And at every turn \u00a7 599f imposes additional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses: It compels them to deal with nonambulatory pigs on their premises in ways that the federal Act and regulations do not. In essence, California\u2019s statute substitutes a new regulatory scheme for the one the FSIS uses. Where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig, under state law the slaughterhouse must take another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Consider first what the two statutes tell a slaughterhouse to do when (as not infrequently occurs) a pig becomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to the slaughterhouse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 599f(c) prohibits the slaughterhouse from \u201chold[ing]\u201d such an animal \u201cwithout taking immediate action to humanely euthanize\u201d it. And \u00a7 599f(b) provides that no part of the animal\u2019s carcass may be \u201cprocess[ed]\u201d or \u201cbutcher[ed]\u201d to make food. By contrast, under the FMIA and its regulations, a slaughterhouse may hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory pig that has not been condemned. See <em>supra, </em>at 457, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 958. And the slaughterhouse may process or butcher such an animal\u2019s meat for human consumption, subject to an FSIS official\u2019s approval at a post-mortem inspection. See <em>ibid. </em>The State\u2019s proscriptions thus exceed the FMIA\u2019s. To be sure, nothing in the federal Act requires what the state law forbids (or forbids what the state law requires); California is right to note that \u201c[t]he FMIA does not mandate that TJ. S. Suspect\u2019 [nonambulatory] animals ... be placed into the human food production process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">[565 U.S. 461]</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Brief for State Respondents 31. But that is irrelevant, because  the FMIA\u2019s preemption clause covers not just conflicting but also different or additional state requirements. It therefore precludes California\u2019s effort in \u00a7\u00a7 599f(b) and (c) to impose new rules, beyond any the FSIS has chosen to adopt, on what a slaughterhouse must do with a pig that becomes nonambulatory during the production process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">Similarly, consider how the state and federal laws address what a slaughterhouse should do when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery, usually because of harsh transportation conditions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 599f(a) of the California law bars a slaughterhouse from \u201creceiv[ing]\u201d or \u201cbuy[ing]\u201d such a pig, thus obligating the slaughterhouse to refuse delivery of the animal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But that directive, too, deviates from any imposed by federal law.  <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>A regulation issued under the FMIA specifically authorizes slaughterhouses to buy disabled or diseased animals (including nonambulatory swine), by exempting them from a general prohibition on such purchases. See 9 CFR \u00a7 325.20(c). And other regulations contemplate that slaughterhouses will in fact take, rather than refuse, receipt of nonam-bulatory swine. Recall that the FMIA\u2019s regulations provide for the inspection of all pigs at delivery, see <em>supra, </em>at 456, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 956-957\u2014in the case of nonambulatory pigs, often right on the truck, see Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS Directive 6900.2, ch. II(I). They further instruct slaughterhouses to kill and dispose of any</p>\n<p id=\"A6Kb\">[565 U.S. 462]</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">nonambulatory pigs labeled \u201ccondemned,\u201d and to slaughter separately those marked \u201csuspect.\u201d See <em>supra, </em>at 456-457, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 957-958. In short, federal law establishes rules for handling and slaughtering non-ambulatory pigs brought to a slaughterhouse, rather than ordering them returned to sender. So \u00a7 599f(a) and the FMIA require different things of a slaughterhouse confronted with a delivery truck containing nonambula-tory swine. The former says \u201cdo not receive or buy them\u201d; the latter does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">The Humane Society counters that at least \u00a7 599f(a)\u2019s ban on buying non-ambulatory animals escapes preemption because that provision applies no matter when or where a purchase takes place. The argument proceeds in three steps: (1) Section 599f(a)\u2019s ban covers purchases of nonambula-tory pigs made prior to delivery, away from the slaughterhouse itself (say, at a farm or auction); (2) the State may regulate such offsite purchases because they do not involve a slaughterhouse\u2019s \u201cpremises, facilities and operations,\u201d which is a condition of preemption under the FMIA; and (3) no different result should obtain just because a slaughterhouse structures its swine purchases to occur at delivery, on its own property. See Brief for Non-State Respondents 43-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">But this argument fails on two grounds. First, its preliminary steps have no foundation in the record. Until a stray comment at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50, neither the State nor the Humane Society had disputed the NMA\u2019s assertion that slaughterhouses buy pigs at delivery (or still later, upon successful ante-mortem inspection). See Brief for Petitioner 46, n. 18; Brief for Non-State Respondents 44; Brief for State Respondents 16, n. 5. Nor had the parties presented evidence that a significant number of pigs become non-ambulatory before shipment, when any offsite purchases would occur. The record therefore does not disclose whether \u00a7 599f(a)\u2019s ban on purchase ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate, much less how an application of that kind would affect a slaughterhouse\u2019s operations. And because</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">[565 U.S. 463]</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">that is so, we have no basis for deciding whether the FMIA would preempt it. Second, even assuming that a State could regulate offsite purchases, the concluding step of the Humane Society\u2019s argument would not follow. The FMIA\u2019s preemption clause expressly focuses on \u201cpremises, facilities and operations\u201d\u2014at bottom, the slaughtering and processing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>animals at a given location. So the distinction between a slaughterhouse\u2019s site-based activities and its more far-flung commercial dealings is not, as the Humane Society contends, an anomaly that courts should strain to avoid. It is instead a fundamental feature of the FMIA\u2019s preemption clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">For that reason, the Humane Society\u2019s stronger argument concerns California\u2019s effort to regulate the <em>last </em>stage of a slaughterhouse\u2019s business\u2014the ban in \u00a7 599f(b) on \u201csell-ting] meat or products of nonambula-tory animals for human consumption.\u201d The Government acknowledges that the FMIA\u2019s preemption clause does not usually foreclose \u201cstate regulation of the commercial sales activities of slaughterhouses.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>17. And the Humane Society asserts, in line with that general rule, that \u00a7 599f(b)\u2019s ban on sales does not regulate a slaughterhouse\u2019s \u201coperations\u201d because it kicks in only after they have ended: Once meat from a slaughtered pig has passed a post-mortem inspection, the Act \u201cis not concerned with whether or how it is ever actually sold.\u201d Brief for Non-State Respondents 45. At most, the Humane Society claims, \u00a7 599f(b)\u2019s ban on sales offers an \u201cincentiv[e]\u201d to a slaughterhouse to take nonambulatory pigs out of the meat production process. <em>Id., </em>at 46. And California may so \u201cmotivate\u201d an operational choice without running afoul of the FMIA\u2019s preemption provision. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC, </em>544 U.S. 431, 443, 125 S. Ct. 1788, 161 L. Ed. 2d 687 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">But this argument mistakes how the prohibition on sales operates within \u00a7 599f as a whole. The sales ban is a criminal proscription calculated to help implement and enforce</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">[565 U.S. 464]</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">each of the section\u2019s other regulations\u2014its prohibition of receipt and purchase, its bar on butchering and processing, and its mandate of immediate euthanasia. The idea\u2014and the inevitable effect\u2014of the provision is to make sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the production process (or keep them out of the process from the beginning) by criminalizing the sale of their meat. That, we think, is something more than an \u201cincentiv[e]\u201d or \u201cmotivat[or]\u201d; the sales ban instead functions as a command to slaughterhouses to structure their operations in the exact way the remainder of \u00a7 599f mandates. And indeed, if the sales ban were to avoid the FMIA\u2019s preemption clause, then any State could impose any regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it as a ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way the State disapproved. That would make a mockery of the FMIA\u2019s preemption provision. Cf. <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., </em>541 U.S. 246, 255, 124 S. Ct. 1756, 158 L. Ed. 2d 529 (2004) (stating that it \u201cwould make no sense\u201d to allow state regulations to escape preemption because they addressed the purchase, rather than manufacture, of a federally regulated product). Like the rest of \u00a7 599f, the sales ban regulates how slaughterhouses must deal with nonambulatory pigs on their premises. The FMIA therefore preempts it for all the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">California\u2019s and the Humane Society\u2019s broadest argument against preemption maintains that all of \u00a7 599f s challenged provisions fall outside the \u201cscope\u201d of the FMIA because they exclude a class of animals from the slaughtering process. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678 (preempting certain re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>quirements \u201cwithin the scope of this [Act]\u201d). According to this view, the Act (and the FSIS\u2019s authority under it) extends only to \u201canimals that are going to be turned into meat,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u2014or to use another phrase, animals that will \u201cbe slaughtered . . . for purposes of human food production,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">[565 U.S. 465]</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Brief for State Respondents 19 (emphasis deleted). Section 599f avoids the scope of the Act, respondents claim, by altogether removing nonambulatory pigs from the slaughtering process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Ninth Circuit accepted this argument, analogizing \u00a7 599f to state laws upheld in two other Circuits banning the slaughter of horses for human consumption. 599 F.3d, at 1098 (discussing <em>Cavel Int\u2019l, Inc. </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>500 F.3d 551 (CA7 2007), <em>and Ernpacadora de Carnes de Fresnillo, S. A. de C.V. </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>476 F.3d 326 (CA5 2007)). According to the Court of Appeals, \u201cstates are free to decide which animals may be turned into meat.\u201d 599 F.3d, at 1098, 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">We think not.  The FMIA\u2019s scope includes not only \u201canimals that are going to be turned into meat,\u201d but animals on a slaughterhouse\u2019s premises that will never suffer that fate. The Act\u2019s implementing regulations themselves exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process. Swine with hog cholera, for example, are disqualified, see 9 CFR \u00a7 309.5(a); so too are swine and other livestock \u201caffected with anthrax,\u201d \u00a7 309.7(a). Indeed, the federal regulations prohibit the slaughter of any nonambulatory <em>cattle </em>for human consumption. See \u00a7 309.3(e). As these examples demonstrate, one vital function of the Act and its regulations is to ensure that some kinds of livestock delivered to a slaughterhouse\u2019s gates will <em>not </em>be turned into meat. Under federal law, nonambulatory pigs are not among those excluded</p>\n<p id=\"AKCPt\">[565 U.S. 466]</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">animals. But that is to say only that \u00a7 599fs requirements differ from those of the FMIA\u2014not that \u00a7 599f s requirements fall outside the FMIA\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Nor are respondents right to suggest that \u00a7 599f s exclusion avoids the FMIA\u2019s scope because it is designed to ensure the humane treatment of pigs, rather than the safety of meat. See, e.g., Brief for State Respondents 29; Brief for Non-State Respondents 39-40. [12] That view misunderstands the authority\u2014and indeed responsibility\u2014that the FMIA gives to federal officials. Since 1978, when Congress incorporated the HMSA\u2019s standards, the FMIA has required slaughterhouses to follow prescribed methods of humane handling, so as to minimize animals\u2019 pain and suffering. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 603(b), 610(b); <em>supra, </em>at 456-458, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 957-959. A violation of those standards is a crime, see \u00a7 676, and the Secretary of Agriculture can suspend inspections at\u2014and thus effectively shut down\u2014a slaughterhouse that disobeys them, see \u00a7\u00a7 603(b), 610(c). To implement the Act\u2019s humane-handling provisions, the FSIS has issued detailed regulations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>see 9 CFR pt. 313, including some specifically addressing animals that cannot walk, see \u00a7\u00a7 313.2(d), 313.1(c). Those rules, as earlier noted, apply throughout the time an animal is on a slaughterhouse\u2019s premises, from the moment a delivery truck pulls up to the gate. See <em>supra, </em>at 456-458, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 957-959. So the FMIA addresses not just food safety, but humane treatment as well. Even California conceded at oral argument that the FSIS could issue regulations under the FMIA, similar to \u00a7 599f, mandating the euthanasia of nonambula-tory swine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46-47. If that is so\u2014and it is, because of the FSIS\u2019s authority over humane-handling methods\u2014then \u00a7 599fs requirements must fall within the FMIA\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">[565 U.S. 467]</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">The Circuit decisions upholding state bans on slaughtering horses, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, do not demand any different conclusion. We express no view on those decisions, except to say that the laws sustained there differ from \u00a7 599f in a significant respect. A ban on butchering horses for human consumption works at a remove from the sites and activities that the FMIA most directly governs. When such a ban is in effect, no horses will be delivered to, inspected at, or handled by a slaughterhouse, because no horses will be ordered for purchase in the first instance. But \u00a7 599f does not and cannot work in that way. As earlier noted, many non-ambulatory pigs become disabled either in transit to or after arrival at a slaughterhouse. See <em>supra, </em>at 460-463, and nn. 5-6, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 960-962. So even with \u00a7 599f in effect, a swine slaughterhouse will encounter nonambulatory pigs. In that circumstance, \u00a7 599f tells the slaughterhouse what to do with those animals. Unlike a horse slaughtering ban, the statute thus reaches into the slaughterhouse\u2019s facilities and affects its daily activities. And in so doing, the California law runs smack into the FMIA\u2019s regulations. So whatever might be said of other bans on slaughter, \u00a7 599f imposes requirements within\u2014and indeed at the very heart of\u2014the FMIA\u2019s scope.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">[565 U.S. 468]</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">The FMIA regulates slaughterhouses\u2019 handling and treatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their delivery through the end of the meat production process. California\u2019s \u00a7 599f endeavors to regulate the same thing, at the same time, in the same place except by imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>different requirements. The FMIA expressly preempts such a state law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand this case for further proceedings tent with this opinion. consis-</p>\n<p id=\"AxzA5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">.  The FMIA applies to all slaughterhouses producing meat for interstate and foreign commerce. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601(h), 603(a). The FMIA also regulates slaughterhouses serving an exclusively intrastate market in any State that does not administer an inspection system with \u201crequirements at least equal to those\u2019\u2019 of the Act. \u00a7 661(c)(1). Because California has chosen not to adopt such an inspection program, the FMIA governs all slaughterhouses in the State (except for any limited to \u201ccustom slaughtering for personal, household, guest, and employee uses,\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 623(a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1058-13\">.  The PSIS\u2019s regulations define \u201cnon-ambulatory disabled livestock\u2019\u2019 as \u201clivestock that cannot rise from a recumbent position or that cannot walk, including, but not limited to, those with broken appendages, severed tendons or ligaments, nerve paralysis, fractured vertebral column, or metabolic conditions.\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 309.2(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1059-17\">. The preemption provision also includes a saving clause, which states that the Act \u201cshall not preclude any State . . . from making requirement[s] or taking other action, consistent with this [Act], with respect to any other matters regulated under this [Act].\u2019\u2019 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678; see n. 10, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1059-18\">.

The percentage of pigs becoming nonambulatory after delivery varies by slaughterhouse from 0.1 percent to over 1 percent. See McGlone, Fatigued Pigs: The Final Link, Pork Magazine 14 (Mar. 2006). About 100 million pigs are slaughtered each year in the United States, see Dept. of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Livestock Slaughter 13 (Jan. 2011), so those percentages work out to between 100,000 and 1,000,000 pigs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">. According to one estimate, almost one-half of 1 percent of the pigs slaughtered annually in the United States become nonambulatory during the trip from farm to slaughterhouse. See National Pork Board, Transport Quality Assurance Handbook 25 (Version 4, 2008) (updated 2010). About half that many die during transport. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1060-13\">. Section 599f(a) also bans \u201csell[ing]\u201d nonambulatory animals. But because slaughterhouses (unlike other entities referenced in the provision) do not typically sell live animals, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>prohibition is not at issue in this case. The statute\u2019s distinct ban on selling meat from nonambulatory animals that have been slaughtered is discussed <em>infra, </em>at 463-464, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">. California\u2019s brief sometimes casts its argument in terms of the \u201coperations\u201d language of the FMIA\u2019s preemption clause (although the State appeared to abandon this phrasing at oral argument). In this version of the claim, California contends that the \u201coperations\u201d of a slaughterhouse are only those \u201cof federal concern,\u201d and that excluding a class of animals from the slaughtering process does not impinge on such operations. Brief for State Respondents 20, n. 9; see also <em>id., </em>at 20-21. We see no real difference between saying that a categorical exclusion of animals does not implicate \u201c \u2018operations\u2019 of federal concern\u201d and saying that it does not fall within the scope of the Act. Accordingly, our answer to both forms of the argument is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">. Indeed, the FSIS recently solicited comment on a rulemaking petition that would require all nonambulatory disabled livestock, including swine, to be humanely euthanized. See 76 Fed. Reg. 6572 (2011). The FSIS has taken no further action on that petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">. We finally reject California\u2019s argument, see Brief for State Respondents 20, that our reading of the FMIA\u2019s preemption provision renders its saving clause insignificant.  That clause provides that States may regulate slaughterhouses as to \u201cother matters,\u2019\u2019 not addressed in the express preemption clause, as long as those laws are \u201cconsistent with\u2019\u2019 the FMIA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678. So, for example, the Government acknowledges that state laws of general application (workplace safety regulations, building codes, etc.) will usually apply to slaughterhouses. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. Moreover, because the FMIA\u2019s express preemption provision prevents States from imposing only \u201cadditional]\u2019\u2019 or \u201cdifferent\u201d requirements, \u00a7 678, States may exact civil or criminal penalties for animal cruelty or other conduct that also violates the FMIA. See \u00a7 678; cf. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC, </em>544 U.S. 431, 447, 125 S. Ct. 1788, 161 L. Ed. 2d 687 (2005) (holding that a preemption clause barring state laws \u201c \u2018in addition to or different\u2019 \u201d from a federal Act does not interfere with an \u201cequivalent\u201d state provision (emphasis deleted)). Although the FMIA preempts much state law involving slaughterhouses, it thus leaves some room for the States to regulate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
