Maples is an Alabama capital prisoner sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of two individuals. At trial, he was represented by two appointed lawyers, minimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases. Maples sought postcon-viction relief in state court, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial infirmities. His petition, filed in August 2001, was written by two New York attorneys serving <em>pro bono, </em>both associated with the same New York-based large law firm. An Alabama attorney, designated as local counsel, moved the admission of the out-of-state counsel <em>pro hac vice. </em>As understood by New York counsel, local counsel would facilitate their appearance, but would undertake no substantive involvement in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">In the summer of 2002, while Maples\u2019 postconviction petition remained pending in the Alabama trial court, his New York attorneys left the law firm; their new employment disabled them from continuing to represent Maples. They did not inform Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as his counsel. Nor did they seek the Alabama trial court\u2019s leave to withdraw. Neither they nor anyone</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">[565 U.S. 271]</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">else moved for the substitution of counsel able to handle Maples\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">In May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples\u2019 petition. Notices of the court\u2019s order were posted to the New York attorneys at the address of the law firm with which they had been associated. Those postings were returned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempted no further mailing. With no attorney of record in fact acting on Maples\u2019 behalf, the time to appeal ran out.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">Thereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. The District Court and, in turn, the Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the procedural default in state court, <em>i.e., </em>Maples\u2019 failure timely to appeal the Alabama trial court\u2019s order denying him postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was blameless for the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">The sole question this Court has taken up for review is whether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples\u2019 case, there is \u201ccause\u201d to excuse the default. Maples maintains that there is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly representing him had abandoned the case without leave of court, without informing Maples they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>no longer represent him, and without securing any recorded substitution of counsel. We agree. Abandoned by counsel, Maples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state postconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to protect himself <em>pro se. </em>In these circumstances, no just system would lay the default at Maples\u2019 death-cell door. Satisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we reverse the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Alabama sets low eligibility requirements for lawyers appointed to represent indigent capital defendants at trial.

Experience with capital cases is not required. Former Justices Brief 7-8. Nor does the State provide, or require appointed counsel to gain, any capital-case-specific professional education or training.

Until 1999, the State paid appointed capital defense attorneys just \u201c$40.00 per hour for time expended in court and $20.00 per hour for time reasonably expended out of court in the preparation of [the defendant\u2019s] case.\u201d Ala.

T. 2006, No. 06-10605, p. 23. Thus, as of 2006, 86% of the attorneys representing Alabama\u2019s death row inmates in state collateral review proceedings \u201ceither worked for the Equal Justice Initiative (headed by NYU Law professor Bryan Stevenson), out-of-state public interest groups like the Innocence Project, or an out-of-state mega-firm.\u201d Brief in Opposition 16, n. 4. On occasion, some prisoners sentenced to death receive no postconviction representation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>all. See ABA Report 112 (\u201c[A]s of April 2006, approximately fifteen of Alabama\u2019s death row inmates in the final rounds of state appeals had no lawyer to represent them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">This system was in place when, in 1997, Alabama charged Maples with two counts of capital murder; the victims, Stacy Alan Terry and Barry Dewayne Robinson II, were Maples\u2019 friends who, on the night of the murders, had been out on the town with him. Maples pleaded not guilty, and his case proceeded to trial, where he was represented by two court-appointed Alabama attorneys. Only one of them had earlier served in a capital case. See Tr. 3081. Neither counsel had previously tried the penalty phase of a capital case. Compensation for each lawyer was capped at $1,000 for time spent out of court preparing Maples\u2019 case, and at $40 per hour for in-court services. See Ala. Code \u00a7 15-12-21 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Finding Maples guilty on both counts, the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. The vote was 10 to 2, the minimum number Alabama requires for a death (  \u201cThe decision of the jury to recommend a sentence of death must be based on a vote of at least 10 jurors.\u201d). Accepting the jury\u2019s recommendation, the trial court sentenced Maples to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">[565 U.S. 274]</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">On direct appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence. <em>Ex parte Maples, </em>758 So. 2d 81 (Ala. 1999); <em>Maples </em>v. <em>State, </em>758 So. 2d 1 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999). We denied certiorari. <em>Maples </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>531 U.S. 830, 121 S. Ct. 83, 148 L. Ed. 2d 45 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Two out-of-state volunteers represented Maples in postconviction proceedings: Jaasi Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associates at the New York offices of the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell law firm. At the time,  Alabama required out-of-state attorneys to associate local counsel when seeking admission to practice <em>pro hac vice </em>before an Alabama court, regardless of the nature of the proceeding. Rule Governing Admission to the Ala. State Bar VII (2000) (hereinafter Rule VII).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Alabama Rule further prescribed that the local attorney\u2019s name \u201cappear on all notices, orders, pleadings, and other documents filed in the cause,\u201d and that local counsel \u201caccept joint and several responsibility with the foreign attorney to the client, to opposing parties and counsel, and to the court or administrative agency in all matters [relating to the case].\u201d Rule VII(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">Munanka and Ingen-Housz associated Huntsville, Alabama, attorney John Butler as local counsel. Notwithstanding his obligations under Alabama law, Butler informed Munanka and Ingen-Housz, \u201cat the outset,\u201d that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of allowing the two New York attorneys to appear <em>pro hac vice </em>on behalf of Maples. App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a. Given his lack of \u201cresources, available time [and] experience,\u201d Butler told the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers, he could not \u201cdeal with substantive issues in the case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys accepted Butler\u2019s conditions. <em>Id., </em>at 257a. This arrangement between out-of-state and local attorneys, it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>pears, was</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">[565 U.S. 275]</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">hardly atypical. See Former Justices Brief 36 (\u201cThe fact is that local counsel for out-of-state attorneys in postconviction litigation most often do nothing other than provide the mechanism for foreign attorneys to be admitted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">With the aid of his <em>pro bono </em>counsel, Maples filed a petition for postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among other claims, Maples asserted that his court-appointed attorneys provided constitutionally ineffective assistance during both guilt and penalty phases of his capital trial. App. 29-126. He alleged, in this regard, that his inexperienced and underfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious intoxication defense, did not object to several egregious instances of pros-ecutorial misconduct, and woefully underprepared for the penalty phase of his trial. The State responded by moving for summary dismissal of Maples\u2019 petition. On December 27, 2001, the trial court denied the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Some seven months later, in the summer of 2002, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. App. to Pet. for Cert. 258a. Munanka gained a clerkship with a federal judge; Ingen-Housz accepted a position with the European Commission in Belgium. <em>Ibid. </em>Neither attorney told Maples of their departure from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell or of their resulting inability to continue to represent him. In disregard of Alabama law, see Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.2, Comment, neither attorney sought the trial court\u2019s leave to withdraw, App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a. Compounding Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s inaction, no other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyer entered an appearance on Maples\u2019 behalf, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise notified the court of any change in Maples\u2019 representation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Another nine months passed. During this time period, no Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys assigned to Maples\u2019 case sought admission to the Alabama Bar, entered appearances</p>\n<p id=\"AEG-0\">[565 U.S. 276]</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">on Maples\u2019 behalf, or otherwise advised the Alabama court that Mu-nanka and Ingen-Housz were no longer Maples\u2019 attorneys. Thus, Munanka and Ingen-Housz (along with Butler) remained Maples\u2019 listed, and only, \u201cattorneys of record.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">There things stood when, in May 2003, the trial court, without holding a hearing, entered an order denying Maples\u2019 Rule 32 petition. App. 146-225.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The clerk of the Alabama trial court mailed copies of the order to Maples\u2019 three attorneys of record. He sent Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s copies to Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\u2019s New York address, which the pair had provided upon entering their appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">When those copies arrived at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Munanka and Ingen-Housz had long since departed. The notices, however, were not forwarded to another Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney. Instead, a mailroom employee sent the unopened envelopes back to the court. \u201cReturned to Sender\u2014Attempted, Unknown\u201d was stamped on the envelope addressed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Munanka. App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition 8a. A similar stamp appeared on the envelope addressed to Ingen-Housz, along with the handwritten notation \u201cReturn to Sender\u2014 Left Firm.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7a.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Upon receiving back the unopened envelopes he had mailed to Munanka and Ingen-Housz, the Alabama court clerk took no further action. In particular, the clerk did not contact Mu-nanka or Ingen-Housz at the personal telephone numbers or home addresses they had provided in their <em>pro hac vice </em>applications. See Ingen-Housz Verified Application for Admission To Practice Under Rule VII, p. 1; and Munanka Verified Application for Admission To Practice Under Rule VII, p. 1, in <em>Maples </em>v. <em>State, </em>No. CC-95-842.60 (C. C. Morgan Cty, Ala.). Nor did the clerk alert Sullivan &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"A8vq\">[565 U.S. 277]</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Cromwell or Butler. Butler received his copy of the order, but did not act on it. App. to Pet. for Cert. 256a. He assumed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz, who had been \u201cCC\u2019d\u201d on the order, would take care of filing an appeal. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Meanwhile, the clock ticked on Maples\u2019 appeal. Under Alabama\u2019s Rules of Appellate Procedure, Maples had 42 days to file a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s May 22, 2003 order denying Maples\u2019 petition for postconviction relief. Rule 4(a)(1) (2000). No appeal notice was filed, and the time allowed for filing expired on July 7, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">A little over a month later, on August 13, 2003, Alabama Assistant Attorney General Jon Hayden, the attorney representing the State in Maples\u2019 collateral review proceedings, sent a letter directly to Maples. App. to Pet. for Cert. 253a-254a. Hayden\u2019s letter informed Maples of the missed deadline for initiating an appeal within the State\u2019s system, and notified him that four weeks remained during which he could file a federal habeas petition. <em>Ibid. </em>Hayden mailed the letter to Maples only, using his prison address. <em>Ibid. </em>No copy was sent to Maples\u2019 attorneys of record, or to anyone else acting on Maples\u2019 behalf. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Upon receiving the State\u2019s letter, Maples immediately contacted his mother. <em>Id., </em>at 258a. She telephoned Sullivan &amp; Cromwell to inquire about her son\u2019s case. <em>Ibid. </em>Prompted by her call, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys Marc De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer submitted a motion, through Butler, asking the trial court to reissue its order denying Maples\u2019 Rule 32 petition, thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period. Id., at 222a.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The trial court denied the motion, <em>id., </em>at 222a-225a, noting that Mu-nanka and Ingen-Housz had not withdrawn from the case and, consequently, were \u201cstill attorneys of record for the petitioner,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 223a. Furthermore, the court added, attorneys De Leeuw, Duffy, and Brewer had not \u201cyet been admitted to practice in Alabama\u201d or \u201centered appearances as attorneys of record.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cHow,\u201d the court asked, \u201ccan</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">[565 U.S. 278]</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">a Circuit Clerk in Decatur, Alabama know what is going on in a law firm in New York, New York?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 223a-224a. Declining to blame the clerk for the missed notice of appeal deadline, the court said it was \u201cunwilling to enter into subterfuge in order to gloss over mistakes made by counsel for the petitioner.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Maples next petitioned the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of mandamus, granting him leave to file an out-of-time appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Rejecting Maples\u2019 plea, the Court of Criminal Appeals determined that, although the clerk had \u201cassumed a duty to notify the parties of the resolution of Maples\u2019s Rule 32 petition,\u201d the clerk had satisfied that obligation by sending notices to the attorneys of record at the addresses those attorneys provided. <em>Id., </em>at 234a-235a. Butler\u2019s receipt of the order, the court observed, sufficed to notify all attorneys \u201cin light of their apparent co-counsel status.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 235a-236a (quoting <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Kellett, </em>489 So. 2d 554, 555 (Ala. 1986)). The Alabama Supreme Court summarily affirmed the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 judgment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 237a, and this Court denied certiorari, <em>Maples </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>543 U.S. 1148, 125 S. Ct. 1309, 161 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Having exhausted his state post-conviction remedies, Maples sought federal habeas corpus relief. Addressing the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims Maples stated in his federal petition, the State urged that Maples had forever forfeited those claims. Maples did, indeed, present the claims in his state postconviction (Rule 32) petition, the State observed, but he did not timely appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition. That procedural default, the State maintained, precluded federal-court consideration of the claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Maples replied that the default should be</p>\n<p id=\"AkSBe\">[565 U.S. 279]</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">excused, because he missed the appeal deadline \u201cthrough no fault of his own.\u201d App. 262 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The District Court determined that Maples had defaulted his ineffective-assistance claims, and that he had not shown \u201ccause\u201d sufficient to overcome the default. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a-55a. The court understood Maples to argue that errors committed by his postconviction counsel, not any lapse on the part of the court clerk in Alabama, provided the requisite \u201ccause\u201d to excuse his failure to meet Alabama\u2019s 42-days-to-appeal Rule. <em>Id., </em>at 55a. Such an argument was inadmissible, the court ruled, because this Court, in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991), had held that the ineffectiveness of post-conviction appellate counsel could not qualify as cause. App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a (citing <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S., at 751, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. <em>Maples </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>586 F.3d 879 (2009) <em>(per curiam). </em>In accord with the District Court, the Court of Appeals\u2019 majority held that Maples defaulted his ineffective-assistance claims in state court by failing to file a timely notice of appeal, <em>id., </em>at 890, and that Coleman rendered Maples\u2019 assertion of \u201ccause\u201d unacceptable, 586 F.3d, at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Judge Barkett dissented. <em>Id., </em>at 895-898. She concluded that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals had acted \u201carbitrarily\u201d in refusing to grant Maples\u2019 request for an out-of-time appeal. <em>Id., </em>at 896. In a case involving \u201cindistinguishable facts,\u201d Judge Bar-kett noted, the Alabama appellate court had allowed the petitioner to file a late appeal. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>State, </em>884 So. 2d 898, 899 (Ala. Crim. App. 2002)). Inconsistent application of the 42-days-to-appeal rule, Judge Barkett said, \u201crender[ed] the rule an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>inadequate ground on which to bar federal review of Maples\u2019s claims.\u201d 586 F.3d, at 897: The interests of justice, she added, required review of Maples\u2019 claims in view of the exceptional circumstances and high stakes involved, and the absence of any fault on Maples\u2019 part. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">[565 U.S. 280]</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">We granted certiorari to decide whether the uncommon facts presented here establish cause adequate to excuse Maples\u2019 procedural default. 562 U.S. 1286, 131 S. Ct. 1718, 179 L. Ed. 2d 644 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">As a rule, a state prisoner\u2019s ha-beas claims may not be entertained by a federal court \u201cwhen (1) \u2018a state court [has] declined to address [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,\u2019 and (2) \u2018the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>562 U.S. 307, 316, 131 S. Ct. 1120, 179 L. Ed. 2d 62 (2011) (quoting <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S., at 729-730, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640). The bar to federal review may be lifted, however, if \u201cthe prisoner can demonstrate cause for the [procedural] default [in state court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 750, 111 S.

Ed. 2d 594 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Given the single issue on which we granted review, we will assume, for purposes of this decision, that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 refusal to consider Maples\u2019 ineffective-assistance claims rested on an independent and adequate state procedural ground: namely, Maples\u2019 failure to satisfy Alabama\u2019s Rule requiring a notice of appeal to be filed within 42 days from the trial court\u2019s final order. Accordingly, we confine our consideration to the question whether Maples has shown cause to excuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Cause for a procedural default exists where \u201csomething <em>external </em>to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,] . . . \u2018impeded [his] efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S., at 753, 111 S.

Thus, when a petitioner\u2019s postconviction attorney misses a filing deadline, the petitioner is bound by the oversight and cannot rely on it to establish cause. <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S., at 753-754, 111 S.

We do not disturb that general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">A markedly different situation is presented, however, when an attorney abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Having severed the principal-agent relationship, an attorney no longer acts, or fails to act, as the client\u2019s representative. See 1 Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 31, Comment f (1998) (\u201cWithdrawal, whether proper or improper, terminates the lawyer\u2019s authority to act for the client.\u201d).

Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (2010), is instructive. That case involved a missed one-year deadline, prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), for filing a federal habeas petition. <em>Holland </em>presented two issues: first,  whether the \u00a7 2244(d) time limitation can be tolled for equitable reasons, and, second, whether an attorney\u2019s unprofessional conduct can ever count as an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d justifying equitable tolling. 560 U.S., at 649,</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">[565 U.S. 282]</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">651, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (internal quotation marks omitted). We answered yes to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">On the second issue, the Court recognized that an attorney\u2019s negligence, for example, miscalculating a filing deadline, does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory time limit. <em>Id., </em>at 651-652, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130; <em>id., </em>at 656, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>549 U.S. 327, 336, 127 S. Ct. 1079, 166 L. Ed. 2d 924 (2007). The <em>Holland </em>petitioner, however, urged that attorney negligence was not the gravamen of his complaint. Rather, he asserted that his lawyer had detached himself from any trust relationship with his client: \u201c[My lawyer] has abandoned me,\u201d the petitioner complained to the court. 560 U.S., at 637, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Nara </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>264 F.3d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering a hearing on whether a client\u2019s effective abandonment by his lawyer merited tolling of the one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">In a concurring opinion in <em>Holland, </em>Justice Alito homed in on  the essential difference between a claim of attorney error, however egregious, and a claim that an attorney had essentially abandoned his client. 560 U.S., at 659, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130. Holland\u2019s plea fit the latter category: He alleged abandonment \u201cevidenced by counsel\u2019s near-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to respond to petitioner\u2019s many inquiries and requests over a period of several years.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see <em>id., </em>at 636-637, 652, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (majority opinion). If true, Justice Alito explained, \u201cpetitioner\u2019s allegations would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his control[:]  Common sense dictates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>that a litigant cannot be held constructively responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 659, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">[565 U.S. 283]</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">We agree that,  under agency principles, a client cannot be charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who has abandoned him. Nor can a client be faulted for failing to act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact, are not representing him. We therefore inquire whether Maples has shown that his attorneys of record abandoned him, thereby supplying the \u201cextraordinary circumstances beyond his control,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>necessary to lift the state procedural bar to his federal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">From the time he filed his initial Rule 32 petition until well after time ran out for appealing the trial court\u2019s denial of that petition, Maples had only three attorneys of record: Mu-nanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler. Unknown to Maples, not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his attorney during the 42 days permitted for an appeal from the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">The State contends that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell represented Maples throughout his state postconviction proceedings. Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel continuing through the six weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his Rule 32 petition. We disagree. It is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their agency relationship with Maples long before the default occurred. See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the two attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw from the case). Both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\u2019s employ in the summer of 2002, at least nine months before the Alabama trial court entered its order denying Rule 32 relief. App. to Pet. for Cert. 258a. Their new employment\u2014Munanka as a</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">[565 U.S. 284]</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">law clerk for a federal judge, Ingen-Housz as an employee of the European Commission in Belgium\u2014 disabled them from continuing to represent Maples. See Code of Conduct for Judicial Employees, Canon 4(D)(3) (1999) (  prohibiting judicial employees from participating in \u201clitigation against federal, state or local government\u201d); European Commission, Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, Tit. I, Art. 12b (2004) (em ployees cannot perform outside work without first obtaining authorization from the Commission), available at http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/ toclOO_en.pdf (as visited Jan. 13, 2012, and in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Hornbook agency law establishes that the attorneys\u2019 departure from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and their commencement of employment that prevented them from representing Maples ended their agency relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ship with him. See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 112 (1957) (hereinafter Restatement (Second)) (  \u201c[T]he authority of an agent terminates if, without knowledge of the principal, he acquires adverse interests or if he is otherwise guilty of a serious breach of loyalty to the principal.\u201d); 2 <em>id., </em>\u00a7 394, Comment a (\u201c[T]he agent commits a breach of duty [of loyalty] to his principal by acting for another in an undertaking which has a substantial tendency to cause him to disregard his duty to serve his principal with only his principal\u2019s purposes in mind.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Furthermore, the two attorneys did not observe Alabama\u2019s Rule requiring them to seek the trial court\u2019s permission to withdraw. See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.2, Comment. Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) \u00a7 111, Comment <em>b </em>(\u201c[I]t is ordinarily inferred that a principal does not intend an agent to do an illegal act.\u201d). By failing to seek permission to withdraw, Munanka and Ingen-Housz allowed the court\u2019s records to convey that they represented Maples. As listed attorneys of record, they, not Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law requires the clerk to furnish. See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.5 (  \u201cUpon the entry of any order in a criminal proceeding made in response to a motion, . ..the</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">[565 U.S. 285]</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">clerk shall, without undue delay, furnish all parties a copy thereof by mail or by other appropriate means.\u201d) and 34.4 (  \u201c[W]here the defendant is represented by counsel, service shall be made upon the attorney of record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Although acknowledging that Mu-nanka and Ingen-Housz severed their agency relationship with Maples upon their departure from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, the State argues that, nonetheless, Maples was not abandoned. Other attorneys at the firm, the State asserts, continued to serve as Maples\u2019 counsel. Regarding this assertion, we note, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys played. In an affidavit submitted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples\u2019 request that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see <em>supra, </em>at 277, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 819, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been \u201cinvolved in [Maples\u2019] case since the summer of 2001.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a. After the trial court initially denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw informed the court, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell \u201clawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated] eviden-tiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 258a. Another Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit submitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003, that she \u201cha[d] worked on [Maples\u2019] case since October 14, 2002.\u201d App. 231. But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy described what their \u201cinvolve[ment]\u201d or \u201cwor[k] on [Maples\u2019] case\u201d entailed. And neither attorney named the lawyers, other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in preparation for the expected hearing. Nor did De Leeuw identify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed on Maples\u2019 case between Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s departures and the firm\u2019s receipt of the telephone call from Maples\u2019 mother.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>[565 U.S. 286]</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The slim record on activity at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, however, does not warrant a remand to determine more precisely the work done by firm lawyers other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz. For the facts essential to our decision are not in doubt. At the time of the default, the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys who later came forward\u2014De Leeuw, Duffy, and Kathy Brewer\u2014had not been admitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered their appearances on Maples\u2019 behalf, and had done nothing to inform the Alabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. Thus, none of these attorneys had the legal authority to act on Maples\u2019 behalf before his time to appeal expired. Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) \u00a7 111 (The \u201cfailure to acquire a qualification by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized act. . . terminates the agent\u2019s authority to act.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">[565 U.S. 287]</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">What they did or did not do in their New York offices is therefore beside the point. At the time critical to preserving Maples\u2019 access to an appeal, they, like Munanka and Ingen-Housz, were not Maples\u2019 authorized agents.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab0A\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Maples\u2019 only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, also left him abandoned. Indeed, Butler did not even begin to represent Maples. Butler informed Munanka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of enabling the two out-of-state attorneys to appear <em>pro hac vice. Supra, </em>at 274, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 817. Lacking the necessary \u201cresources, available time [and] experience,\u201d Butler told the two Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers, he would not \u201cdeal with substantive issues in the case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That the minimal participation he undertook was inconsistent with Alabama law, see Rule VII, quoted <em>supra, </em>at 274, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 817, underscores the absurdity of holding Maples barred because Butler signed on as local counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">In recognizing that Butler had no role in the case other than to allow Munanka and Ingen-Housz to appear <em>pro hac vice, </em>we need not rely solely on Butler\u2019s and De Leeuw\u2019s statements to that effect. App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a-258a. Other factors confirm that Butler did not \u201coperat[e] as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>[Maples\u2019] agent in any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S., at 659, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The first is Butler\u2019s own conduct. Upon receiving a copy of the trial court\u2019s Rule 32 order, Butler did not contact Sullivan &amp; Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were taking appropriate action. Although Butler had reason to believe that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had received a copy of the court\u2019s order, see App. 225 (indicating that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were CC\u2019d on the order), Butler\u2019s failure even to place a phone call to the New York firm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely representative role in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Notably, the State did not treat Butler as Maples\u2019 actual representative. Assistant Attorney General Hayden addressed</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">[565 U.S. 288]</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">the letter informing Maples of the default directly to Maples in prison. See <em>supra, </em>at 277, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 819. Hayden sent no copy to, nor did he otherwise notify, any of the attorneys listed as counsel of record for Maples.  Lawyers in Alabama have an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an opposing party known to be represented by counsel. See Ala. Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2003); Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.4 (requiring that the service of all documents \u201cbe made upon the attorney of record\u201d). In writing directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding this ethical obligation, Assistant Attorney General Hayden must have believed that Maples was no longer represented by counsel, out-of-state or local.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In sum, the record admits of only one reading: At no time before the missed deadline was Butler serving as Maples\u2019 agent \u201cin any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S., at 659, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (opinion of Alito, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of record, the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive notice. See <em>supra, </em>at 284-285, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 823-824. He in fact received none or any other warning that he had better fend for himself. Had counsel of record or the State\u2019s attorney</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">[565 U.S. 289]</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">informed Maples of his plight before the time to appeal ran out, he could have filed a notice of appeal himself<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or enlisted the aid of new volunteer attorneys.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Given no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from complying with the State\u2019s procedural rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">\u201cThe cause and prejudice requirement,\u201d we have said, \u201cshows due regard for States\u2019 finality and comity interests while ensuring that \u2018fundamental fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dretke </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>541 U.S. 386, 393, 124 S.

In the unusual circumstances of this case, principles of agency law and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: There was indeed cause to excuse Maples\u2019 procedural default. Through no fault of his own, Maples lacked the assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42 days Alabama allows for noticing an appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief. As just observed, he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to <em>pro se </em>status. Maples was disarmed by extraordinary circumstances quite beyond his control.

As <em>amici </em>for Maples explain, a significant conflict of interest arose for the firm once the crucial deadline passed. Brief for Legal Ethics Professors et al. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>as <em>Amici Curiae </em>23-27. Following the default, the firm\u2019s interest in avoiding damage to its own reputation was at odds with Maples\u2019 strongest argument\u2014i.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him, therefore he had cause to be relieved from the default. Yet Sullivan &amp; Cromwell did not cede Maples\u2019 representation to a new attorney, who could have made Maples\u2019 abandonment argument plain to the Court of Appeals. Instead, the firm represented Maples through briefing and oral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, where they attempted to cast responsibility for the mishap on the clerk of the Alabama trial court. Given Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\u2019s conflict of interest, Maples\u2019 federal habeas petition, prepared and submitted by the firm, is not persuasive evidence that Maples, prior to the default, ever \u201cviewed himself\u2019 as represented by \u201cthe firm,\u2019\u2019 see <em>post, </em>at 295, 181 L.

It bears note, as well, that the State served its response to Maples\u2019 Rule 32 petition only on Munanka at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\u2019s New York address, not on Butler. App. 26. While the State may not be obligated to serve more than one attorney of record, its selection of New York rather than local counsel is some indication that, from the start, the State was cognizant of the limited role Butler would serve. Conforming the State\u2019s Rule to common practice, in 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court amended the provision on appearances by out-of-state counsel to eliminate the requirement that such attorneys associate local counsel when representing indigent criminal defendants <em>pro bono </em>in postconviction proceedings.

Unbeknownst to petitioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation due to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortunate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the two young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in his state postcon-viction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by these two attorneys of new employment that precluded them from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to notify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to withdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure of the firm that they left to monitor the status of petitioner\u2019s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of the decision denying petitioner\u2019s request for state postconviction relief was received in that firm\u2019s offices, the failure of the firm\u2019s mailroom to route that important communication to either another member of the firm or to the departed attorneys\u2019 new addresses; (7) the failure of the clerk\u2019s office to take any action when the envelope containing that notice came back un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>opened; and (8) local counsel\u2019s very limited conception of the role that he was obligated to play in petitioner\u2019s representation. Under these unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner\u2019s attorneys effectively abandoned him and that this</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">[565 U.S. 291]</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">abandonment was a \u201ccause\u201d that is sufficient to overcome petitioner\u2019s procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">In an effort to obtain relief for his client, petitioner\u2019s counsel in the case now before us cast blame for what occurred on Alabama\u2019s system of providing legal representation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral proceedings. See Brief for Petitioner 3-6. But whatever may be said about Alabama\u2019s system, I do not think that Alabama\u2019s system had much if anything to do with petitioner\u2019s misfortune. The quality of petitioner\u2019s representation at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet the deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial of his state postconviction petition. Nor do I see any important connection between what happened in this case and Alabama\u2019s system for providing representation for prisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to petition the state courts for collateral relief. Unlike other States, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to represent these prisoners <em>pro bono, </em>and we are told that most of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms. <em>Id., </em>at 4. Petitioner\u2019s brief states that the Alabama system had \u201ca direct bearing on the events giving rise ... to the procedural default at issue,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 3, but a similar combination of untoward events could have occurred if petitioner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were appointed by the court and paid for with state funds. The firm whose lawyers represented petitioner <em>pro bono </em>is one of the country\u2019s most prestigious and expensive, and I have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery if they were given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys from such a firm. See <em>id., </em>at 9 (stating that it \u201cseemed as though Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys working at an elite New York law firm . . . agreed to represent Maples <em>pro bono\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">What occurred here was not a predictable consequence of the Alabama system but a veritable perfect storm of misfortune,</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">[565 U.S. 292]</p>\n<p id=\"Afp5\">a most unlikely combination of events that, without notice, effectively deprived petitioner of legal representation.

The Court now concludes that Maples has established cause for his procedural default by reason of abandonment by his attorneys. Because I cannot agree with that conclusion, and because Maples\u2019 alternative argument fares no better, I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">Our doctrine of procedural default reflects, and furthers, the principle that errors in state criminal trials should be remedied in state court. As we have long recognized, federal ha-beas review for state prisoners imposes significant costs on the States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>undermining not only their practical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments, see <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 126-127, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1982), but also the primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitutional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law, <em>id., </em>at 128, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783. We have further recognized that \u201c[t]hese costs are particularly high . . . when a state prisoner, through a procedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitutional claims in state court.\u201d <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 748, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991). In that situation, the prisoner has \u201cdeprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 732, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640, thereby leaving the state courts without \u201ca chance to mend their own fences and avoid federal intrusion,\u201d <em>Engle, </em>456 U.S., at 129, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783. For that reason, and because permitting</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">[565 U.S. 293]</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">federal-court review of defaulted claims would \u201cundercu[t] the State\u2019s ability to enforce its procedural rules,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>we have held that when a state court has relied on an adequate and independent state procedural ground in denying a prisoner\u2019s claims, the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain federal habeas relief. <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S., at 729-730, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">To be sure, the prohibition on federal-court review of defaulted claims is not absolute. A habeas petitioner\u2019s default in state court will not bar federal habeas review if \u201cthe petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 748, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640\u2014\u201ccause\u201d constituting \u201csomething <em>external </em>to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him,\u201d that impeded compliance with the State\u2019s procedural rule, <em>id., </em>at 753, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640. As a general matter, an attorney\u2019s mistakes (or omissions) do not meet the standard \u201cbecause the attorney is the petitioner\u2019s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must \u2018bear the risk of attorney error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 488, 106 S. Ct. 2639, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1986)). See also <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633-634, and n. 10, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 8 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">When an attorney\u2019s error occurs at a stage of the proceedings at which the defendant has a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, that error may constitute cause to excuse a resulting procedural default. A State\u2019s failure in its duty to provide an effective attorney, as measured by the standard set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), makes the attorney\u2019s error chargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense. See <em>Murray, supra, </em>at 488, 106 S. Ct. 2639, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397. But when the client has no right to counsel\u2014as is the case in the postconviction setting, see <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S. Ct. 1990, 95 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1987)\u2014the client bears the risk of all attorney errors made in the course of the representation, regardless of the egregiousness of the mistake. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>at 754, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (\u201c[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney\u2019s error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AmuI\">[565 U.S. 294]</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">right to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">In light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct to conclude, <em>ante, </em>at 283, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 823, that a habeas petitioner\u2019s procedural default may be excused when it is attributable to abandonment by his attorney. In such a case, <em>Coleman\u2019s </em>rationale for attributing the attorney\u2019s acts and omissions to the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased acting as the client\u2019s agent, \u201cwell-settled principles of agency law,\u201d 501 U.S., at 754, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640, no longer support charging the client with his lawyer\u2019s mistakes. The attorney\u2019s mistakes may therefore be understood as an \u201cexternal factor,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and in appropriate circumstances may justify excusing the prisoner\u2019s procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">I likewise agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion, <em>ante, </em>at 283, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 823, that Maples\u2019 two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples by the time the Alabama trial court entered its order denying his petition for postconviction relief. As the Court observes, <em>ante, </em>at 283-284, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 823-824, without informing Maples or seeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw from Maples\u2019 case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\u2019s employ and accepted new positions that precluded them from continuing to represent Maples. This conduct amounted to renunciation of their roles as Maples\u2019 agents, see 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 119, Comment <em>b </em>(1957) (hereinafter Restatement 2d), and thus terminated their authority to act on Maples\u2019 behalf, <em>id.., </em>\u00a7 118. As a result, Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s failure to take action in response to the trial court\u2019s order should not be imputed to Maples.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">It is an unjustified leap, however, to conclude that Maples was left unrepresented during the relevant window between the Alabama trial court\u2019s dismissal of his postconviction petition and expiration of the 42-day period for filing a notice of</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">[565 U.S. 295]</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">appeal established by Alabama Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) (2009). Start with Maples\u2019 own allegations: In his amended federal habeas petition, Maples alleged that, at the time he sought postconviction relief in Alabama trial court, he \u201cwas represented by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell of New York, New York.\u201d App. 256. Although the petition went on to identify Munanka and Ingen-Housz as \u201cthe two Sullivan lawyers handling the matter,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 257, its statement that Maples was \u201crepresented\u201d by the firm itself strongly suggests that Maples viewed himself as having retained the services of the firm as a whole, a perfectly natural understanding. \u201cWhen a client retains a lawyer who practices with a firm, the presumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have been retained.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 31, Comment f, p. 222 (1998). Admittedly, in connection with the attempt before the Alabama trial court to extend the time for appeal, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell partner Marc De Leeuw submitted an affidavit stating that the firm\u2019s lawyers \u201chandle <em>pro bono </em>cases on an individual basis\u201d and that the lawyers who had appeared in Maples\u2019 case had followed that practice, \u201cattempt[ing] not to use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a. But Maples\u2019 habeas petition is the pleading that initiated the current litigation; and surely the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>tions that it contained should be given priority over representations made to prior courts.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">[565 U.S. 296]</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">In any case, even if Maples had no attorney-client relationship with the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell firm, Munanka and Ingen-Housz were surely not the only Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers who represented Maples on an individual basis. De Leeuw\u2019s affidavit acknowledged that he had \u201cbeen involved in [Maples\u2019] case since the summer of 2001,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>roughly a year before Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and it further stated that after \u201cMs. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka\u201d learned of the court\u2019s initial order denying the State\u2019s motion to dismiss Maples\u2019 postconviction petition in December 2001, \u201cthe lawyers this case for Mr. Maples prepared for the evidentiary hearing\u201d Maples had requested, <em>id., </em>at 258a. Moreover, when Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney Felice Duffy filed a motion to appear <em>pro hac vice </em>before the Alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to extend the deadline, she stated that she had \u201cworked on [Maples\u2019] case since October 14, 2002,\u201d App. 231, months before the procedural default took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">According to the Court, see <em>ante, </em>at 285, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 824, De Leeuw\u2019s affidavit does not make clear how he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in Maples\u2019 case or whether lawyers other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz were among those who prepared for the anticipated evi-dentiary hearing; and Duffy\u2019s motion does not make clear what her \u201cwor[k]\u201d entailed. But there is little doubt that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were not the only attorneys who engaged in the preparations; and that De Leeuw was \u201cinvolved\u201d and Duffy \u201cworked\u201d as lawyers for Maples (what other role could they have taken on?). De Leeuw\u2019s distinction between \u201cMs. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka\u201d and \u201cthe lawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples\u201d would have been senseless if the latter category did not extend beyond the two named attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">[565 U.S. 297]</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">In sum, there is every indication that when the trial court entered its order dismissing Maples\u2019 postconviction petition in May 2003, Maples continued to be represented by a team of attorneys in Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\u2019s New York office. The Court nonetheless insists that the actions of these attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been admitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered appearances in the Alabama trial court, and had not sought to substitute for Mu-nanka and Ingen-Housz. See <em>ante, </em>at 286-287, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 825. The Court does not, however, explain why these facts establish that the attorneys were not Maples\u2019 agents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the case that did not require court appearance\u2014which would certainly include keeping track of orders issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>and filing deadlines. The Court\u2019s quotation from the Restatement of Agency, <em>ante, </em>at 286, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 825, that the \u201cfailure to acquire a qualification by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized act. . . terminates the agent\u2019s authority to act,\u201d 1 Restatement 2d, \u00a7 111, at 290, omits the crucial condition contained at the end of the section: \u201cif thereafter he [the agent] should infer that the principal, if he knew the facts, would not consent to the further exercise of the authority.\u201d There was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him, simply because they had <em>not yet </em>qualified before the Alabama court. Though it would have been \u201cillegal\u201d for these attorneys to file a notice of appeal without being authorized to practice in Alabama, nothing prevented them from first seeking to secure admission to practice, as Munanka and Ingen-Housz initially had done, and <em>then </em>filing a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">It would create a huge gap in our <em>Coleman </em>jurisprudence to disregard all attorney errors committed before admission to the relevant court; and an even greater gap to disregard (as the Court suggests) all errors committed before the attorney enters an appearance. Moreover, even if these attorneys cannot be regarded as Maples\u2019 agents for purposes of</p>\n<p id=\"Al61\">[565 U.S. 298]</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">conducting the Alabama litigation, they were <em>at least </em>his agents for purposes of advising him of the impending deadline. His unawareness was the fault of counsel who were his agents, and must be charged to him. What happened here is simply \u201c[a]ttorney ignorance or inadvertence\u201d of the sort that does not furnish cause to excuse a procedural default. <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S., at 753, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">But even leaving aside the question of Maples\u2019 \u201cunadmitted\u201d attorneys at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Maples had a fully admitted attorney, who had entered an appearance, in the person of local counsel, John Butler. There is no support for the Court\u2019s conclusion that Butler \u201cdid not even begin to represent Maples.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 287, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 825. True, the affidavit Butler filed with the Alabama trial court in the proceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that he had \u201cno substantive involvement\u201d with the case, and that he had \u201cagreed to serve as local counsel only.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a. But a disclaimer of \u201csubstantive involvement\u201d in a case, whether or not it violates a lawyer\u2019s ethical obligations, see <em>ante, </em>at 287, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 825-826, is not equivalent to a denial of any agency role at all. A local attorney\u2019s \u201cnonsub-stantive\u201d involvement would surely include, at a <em>minimum, </em>keeping track of local court orders and advising \u201csubstantive\u201d counsel of impending deadlines. Nor did Butler\u2019s explanation for his failure to act when he received a copy of the trial court\u2019s order sound in abandonment. Butler did not say, for instance, that he ignored the order because he did not consider Maples to be his client. Instead, based on \u201cpast practice\u201d and the content of the order, Butler \u201cassumed\u201d that Maples\u2019 lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell would receive a copy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 256a.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">The Court gets this badly wrong when it states that \u201cButler\u2019s failure even to place a phone call to the New York firm\u201d demonstrates Butler\u2019s \u201cdisclaimer of any genuinely representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tive role.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 287, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 826. By equating the very attorney error that contributed to Maples\u2019 procedural default with the absence of an agency relationship, the Court ensures that</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">[565 U.S. 299]</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">today\u2019s opinion will serve as a template for future habeas petitioners seeking to evade <em>Coleman\u2019s </em>holding that ineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel will not furnish cause to excuse a procedural default. See 501 U.S., at 752-754, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640. The trick will be to allege, not that counsel was ineffective, but rather that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely representative agent. No precedent should be so easily circumvented by word games, but the damage is particularly acute when the affected precedent is so firmly \u201cgrounded in concerns of comity and federalism.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 730, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The Court\u2019s last-gasp attempt to justify its conclusion that Butler was not Maples\u2019 agent is to point out that a prosecutor sent a letter to Maples directly, informing him of the defaulted appeal. See <em>ante, </em>at 287-288, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 825-826. The Court reasons that the prosecutor must have thought that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers, since to communicate with a represented party would have been a violation of ethical standards. <em>Ibid. </em>But even if this supposition is correct, it is hard to understand what it proves. What matters, after all, is not whether the prosecutor <em>thought </em>Maples had been abandoned, but whether Maples <em>really </em>was abandoned. And as it turns out, Butler\u2019s conduct after learning about the default further belies any such contention. Almost immediately, Butler began to cooperate with Maples\u2019 lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, filing papers as \u201cCounsel for Mr. Maples\u201d or \u201cLocal Counsel for Petitioner Cory Maples\u201d in multiple courts in an attempt to rectify the mistake. See App. 229, 230, 236, 238. Had Butler reassumed his representational duties after having abandoned them? Hardly. There is no proper basis for a conclusion of abandonment <em>interruptus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Maples argues in the alternative that his default should be excused because his right to due process was violated when the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Munanka\u2019s and</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">[565 U.S. 300]</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Ingen-Housz\u2019s copies of the court\u2019s dismissal order were returned undeliverable. According to Maples, our decision in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>547 U.S. 220, 126 S. Ct. 1708, 164 L. Ed. 2d 415 (2006), establishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">We held in <em>Jones </em>that, when a mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property. See <em>id., </em>at 234, 126 S. Ct. 1708, 164 L. Ed. 2d 415. It is questionable whether that holding has any relevance to the circumstances here, which involved not the institution of proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather the issuance of an order in a pending case that was instituted by Maples himself. Indeed, I think it doubtful whether due process entitles a litigant to <em>any </em>notice of a court\u2019s order in a pending case. The Federal Rules certainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute requirement. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides that \u201c[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment] does not affect the time for appeal or relieve\u2014or authorize the court to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>lieve\u2014a party for failing to appeal within the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (4)(a).\u201d And although Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for filing an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not receive notice, it establishes 180 days after the judgment or order is entered as the outer limit by which a motion to reopen must be filed. See Rule 4(a)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">There is no need to grapple with this question, however, because Butler received a copy of the trial court\u2019s order. \u201cUnder our system of representative litigation, \u2018each party ... is considered to have \u201cnotice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon [his] attorney.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 92, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1990) (quoting <em>Link, </em>at 634, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 8 L. Ed. 2d 734). The notice to Butler was therefore constitutionally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">[565 U.S. 301]</p>\n<p id=\"pAbAmNM\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"43\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAPcAAAAsAQAAAACRDhMSAAAAqUlEQVR4nO2ToQ7CQBBEdxcEQZAKLEk/pAlIPgeLol+C4iPwIOEfCiTVh2sC2cFxeyuuAkc67s2Imb3kGJQTJBsT/X+ePJB6ENLaWC9y8Gs/oXriK90+UlDB3S46exAOwbQ1jQOhYxst3lw8oFvGSoRdCkp4W6tDCirUrsyma+1A6DA21nriAbObOXlxSkEFRWFOLksHwvtptEbV3EPv/rz6ch7+15Bn9AGV0rWB3xjPXgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"247\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">One suspects that today\u2019s decision is motivated in large part by an understandable sense of frustration with the State\u2019s refusal to waive Maples\u2019 procedural default in the interest of fairness. Indeed, that frustration may well explain the Court\u2019s lengthy indictment of Alabama\u2019s general procedures for providing representation to capital defendants, <em>ante, </em>at 271-273, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 816-817, a portion of the Court\u2019s opinion that is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be otherwise inexplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">But if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing Maples\u2019 procedural default here, it does so whenever a defendant\u2019s procedural default is caused by his attorney. That is simply not the law\u2014and cannot be, if the States are to have an orderly system of criminal litigation conducted by counsel. Our precedents allow a State to stand on its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner\u2019s procedural default even when counsel is to blame. Because a faithful application of those precedents leads to the conclusion that Maples has not demonstrated cause to excuse his procedural default; and because the reasoning by which the Court justifies the opposite conclusion invites future evisceration of the principle that defendants are responsible for the mistakes of their attorneys; I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-12\"> The Court says that the allegations in Maples\u2019 own habeas petition are not \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u2019\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 286, n. 8, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 824-825, because Maples\u2019 lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell labored under a conflict of interest when they prepared the document. This is a curious point, since the effect of Maples\u2019 statement was to <em>implicate </em>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as a firm in missing the filing deadline. The conflict would have induced the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers to exonerate the firm. To be sure, as the case later developed (at this stage abandonment had not yet been conceived as the litigating strategy), it would have been in Maples\u2019 interest to say he had no lawyers. But the issue the petition\u2019s statement raises is not whether Maples was cleverly represented; it is whether the statement was <em>true. </em>And if Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\u2019s involvement in preparing the petition has any bearing upon that, it only reinforces the truth.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
