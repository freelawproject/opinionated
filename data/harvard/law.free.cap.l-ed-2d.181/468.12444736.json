Ct. 1305, 179 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Court of Appeals departed from this standard, and we therefore grant certiorari and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">Irving Cross was tried for kidnap-ing and sexually assaulting A. S. at knifepoint. Cross claimed that A. S. had consented to sex in exchange for money and drugs. Despite her avowed fear of taking the stand, A. S. testified as the State\u2019s primary witness at Cross\u2019 trial in November 1999 and was cross-examined by Cross\u2019 attorney. According to the trial judge, A. S.\u2019s testimony was halting. The jury found Cross not guilty of kidnaping but was unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charges, and the trial judge declared a mistrial. The State decided to retry Cross on those counts, and the retrial was scheduled for March 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">On March 20, 2000, the prosecutor informed the trial judge that A. S. could not be located. A week later, on March 28, the State moved to have A. S. declared unavailable and to introduce her prior testimony at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-18\">The State represented that A. S. had said after the first trial that she was willing to testify at the retrial. The State said that it had remained in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with A. S. and her mother and that \u201c[e]very indication\u201d had been that A. S., \u201cthough extremely frightened, would be willing to again come to court and testify.\u201d Record, Exh. J, p. 111 (hereinafter Exh. J). On March 3, however, A. S.\u2019s mother and brother told the State\u2019s investigator that they did not know where she was, and A. S.\u2019s mother reported that A. S. was \u201cvery fearful and very concerned\u201d about testifying again. Record, Exh. K, p. E-9 (hereinafter Exh. K); <em>id., </em>at E-14. On March 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>or 10, the investigator interviewed</p>\n<p id=\"AaVsM\">[565 U.S. 67]</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">A. S.\u2019s father, who also had \u201cno idea where [A. S.] was.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at E-12. The father\u2019s only suggestion was to refer the investigator back to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">On March 10, the State learned from A. S.\u2019s mother that A. S. had run away from home the day before and had not returned.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Exh. J, at 111. Thereafter, \u201cefforts began by members of the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and by law enforcement personnel to locate\u201d A. S. <em>Id., </em>at 112. The State averred that its efforts included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201cConstant personal visits to the home of [A. S.] and her mother, at all hours of the day and night. This is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cPersonal visits to the home of [A. S.\u2019s] father. This is where the victim lived when the sexual assault occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cPersonal conversations, in English and in Spanish, with the victim\u2019s mother, father, and other family members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201cTelephone calls, in English and in Spanish, to the victim\u2019s mother, father, and other family members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">\u201cChecks at the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cChecks at local hospitals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">\u201cChecks at the Cook County Department of Corrections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">\u201cCheck at the victim\u2019s school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-15\">\u201cCheck with the family of an old boyfriend of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-16\">\u201cCheck with the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-17\">\u201c[Department of] Public [A] id check.\u201d Id., at 112-113.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">The State also inquired at the Department of Public Health, the morgue, the Cook County Jail, the Illinois Department</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">[565 U.S. 68]</p>\n<p id=\"b571-20\">of Corrections, the Immigration Department, and the post office. See Exh. K, at E-14 to E-17, E-21; App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The State\u2019s investigator was assisted in the search by a police detective and a victim\u2019s advocate. The detective visited A. S.\u2019s father\u2019s home once and went to A. S.\u2019s mother\u2019s home\u2014A. S.\u2019s last-known residence\u2014on numerous occasions, approximately once every three days, at different hours of the day and night. Exh. K, at E27 to E29, E35. On one visit, A. S.\u2019s mother told the victim\u2019s advocate that A. S. could be staying with an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, 40 miles away. <em>Id., </em>at E42 to E43. The police detective visited the Waukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriend\u2019s mother that she had not seen A. S. in several months and that A. S. was not staying with her or her son. <em>Id., </em>at E33 to E34. The efforts to find A. S. continued until March 28, the day of the hearing on the State\u2019s motion. <em>Id., </em>at E30.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-21\">On a final visit to A. S.\u2019s mother on the morning of March 28, the mother informed the police detective that A. S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had said that she did not want to testify and would not return to Chicago. See <em>id., </em>at E-30; 632 F.3d 356, 359 (CA7 2011). A. S.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>mother told the detective that she still did not know where A. S. was or how to contact her. Exh. K, at E30. The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion and admitted A. S.\u2019s earlier testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The trial court concluded that the State had \u201cexpended efforts that go way beyond due diligence,\u201d <em>id., </em>at E-65, and that A. S. \u201cha[d] made it impossible for anybody to find where she is ... in spite of what I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],\u201d <em>id., </em>at E-67. At Cross\u2019 retrial, a legal intern from the State\u2019s attorney\u2019s office read A. S.\u2019s prior, cross-examined testimony to the jury. According to the opinion below, the clerk\u2019s reading of the prior testimony did not include the long pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk read the transcript with a slight inflection. See 632 F.3d, at 359. The jury acquitted</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">[565 U.S. 69]</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Cross of aggravated sexual assault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">On appeal, the Illinois Appellate Court agreed that A. S. was unavailable because \u201c[i]t is clear from her telephone conversation with her mother that she was not in the city\u201d and \u201calso evident that she was in hiding and did not want to be located.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a. The court found that the State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to locate A. S., and that the trial court had properly allowed the introduction of A. S.\u2019s cross-examined testimony from the first trial. The court, therefore, affirmed Cross\u2019 convictions and sentence. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied Cross\u2019 petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Cross argued, among other things, that the state court had unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment precludes the admission of the prior testimony of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecution made a good-faith effort to obtain the de-clarant\u2019s presence at trial. The District Court denied Cross\u2019 petition, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the Seventh Circuit, the Illinois Appellate Court was unreasonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient effort to secure A. S.\u2019s presence at the retrial. The Seventh Circuit stressed the importance of A. S.\u2019s testimony and the manner of her testimony at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">In <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 88 S. Ct. 1318, 20 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1968), we held that  \u201ca witness is not \u2018unavailable\u2019 for purposes of the . . . confrontation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 724-725, 88 S. Ct. 1318, 20 L. Ed. 2d 255. In <em>Barber, </em>we held that a witness had not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes because the</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">[565 U.S. 70]</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">State, which could have brought the witness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad testificandum, </em>had \u201cmade absolutely no effort to obtain [his] presence ... at trial\u201d apart from determining that he was serving a sentence in a federal prison. <em>Id., </em>at 723, 88 S. Ct. 1318, 20 L. Ed. 2d 255; see also <em>id., </em>at 725, 88 S. Ct. 1318, 20 L. Ed. 2d 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">We again addressed the question of witness unavailability in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Rob</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>erts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). In that case, we held, the State had discharged its \u201cduty of good-faith effort.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 75, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597. We noted that the prosecutor had spoken to the witness\u2019 mother, who reported that she had no knowledge of her daughter\u2019s whereabouts and \u201cknew of no way to reach [her] even in an emergency.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We also noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the witness\u2019 name to her parents\u2019 residence over a 4-month period prior to the trial.  \u201c \u2018The lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness,\u2019 \u201d the Court made clear, \u201c \u2018is a question of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 74, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 189, n. 22, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)). We acknowledged that there were some additional steps that the prosecutor might have taken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that \u201c[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.\u201d 448 U.S., at 75, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597. But \u201cthe great improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept of reasonableness required their execution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 76, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Appellate Court that the State conducted the requisite good-faith search for A. S. did not represent an unreasonable application of our Confrontation Clause precedents. Whether or not the state court went too far in characterizing the prosecution\u2019s efforts as \u201csuperhuman,\u201d the state court identified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and applied it in a reasonable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Seventh Circuit found that the State\u2019s efforts were inadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">[565 U.S. 71]</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">faulted the State for failing to contact \u201cA. S.\u2019s current boyfriend\u2014whom she was with just moments before the alleged assault\u2014or any of her other friends in the Chicago area.\u201d 632 F.3d, at 362. But the record does not show that any of A. S.\u2019s family members or any other persons interviewed by the State provided any reason to believe that any of these individuals had information about A. S.\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because it did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where A. S. had once been enrolled, <em>ibid., </em>but the court\u2019s own opinion observed that the information about A. S.\u2019s enrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was not \u201cnoteworthy\u201d or \u201cparticularly helpful,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>Since A. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at E-42, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the school had better information about A. S.\u2019s location than did the members of her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State\u2019s efforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve her with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testifying at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear about testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless appeared in court and had taken the stand. The State represented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to testify at the retrial as well. 632 F.3d, at 362.  We have never held that the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>must have issued a subpoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into hiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes, and the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a sexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she is willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">As we observed in <em>Roberts, </em> when a witness disappears before trial, it is always possible to think of additional steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the witness\u2019 presence, see 448 U.S., at 75, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597, but the Sixth Amendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust every avenue of inquiry,</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">[565 U.S. 72]</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">no matter how unpromising. And, more to the point,  the deferential standard of review set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) does not permit a federal court to overturn a state court\u2019s decision on the question of unavailability merely because the federal court identifies additional steps that might have been taken. Under AEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross\u2019 motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-22\"> The State\u2019s motion does not mention the investigator\u2019s March 3 visit with A. S.\u2019s mother and brother, and the record in this case does not make entirely clear when A. S. disappeared and when the State\u2019s attorney actually became aware of this fact. In any event, the parties do not dispute the facts in this case regarding the State\u2019s efforts to locate A. S. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
