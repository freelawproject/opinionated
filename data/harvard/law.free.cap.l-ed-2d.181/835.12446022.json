Latecomer to the international copyright regime launched by Berne, the United States joined the Convention in 1989. To perfect U.S. implementation of Berne, and as part of our response to the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations, Congress, in 1994, gave works enjoying copyright protection abroad the same full term of protection available to U.S. works. Congress did so in \u00a7 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which grants copyright protection to pre-existing works of Berne member countries, protected in their country of origin, but lacking protection in the United States for any of three reasons: The United States did not protect works from the country of origin at the time of publication; the United States did not protect sound recordings fixed before 1972; or the author had failed to comply with U.S. statutory formalities (formalities Congress no longer requires as prerequisites to copyright protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">The URAA accords no protection to a foreign work after its full copyright term has expired, causing it to fall into the public domain, whether under the laws of the country of origin or of this country. Works encompassed by \u00a7 514 are granted the protection they would have enjoyed had the United States maintained copyright relations with the author\u2019s country or removed formalities incompatible with Berne. Foreign authors, however, gain no credit for the protection they lacked in years prior to \u00a7 514\u2019s enactment. They therefore enjoy fewer total years of exclusivity than do their U.S. counterparts. As a consequence of the barriers to U.S. copyright protection prior to the enactment of \u00a7 514, foreign works \u201crestored\u201d to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country. To cushion the impact of their placement in protected status, Congress included in \u00a7 514 ameliorating accommodations for parties who had exploited affected works before the URAA was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Petitioners include orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">[565 U.S. 308]</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">works \u00a7 514 removed from the public domain. They maintain that the Constitution\u2019s Copyright and Patent Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8, and First Amendment both decree the invalidity of \u00a7 514. Under those prescriptions of our highest law, petitioners assert, a work that has entered the public domain, for whatever reason, must forever remain there.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>In accord with the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, we conclude that \u00a7 514 does not transgress constitutional limitations on Congress\u2019 authority. Neither the Copyright and Patent Clause nor the First Amendment, we hold, makes the public domain, in any and all cases, a territory that works may never exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Members of the Berne Union agree to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own. Berne Convention, Sept. 9, 1886, as revised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, Arts. 1, 5(1), 828 U. N. T. S. 221, 225, 231-233. Nationals of a member country, as well as any author who publishes in one of Berne\u2019s 164 member states, thus enjoy copyright protection in nations across the globe. Arts. 2(6), 3. Each country, moreover, must afford at least the minimum level of protection specified by Berne. The copyright term must span the author\u2019s lifetime, plus at least 50 additional years, whether or not the author has complied with a member state\u2019s legal formalities. Arts. 5(2), 7(1). And, as relevant here, a work must be protected abroad unless its copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is claimed or the country of origin. Art. 18(1)-(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">[565 U.S. 309]</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">A different system of transnational copyright protection long prevailed in this country. Until 1891, foreign works were categorically excluded from Copyright Act protection. Throughout most of the 20th century, the only eligible foreign authors were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights to U.S. authors and whose, works were printed in the United States. See Act of Mar. 3, 1891, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 13, 26 Stat. 1107, 1110; Patry, The United States and International Copyright Law, 40 Houston L. Rev. 749, 750 (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For domestic and foreign authors alike, protection hinged on compliance with notice, registration, and renewal formalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">The United States became party to Berne\u2019s multilateral, formality-free copyright regime in 1989. Initially, Congress adopted a \u201cminimalist ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>proach\u201d to compliance with the Convention. H. R. Rep. No. 100-609, p. 7 (1988) (hereinafter BCIA House Report). The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (BCIA), 102 Stat. 2853, made \u201conly those changes to American copyright law that [were] clearly required</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">[565 U.S. 310]</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">under the treaty\u2019s provisions,\u201d BCIA House Report, at 7. Despite Berne\u2019s instruction that member countries\u2014including \u201cnew accessions to the Union\u201d\u2014protect foreign works under copyright in the country of origin, Art. 18(1) and (4), 828 U. N. T. S., at 251, the BCIA accorded no protection for \u201cany work that is in the public domain in the United States,\u201d \u00a7 12, 102 Stat. 2860. Protection of future foreign works, the BCIA indicated, satisfied Article 18. See \u00a72(3), 102 Stat. 2853 (\u201cThe amendments made by this Act, together with the law as it exists on the date of the enactment of this Act, satisfy the obligations of the United States in adhering to the Berne Convention . . . .\u201d). Congress indicated, however, that it had not definitively rejected \u201cretroactive\u201d protection for pre-existing foreign works; instead it had punted on this issue of Berne\u2019s implementation, deferring consideration until \u201ca more thorough examination of Constitutional, commercial, and consumer considerations is possible.\u201d BCIA House Report, at 51, 52.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">[565 U.S. 311]</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">The minimalist approach essayed by the United States did not sit well with other Berne members.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While negotiations were ongoing over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexican authorities complained about the United States\u2019 refusal to grant protection, in accord with Article 18, to Mexican works that remained under copyright domestically. See Intellectual Property and International Issues, Hearings before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration, House Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 168 (1991) (statement of Ralph Oman, U.S. Register of Copyrights).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Register of Copyrights also reported \u201cquestions\u201d from Turkey, Egypt, and Austria. <em>Ibid. </em>Thailand and Russia balked at protecting</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">[565 U.S. 312]</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">U.S. works, copyrighted here but in those countries\u2019 public domains, until the United States reciprocated with respect to their authors\u2019 works. URAA Joint Hearing 137 (statement of Ira S. Shapiro, General Counsel, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)); <em>id., </em>at 208 (statement of Professor Shira Perlmutter); <em>id., </em>at 291 (statement of Jason S. Berman, Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Berne, however, did not provide a potent enforcement mechanism. The Convention contemplates dispute resolution before the International Court of Justice. Art. 33(1). But it specifies no sanctions for noncompliance and allows parties, at any time, to declare themselves \u201cnot. . . bound\u201d by the Convention\u2019s dispute resolution provision. Art. 33(2)-(3), 828 U. N. T. S., at 277. Unsurprisingly, no enforcement actions were launched before 1994. D. Gervais, The TRIPS Agreement 213, and n. 134 (3d ed. 2008). Although \u201cseveral Berne Union Members disagreed with [our] interpretation of Article 18,\u201d the USTR told Congress, the Berne Convention did \u201cnot provide a meaningful dispute resolution process.\u201d URAA Joint Hearing 137 (statement of Shapiro). This shortcoming left Congress \u201cfree to adopt a minimalist approach and evade Article 18.\u201d Karp, Final Report, Berne Article 18 Study on Retroactive United States Copyright Protection for Berne and other Works, 20 Colum.-VLA J. L. &amp; Arts 157, 172 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">The landscape changed in 1994. The Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations produced the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Agreement on Trade-Related</p>\n<p id=\"AUXei\">[565 U.S. 313]</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The United States joined both. TRIPS mandates, on pain of WTO enforcement, implementation of Berne\u2019s first 21 articles. TRIPS, Art. 9.1, 33 I. L. M. 1197, 1201 (requiring adherence to all but the \u201cmoral rights\u201d provisions of Article. The WTO gave teeth to the Convention\u2019s requirements: Noncompliance with a WTO ruling could subject member countries to tariffs or cross-sector re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>taliation. See Gervais, <em>supra, </em>at 213; 7 W. Patry, Copyright \u00a7 24:1, pp. 24-8 to 24-9 (2011). The specter of WTO enforcement proceedings bolstered the credibility of our trading partners\u2019 threats to challenge the United States for inadequate compliance with Article 18. See URAA Joint Hearing 137 (statement of Shapiro, USTR) (\u201cIt is likely that other WTO members would challenge the current U.S. implementation of Berne Article 18 under [WTO] procedures.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Congress\u2019 response to the Uruguay agreements put to rest any questions concerning U.S. compliance with Article 18. Section 514 of the URAA,  108 Stat. 4976 (codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 104A, 109(a)),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> extended copyright to works that</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">[565 U.S. 314]</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">garnered protection in their countries of origin,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but had no right to exclusivity in the United States for any of three reasons: lack of copyright relations between the country of origin and the United States at the time of publication; lack of subject-matter protection for sound recordings fixed before 1972; and failure to comply with U.S. statutory formalities <em>(e.g., </em>failure to provide notice of copyright status, or to register and renew a copyright). See \u00a7 104A(h)(6)(B)-(C).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">[565 U.S. 315]</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Works that have fallen into the public domain after the expiration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>a full copyright term\u2014either in the United States or the country of origin\u2014receive no further protection under \u00a7 514. Ibid.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Copyrights \u201crestored\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> under URAA \u00a7 514 \u201csubsist for the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted ... if the work never entered the public domain.\u201d \u00a7 104A(a)(l)(B). Prospectively, restoration places foreign works on an equal footing with their U.S. counterparts; assuming a foreign and domestic author died the same day, their works will enter the public domain simultaneously. See \u00a7 302(a) (copyrights generally expire 70 years after the author\u2019s death). Restored works, however, receive no compensatory time for the period of exclusivity they would have enjoyed before \u00a7 514\u2019s enactment, had they been protected at the outset in the United States. Their total term, therefore, falls short of that available to similarly situated U.S. works.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The URAA\u2019s disturbance of the public domain hardly escaped Congress\u2019 attention.  Section 514 imposed no liability for any use of foreign works occurring before restoration. In addition, anyone remained free to copy and use restored</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">[565 U.S. 316]</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">works for one year following \u00a7 514\u2019s enactment. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 104A(h)(2)(A). Concerns about \u00a7 514\u2019s compatibility with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause led Congress to include additional protections for \u201creliance parties\u201d\u2014 those who had, before the URAA\u2019s enactment, used or acquired a foreign work then in the public domain. See \u00a7 l04A(h)(3)-(4).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Reliance parties may continue to exploit a restored work until the owner of the restored copyright gives notice of intent to enforce\u2014either by filing with the U.S. Copyright Office within two years of restoration, or by actually notifying the reliance party. \u00a7 104A(c), (d)(2)(A)(i), and (B)(i). After that, reliance parties may continue to exploit existing copies for a grace period of one year. \u00a7 104A(d)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii). Finally, anyone who, before the URAA\u2019s enactment, created a \u201cderivative work\u201d based on a restored work may indefinitely exploit the derivation upon payment to the copyright holder of \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d to be set by a district judge if the parties cannot agree. \u00a7 104A(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">In 2001, petitioners filed this lawsuit challenging \u00a7 514. They maintain that Congress, when it passed the URAA, exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and transgressed First Amendment limitations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The District</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">[565 U.S. 317]</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Court granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Golan </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>No. Civ. 01-B-1854, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6800, 2005 WL 914754 (D Colo., Apr. 20, 2005). In rejecting petitioners\u2019 Copyright Clause argument, the court stated that Congress \u201chas historically demonstrated little compunction about removing copyrightable materials from the public domain.\u201d 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6800, [WL] at *14. The court next declined to part from \u201cthe settled rule that private censorship via copyright enforcement does not implicate First Amendment concerns.\u201d 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6800, [WL] at *17.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed in part. <em>Golan </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1179 (2007). The public domain, it agreed, was not a \u201cthreshold that Congress\u201d was powerless to \u201ctraverse in both directions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1187 (internal quotations marks omitted). But \u00a7 514, as the Court of Appeals read our decision in <em>Eldred </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>537 U.S. 186, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (2003), required further First Amendment inspection, 501 F.3d, at 1187. The measure \u201c \u2018altered the traditional contours of copyright protection,\u2019 \u201d the court said\u2014specifically, the \u201cbedrock principle\u201d that once works enter the public domain, they do not leave. <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Eldred, </em>537 U.S., at 221, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683). The case was remanded with an instruction to the District Court to address the First Amendment claim in light of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">On remand, the District Court\u2019s starting premise was uncontested: Section 514 does not regulate speech on the basis of its content; therefore the law would be upheld if \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.\u201d 611 F. Supp. 2d 1165, 1170-1171 (Colo. 2009) (quoting <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S. Ct. 2746, 105 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1989)). Summary judgment was due petitioners, the court concluded, because \u00a7 514\u2019s constriction of the public domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests: compliance with Berne,</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">[565 U.S. 318]</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">securing greater protection for U.S. authors abroad, or remediation of the inequitable treatment suffered by foreign authors whose works lacked protection in the United States. 611 F. Supp. 2d, at 1172-1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">The Tenth Circuit reversed. Deferring to Congress\u2019 predictive judgments in matters relating to foreign affairs, the appellate court held that \u00a7514 survived First Amendment scrutiny. Specifically, the court determined that the law was narrowly tailored to fit the important government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>aim of protecting U.S. copyright holders\u2019 interests abroad. 609 F.3d 1076 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">We granted certiorari to consider petitioners\u2019 challenge to \u00a7 514 under both the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment, 562 U.S. 1270, 131 S. Ct. 1600, 179 L. Ed. 2d 516 (2011), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">We first address petitioners\u2019 argument that Congress lacked authority, under the Copyright Clause, to enact \u00a7 514. The Constitution states that  \u201cCongress shall have Power . . . [t]o promote the Progress of Science ... by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their . . . Writings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. Petitioners find in this grant of authority an impenetrable barrier to the extension of copyright protection to authors whose writings, for whatever reason, are in the public domain. We see no such barrier in the text of the Copyright Clause, historical practice, or our precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application of copyright protection to works in the public domain. Symposium, Congressional Power and Limitations Inherent in the Copyright Clause, 30 Colum. J. L. &amp; Arts 259, 266 (2007). Petitioners\u2019 contrary argument relies primarily on the Constitution\u2019s confinement of a copyright\u2019s lifespan to a \u201climited Tim[e].\u201d \u201cRemoving works from the public domain,\u201d they contend, \u201cviolates the \u2018limited [t]imes\u2019 restriction</p>\n<p id=\"A9RR\">[565 U.S. 319]</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">by turning a fixed and predictable period into one that can be reset or resurrected at any time, even after it expires.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Our decision in <em>Eldred </em>is largely dispositive of petitioners\u2019 limited-time argument. There we addressed the question whether Congress violated the Copyright Clause when it extended, by 20 years, the terms of existing copyrights. 537 U.S., at 192-193, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (upholding Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA)). Ruling that Congress acted within constitutional bounds, we declined to infer from the text of the Copyright Clause \u201cthe command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever \u2018fixed\u2019 or \u2018inalterable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 199, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683. \u201cThe word \u2018limited,\u2019 \u201d we observed, \u201cdoes not convey a meaning so constricted.\u201d <em>Ibid- </em>Rather, the term is best understood to mean \u201cconfine[d] within certain bounds,\u201d \u201crestrain [ed],\u201d or \u201ccircumscribed\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The construction petitioners tender closely resembles the definition rejected in <em>Eldred. </em>and is similarly infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">The terms afforded works restored by \u00a7 514 are no less \u201climited\u201d than those the CTEA lengthened. In light of <em>Eldred, </em>petitioners do not here contend that the term Congress has granted U.S. authors\u2014their lifetimes, plus 70 years\u2014is unlimited. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 302(a). Nor do petitioners explain why terms of the same duration, as applied to foreign works, are not equally \u201ccircumscribed\u201d and \u201cconfined.\u201d See <em>Eldred, </em>537 U.S., at 199, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683. Indeed, as earlier noted, see <em>supra, </em>at 307, 315, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 843, 847-848, the copyrights of restored foreign works typically last for fewer years than those of their domestic counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The difference, petitioners say, is that the limited time had already passed for works in the public domain. What was that limited term for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>foreign works once excluded from U.S. copyright protection? Exactly \u201czero,\u201d petitioners respond. Brief for Petitioners 22 (works in question \u201creceived a specific term of protection . . . sometimes expressly set to zero\u201d; \u201cat the end of that period,\u201d they \u201centered the public domain\u201d);</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">[565 U.S. 320]</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (by \u201crefusing to provide any protection for a work,\u201d Congress \u201cset[s] the term at zero,\u201d and thereby \u201ctell[s] us when the end has come\u201d). We find scant sense in this argument, for surely a \u201climited time\u201d of exclusivity must begin before it may end.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Carried to its logical conclusion, petitioners persist, the Government\u2019s position would allow Congress to institute a second \u201climited\u201d term after the first expires, a third after that, and so on. Thus, as long as Congress legislated in installments, perpetual copyright terms would be achievable. As in <em>Eldred, </em>the hypothetical legislative misbehavior petitioners posit is far afield from the case before us. See 537 U.S., at 198-200, 209-210, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683. In aligning the United States with other nations bound by the Berne Convention, and thereby according equitable treatment to once disfavored foreign authors, Congress can hardly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a regime of perpetual copyrights.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Historical practice corroborates our reading of the Copyright Clause to permit full U.S. compliance with Berne. Undoubtedly, federal copyright legislation generally has not affected works in the public domain. Section 514\u2019s disturbance of that domain, petitioners argue, distinguishes their suit from Eldred\u2019s. In adopting the CTEA, petitioners note, Congress acted in accord with \u201can unbroken congressional practice\u201d of granting pre-expiration term extensions, 537 U.S., at 200, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683. No comparable practice, they maintain, supports \u00a7 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">On occasion, however, Congress has seen fit to protect works once freely available. Notably, the Copyright Act of 1790 granted protection to many works previously in the public domain. Act of May 31, 1790 (1790 Act), \u00a7 1, 1</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">[565 U.S. 321]</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Stat. 124 (covering \u201cany map, chart, book, or books already printed within these United States\u201d). Before the Act launched a uniform national system, three States provided no statutory copyright protection at all.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Of those that did afford some protection, seven failed to protect maps;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> eight did not cover previously published books;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and all ten denied protection to works that failed to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>with formalities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The First Congress, it thus appears, did not view the public domain as inviolate. As we have recognized, the \u201cconstruction placed upon the Constitution by [the drafters of] the first [copyright] act of 1790, and the act of 1802 . . . men who were contemporary with [the Constitution\u2019s] formation, many of whom were members of the convention which framed it, is of itself entitled to very great weight.\u201d <em>Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. </em>v. <em>Sarony, </em>111 U.S. 53, 57, 4 S. Ct. 279, 28 L. Ed. 349 (1884).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">[565 U.S. 322]</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Subsequent actions confirm that Congress has not understood the Copyright Clause to preclude protection for existing works. Several private bills restored the copyrights of works that previously had been in the public domain. See Act of Feb. 19, 1849 (Corson Act), ch. 57, 9 Stat. 763; Act of June 23, 1874 (Helmuth Act), ch. 534, 18 Stat. 618; Act of Feb. 17, 1898 (Jones Act), ch. 29, 30 Stat. 1396. These bills were unchallenged in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Analogous patent statutes, however, were upheld in litigation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In 1808, Congress passed a private bill restoring patent protection to Oliver Evans\u2019 flour mill. When Evans sued for infringement, first Chief Justice Marshall in the Circuit Court, <em>Evans </em>v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872 (No. 4,564) (Va. 1813), and then Justice Bushrod Washington for this Court, <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>9 Cranch 199, 3 L. Ed. 704 (1815), upheld the restored patent\u2019s validity. After the patent\u2019s expiration, the Court said, \u201ca general right to use [Evans\u2019] discovery was not so vested in the public\u201d as to allow the defendant to continue using the machinery, which he had constructed between the patent\u2019s expiration and the bill\u2019s passage. <em>Id., </em>at 202, 3 L. Ed. 704. See also <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>3 F. Cas. 648, 650 (No. 1,518) (CC Mass. 1839) (Story, J.) (\u201cI never have entertained any doubt of the constitutional authority of congress\u201d to \u201cgive a patent for an invention, which . . . was in public use and enjoyed by the community at the time of the passage of the act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">This Court again upheld Congress\u2019 restoration of an invention to protected status in <em>McClurg </em>v. <em>Kingsland, </em>1 How. 202, 11 L. Ed. 102(1843). There we enforced an 1839 amendment that recognized a patent on an invention despite its prior use by the inventor\u2019s employer. Absent such dispensation, the employer\u2019s use would have rendered the invention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>unpatentable,</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">[565 U.S. 323]</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">and therefore open to exploitation without the inventor\u2019s leave. <em>Id,, </em>at 206-209, 11 L. Ed. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Congress has also passed generally applicable legislation granting patents and copyrights to inventions and works that had lost protection. An 1832 statute authorized a new patent for any inventor whose failure, \u201cby inadvertence, accident, or mistake,\u201d to comply with statutory formalities rendered the original patent \u201cinvalid or inoperative.\u201d Act of July 3, \u00a7 3, 4 Stat. 559. An 1893 measure similarly allowed authors who had not timely deposited their work to receive \u201call the rights and privileges\u201d the Copyright Act affords, if they made the required deposit by March 1, 1893. Act of Mar. 3, ch. 215, 27 Stat. 743.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And in 1919 and 1941, Congress authorized the President to issue proclamations granting protection to foreign works that had fallen into the public domain during World Wars I and II. See Act of Dec. 18, 1919, ch. 11, 41 Stat. 368; Act of Sept. 25, 1941, ch. 421, 55 Stat. 732.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Pointing to dictum in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere Co. of Kansas City, </em>383 U.S. 1, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1966), petitioners would have us look past this history. In <em>Graham, </em>we stated that \u201cCongress may not authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">[565 U.S. 324]</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 6, 86 S.

But as we explained in <em>Eldred, </em>this passage did not speak to the constitutional limits on Congress\u2019 copyright and patent authority. Rather, it \u201caddressed an invention\u2019s very eligibility for patent protection.\u201d 537 U.S., at 202, n. 7, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Installing a federal copyright system and ameliorating the interruptions of global war, it is true, presented Congress with extraordinary situations. Yet the TRIPS accord, leading the United States to comply in full measure with Berne, was also a signal event. See <em>supra, </em>at 312-313, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 846-847; cf. <em>Eldred, </em>537 U.S., at 259, 264-265, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (acknowledging importance of international uniformity advanced by U.S. efforts to conform to the Berne Convention). Given the authority we hold Congress has, we will not second-guess the political choice Congress made between leaving the public domain untouched and embracing Berne unstintingly. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 212-213, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L.

Congress is empowered to \u201cpromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts\u201d by enacting systems of copyright and patent protection. U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. Perhaps counterintuitively for the contemporary reader, Congress\u2019 copyright authority is tied to the progress of science; its patent authority, to the progress of the useful arts. See <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S., at 5, and n. 1, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545; <em>Evans, </em>8 F. Cas., at 873 (Marshall, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The \u201cProgress of Science,\u201d petitioners acknowledge, refers broadly to \u201cthe creation and spread of knowledge and learning.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 21; accord <em>post, </em>at 344-345, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 866. They nevertheless argue that federal legislation cannot serve the Clause\u2019s aim unless the legislation \u201cspur[s] the creation of . . . new works.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 24; accord <em>post, </em>at 345, 351, 360, 181 L.

Because \u00a7 514 deals solely with works</p>\n<p id=\"A9ndP\">[565 U.S. 325]</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">already created, petitioners urge, it \u201cprovides no plausible incentive to create new works\u201d and is therefore invalid. Reply Brief 4.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The creation of at least one new work, however, is not the sole way Congress may promote knowledge and learning. In <em>Eldred, </em>we rejected an argument nearly identical to the one petitioners rehearse. The <em>Eldred. </em>petitioners urged that the \u201cCTEA\u2019s extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to \u2018promote the Progress of Science,\u2019. .. because it does not stimulate the creation of new works.\u201d 537 U.S., at 211-212, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683. In response to this argument, we held that the Copyright Clause does not demand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to induce new works. Rather, we explained, the Clause \u201cempowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body\u2019s judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 222, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683. And those permissible ends, we held, extended beyond the creation of new works. See <em>id., </em>at 205-206, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (rejecting the notion that \u201c \u2018the only way to promote the progress of science [is] to provide incentives to create new works\u2019 \u201d (quoting Perlmutter, Participation in the International Copyright System as a Means To Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, 36 Loyola (LA) L. Rev. 323, 332 (2002))).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Even were we writing on a clean slate, petitioners\u2019 argument would be unavailing. Nothing in the text of the Copyright</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">[565 U.S. 326]</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Clause confines the \u201cProgress of Science\u201d exclusively to \u201cincentives for creation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 324, n. 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). Evidence from the founding, moreover, suggests that inducing <em>dissemi</em>nation\u2014as opposed to creation\u2014was viewed as an appropriate means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>promote science. See Nachbar, Constructing Copyright\u2019s Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 44 (2002) (\u201cThe scope of copyright protection existing at the time of the framing,\u201d trained as it was on \u201cpublication, not creation,\u201d \u201cis inconsistent with claims that copyright must promote creative activity in order to be valid.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Until 1976, in fact, Congress made \u201cfederal copyright contingent on publication [,] [thereby] providing incentives not primarily for creation,\u201d but for dissemination. Perlmutter, <em>supra, </em>at 324, n. 5. Our decisions correspondingly recognize that  \u201ccopyright supplies the economic incentive to create <em>and disseminate </em>ideas.\u201d <em>Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nation Enterprises, </em>471 U.S. 539, 558, 105 S. Ct. 2218, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1985) (emphasis added). See also <em>Eldred, </em>537 U.S., at 206, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Considered against this backdrop, \u00a7514 falls comfortably within Congress\u2019 authority under the Copyright Clause. Congress rationally could have concluded that adherence to Berne \u201cpromotes the diffusion of knowledge,\u201d Brief for Petitioners 4. A well-functioning international copyright system would likely encourage the dissemination of existing and future works. See URAA Joint Hearing 189 (statement of Professor Perlmut-ter). Full compliance with Berne, Congress had reason to believe, would expand the foreign markets available to U.S. authors and invigorate protection against piracy of U.S. works abroad, S. Rep. No. 103-412, pp. 224, 225 (1994); URAA Joint Hearing 291 (statement of Berman, RIAA); <em>id., </em>at 244, 247 (statement of Smith, IIPA),</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">[565 U.S. 327]</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">thereby benefiting copyright intensive industries stateside and inducing greater investment in the creative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The provision of incentives for the creation of new works is surely an essential means to advance the spread of knowledge and learning. We hold, however, that it is not the sole means Congress may use \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of Science.\u201d See Perlmutter, <em>supra, </em>at 332 (United States would \u201close all flexibility\u201d were the provision of incentives to create the exclusive way to promote the progress of science).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Congress determined that exemplary adherence to Berne would serve the objectives of the Copyright Clause. We have no warrant to reject the rational judgment Congress made.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">We next explain why the First Amendment does not inhibit the restoration authorized by \u00a7 514. To do so, we first recapitulate the relevant part of our pathmarking decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>Eldred. </em>The petitioners in <em>Eldred, </em>like those here, argued that Congress had violated not only the \u201climited Times\u201d prescription of the Copyright Clause. In addition, and independently, the <em>Eldred. </em>petitioners charged, Congress had offended the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of expression guarantee. The CTEA\u2019s 20-year enlargement of a copyright\u2019s duration, we held in <em>Eldred, </em>offended neither provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Concerning the First Amendment, we recognized that some restriction on expression is the inherent and intended</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">[565 U.S. 328]</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">effect of every grant of copyright. Noting that the \u201cCopyright Clause and the First Amendment were adopted close in time,\u201d 537 U.S., at 219, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683, we observed that the Framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit on the manner in which expressive works may be used. They also saw copyright as an \u201cengine of free expression [:] By establishing a marketable right to the use of one\u2019s expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Harper &amp; Row, </em>471 U.S., at 558, 105 S.

Moreover, Congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime: It deferred the date from which enforcement runs, and it cushioned the impact of restoration on \u201creliance parties\u201d who exploited foreign works denied protection before \u00a7 514 took effect. See <em>supra, </em>at 315-316, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 847-848 (describing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 104A(c), (d), and (h)). See also <em>Eldred, </em>537 U.S., at 220, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L.

The limited rights they retain under copyright law\u2019s \u201cbuilt-in safeguards\u201d are, in their view, no substitute for the unlimited use they enjoyed before \u00a7 514\u2019s enactment. Nor, petitioners urge, does \u00a7 514\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d foray into the public domain possess the historical pedigree that supported the term extension at issue in <em>Eldred. </em>Brief for Petitioners 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">However spun, these contentions depend on an argument we considered and rejected above, namely, that the Constitution renders the public domain largely untouchable by Congress. Petitioners here attempt to achieve under the banner of the First Amendment what they could not win under the Copyright Clause: On their view of the Copyright Clause, the public domain is inviolable; as they read the First Amendment, the public domain is policed through heightened judicial scrutiny of Congress\u2019 means and ends. As we have already shown, see <em>supra, </em>at 318-327, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 850-855, the text of the Copyright Clause and the historical record scarcely establish that \u201conce a work enters the public domain,\u201d Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>cannot permit anyone\u2014\u201cnot even the creator\u2014[to] copyright it,\u201d 501 F.3d, at 1184. And nothing in the historical record, congressional practice, or our own jurisprudence warrants exceptional First Amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Neither this challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">[565 U.S. 331]</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">nor that raised in <em>Eldred, </em>we stress, allege Congress transgressed a generally applicable First Amendment prohibition; we are not faced, for example, with copyright protection that hinges on the author\u2019s viewpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The Tenth Circuit\u2019s initial opinion determined that petitioners marshaled a stronger First Amendment challenge than did their predecessors in <em>Eldred, </em>who never \u201cpossessed unfettered access to any of the works at issue.\u201d 501 F.3d, at 1193.

Brief for Petitioners 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">To copyright lawyers, the \u201cvested rights\u201d formulation might sound exactly backwards:  Rights typically vest at the <em>outset </em>of copyright protection, in an author or rightholder. See, <em>e.g., </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a) (\u201cCopyright in a work protected . . . vests initially in the author . . . .\u201d). Once the term of protection ends, the works do not re-vest in any rightholder. Instead, the works simply lapse into the public domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">[565 U.S. 332]</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">See, <em>e.g., </em>Berne, Art. 18(1), 828 U. N. T. S., at 251 (\u201cThis Convention shall apply to all works which . . . have not yet fallen into the public domain . . . .\u201d). Anyone has free access to the public domain, but no one, after the copyright term has expired, acquires ownership rights in the once-protected works.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Congress recurrently adjusts copyright law to protect categories of works once outside the law\u2019s compass. For example, Congress broke new ground when it extended copyright protection to foreign works in 1891, Act of Mar. 3, \u00a7 13, 26 Stat. 1110; to dramatic works in 1856, Act of Aug. 18, 11 Stat. 138; to photographs and photographic negatives in 1865, Act of Mar. 3, \u00a7 1, 13 Stat. 540; to motion pictures in 1912, Act of Aug. 24, 37 Stat. 488; to fixed sound recordings in 1972, Act of Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat. 391; and to architectural works in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>1990, Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act, 104 Stat. 5133. And on several occasions, as recounted above, Congress protected works previously in the public domain, hence freely usable by the public. See <em>supra, </em>at 320-324, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 851-853. If Congress could grant protection to these works without hazarding heightened First Amendment scrutiny, then what free speech principle disarms it from protecting works prematurely cast into the public domain for reasons antithetical to the Berne Convention?<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">Section 514, we add, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.

The question here, as in <em>Eldred, </em>is whether would-be users must pay for their desired use of the author\u2019s expression, or else limit their exploitation to \u201cfair use\u201d of that work. Prokofiev\u2019s Peter and the Wolf could once be performed free of charge; after \u00a7514 the right to perform it must be obtained in the marketplace. This is the same marketplace, of course, that exists for the music of Prokofiev\u2019s U.S. contemporaries: works of Copland and Bernstein, for example, that enjoy copyright protection, but nevertheless appear regularly in the programs of U.S. concertgoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Before we joined Berne, domestic works and some foreign works were protected under U.S. statutes and bilateral international agreements, while other foreign works were available at an artificially low (because royalty-free) cost. By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that most works, whether foreign or domestic, would be governed by the same legal regime. The phenomenon to which Congress responded is not new: Distortions of the same order occurred with greater frequency\u2014and to the detriment of both foreign and domestic authors\u2014when, before 1891, foreign works were excluded entirely from U.S. copyright protection. See Kampelman, The United States and International Copyright, 41 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 406, 413 (1947) (\u201cAmerican readers were less inclined to read the novels of Cooper or Hawthorne</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">[565 U.S. 334]</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">for a dollar when they could buy a novel of Scott or Dickens for a quarter.\u201d). Section 514 continued the trend toward a harmonized copyright regime by placing foreign works in the position they would have occupied if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>the current regime had been in effect when those works were created and first published. Authors once deprived of protection are spared the continuing effects of that initial deprivation; \u00a7 514 gives them nothing more than the benefit of their labors during whatever time remains before the normal copyright term expires.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Unlike petitioners, the dissent makes much of the so-called \u201corphan works\u201d problem. See <em>post, </em>at 354-357, 366-367, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 872-874, 879-880. We readily acknowledge the difficulties would-be users of copyrightable materials may face in identifying or locating copyright owners. See generally U.S. Copyright Office, Report on Orphan Works 21-40 (2006). But as the dissent concedes, see <em>post, </em>at 357, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 873-874, this difficulty is hardly peculiar to works restored under \u00a7 514. It similarly afflicts, for instance, U.S. libraries that attempt to catalogue U.S. books. See <em>post, </em>at 355-356, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 872-873. See also Brief for American Library Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>22 (Section 514 \u201cexacerbated,\u201d but did not create, the problem of orphan works); U.S. Copyright Office, <em>supra, </em>at 41-44 (tracing orphan-works problem to Congress\u2019 elimination of formalities, commencing with the 1976 Copyright Act).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Nor is this a matter appropriate for judicial, as opposed to legislative, resolution.

Despite \u201clongstanding efforts,\u201d see <em>Authors Guild, </em>770 F. Supp. 2d, at 678 (quoting statement of Marybeth Peters), Congress has not yet passed ameliorative orphan-works legislation of the sort enacted by other Berne members, see, <em>e.g., </em>Canada Copyright Act, R. S. C., 1985, c. C-42, \u00a7 77 (authorizing Copyright Board to license use of orphan works by persons unable, after making reasonable efforts, to locate the copyright owner). Heretofore, no one has suggested that the orphan-works issue could be addressed through our implementation of Berne, rather than through overarching legislation of the sort proposed in Congress and cited by the dissent. See <em>post, </em>at 366-367, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 879-880; U.S. Copyright Office, Legal Issues in Mass Digitization 25-29 (2011) (discussing recent legislative efforts). Our unstinting adherence to Berne may add impetus to calls for the enactment of such legislation. But resistance to Berne\u2019s prescriptions surely is not a necessary or proper response to the pervasive question, what should Congress do about orphan works.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Congress determined that U.S. interests were best served by our full participation in the dominant system of international copyright protection.

In this sense, a copyright is, in Macaulay\u2019s words, a \u201ctax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers\u201d\u2014a bounty designed to encourage new production. As the Court said in <em>Eldred, </em>\u201c \u2018 [t]he economic philosophy behind the [Copyright] [C]lause ... is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eldred </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>537 U.S. 186, 212, n. 18, 123 S.

Miller ed. 1913); E. Waltersc-heid, The Nature of the Intellectual Property Clause: A Study in Historical Perspective 125-126 (2002) (hereinafter Walterscheid).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The statute before us, however, does not encourage anyone to produce a single new work. By definition, it bestows monetary rewards only on owners of old works\u2014works that have already been created and already are in the American public domain. At the same time, the statute inhibits the dissemination of those works, foreign works published abroad after 1923, of which there are many millions, including films, works of art, innumerable photographs, and, of course, books\u2014books that (in the absence of the statute) would assume their rightful places in computer-accessible databases, spreading knowledge throughout the world. See <em>infra, </em>at 354-357, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 872-874. In my view, the Copyright Clause does not authorize Congress to enact this statute. And I consequently dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">The possibility of eliciting new production is, and always has been, an essential precondition for American copyright protection. The Constitution\u2019s words, \u201cexclusive Right,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">[565 U.S. 346]</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">\u201climited Times,\u201d \u201cProgress of Science,\u201d viewed through the lens of history underscore the legal significance of what the Court in <em>Eldred. </em>referred to as the \u201ceconomic philosophy behind the Copyright Clause.\u201d 537 U.S., at 212, n. 18, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (brackets omitted). That philosophy understands copyright\u2019s grants of limited monopoly privileges to authors as private benefits that are conferred for a public reason\u2014to elicit new creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Yet, as the Founders recognized, monopoly is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it can encourage production of new works. In the absence of copyright protection, anyone might freely copy the products of an author\u2019s creative labor, appropriating the benefits without incurring the nonrepeatable costs of creation, thereby deterring authors from exerting themselves in the first place. On the other hand, copyright tends to restrict the dissemination (and use) of works once produced either because the absence of competition translates directly into higher consumer prices or because the need to secure copying permission sometimes imposes administrative costs that make it difficult for potential users of a copyrighted work to find its owner and strike a bargain. See W. Landes &amp; R. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 68-70, 213-214 (2003). Consequently, the original British copyright statute, the Constitution\u2019s Framers, and our case law all have recognized copyright\u2019s resulting and necessary call for balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">At the time the Framers wrote the Constitution, they were well aware of Britain\u2019s 18th-century copyright statute, the Statute of Anne, 8 Anne, ch. 19 (1710), and they were aware of the legal struggles that produced it. That statute sought in part to control, and to limit, pre-existing monopolies that had emerged in the book trade as a result of the Crown\u2019s having previously granted special privileges to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>royal favorites. The Crown, for example, had chartered the Stationers\u2019 Company, permitting it to regulate and to censor</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">[565 U.S. 347]</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">works on the government\u2019s behalf. The Stationers had thereby acquired control over the disposition of copies of published works, from which emerged the Stationers\u2019 copyright a right conferred on company members, not authors, that was deemed to exist in perpetuity. See L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspective 1-16, 114-150 (1968) (hereinafter Patterson); Walterscheid 59-65; <em>Gomez-Arostegui, </em>The Untold Story of the First Copyright Suit Under the Statute of Anne in 1710, 25 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 1247, 1250-1256 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">To prevent the continuation of the booksellers\u2019 monopoly and to encourage authors to write new books, Parliament enacted the Statute of Anne. It bore the title: \u201cAn Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned.\u201d And it granted authors (not publishers) and their assignees the \u201csole Right and Liberty of printing\u201d their works for limited periods of time <em>in order to encourage them \u201cto compose and write useful Books.\u201d </em>8 Anne, ch. 19, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). As one historian has put it: \u201cThe central plank of the . . . Act was ... a cultural <em>quid-pro quo. </em>To encourage \u2018learned Men to compose and write useful Books\u2019 the state would provide a guaranteed, if temporally limited, right to print and reprint those works.\u201d Deazley, The Myth of Copyright at Common Law, 62 Camb. L. J. 106, 108 (2003). At first, in their attempts to minimize their losses, the booksellers argued that authors had a perpetual common-law copyright in their works deriving from their natural rights as creators. But the House of Lords ultimately held in <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>1 Eng. Rep. 837 (1774), that the Statute of Anne had transformed any such perpetual common-law copyright into a copyright of a limited term designed to serve the public interest. Patterson 15-16, 153, 158-179; Deazley, <em>supra, </em>at 114-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Many early colonial copyright statutes, patterned after the Statute of Anne, also stated that copyright\u2019s objective was</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">[565 U.S. 348]</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">to encourage authors to produce new works and thereby improve learning. See U.S. Copyright Office, Copyright Enactments, Bulletin No. 3, pp. 1, 6, 10, 11, 17, 19 (rev. 1963) (statutes of Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Georgia, and New York); Walter-scheid 74-75; Bracha, The Adventures of the Statute of Anne in the Land of Unlimited Possibilities: The Life of a Legal Transplant, 25 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 1427, 1444-1450 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">At least, that was the predominant view expressed to, or by, the Founders. Patterson 93. Thomas Jefferson, for example, initially expressed great uncertainty as to whether the Constitution should authorize the grant of copyrights and patents at all, writing that \u201cthe benefit even of limited monopolies is too doubtful\u201d to warrant anything other than their \u201csuppression\u201d Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956). James Madison also thought that \u201cMonopolies . . . are justly classed among the greatest nu[i]sances in Government.\u201d Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 <em>id-., </em>at 16, 21 (J. Boyd ed. 1958). But he argued that \u201cin certain cases\u201d such as copyright, monopolies should \u201cbe granted\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>(\u201cwith caution, and guarded with strictness agst abuse\u201d) to serve as \u201ccompensation <em>for a benefit actually gained to the community ... </em>which the owner might otherwise withhold from public use.\u201d Monopolies. Perpetuities. Corporations. Ecclesiastical Endowments., in J. Madison, Writings 756 (J. Rakove ed. 1999) (emphasis added). Jefferson eventually came to agree with Madison, supporting a limited conferral of monopoly rights but only <em>\u201cas an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility.\u201d </em>Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13, 1813), in 6 Papers of Thomas Jefferson, at 379, 383 (J. Looney ed. 2009) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">This utilitarian view of copyrights and patents, embraced by Jefferson and Madison, stands in contrast to the \u201cnatural</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">[565 U.S. 349]</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">rights\u201d view underlying much of continental European copyright law\u2014a view that the English booksellers promoted in an effort to limit their losses following the enactment of the Statute of Anne and that in part motivated the enactment of some of the colonial statutes. Patterson 158-179, 183-192. Premised on the idea that an author or inventor has an inherent right to the fruits of his labor, it mythically stems from a legendary 6th-century statement of King Diarmed \u201c \u2018to every cow her calf, and accordingly to every book its copy.\u2019 \u201d A. Birrell, Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copyright in Books 42 (1899). That view, though perhaps reflected in the Court\u2019s opinion, <em>ante, </em>at 334, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 859-860, runs contrary to the more utilitarian views that influenced the writing of our own Constitution\u2019s Copyright Clause. See S. Ricketson, The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works: 1886-1986, pp. 5-6 (1987) (The first French copyright laws \u201cplaced authors\u2019 rights on a more elevated basis than the Act of Anne had done,\u201d on the understanding that they were \u201csimply according formal recognition to what was already inherent in the 'very nature of things\u2019 \u201d); S. Stewart, International Copyright and Neighbouring Rights 6-7 (2d ed. 1989) (describing the European system of <em>droit d\u2019auteur).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">This utilitarian understanding of the Copyright Clause has long been reflected in the Court\u2019s case law. In <em>Mazer, </em>for example, the Court refers to copyright as embodying the view that <em>\u201cencouragement of individual effort by personal gain </em>is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.\u201d 347 U.S., at 219, 74 S. Ct. 460, 98 L. Ed. 630 (emphasis added). In <em>Twentieth Century Music Corp. </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>422 U.S. 151, 95 S. Ct. 2040, 45 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1975), the Court says that underlying copyright is the understanding that <em>\u201cfcjreative work is to be encouraged and. rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.\u201dId., </em>at 156, 95 S. Ct. 2040, 45 L. Ed. 2d 84 (emphasis added). And in <em>Sony Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Universal City</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">[565 U.S. 350]</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\"><em>Studios, Inc., </em>464 U.S. 417, 104 S. Ct. 774, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1984), the Court, speaking of both copyrights and patents, points out that the \u201cmonopoly privileges that Congress may authorize are . . . [not] primarily designed to provide a special private benefit. Rather, the limited grant is a means by which an important public purpose may be achieved. It is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors ... by the provision of a special reward.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 429, 104 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>774, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (emphasis added); see also, <em>e.g., Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere Co. of Kansas City, </em>383 U.S. 1, 6, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1966) (The \u201cconstitutional command . . . \u2018[to] promote the Progress [of Science]\u2019... is the <em>standard </em>expressed in the Constitution and it may not be ignored\u201d); <em>Fox Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Doyal, </em>286 U.S. 123, 127, 52 S. Ct. 546, 76 L. Ed. 1010 (1932) (\u201cThe sole interest of the United States . . . lie [s] in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Congress has expressed similar views in congressional Reports on copyright legislation. Thus, for example, an 1892 House Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-5\">\u201cThe object to be attained and the reason for the constitutional grant of power are imbedded in the grant itself. They are \u2018to promote the progress of science and the useful arts.\u2019 . . . [The Clause says] nothing . . . about any desire or purpose to secure to the author or inventor his \u2018natural right to his property.\u2019 \u201d H. R. Rep. No. 1494, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Similarly, the congressional authors of the landmark 1909 Copyright Act wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">\u201cThe Constitution . . . provides that Congress shall have the power to grant [copyrights] . . . [n]ot primarily for the benefit of the author . . . but because the policy is believed to be for the benefit of the great body of people, in that it will stimulate writing and invention, to give some bonus to authors and inventors.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">[565 U.S. 351]</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">And they went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">\u201cCongress must consider . . . two questions: First, how much will the legislation stimulate the producer and so benefit the public; and, second, how much will the monopoly granted be detrimental to the public? The granting of such exclusive rights, under the proper terms and conditions, confers a benefit upon the public that outweighs the evils of the temporary monopoly.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">The upshot is that text, history, and precedent demonstrate that the Copyright Clause places great value on the power of copyright to elicit new production. Congress in particular cases may determine that copyright\u2019s ability to do so outweighs any concomitant high prices, administrative costs, and restrictions on dissemination. And when it does so, we must respect its judgment. See <em>Eldred, </em>537 U.S., at 222, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683. But does the Clause empower Congress to enact a statute that withdraws works from the public domain, brings about higher prices and costs, and in doing so seriously restricts dissemination, particularly to those who need it for scholarly, educational, or cultural purposes\u2014all <em>without providing any additional incentive </em>for the production of new material? That is the question before us. And, as I have said, I believe the answer is no. Congress in this statute has exceeded what are, under any plausible reading of the Copyright Clause, its permissible limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">The Act before us says that it \u201crestores\u201d American copyright to a set of works, which, for the most part, did not previously enjoy American copyright protection. These works had fallen into America\u2019s public domain, but as of the \u201crestoration\u201d date, they had not yet fallen into the public domain of the foreign country where they originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\">[565 U.S. 352]</p>\n<p id=\"b971-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>The statute covers works originating almost anywhere outside the United States. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 104A(h)(3) (setting out eligibility criteria); U.S. Copyright Office, Circular No. 38A: International Copyright Relations of the United States (2010). The relevant set of works consists primarily of works originating abroad that did not obtain, or at some point lost, American copyright protection because (1) the author failed to comply with applicable American copyright formalities (such as notice or renewal), or (2) the nation in which they were first published then lacked copyright relations with the United States, or (3) they are sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972. \u00a7 104A(h)(6)(C). Awork must also satisfy other technical requirements: It must have had a rightholder who was a national or resident of an eligible country on the day it was created; and it cannot have been published in the United States within 30 days of its first publication. \u00a7 104A(h)(6)(D). The Act grants these works a copyright that expires at the time it would have expired had the author obtained a full American copyright term starting from the date on which the work was first published (in the foreign country). \u00a7 104A(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">The Act mainly applies to works first published abroad between 1923 and 1989. It does not apply significantly to earlier works because any work published before 1921 would have fallen into the public domain before 1977 had it received a full American copyright term, while works published between 1921 and 1923 obtained a \u201crestored\u201d copyright that expired before the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, and so could have lasted two years at most. See Tit. I, \u00a7 101, 90 Stat. 2574 (extending the copyright term of works still under copyright in 1977 to 75 years); 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 304(b) (extending the copyright term of works still under copyright in 1998 to 95 years). It has less impact on more recent works because in 1989 the United States became a Berne member, abolished the copyright notice requirement, and thenceforth provided prospective copyright protection</p>\n<p id=\"AZNkb\">[565 U.S. 353]</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">throughout the Berne Union. See R. Schech-ter &amp; J. Thomas, Intellectual Property: The Law of Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks 75-77 (2003); \u00a7 7, 102 Stat. 2857-2858 (codified as amended at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-406).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Despite these temporal limitations, the Act covers vast numbers of works. The first category includes works published in countries that had copyright relations with the United States during this time period, such as most of Western Europe and Latin America, Australia, and Japan, see Circular No. 38A, at 2-10, whose authors did not satisfy American copyright formalities, perhaps because the author, who may not have sought an American copyright, published the book abroad without proper American notice, or perhaps because the author obtained a valid American copyright but failed to renew it.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The second category (works that entered the public domain due to a lack of copyright relations) includes, among others, all works published in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union before May 1973 (when the U.S.S.R. joined the Universal Copyright Convention (UCO), all works published in the People\u2019s Republic of China before March 1992 (when bilateral copyright relations between the People\u2019s Republic and the United States were first estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>lished), all South Korean works published before October 1987 (when South Korea joined the UCC), and all Egyptian and Turkish works published before March 1989 (when the United States joined Berne). See <em>id., </em>at 2-10, and 11, nn. 2, 5, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The third category covers all sound recordings from eligible foreign countries published after February 15, 1972. The practical significance of federal copyright restoration to this category of works is less clear, since these works received, and continued to receive, copyright protection under state law. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Apparently there are no precise figures about the number of works the Act affects, but in 1996 the then-Register of</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">[565 U.S. 354]</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Copyrights, Marybeth Peters, thought that they \u201cprobably number in the millions.\u201d The Year in Review: Accomplishments and Objectives of the U.S. Copyright Office, 7 Ford. Intellectual Property Media &amp; Entertainment L. J. 25, 31 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">The provision before us takes works from the public domain, at least as of January 1, 1996. See \u00a7 104A(h)(2)(A) (setting \u201crestoration\u201d dates). It then restricts the dissemination of those works in two ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">First, \u201crestored copyright\u201d holders can now charge fees for works that consumers previously used for free. The price of a score of Shostakovich\u2019s Preludes and Fugues Op. 87, for example, has risen by a multiple of seven. Brief for Conductors Guild et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11. And, as the Court recognizes, an orchestra that once could perform \u201cPeter and the Wolf . . . free of charge\u201d will now have to buy the \u201cright to perform it ... in the marketplace.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 333, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 859. But for the case of certain \u201cderivative\u201d works, \u00a7 104A(d)(3), the \u201crestored copyright\u201d holder, like other copyright holders, can charge what the market will bear. If a school orchestra or other nonprofit organization cannot afford the new charges, so be it. They will have to do without\u2014aggravating the already serious problem of cultural education in the United States. See Brief for Conductors Guild et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>4-5, 7-8 (describing the inability of many orchestras to pay for the rental of sheet music covered by \u201crestored copyright[s]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Second, and at least as important, the statute creates administrative costs, such as the costs of determining whether a work is the subject of a \u201crestored copyright,\u201d searching for a \u201crestored copyright\u201d holder, and negotiating a fee. Congress has tried to ease the administrative burden of contacting copyright holders and negotiating prices for those whom the statute calls \u201creliance part[ies],\u201d namely those who previously had used such works when they were freely available</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">[565 U.S. 355]</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">in the public domain. \u00a7 104A(h)(4). But Congress has done nothing to ease the administrative burden of securing permission from copyright owners that is placed upon those who want to use a work that they did not previously use, and this is a particular problem when it comes to \u201corphan works\u201d\u2014older and more obscure works with minimal commercial value that have copyright owners who are difficult or impossible to track down. Unusually high administrative costs threaten to limit severely the distribution and use of those works\u2014works which, despite their characteristic lack of economic value, can prove culturally invaluable.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>There are millions of such works. For example, according to European Union figures, there are 13 million orphan books in the European Union (13% of the total number of books in copyright there), 225,000 orphan films in European film archives, and 17 million orphan photographs in United Kingdom museums. A. Vuo-pala, Assessment of the Orphan Works Issue and Costs for Rights Clearance 19, 25 (2010), online at http:// ec. europa. eu/infor mation_ society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/ reports_orphan/anna_report.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 13, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). How is a university, a film collector, a musician, a database compiler, or a scholar now to obtain permission to use any such lesser known foreign work previously in the American public domain? Consider the questions that any such individual, group, or institution usually must answer: Is the work eligible for restoration under the statute? If so, who now holds the copyright\u2014the author? an heir? a publisher? an association? a long-lost cousin? Whom must we contact? What is the address? Suppose no one answers? How do we conduct a negotiation?</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">To find answers to these, and similar, questions costs money. The cost to the University of Michigan and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, for example, to determine the copyright status of books contained in the HathiTrust Digital Library that were published in the</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">[565 U.S. 356]</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">United States from 1923 to 1963 will exceed $ 1 million. Brief for American Library Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>15.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">It is consequently not surprising to learn that the Los Angeles Public Library has been unable to make its collection of Mexican folk music publicly available because of problems locating copyright owners, that a Jewish cultural organization has abandoned similar efforts to make available Jewish cultural music and other materials, or that film preservers, museums, universities, scholars, database compilers, and others report that the administrative costs associated with trying to locate foreign copyright owners have forced them to curtail their cultural, scholarly, or other work-preserving efforts. See, <em>e.g., </em>Comments of the Library Copyright Alliance in Response to the U.S. Copyright Office\u2019s Inquiry on Orphan Works 5 (Mar. 25, 2005), online at http://www.arl.org./bm~/doc/ lcacomment0305.pdf; Comments of Creative Commons and Save The Music in Response to the U.S. Copyright Office\u2019s Inquiry on Orphan Works (Mar. 25, 2005), online at http:// www.copyright.gov/orphan/comments/ OW0643-STM-Creative Commons.pdf; General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): Intellectual Property Provisions, Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration of the House Committee on the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 131, 273 (1994) (hereinafter Joint Hearing) (statement of Larry Urbanski, Chairman of the Fairness in Copyright Coalition and President of Moviecraft, Inc.); Brief for American Library Association et al. as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>6-23; Brief for Creative Commons Corp. as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>7-8; Brief for Project Petrucci, LLC, as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">These high administrative costs can prove counterproductive in an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>other way. They will tempt some potential users to \u201csteal\u201d or \u201cpirate\u201d works rather than do without. And</p>\n<p id=\"AQQm9\">[565 U.S. 357]</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">piracy often begets piracy, breeding the destructive habit of taking copyrighted works without paying for them, even where payment is possible. Such habits ignore the critical role copyright plays in the creation of new works, while reflecting a false belief that new creation appears by magic without thought or hope of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">I recognize that ordinary copyright protection also comes accompanied with dissemination-restricting royalty charges and administrative costs. But here the restrictions work special harm. For one thing, the foreign location of restored works means higher than ordinary administrative costs. For another, the statute\u2019s technical requirements make it very difficult to establish whether a work has had its copyright restored by the statute. Gard, In the Trenches With \u00a7 104A: An Evaluation of the Parties\u2019 Arguments in <em>Golan </em>v. <em>Holder </em>as It Heads to the Supreme Court, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 199, 216-220 (2011) (describing difficulties encountered in compiling the information necessary to create an online tool to determine whether the statute applies in any given case).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Worst of all, \u201crestored copyright\u201d protection removes material from the public domain. In doing so, it reverses the payment expectations of those who used, or intended to use, works that they thought belonged to them. Were Congress to act similarly with respect to well-established property rights, the problem would be obvious. This statute analogously restricts, and thereby diminishes, Americans\u2019 pre-existing freedom to use formerly public domain material in their expressive activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Thus, while the majority correctly observes that the dissemination-restricting harms of copyright normally present problems appropriate for legislation to resolve, <em>ante, </em>at 334-335, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 859-860, the question is whether the Copyright Clause permits Congress seriously to exacerbate such a problem by</p>\n<p id=\"ARuOs\">[565 U.S. 358]</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">taking works out of the public domain without a countervailing benefit. This question is appropriate for judicial resolution. Indeed, unlike <em>Eldred </em>where the Court had to decide a complicated line-drawing question\u2014 when is a copyright term too long?\u2014 here an easily administrable standard is available\u2014a standard that would require works that have already fallen into the public domain to stay there.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">The several, just mentioned features of the present statute are important, for they distinguish it from other copyright laws. By removing material from the public domain, the statute, in literal terms, \u201cabridges\u201d a preexisting freedom to speak. In practical terms, members of the public might well have decided what to say, as well as when and how to say it, in part by reviewing with a view to repeating, expression that they reasonably believed was, or would be, freely available. Given these speech implications, it is not surprising that Congress has long sought to protect public domain material when revising the copyright laws. See <em>infra, </em>at 362, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 877 (listing instances). And this Court has assumed the particular importance of public domain material in roughly analogous circumstances. See <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S., at 6, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (\u201cCongress may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain\u201d); <em>Kewanee Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Bicron Corp., </em>416 U.S. 470, 484, 94 S. Ct. 1879, 40 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1974) (trade secret protection is not incompatible with \u201cpolicy that matter once in the public domain must remain in the public domain\u201d); <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 496, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1975) (First Amendment prohibits sanctioning press for publishing material disclosed in public court documents); see also <em>Dastar Corp. </em>v. <em>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., </em>539 U.S. 23, 33, 123 S. Ct. 2041, 156 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2003) (\u201cThe right to copy . . . once a copyright has expired . . . passes to the public\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Moreover, whereas forward-looking copyright laws tend to benefit those whose identities are not yet known (the writer who has not yet written a book, the musician who has not</p>\n<p id=\"AZYGv\">[565 U.S. 359]</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">yet composed a song), when a copyright law is primarily backward looking the risk is greater that Congress is trying to help known beneficiaries at the expense of badly organized unknown users who find it difficult to argue and present their case to Congress. In <em>Eldred, </em>I thought this problem was severe. See generally 537 U.S., at 243-266, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (dissenting opinion). And in light of the fact that Congress, with one minor exception, heard testimony only from the representatives of existing copyright holders, who hoped that passage of the statute would enable them to benefit from reciprocal treatment of American authors abroad, <em>infra, </em>at 364-365, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 878-879, I cannot say that even here the problem, while much diminished, was nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">I agree with the majority that, in doing so, this statute does not discriminate among speakers based on their viewpoints or subject matter. <em>Ante, </em>at 330-331, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 857-858. But such considerations do not exhaust potential First Amendment problems. Cf. <em>Sorrell </em>v. <em>IMS Health Inc., </em>564 U.S. 552, 566, 131 S. Ct. 2653; 180 L. Ed. 2d 544 (2011) (finding First Amendment problem in statute that prohibits drug manufacturers from using publicly available prescriber-identifying information in their marketing efforts in part because it \u201cdisfavor [ed] specific speakers\u201d); <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>512 U.S. 622, 659, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 129 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1994) (\u201cRegulations that discriminate among media, or among different speakers within a single medium, often present serious First Amendment concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Taken together, these speech-related harms <em>(e.g., </em>restricting use of previously available material; reversing payment expectations; rewarding rent-seekers at the public\u2019s expense) at least show the presence of a First Amendment interest. And that is enough. For present purposes, I need not decide whether the harms to that interest show a violation of the First Amendment. I need only point to the importance of interpreting the Constitution as a single document\u2014a document that we should not read as setting the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment at cross-purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">[565 U.S. 360]</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Nor need I advocate the application here of strict or specially heightened review. I need only find that the First Amendment interest is important enough to require courts to scrutinize with some care the reasons claimed to justify the Act in order to determine whether they constitute reasonable copyright-related justifications for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>serious harms, including speech-related harms, which the Act seems likely to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">This statute does not serve copyright\u2019s traditional public ends, namely the creation of monetary awards that \u201cmotivate the creative activity of authors,\u201d <em>Sony, </em>464 U.S., at 429, 104 S. Ct. 774, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574, \u201cencourag[e] individual effort,\u201d <em>Mazer, </em>347 U.S., at 219, 74 S. Ct. 460, 98 L. Ed. 630, and thereby \u201cserve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts,\u201d <em>Twentieth Century Music, </em>422 U.S., at 156, 95 S. Ct. 2040, 45 L. Ed. 2d 84. The statute grants its \u201crestored copyright[s]\u201d <em>only </em>to works <em>already produced. </em>It provides no monetary incentive to produce anything new. Unlike other American copyright statutes from the time of the Founders onwards, including the statute at issue in <em>Eldred, </em>it lacks any significant copyright-related <em>quid, pro quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The majority seeks to avoid this awkward fact by referring to past congressional practice that mostly suggests that Congress may provide new or increased protection <em>both </em>to newly created <em>and. </em>to previously created works. <em>Ante, </em>at 320-321, 323, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 851-852, 852; Act of May 31, 1790, \u00a7 1, 1 Stat. 124 (conferring its new federal copyright on new works as well as old); Act of July 3, 1832, \u00a7 3, 4 Stat. 559 (authorizing new patents for past and future inventors who inadvertently failed to comply with applicable statutory formalities); <em>McClurg </em>v. <em>Kingsland, </em>1 How. 202, 11 L. Ed. 102 (1843) (applying an act deeming a past or future inventor\u2019s patent valid despite it being briefly used by, for example, the inventor\u2019s employer). I do not dispute</p>\n<p id=\"A2q57\">[565 U.S. 361]</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">that copyright power. Insofar as such a statute does the former, i.e., extends protection to newly created material, it embodies copyright\u2019s traditional justification\u2014eliciting new production. And I do not doubt that Congress may then also include existing works within the scope of, say, increased protection for equitable and administrative reasons. See <em>Eldred, </em>537 U.S., at 204, 214-215, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (describing equitable reasons for applying newly extended copyright terms to future and existing copyrights alike). The statute before us, however, does not directly elicit any new production. Compare <em>id., </em>at 204-208, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (majority opinion) (noting that statute\u2019s extended term would apply to newly created material, and finding that the determination of the likelihood of its eliciting new production in practice was a matter for Congress to determine), with <em>id., </em>at 243-267, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that there is little likelihood, in practice, that the statute would elicit new material). See also Walterscheid 219 (the 1790 Congress likely thought it was substituting federal protection for pre-existing state common-law protections); Maher, Copyright Term, Retrospective Extension, and the Copyright Law of 1790 in Historical Context, 49 J. Copyright Soc. USA 1021, 1023-1024, and n. 8 (2002) (numerical estimate suggesting that 1790 Act removed only a small number of books from public domain).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">The other statutes to which the majority refers are private bills, statutes retroactively granting protection in wartime, or the like. <em>Ante, </em>at 320-323, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 851-853; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Act of Feb. 19, 1849, ch. 57, 9 Stat. 763 (Levi Corson); Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 534, 18 Stat., pt. 3, p. 618 (Tod Helmuth); Act of Feb. 17, 1898, ch. 29, 30 Stat. 1396 (Judson Jones); Act of Dec. 18, 1919, ch. 11, 41 Stat. 368; Act of Sept. 25, 1941, ch. 421, 55 Stat. 732; see also <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>9 Cranch 199, 3 L. Ed. 704 (1815) (upholding a private bill restoring patent protection to a flour mill). But special circumstances, like wars, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters, prevent the realization in practice of a reasonable expectation of securing or maintaining a pre-existing right.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">[565 U.S. 362]</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Private bills are designed to provide special exceptions for comparable equitable reasons. See also Act of Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 215, 27 Stat. 743 (similar, as far as I can tell). To find in these laws an important analogy to the present law, which for the most part covers works that the author did not expect to protect in America (and often did not particularly want to protect), seems somewhat farfetched.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">In fact, congressional practice shows the contrary. It consists of a virtually unbroken string of legislation preventing the withdrawal of works from the public domain. See, <em>e.g., </em>Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, \u00a7 12, 102 Stat. 2860 (the Act \u201cdoes not provide copyright protection for any work that is in the public domain in the United States\u201d); Copyright Act of 1976, Tit. I, \u00a7 101, 90 Stat. 2573 (declining to extend copyright protection to any work that is in the public domain prior to the Act taking effect); Copyright Act of 1909, \u00a77, 35 Stat. 1077 (\u201c[N]o copyright shall subsist in the original text of any work which is in the public domain, or in any work which was published in this country or any foreign country prior to the going into effect of this Act and has not been already copyrighted in the United States\u201d); Act to Amend the Several Acts Respecting Copy Rights \u00a7 16, 4 Stat. 439 (the Act \u201cshall not extend to any copyright heretofore secured, the term of which has already expired\u201d); see also H. R. Rep. No. 1742, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1962) (expressing concern that because \u201cit is not possible to revive expired terms of copyright, it seems to the committee to be desirable to suspend further expiration of copyright for a period long enough to enable the working out of remaining obstacles to the overall revision of the copyright law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The majority makes several other arguments. First, it argues that the Clause does not require the \u201ccreation of at least one new work,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 325, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 854, but may instead \u201cpromote the Progress of Science\u201d in other ways. And it specifically</p>\n<p id=\"AEuh\">[565 U.S. 363]</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">mentions the \u201cdissemination of existing and future works\u201d as determinative <em>here. Ante, </em>at 324-327, and n. 25, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 853-855. The industry experts to whom the majority refers argue that copyright protection of already existing works can help, say, music publishers or film distributers raise prices, produce extra profits, and consequently lead them to publish or distribute works they might otherwise have ignored. But ordinarily a copyright\u2014since it is <em>a monopoly </em>on copy<em>ing\u2014restricts </em>dissemination of a work once produced compared to a competitive market. And simply making the industry richer does not mean that the industry, when it makes an ordinary <em>forward-looking </em>economic calculus, will distribute works not previously distributed. The industry experts might mean that temporary extra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>profits will lead them to invest in the development of a market, say, by advertising. But this kind of argument, which can be made by distributers of all sorts of goods, ranging from kiwi fruit to Swedish furniture, has little if anything to do with the nonrepeatable costs of initial creation, which is the special concern of copyright protection. See <em>supra, </em>at 346, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 867-868.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Moreover, the argument proves too much. It is the kind of argument that the Stationers\u2019 Company might well have made and which the British Parliament rejected. Cf. Patterson 154-155 (describing failed booksellers\u2019 bill seeking protection from foreign competition through an extension of the copyright term). It is the kind of argument that could justify a legislature\u2019s withdrawing from the public domain the works, say, of Hawthorne or of Swift or for that matter the King James Bible in order to encourage further publication of those works; and, it could even more easily justify similar action in the case of lesser known early works, perhaps those of the Venerable Bede. The Court has not, to my knowledge, previously accepted such a rationale\u2014a rationale well removed from the special economic circumstances that surround the nonrepeatable costs of the initial creation of a \u201cWriting.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>at 346, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 867. And I fear that doing so would</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">[565 U.S. 364]</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">read the Copyright Clause as if it were a blank check made out in favor of those who are not themselves creators.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">It is not surprising that the copyright holders\u2019 representatives who appeared before Congress did not emphasize this argument. (With one minor exception only those representatives appeared, see generally Joint Hearing; the Copyright Office did not testify, <em>id., </em>at 239.) Rather, they focused on the Berne Convention itself. By that time, Congress had already protected all <em>new </em>works of Berne members. But it had not provided additional protection to pre-existing foreign works that were then in the American public domain. Industry witnesses testified that withdrawing such works from the American public domain would permit foreign copyright owners to charge American consumers more for their products; and that, as a result, the United States would be able to persuade foreign countries to allow American holders of pre-existing copyrights to charge foreign customers more money for their products. See <em>id., </em>at 241 (statement of Eric Smith, Executive Director and General Counsel, International Intellectual Property Alliance) (\u201c[F]ailure to [comply with Article 18] will . . . undermine the ability of the United States to press other countries to implement the same sort of protection in their implementing legislation currently pending in many legislatures around the globe\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 253 (statement of Matt Gerson, Vice President for Congressional Affairs, Motion Picture Assn, of America) (similar). See also <em>id., </em>at 85 (statement of Xavier Becerra, House Judiciary Committee member) (\u201c[R]etroactivity ... is probably the best way to ensure that some of our older American works, anything from Motown, to \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 to \u2018The Hardy Boys\u2019 get the protection in some of these emerging foreign markets. It is important to ensure that countries no longer use our U.S. law as an excuse for not extending retroactive copyright protections to some of our own works\u201d). But see <em>id., </em>at 272-279 (statement of Larry Urbanski, Chairman of the Fairness in Copyright Coalition and President of Mov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>iecraft</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">[565 U.S. 365]</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Inc.) (testifying against restoration on grounds similar to those set out, <em>supra, </em>at 354-357, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 872-874).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">This argument, whatever its intrinsic merits, is an argument that directly concerns a private benefit: how to obtain more money from the sales of existing products. It is not an argument about a public benefit, such as how to promote or to protect the creative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Third, the majority points out that the statute \u201cgives [authors] nothing more than the benefit of their labors during whatever time remains before the normal copyright term expires.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 334, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 860. But insofar as it suggests that copyright should in general help authors obtain greater monetary rewards than needed to elicit new works, it rests upon primarily European, but not American, copyright concepts. See <em>supra, </em>at 348-349, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 868-869.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Fourth, the majority argues that this statutory provision is necessary to fulfill our Berne Convention obligations. <em>Ante, </em>at 309-313, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 844-847. The Treaty, in Article 18, says that the \u201cConvention shall apply to all works which, at the moment of its coming into force [i.e., 1989 in the case of the United States] have not yet fallen into the public domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of protection\u201d Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Art. 18(1), Sept. 9, 1886, as revised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, 828 U. N. T. S. 221, 251. The majority and Government say that this means we must protect the foreign works at issue here. And since the Berne Convention, taken as a whole, provides incentives for the creation of new works, I am willing to speculate, for argument\u2019s sake, that the statute might indirectly encourage production of new works by making the United States\u2019 place in the international copyright regime more secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Still, I cannot find this argument sufficient to save the statute. For one thing, this is a dilemma of the Government\u2019s own making. The United States obtained the benefits of Berne for many years despite its failure to enact a statute</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">[565 U.S. 366]</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">implementing Article 18. But in 1994, the United States and other nations signed the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which enabled signatories to use World Trade Organization dispute resolution mechanisms to complain about other members\u2019 Berne Convention violations. And at that time the Government, although it successfully secured reservations protecting other special features of American copyright law, made no effort to secure a reservation permitting the United States to keep some or all restored works in the American public domain. Indeed, it made no effort to do so despite the fact that Article 18 explicitly authorizes countries to negotiate exceptions to the Article\u2019s retroactivity principle. See Art. 18(3), <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cThe application of [the retroactivity] principle <em>shall be subject to any provisions contained in special conventions to that effect </em>existing or to be concluded between countries of the Union\u201d (emphasis added)); Gervais, <em>Golan </em>v. <em>Holder: A </em>Look at the Constraints Imposed by the Berne Convention, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 147, 151-152 (2011); Gard, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc, at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>For another thing, the Convention does not require Congress to enact a statute that causes so much damage to public domain material. Article 18(3) also states that \u201cthe respective countries shall determine, each in so far as it is concerned, <em>the conditions of application of this principle.\u201d </em>18 U. N. T. S., at 251 (emphasis added). Congress could have alleviated many of the costs that the statute imposes by, for example, creating forms of compulsory licensing, requiring \u201crestored copyright\u201d holders to provide necessary administrative information as a condition of protection, or insisting upon \u201creasonable royalties.\u201d Cf. S. 2913, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (legislation that would have limited judicial remedies against users of orphan works); H. R. 5889, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (House version of same); American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, http:// www. ascap. com/licensing/termsdefin ed.aspx (society of</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">[565 U.S. 367]</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">music copyright owners offering blanket licenses that give users the unlimited right to perform any of its members\u2019 songs for a fixed fee, thus reducing negotiation and enforcement costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">To say this is not to criticize the Convention or our joining it. Rather, it is to argue that the other branches of Government should have tried to <em>follow </em>the Convention and in particular its provisions offering compliance flexibility. The fact that the statute has significant First Amendment costs is relevant in this respect, for that Amendment ordinarily requires courts to evaluate less restrictive, alternative possibilities. Doing so here reveals that neither Congress nor the Executive took advantage of less restrictive methods of compliance that the Convention itself provides. And that fact means that the Convention cannot provide the statute with a constitutionally sufficient justification that is otherwise lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">The fact that, by withdrawing material from the public domain, the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow of information is sufficient, when combined with the other features of the statute that I have discussed, to convince me that the Copyright Clause, interpreted in the light of the First Amendment, does not authorize Congress to enact this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
