See generally <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 389, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971) (\u201c[V]iolation of [the Fourth Amendment] by a federal agent. . . gives rise to a cause of action for damages\u201d against a Federal Government employee). Because we believe that in the circumstances present here state tort law authorizes adequate alternative damages actions\u2014actions that provide both significant deterrence and compensation\u2014we cannot do so. See <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>551 U.S. 537, 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2D 389 (2007) (no <em>Bivens </em>action</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">[565 U.S. 121]</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">where \u201calternative, existing\u201d processes provide adequate protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Richard Lee Pollard was a prisoner at a federal facility operated by a private company, the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation. In 2002 he filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in federal court against several Wackenhut employees, who (now) include a security officer, a food-services supervisor, and several members of the medical staff. As the Federal Magistrate Judge interpreted Pollard\u2019s complaint, he claimed that these employees had deprived him of adequate medical care, had thereby violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment, and had caused him injury. He sought damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Pollard said that a year earlier he had slipped on a cart left in the doorway of the prison\u2019s butcher shop. The prison medical staff took X rays, thought he might have fractured both elbows, brought him to an outside clinic for further orthopedic evaluation, and subsequently arranged for surgery. In particular, Pollard claimed:</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">(1) Despite his having told a prison guard that he could not extend his arm, the guard forced him to put on a jumpsuit (to travel to the outside clinic), causing him \u201cthe most excruciating pain,\u201d App. 32;</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">(2) During several visits to the outside clinic, prison guards made Pollard wear arm restraints that were connected in a way that caused him continued pain;</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">(3) Prison medical (and other) personnel failed to follow the outside clinic\u2019s instructions to put Pollard\u2019s left elbow in a posterior splint, failed to provide necessary physical therapy, and failed to conduct necessary studies, including nerve conduction studies;</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">(4) At times when Pollard\u2019s arms were in casts or similarly disabled, prison officials failed to make alternative arrangements for him to receive meals, with the result that (to avoid \u201cbeing humiliated\u201d in the general food service area, <em>id., </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">[565 U.S. 122]</p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">35) Pollard had to auction off personal items to obtain funds to buy food at the commissary;</p>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">(5) Prison officials deprived him of basic hygienic care to the point where he could not bathe for two weeks;</p>\n<p id=\"b710-20\">(6) Prison medical staff provided him with insufficient medicine, to the point where he was in pain and could not sleep; and</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>(7) Prison officials forced him to return to work before his injuries had healed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">After concluding that the Eighth Amendment did not provide for a <em>Bivens </em>action against a privately managed prison\u2019s personnel, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the District Court dismiss Pollard\u2019s complaint. The District Court did so. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit found that the Eighth Amendment provided Pollard with a <em>Bivens </em>action, and it reversed the District Court. <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>The GEO Group, Inc., </em>607 F.3d 583, 603, as amended, 629 F.3d 843, 868 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The defendants sought certiorari. And, in light of a split among the Courts of Appeals, we granted the petition. Compare <em>ibid, </em>(finding an Eighth Amendment <em>Bivens </em>action where prisoner sues employees of a privately operated federal prison) with, <em>e.g., Alba </em>v. <em>Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1254-1256 (CA11 2008) (no <em>Bivens </em>action available), and <em>Holly </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>434 F.3d 287, 288 (CA4 2006) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Recently, in <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Robbins, supra, </em>we rejected a claim that the Fifth Amendment impliedly authorized a <em>Bivens </em>action that would permit landowners to obtain damages from government officials who unconstitutionally interfere with their exercise of property rights. After reviewing the Court\u2019s earlier <em>Bivens </em>cases, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201c[T]he decision whether to recognize a <em>Bivens </em>remedy may require two steps. In the first place, there is the question whether any alternative, existing process for</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ard34\">[565 U.S. 123]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">protecting the [constitutionally recognized] interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages. . . . But even in the absence of an alternative, a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is a subject of judgment: \u2018the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed, however, to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.\u2019 \u201d 551 U.S., at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389 (quoting <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 378, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1983)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">These standards seek to reflect and to reconcile the Court\u2019s reasoning set forth in earlier cases. In <em>Bivens </em>itself the Court held that the Fourth Amendment implicitly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents\u2019 violation of the Amendment\u2019s constitutional strictures. 403 U.S., at 389, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. The Court noted that \u201c \u2018where federally protected rights have been invaded,\u2019 \u201d courts can \u201c \u2018adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 392, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (quoting <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946)). See also <em>Correctional Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 66, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2001) (\u201cauthority to imply a new constitutional tort\u201d anchored within general \u201c \u2018arising under\u2019 \u201d jurisdiction). It pointed out that the Fourth Amendment prohibited, among other things, conduct that state law might permit (such as the conduct at issue in that very case). <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S., at 392-393, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. It added that the interests pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>tected on the one hand by state \u201ctrespass\u201d and \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d laws and on the other hand by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantees \u201cmay be inconsistent or even hostile.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 394, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. It stated that \u201c[h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 395, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. And it found \u201cno special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 396, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">[565 U.S. 124]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846 (1979), the Court considered a former congressional employee\u2019s claim for damages suffered as a result of her employer\u2019s unconstitutional discrimination based on gender. The Court found a damages action implicit in the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>Id.., </em>at 248-249, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846. In doing so, the Court emphasized the unavailability of \u201cother alternative forms of judicial relief.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 245, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846. And the Court noted that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Congress (or the Constitution) intended to foreclose such a remedy. <em>Id., </em>at 247, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1980), the Court considered a claim for damages brought by the estate of a federal prisoner who (the estate said) had died as the result of Government officials\u2019 \u201cdeliberat[e] indifferen[ce]\u201d to his medical needs\u2014indifference that violated the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>at 16, n. 1, 17, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (citing <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)). The Court implied an action for damages from the Eighth Amendment. 446 U.S., at 17-18, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15. It noted that state law offered the particular plaintiff no meaningful damages remedy. I<em>d., </em>at 17, n. 4, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15. Although the estate might have brought a damages claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the defendant in any such lawsuit was the employer, namely, the United States, not the individual officers who had committed the violation. <em>Id., </em>at 21, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15. A damages remedy against an individual officer, the Court added, would prove a more effective deterrent. <em>Ibid. </em>And, rather than leave compensation to the \u201cvagaries\u201d of state tort law, a federal <em>Bivens </em>action would provide \u201cuniform rules.\u201d 446 U.S., at 23, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Since <em>Carlson, </em>the Court has had to decide in several different instances whether to imply a <em>Bivens </em>action. And in each instance it has decided against the existence of such an action. These instances include:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">(1)A federal employee\u2019s claim that his federal employer dismissed him in violation of the First Amendment, <em>Bush, supra, </em>at 386-388, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed. 2d 648 (congressio-nally created federal civil service procedures provide meaningful redress);</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">[565 U.S. 125]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">(2) A claim by military personnel that military superiors violated various constitutional provisions, <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 298-300, 103 S. Ct. 2362, 76 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1983) (special factors related to the military counsel against implying a <em>Bivens </em>action), see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>483 U.S. 669, 683-684, 107 S. Ct. 3054, 97 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1987) (similar);</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">(3) A claim by recipients of Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Security disability benefits that benefits had been denied in violation of the Fifth Amendment, <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Chilicky, </em>487 U.S. 412, 414, 425, 108 S. Ct. 2460, 101 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1988) (elaborate administrative scheme provides meaningful alternative remedy);</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">(4) A former bank employee\u2019s suit against a federal banking agency, claiming that he lost his job due to agency action that violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, <em>FDIC </em>v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 484-486, 114 S. Ct. 996, 127 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1994) (no <em>Bivens </em>actions against government agencies rather than particular individuals who act unconstitutionally);</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">(5) A prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment-based suit against a private corporation that managed a federal prison, <em>Malesko, </em>534 U.S., at 70-73, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (to permit suit against the employer-corporation would risk skewing relevant incentives; at the same time, the ability of a prisoner to bring state tort law damages action against <em>private </em>individual defendants means that the prisoner does not \u201clack effective remedies,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 72, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Although the Court, in reaching its decisions, has not always similarly emphasized the same aspects of the cases, <em>Wilkie </em>fairly summarizes the basic considerations that underlie those decisions. 551 U.S., at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389. We consequently apply its approach here. And we conclude that Pollard cannot assert a <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">That is primarily because Pollard\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim focuses upon a kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law. And in the case of a privately employed defendant, state tort law provides an \u201calternative, existing process\u201d capable of protecting the constitutional interests at stake. 551 U.S., at 550, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389. The</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">[565 U.S. 126]</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">existence of that alternative here constitutes a \u201cconvincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Our reasoning is best understood if we set forth and explain why we reject Pollard\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Pollard (together with supporting <em>amici) </em>asks us to imply a <em>Bivens </em>action for four basic reasons\u2014none of which we find convincing. First, Pollard argues that this Court has already decided in <em>Carlson </em>that a federal prisoner may bring an Eighth Amendment-based <em>Bivens </em>action against prison personnel; and we need do no more than simply apply <em>Carlson\u2019s </em>holding here. <em>Carlson, </em>however, was a case in which a federal prisoner sought damages from personnel employed by the <em>government, </em>not personnel employed by a <em>private </em>firm. 446 U.S., at 25, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15. And for present purposes that fact\u2014of employment status\u2014makes a critical difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">For one thing, the potential existence of an adequate \u201calternative, existing process\u201d differs dramatically in the two sets of cases. Prisoners ordinarily <em>cannot </em>bring state-law tort actions against employees of the Federal Government. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671, 2679(b)(1) (Westfall Act) (substituting United States as defendant in tort action against federal employee); <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>549 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>225, 238, 241, 127 S. Ct. 881, 166 L. Ed. 2d 819 (2007) (Westfall Act immunizes federal employee through removal and substitution of United States as defendant). But prisoners ordinarily <em>can </em>bring state-law tort actions against employees of a private firm. <em>Infra, </em>at 128-129, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 615-616.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">For another thing, the Court specifically rejected Justice Stevens\u2019 somewhat similar suggestion in his dissenting opinion in <em>Malesko, </em>namely, that a prisoner\u2019s suit against a private prison-management firm should fall within <em>Carlson\u2019s </em>earlier holding because such a firm, like a federal employee, is a \u201cfederal agent.\u201d Compare <em>Malesko, </em>534 U.S., at 70, and n. 4, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (majority opinion), with <em>id., </em>at 76-77, 82, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">[565 U.S. 127]</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In rejecting the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the Court explained that the context in <em>Malesko </em>was \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from the contexts at issue in earlier cases, including <em>Carlson. </em>534 U.S., at 70, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456. That difference, the Court said, reflected in part the nature of the defendant, <em>i.e., </em>a corporate employer rather than an individual employee, <em>ibid.., </em>and in part reflected the existence of alternative \u201ceffective\u201d state tort remedies, <em>id., </em>at 72-73, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456. This last-mentioned factor makes it difficult to square Pollard\u2019s argument with Malesko\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Second, Pollard argues that, because of the \u201cvagaries\u201d of state tort law, <em>Carlson, </em>446 U.S., at 23, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15, we should consider only whether <em>federal </em>law provides adequate alternative remedies. See <em>id., </em>at 18-19, 23, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (considering adequacy of federal remedies); see also, <em>e.g., Schweiker, supra, </em>at 423, 108 S. Ct. 2460, 101 L. Ed. 2d 370 (similar); <em>Bush, </em>462 U.S., at 378, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed. 2d 648 (similar). But cf. <em>Carlson, supra, </em>at 24, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (\u201c \u2018[Relevant Indiana statute would not permit survival of the [state tort] claim\u2019 \u201d). This argument flounders, however, on the fact that the Court rejected it in <em>Malesko. </em>Compare 534 U.S., at 72-73, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (majority opinion), with <em>id., </em>at 79-80, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (making similar suggestion). State tort law, after all, can help to deter constitutional violations as well as to provide compensation to a violation\u2019s victim. And it is consequently unsurprising that several cases have considered the adequacy or inadequacy of state-law remedies when determining whether to imply a <em>Bivens </em>remedy. See, <em>e.g., Bivens, </em>403 U.S., at 394, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (state tort law \u201cinconsistent or even hostile\u201d to Fourth Amendment); <em>Davis, </em>442 U.S., at 245, n. 23, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846 (noting no state-law remedy available); cf. <em>Malesko, supra, </em>at 70, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (noting that the Court has implied <em>Bivens </em>action only where any alternative remedy against individual officers was \u201cnonexistent\u201d or where plaintiff \u201clacked <em>any alternative remedy\u201d </em>at all).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Third, Pollard argues that state tort law does not provide remedies <em>adequate </em>to protect the constitutional interests at issue here. Pollard\u2019s claim, however, is a claim for physical</p>\n<p id=\"AU3p\">[565 U.S. 128]</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">or related emotional harm suffered as a result of aggravated instances of the kind of conduct that state tort law typically forbids. That claim arose in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>California, where state tort law provides for ordinary negligence actions, for actions based upon \u201cwant of ordinary care or skill,\u201d for actions for \u201cnegligent failure to diagnose or treat,\u201d and for actions based upon the failure of one with a custodial duty to care for another to protect that other from \u201c \u2018unreasonable risk of physical harm.\u2019 \u201d See Cal.

App. 4th 231, 248,</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">[565 U.S. 129]</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 371, 384 (2008) (quoting <em>Haworth </em>v. <em>State, </em>60 Haw. 557, 563, 592 P.2d 820, 824 (1979)). California courts have specifically applied this law to jailers, including private operators of prisons. <em>Giraldo, supra, </em>at 252, 85 Cal.Rptr. 3d, at 387 (\u201c[JJailers owe prisoners a duty of care to protect them from foreseeable harm\u201d); see also <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>180 Cal. App. 4th 1372, 1389-1390, 1397, 103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 834, 849-850, 855 (2010) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Moreover, California\u2019s tort law basically reflects general principles of tort law present, as far as we can tell, in the law of every State. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 314A(4), 320 (1963-1964). We have found specific authority indicating that state law imposes general tort duties of reasonable care (including medical care) on prison employees in every one of the eight States where privately managed secure federal facilities are currently located. See Dept, of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Weekly Population Report (Dec 22, 2011), http ://www.bop. gov/locations/ weekly_report.jsp (listing States) (as visited Dec. 29, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>105 Ga.

Rptr. 3d, at 384 (California, same); <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Russell, </em>224 Miss. 96, 105, 79 So. 2d 528, 531 (1955) (Mississippi, same); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Albuquerque, </em>96 N.M. 433, 438, 631 P.2d 728, 733 (App. 1981) (New Mexico, <em>same); Multiple Claimants </em>v. <em>North Carolina Dept. of Health and Human Servs., </em>176 N.C.

App. 2008) (Texas, same); see also Schellenger, 14 A.L.R.2d 353, \u00a7 2[a] (Later Case Service and Supp. 2011) (same). But cf. Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-46-9(1)(m) (Supp. 2011) (statute forbidding such actions against state\u2014though not private\u2014employees); N. Y. Corree. Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a724 (West 2003), 121 (2011 Cum. Supp.) (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">We note, as Pollard points out, that state tort law may sometimes prove less generous than would a <em>Bivens </em>action, say, by capping damages, see Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a7 3333.2(b) (West 1997), or by forbidding recovery for emotional suffering unconnected with physical harm, see 629 F.3d, at 864, or by imposing procedural obstacles, say, initially requiring the use of expert administrative panels in medical malpractice cases, see, <em>e.g., </em>Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 24, \u00a7 2853 (Supp. 2010); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 231, \u00a7 60B (West 2010). But we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>find in this fact sufficient basis to determine state law inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">State-law remedies and a potential <em>Bivens </em>remedy need not be perfectly congruent. See <em>Bush, supra, </em>at 388, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed. 2d 648 (administrative remedies adequate even though they \u201cdo not provide complete relief\u2019). Indeed, federal law as well as state law contains limitations. Prisoners bringing federal lawsuits, for example, ordinarily may not seek damages for mental or emotional injury unconnected with physical injury. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). And <em>Bivens </em>actions, even if more generous to plaintiffs in some respects, may be less generous</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">[565 U.S. 130]</p>\n<p id=\"AAUOG\">in others. For example, to show an Eighth Amendment violation a prisoner must typically show that a defendant acted, not just negligently, but with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994). And a <em>Bivens </em>plaintiff, unlike a state tort law plaintiff, normally could not apply principles of <em>respondeat superior </em>and thereby obtain recovery from a defendant\u2019s potentially deep-pocketed employer. See <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 676, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Rather, in principle, the question is whether, in general, state tort law remedies provide roughly similar incentives for potential defendants to comply with the Eighth Amendment while also providing roughly similar compensation to victims of violations. The features of the two kinds of actions just mentioned suggest that, in practice, the answer to this question is \u201cyes.\u201d And we have found nothing here to convince us to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Fourth, Pollard argues that there \u201cmay\u201d be similar kinds of Eighth Amendment claims that state tort law does not cover. But Pollard does not convincingly show that there are such cases. Compare Brief for Respondent Pollard 32 (questioning the availability of state tort remedies for \u201cprisoners [who] suffer attacks by other inmates, preventable suicides, or the denial of heat, ventilation or movement\u201d) with <em>Giraldo, supra, </em>at 248-249, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 384-385 (courts have long held that prison officials must protect, <em>e.g., </em>transgender inmate from foreseeable harm by other inmates), and Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 314A(4), 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Regardless, we concede that we cannot prove a negative or be totally certain that the features of state tort law relevant here will universally prove to be, or remain, as we have described them. Nonetheless, we are certain enough about the shape of present law as applied to the kind of case before us to leave different cases and different state laws to another day. That is to say, we can decide whether to imply a <em>Bivens </em>action in a case where an Eighth Amendment claim or state law differs significantly from those at issue here</p>\n<p id=\"AQs0J\">[565 U.S. 131]</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">when and if such a case arises. The possibility of such a different future case does not provide sufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">For these reasons,  where, as here, a federal prisoner seeks damages from privately employed personnel working at a privately operated federal prison, where the conduct allegedly amounts to a violation of the Eighth Amendment, and where that conduct is of a kind that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law (such as the conduct involving improper medical care at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>here), the prisoner must seek a remedy under state tort law. We cannot imply a <em>Bivens </em>remedy in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"ApIO\">The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed,</p>\n<p id=\"AtY5L\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b717-4\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b717-5\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"AjkGC\">with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">I join the opinion of the Court because I agree that a narrow interpretation of the rationale of <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971), would not cause the holding of that case to apply to the circumstances of this case. Even if the narrowest rationale of <em>Bivens </em>did apply here, however, I would decline to extend its holding. <em>Bivens </em>is \u201ca relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action\u201d by constitutional implication. <em>Correctional Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 75, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring); see also <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>551 U.S. 537, 568, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring). We have abandoned that power in the statutory field, see <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 287, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001), and we should do the same in the constitutional field, where (presumably) an imagined \u201cimplication\u201d cannot even be repudiated by Congress. As I have previously stated, see <em>Malesko, supra, </em>at 75, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456, I would limit <em>Bivens </em>and its two follow-on cases <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Passman, </em>442</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">[565 U.S. 132]</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">U.S. 228, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L. Ed. 2d 846 (1979), and <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1980)) to the precise circumstances that they involved.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b717-10\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"AH2g\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Were Pollard incarcerated in a federal- or state-operated facility, he would have a federal remedy for the Eighth Amendment violations he alleges. See <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1980) <em>(Bivens </em>action); <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action). For the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion I joined in <em>Correctional Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 75-83, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2001) (opinion of Stevens, J.), I would not deny the same character of relief to Pollard, a prisoner placed by federal contract in a privately operated prison. Pollard may have suffered \u201caggravated instances\u201d of conduct state tort law forbids, <em>ante, </em>at 128, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 614 (opinion of the Court), but that same aggravated conduct, when it is engaged in by official actors,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> also offends the Federal Constitution, see <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S., at 105-106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251. Rather than remitting Pollard to the \u201cvagaries\u201d of state tort law, <em>Carlson, </em>446 U.S., at 23, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15, I would hold his injuries, sustained while serving a federal sentence, \u201ccompensable according to uniform rules of federal law,\u201d <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>403 U.S. 388, 409, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Indeed, there is stronger cause for providing a federal remedy in this case than there was in <em>Malesko. </em>There, the question presented was whether a <em>Bivens </em>action lies against a private corporation that manages a facility housing federal prisoners. 534 U.S., at 63, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456. Suing a corporate employer, the majority observed in <em>Malesko, </em>would not serve to deter individual officers from conduct transgressing constitutional limitations on their authority. <em>Id., </em>at 70-71, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">[565 U.S. 133]</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Individual deterrence, the Court reminded, was the consideration central to the <em>Bivens </em>decision. <em>Malesko, </em>534 U.S., at 70, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456. Noting the availability of state tort remedies, the majority in <em>Malesko </em>declined to \u201cexten[d] <em>Bivens </em>beyond [that decision\u2019s] core premise,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>deterring individual officers. <em>Id., </em>at 71-73, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456. Pollard\u2019s case, in contrast, involves <em>Bivens\u2019 </em>core concern: His suit seeking damages directly from individual officers would have precisely the deterrent effect the Court found absent in <em>Malesko.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">For the reasons stated, I would hold that relief potentially available under state tort law does not block Pollard\u2019s recourse to a federal remedy for the affront to the Constitution he suffered. Accordingly, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-13\"> The Ninth Circuit ruled that petitioners acted under color of federal law, <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>The GEO Group, Inc., </em>629 F.3d 843, 854 (2010), and petitioners did not seek this Court\u2019s review of that determination, see Brief for Petitioners 37, n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
