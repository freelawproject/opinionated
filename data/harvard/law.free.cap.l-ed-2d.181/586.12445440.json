In their applications they agreed to be bound by a provision which read: \u201cAny claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) at any time arising from or relating to your Account, any transferred balances or this Agreement (collectively, \u2018Claims\u2019), upon the election of you or us, will be resolved by binding arbitration . . . .\u201d App. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">In 2008, respondents filed a class-action complaint against Compu-Credit and Columbus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging, as relevant here, violations of the CROA. The claims largely involved the defendants\u2019 allegedly misleading representation that the credit card could be used to rebuild poor credit and their assessment of multiple fees upon opening of the accounts, which greatly reduced the advertised credit limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">The District Court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of the claims, concluding that \u201cCongress intended claims under the CROA to be non-arbitrable.\u201d 617 F. Supp. 2d 980, 988 (2009). A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, Judge Tashima dissenting. 615 F.3d 1204 (2010). We granted certiorari, 563 U.S. 973, 131 S. Ct. 2874, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1187 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b692-22\">The background law governing the issue before us is the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>enacted in 1925 as a response to judicial hostility to arbitration. <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC </em>v. <em>Concepcion, </em>563 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>333, 339, 131 S. Ct. 1740, 179 L. Ed. 2d 742 (2011). As relevant here, the FAA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">\"A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">[565 U.S. 98]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">This provision establishes \u201ca liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S. Ct. 927, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1983). See also, <em>e.g., Concepcion, supra, </em>at 339, 131 S. Ct. 1740, 179 L. Ed. 2d 742; <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 25, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991). It requires courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate according to their terms. See <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 221, 105 S. Ct. 1238, 84 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1985). That is the case even when the claims at issue are federal statutory claims, unless the FAA\u2019s mandate has been \u201coverridden by a contrary congressional command.\u201d <em>Shearson / American Express Inc. </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>482 U.S. 220, 226, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987). See also <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 628, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985). Respondents contend that the CROA contains such a command.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">That statute regulates the practices of credit repair organizations, defined as certain entities that offer services for the purpose of \u201c(i) improving any consumer\u2019s credit record, credit history, or credit rating; or (ii) providing advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to any activity or service described in clause (i).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679a(3). In its principal substantive provisions, the CROA prohibits certain practices, \u00a7 1679b, establishes certain requirements for contracts with consumers, \u00a7 1679d, and gives consumers a right to cancel, \u00a7 1679e. Enforcement is achieved through the Act\u2019s provision of a private cause of action for violation, \u00a7 1679g, as well as through federal and state administrative enforcement, \u00a7 1679h.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Like the District Court and the Ninth Circuit, respondents focus on the CROA\u2019s disclosure and nonwaiver provisions.  The former, which is reproduced in full in the Appendix, <em>infra, </em>sets forth a statement that the credit repair organization</p>\n<p id=\"AdqSX\">[565 U.S. 99]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">must provide to the consumer before any contract is executed. \u00a7 1679c(a). One sentence of that required statement reads, \u201c \u2018You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act.\u2019 \u201d The Act\u2019s nonwaiver provision states, \u201cAny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of the consumer under this sub-chapter\u2014(1) shall be treated as void; and (2) may not be enforced by any Federal or State court or any other person.\u201d \u00a7 1679f(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">The Ninth Circuit adopted the following line of reasoning, urged upon us by respondents here: The disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>sure provision gives consumers the \u201cright to sue,\u201d which \u201cclearly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.\u201d 615 F.3d, at 1208. Because the nonwaiver provision prohibits the waiver of \u201cany right of the consumer under this subchapter,\u201d the arbitration agreement\u2014which waived the right to bring an action in a court of law\u2014cannot be enforced. <em>Id., </em>at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The flaw in this argument is its premise: that the disclosure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an action in a court of law. It does not. Rather, it imposes an obligation on credit repair organizations to supply consumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation marks) in the statute. The only consumer right it creates is the right to receive the statement, which is meant to describe the consumer protections that the law <em>elsewhere </em>provides. The statement informs consumers, for instance, that they can dispute the accuracy of information in their credit file and that \u201c \u2018 [t] lie credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information.\u2019 \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679c(a). That description is derived from \u00a7 1681i(a), which sets out in great detail the procedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event of challenges to the accuracy of its information. Similarly, the required statement informs consumers that they may \u201c \u2018cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it\u2019 \u201d\u2014the right created</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">[565 U.S. 100]</p>\n<p id=\"ASL1C\">and set forth in more detail in \u00a7 1679e. And  the \u201cright to sue\u201d language describes the consumer\u2019s right to enforce the credit repair organization\u2019s \u201cliab [ility] \u201d for \u201cfail[ure] to comply with any provision of this sub-chapter\u201d provided for in \u00a7 1679g(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, our interpretation does not \u201c [r]educ[e] the required disclosure to insignificance,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 115, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 603. The disclosure provision informs consumers of their right to enforce liability for <em>any </em>failure to conform to the statute\u2014information they might otherwise not possess. It is the dissent\u2019s interpretation that effectively reduces a portion of the CROA to a nullity. Interpreting the \u201cright to sue\u201d language in \u00a7 1679c(a) to \u201ccreate\u201d a right to sue in court not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section that is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of rights created elsewhere; it also renders the creation of the \u201cright to sue\u201d elsewhere superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Respondents suggest that the CROA\u2019s civil-liability provision, \u00a7 1679g (set forth in full in the Appendix, <em>infra), </em>demonstrates that the Act provides consumers with a \u201cright\u201d to bring an action in court. They cite the provision\u2019s repeated use of the terms \u201caction,\u201d \u201cclass action,\u201d and \u201ccourt\u201d\u2014 terms that they say call to mind a judicial proceeding. These references cannot do the heavy lifting that respondents assign them.  It is utterly commonplace for statutes that create civil causes of action to describe the details of those causes of action, including the relief available, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>in the context of a court suit. If the mere formulation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were sufficient to establish the \u201ccontrary</p>\n<p id=\"Al1zP\">[565 U.S. 101]</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">congressional command\u201d overriding the FAA, <em>McMahon, </em>482 U.S., at 226, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185, valid arbitration agreements covering federal causes of action would be rare indeed. But that is not the law. In <em>Gilmer </em>we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) which read, in part: \u201cAny person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c)(1). In <em>McMahon </em>we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act which read, in part: \u201cAny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit.. ..\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). And in <em>Mitsubishi Motors </em>we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by a provision of the Clayton Act which read, in part: \u201c[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a). Thus,  we have repeatedly recognized that contractually required arbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription of civil liability in court. See <em>Gilmer, </em>500 U.S., at 28, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26; <em>McMahon, supra, </em>at 240, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185; <em>Mitsubishi Motors, </em>473 U.S., at 637, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444. To be sure, none of the statutes described above contained a nonwaiver provision, as the statute before us does. But if a cause-of-action provision mentioning judicial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial enforcement, the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is not the waiver of a \u201cright of the consumer,\u201d \u00a7 1679f(a). It takes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">[565 U.S. 102]</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">provision as a \u201ccongressional command\u201d that the FAA shall not apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Moreover,  if one believes that \u00a7 1679g\u2019s contemplation of court suit (combined with \u00a7 1679f(a)) establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement, one must also believe that it establishes a non-waivable right to initial judicial enforcement in <em>any </em>competent judicial tribunal, since it contains no limitation. We think it clear, however, that this mere \u201ccontemplation\u201d of suit in any competent court does <em>not guarantee </em>suit in all competent courts, disabling the parties from adopting a reasonable forum-selection clause. And just as the contemplated availability of all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by contrac - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>tual specification, so also can the contemplated availability of judicial action be limited to judicial action compelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication. The parties remain free to specify such matters, so long as the <em>guarantee </em>of \u00a7 1679g\u2014the <em>guarantee of the legal power to impose liabil</em>ity\u2014is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Respondents and the dissent maintain that if the CROA does not create a right to a judicial forum, then the disclosure provision effectively requires that credit repair organizations mislead consumers. We think not.  The disclosure provision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a manner that is concise and comprehensible to the lay-man\u2014 which necessarily means that it will be imprecise. The required statement says, for example, that the CROA \u201c \u2018prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations,\u2019 \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679c(a). This is in some respects an overstatement, and in some respects an understatement, of the \u201cProhibited practices\u201d set forth in \u00a7 1679b. It would include, for example,</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">[565 U.S. 103]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">deception apart from \u201cthe offer or sale of the services of the credit repair organization,\u201d \u00a7 1679b(a)(4). Yet we would not hold, in order to prevent the required statement from being \u201cmisleading,\u201d that a consumer has a right to be protected from deceptive practices beyond those actually covered by \u00a7 1679b. So also with respect to the statement\u2019s description of a \u201cright to sue.\u201d This is a colloquial method of communicating to consumers that they have the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover damages from credit repair organizations that violate the CROA. We think most consumers would understand it this way, without regard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding. Leaving that possibility out may be imprecise, but it is not misleading\u2014and certainly not so misleading as to demand, in order to avoid that result, reading the statute to contain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">At the time of the CROA\u2019s enactment in 1996, arbitration clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no rarity. Quite the contrary, the early 1990\u2019s saw the increased use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts generally, and in financial services contracts in particular. See Ware, Arbitration and Unconscionability After <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto, </em>31 Wake Forest L. Rev. 1001, 1001, and n. 3 (1996); J. Shimabukuro, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, The Federal Arbitration Act: Background and Recent Developments 1 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Had Congress meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents suggest. When it has restricted the use of arbitration in other contexts, it has done so with a clarity that far exceeds the claimed indications in the CROA. See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 26(n)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (\u201cNo predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable, if the agreement requires arbitration of</p>\n<p id=\"ARuL\">[565 U.S. 104]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">a dispute arising under this section\u201d); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a)(2) (2006 ed.) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever a motor vehicle franchise contract provides for the use of arbitration to resolve a controversy arising out of or relating to such contract, arbitration may be used to settle such controversy only if after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>such controversy arises all parties to such controversy consent in writing to use arbitration to settle such controversy\u201d); cf. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5518(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (granting authority to the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate predispute arbitration agreements in contracts for consumer financial products or services).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That Congress would have sought to achieve the same result in the CROA through combination of the nonwaiver provision with the \u201cright to sue\u201d phrase in the disclosure provision, and the references to \u201caction\u201d and \u201ccourt\u201d in the description of damages recoverable, unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"pA-3Y\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"43\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAS4AAAArAQAAAADugVjpAAAAmElEQVR4nO2UIQ4CQRAE6zohwfEE+AaKj/AJHBLJM3gKAk/CV84gFgZJixaXcLgdV1O9yc5ks0MxoV6akoIe+yV28lYCAdTVRIQ/3O2ytU4EARz8YAQBHJ9mIghgP5rJUFXV1vWtBE0A2vhQCQQwuokggIdvL4IAbiszEQRwXpqJIID7wkyGqqr3znaQoM37Qob+h/TYHLEP1W5qoyMHSGsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"302\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under the Act can proceed in an arbitral forum, the FAA requires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its terms.

The dissent questions the relevance of these statutes, since they postdated the CROA and since this Court\u2019s intervening decisions compelling arbitration \u201cincreasingly alerted Congress to the utility of drafting antiwaiver prescriptions with meticulous care.\u2019\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 116, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 604. But as the dissent implicitly recognizes, Congress had been \u201calerted\u201d much before these post-CROA statutes were passed. The CROA itself followed a series of this Court\u2019s seminal decisions compelling arbitration, decisions which held that the FAA had established a \u201c \u2018federal policy favoring arbitration,\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate / Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 26, 111 S.

Ed. 2d, at 604, there is no reason to think the Congress that enacted the CROA was any less stimulated than subsequent Congresses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b699-13\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b699-14\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"A_8v\">with whom Justice Kagan joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">Claims alleging the violation of a statute, such as the Credit Repair Organizations Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679 et seq., are generally subject to valid arbitration agreements unless Congress evinces a contrary intent in the text, history, or purpose of the statute. See <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate / Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 26, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991). I agree with the Court that Congress has not shown that intent here. But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I find this to be a much closer case than the majority opinion suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">The Act creates a cause of action in its liability provision, see \u00a7 1679g(a), denominates the cause of action a \u201cright to sue\u201d in the mandatory disclosure statement, \u00a7 1679c(a), and then provides that \u201cright [s]\u201d may not be waived, \u00a7 1679f(a). Those for whom Congress wrote the Act\u2014lay readers \u201cof limited economic means and . . . inexperienced in credit matters,\u201d \u00a7 1679(a)(2)\u2014reasonably may interpret the phrase \u201cright to sue\u201d as promising a right to sue <em>in court. </em>And it is plausible to think that Congress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such a construction of the liability provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-28\">But while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is in my view no more compelling than the contrary construction</p>\n<p id=\"b699-29\">[565 U.S. 109]</p>\n<p id=\"b699-30\">that petitioners urge. As the majority opinion notes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>cause of action, and the liability provision that does is materially indistinguishable from other statutes that we have held not to preclude arbitration. In my mind this leaves the parties\u2019 arguments in equipoise, and our precedents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance. This is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitration, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed arbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts in favor of arbitration. See <em>id., </em>at 26, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26. Of course, if we have misread Congress\u2019 intent, then Congress can correct our error by amending the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">I add one more point. The majority opinion contrasts the liability provision of the Act with other, more recently enacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration. I do not understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress must speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to preclude arbitration of statutory claims. We have never said as much, and on numerous occasions have held that proof of Congress\u2019 intent may also be discovered in the history or purpose of the statute in question. See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cIf such an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text of the [statute], its legislative history, or an \u2018inherent conflict\u2019 between arbitration and the [statute\u2019s] underlying purposes\u201d); Shearson <em>/ American Express Inc. </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>482 U.S. 220, 227, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987) (\u201cIf Congress did intend to limit or prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular claim, such an intent \u2018will be deducible from [the statute\u2019s] text or legislative history,\u2019 or from an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute\u2019s underlying purposes\u201d (quoting <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 628, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985); citation omitted)). I agree with the dissent that the statutes the majority opinion cites shed little light on the thoughts of the Congress that passed the Act. But the Act\u2019s text is not dispositive, and respondents identify nothing in</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">[565 U.S. no]</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">the legislative history or purpose of the Act that would tip the balance of the scale in favor of their interpretation.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b700-9\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"AkbLa\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Congress enacted the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA or Act) to protect consumers \u201cwho have experienced credit problems\u201d\u2014\u201cparticularly those of limited economic means\u201d\u2014 against the unfair and deceptive practices of credit repair organizations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679(a). Central to the legislation, Congress sought to arm consumers with information needed to make intelligent decisions about purchasing a repair organization\u2019s services. To that end, Congress directed that, \u201cbefore [execution of] any contract ... between [a] consumer and [a] credit repair organization,\u201d the organization must make certain disclosures. \u00a7 1679c(a). One of the required disclosures reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">\u201cYou have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the [CROA]. This law prohibits deceptive practices by [such] organizations.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">The Act\u2019s civil-liability provision describes suits consumers may bring in court: individual and class actions for damages (actual and punitive) and attorneys\u2019 fees. A further provision renders void any purported waiver of any protection or right the Act grants to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">The Court today holds that credit repair organizations can escape suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>by providing in their take-it-or-leave-it contracts that arbitration will serve as the parties\u2019 sole dispute-resolution mechanism. The \u201cright to sue,\u201d the Court explains, merely connotes the vindication of legal rights, whether in court or before an arbitrator. That reading may be comprehensible to one trained to \u201cthink like a lawyer.\u201d But Congress enacted the CROA with vulnerable consumers in mind\u2014consumers likely to read the words \u201cright to sue\u201d to mean the right to litigate in court, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">[565 U.S. Ill]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In accord with the Ninth Circuit, I would hold that Congress, in an Act meant to curb deceptive practices, did not authorize credit repair organizations to make a false or misleading disclosure\u2014telling consumers of a right they do not, in fact, possess. If the Act affords consumers a non-waivable right to sue in court, as I believe it does, a credit repair organization cannot retract that right by making arbitration the consumer\u2019s sole recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">CompuCredit Corporation marketed a credit card to consumers with weak credit ratings. It did so through massive direct-mail and Internet solicitations, urging recipients to acquire a card under the brand name Aspire Visa, and thereby \u201crebuild poor credit\u201d and \u201cimprove [their] credit rating.\u201d App. 40, Complaint \u00b6 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs, individuals who applied for and received CompuCredit\u2019s card, sought redress for multiple violations of the CROA.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Their complaint alleged that Com-puCredit\u2019s promotional materials told potential customers that no deposit would be required, and that cardholders would receive, upfront, a credit line of $300. In fact, plaintiffs asserted, they were charged an initial finance fee of $29, a monthly fee of $6.50, and an annual fee of $150, assessed immediately against the $300 limit. In the aggregate, plaintiffs calculated, fees charged the first year amounted to $257. CompuCredit\u2019s fee exactions did appear in the promotional materials: in small print, buried amidst other information, and removed from the clearer representation that no deposit would be required. Id., at 40-41, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Far from improving their credit rating, plaintiffs complained, CompuCredit knew that its card, saddled with these fees, \u201cwould not provide any meaningful assistance whatsoever with regard to rebuilding credit and improving a credit rating.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 48, \u00b6 41(b). Furthermore, plaintiffs stated, CompuCredit did not provide them</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">[565 U.S. 112]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">with the written disclosures of their rights required by the CROA. <em>Id., </em>at 42, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Seeking damages for the alleged violations, along with attorneys\u2019 fees, plaintiffs requested class certification. In the District Court and Court of Appeals, they successfully resisted CompuCredit\u2019s motion to compel arbitration pursuant to a form contract that barred class proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court, however, interprets the CROA to permit CompuCredit\u2019s demand that plaintiffs proceed, if at all, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>an arbitrator.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I read the governing statute differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Three sections of the CROA, considered together, indicate Congress\u2019 intention to preclude mandatory, creditor-imposed, arbitration of CROA claims. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1679c(a), 1679g, and 1679f. Before entering into any consumer contract, credit repair organizations must give potential customers a written statement of rights they possess under that Act and related consumer-protection laws. \u00a7 1679c(a). Congress dictated every word of the required notification. Credit repair organizations must tell consumers, in plain terms, how they may enforce their rights: \u201cYou have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the [CROA].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">[565 U.S. 113]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The \u201cright to sue\u201d refers to the claim for relief Congress afforded consumers in \u00a7 1679g. \u201cAny person\u201d who violates another\u2019s rights under the CROA \u201cshall be liable\u201d for actual damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, and may be liable for punitive damages as well. \u00a7 1679g(a)(l)-(3). The Act sets out the factors \u201cthe court shall consider\u201d in determining the amount of punitive damages \u201cthe court may allow\u201d aggrieved consumers to recover, either individually or as a class. \u00a7 1679g(a)(2) and (b). The liability created here, in \u00a7 1679g, is precisely what the consumer, in light of \u00a7 1679c, may sue to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The Act renders void and unenforceable \u201c[a]ny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or <em>any right </em>of the consumer under this subchapter.\u201d \u00a7 1679f (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rights listed in \u00a7 1679c(a) rendered nonwaivable by \u00a7 1679f are the \u201cright to sue\u201d and the \u201cright to cancel [a] contract... for any reason within 3 business days from the date [the consumer] signed it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The question on which this case turns is what Congress meant when it created a nonwaivable \u201cright to sue.\u201d Recall that Congress\u2019 target audience in the CROA is not composed</p>\n<p id=\"AZmn\">[565 U.S. 114]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">of lawyers and judges accustomed to nuanced reading of statutory texts, but laypersons who receive a disclosure statement in the mail. Recall, as well, Congress\u2019 findings that these indi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>victuals are often \u201cof limited economic means and . . . inexperienced in credit matters.\u201d \u00a7 1679(a)(2). Attributing little importance to this context, the Court construes the right to site as \u201cthe legal right, enforceable in court, to recover damages ... without regard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 103, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 596. I read Congress\u2019 words without that sophisticated gloss: The right to sue, I would hold, means the right to litigate in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The Court is quite right in recognizing that consumers \u201chave the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover damages from credit repair organizations that violate the CROA.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But the Court is quite wrong, as I see it, to characterize as merely \u201cimprecise,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>Congress\u2019 failure to include the caveat that access to court may be conditioned upon an anterior arbitration. The \u201cright to sue\u201d may well be \u201ca colloquial method of communicating to consumers.\u201d See <em>ibid. </em>But it surely is not colloquially <em>understood </em>by recipients of the required disclosures as the right, not to adjudicate in court, but only to seek, or defend against, court enforcement of an award rendered by the arbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization. Few, if any, credit repair customers would equate the \u201cright to sue,\u201d \u00a7 1679c(a), with the extremely limited judicial review given to an arbitrator\u2019s award, see, <em>e.g., Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. </em>v. <em>Mattel, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 576, 586-589, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The Court discounts the references to \u201caction,\u201d \u201cclass action,\u201d and \u201ccourt\u201d in \u00a7 1679g, the provision that \u201ccreate [s]\u201d the consumers\u2019 claim for relief. See <em>ante, </em>at 100, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 594. Despite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we have enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes arising under other Acts of Congress. The CROA, however, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements, prime among</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">[565 U.S. 115]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">them, the obligation imposed on the credit repair organization to inform potential customers they \u201chave a right to sue\u201d an organization that violates the Act. \u00a7 1679c(a). Yet the Court refuses to read this language in concert with \u00a7 1679g, notwithstanding our frequent acknowledgment that \u201ca statute is to be read as a whole, since the meaning of statutory language . . . depends on context.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S. Ct. 570, 116 L. Ed. 2d 578 (1991) (citation omitted). As just explained, I believe Congress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure requirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair organization that engages in deceptive practices may be sued <em>in court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Reducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see <em>ante, </em>at 99-100, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 593-595, the Court\u2019s construction of the CROA scarcely advances the Act\u2019s goals. Congress aimed to ensure prospective customers \u201care provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision,\u201d and also to \u201cprotect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679(b). The Court\u2019s interpretation, however, enables the very deception Congress sought to suppress. Today\u2019s decision permits credit repair organizations to deny consumers, through fine print in a contract, an important right whose disclosure is decreed in the U. S. Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">This unfortunate result is not compelled by our precedents. The Court cites three decisions for the proposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tion, by now uncontroversial, that the mere existence of a statutory right of action does not preclude agreements to arbitrate disputes. See <em>ante, </em>at 101, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 595 (citing <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate / Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 28, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991); <em>Shearson / American Express Inc. </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>482 U.S. 220, 240, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987); and <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 637, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985)). As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante, </em>at 101, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 595, none of the statutes at issue in those cases contained a non-waiver clause analogous to \u00a7 1679f. Yet the presence of such a clause would not have affected the outcome, the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">[565 U.S. 116]</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">maintains; a nonwaiver provision would not have precluded arbitration because the statutes conferred no underlying right to proceed in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Precisely the point: The CROA differs from the statutes we have construed in the past in just that respect. The Act does not merely create a claim for relief. It designates that claim as an action entailing a \u201cright to sue\u201d; mandates that consumers be informed, prior to entering any contract, of that right; and precludes the waiver of any \u201cright\u201d conferred by the Act. Neither <em>Gilmer, McMahon, </em>nor <em>Mitsubishi </em>construed a statute of a similar order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The Court\u2019s final point is that, elsewhere, Congress has spoken with particular clarity in guaranteeing a judicial forum and proscribing arbitration, but here, it did not do so. The two statutes the Court cites as exemplary post-date the CROA\u2019s enactment by 14 and 6 years, respectively. (A third merely delegates regulatory authority over certain arbitration agreements.) See <em>ante, </em>at 103-104, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 596-597. Notably, these recent statutes were framed following a string of this Court\u2019s decisions compelling arbitration pursuant to contractual stipulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our decisions have increasingly alerted Congress to the utility of drafting anti-waiver prescriptions with meticulous care. But the Congress that drafted the CROA was not similarly stimulated, and we cannot fairly assess that</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">[565 U.S. 117]</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">enactment in the light of subsequent legislative responses to developments unknown to the CROA\u2019s drafters. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 S. Ct. 326, 4 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1960) (\u201c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Beyond question, the Federal Arbitration Act, \u201cstanding alone,\u201d favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements. <em>McMahon, </em>482 U.S., at 226, 107 S.
