The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that the OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a substantial nexus between his injury and his employer\u2019s extractive operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">Petitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific), operates two drilling platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California and an onshore oil and gas processing facility in Ventura County, California. Pacific employed Juan Valladolid as a general manual laborer\u2014known in the trade as a roustabout\u2014in its oil exploration and extraction business. Valladolid spent about 98 percent of his time on one of Pacific\u2019s offshore drilling platforms performing maintenance duties, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>as picking up litter, emptying trashcans, washing decks, painting, maintaining equipment, and helping to load and unload the platform crane. Valladolid spent the remainder of his time working at Pacific\u2019s onshore processing facility, where he also performed maintenance duties, including painting, sandblasting, pulling weeds, cleaning drain culverts, and operating a forklift.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">While on duty at the onshore facility, Valladolid died in a forklift accident. His widow, a respondent here (hereinafter respondent), filed a claim for benefits under the LHWCA pursuant to the extension of that Act contained within the OCSLA. The OCSLA provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201cWith respect to disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing, or transporting by pipeline the natural resources, or involving rights to the natural resources, of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, compensation shall be payable under the provisions of the [LHWCA].\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) dismissed respondent\u2019s claim. The ALJ reasoned that Valladolid\u2019s fatal injury was not covered under \u00a7 1333(b) because his accident occurred on land, rather than on the Outer Continental Shelf. On appeal, the United States Department of Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding that Congress intended to limit the coverage provided by the OCSLA to injuries suffered by employees within the \u201cgeographical locale\u201d of the Outer Continental Shelf. <em>L. V. </em>v. <em>Pacific Operations Offshore, LLP, </em>42 BRBS 67, 71 (2008) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \u00a7 1333(b) neither contains a \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d requirement, as the Fifth Circuit has held, nor imposes a \u201cbut for\u201d causation requirement, as the Third Circuit has held. See 604 F.3d 1126, 1130-1140 (2010) (rejecting the holdings of <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>877 F.2d 356 (CA5 1989) (en banc); <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Schlumberger Offshore Service, Inc., </em>849 F.2d 805 (CA3 1988)). Instead, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cthe claimant must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf\u2019 to qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the OCSLA. 604 F.3d, at 1139. We granted Pacific\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve this conflict. 562 U.S. 1215, 131 S. Ct. 1472, 179 L. Ed. 2d 298 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, 67 Stat. 29, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301 <em>et seq., </em>which extended the boundaries</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">[565 U.S. 212]</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">of Coastal States up to three geographic miles into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and up to three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, Congress enacted the OCSLA, affirming the Federal Government\u2019s authority and control over the \u201couter Continental Shelf,\u201d defined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction and control of the United States lying seaward and outside of the submerged lands within the extended state boundaries. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331(a), 1332(1). As defined by the OCSLA, the Outer Continental Shelf includes the \u201csubmerged lands\u201d be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>yond the extended state boundaries, \u00a7 1331(a), but not the waters above those submerged lands or artificial islands or installations attached to the seabed. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we refer to the entire geographical zone as the \u201cOCS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Section 1333 extends various provisions of state and federal law to certain aspects of the OCS. For example, \u00a7 1333(a)(1) extends the Constitution and federal laws of civil and political jurisdiction \u201cto the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands, and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,\u201d for the purpose of extracting its natural resources. Section 1333(a)(2)(A) makes the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State applicable to \u201cthat portion of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon, which would be within the area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf.\u201d Section 1333(b), the provision involved in this case, makes LHWCA workers\u2019 compensation benefits available for the \u201cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf\u2019 for the purpose of extracting its natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The question before us is the scope of coverage under \u00a7 1333(b). The parties agree that  \u00a7 1333(b) covers employees,</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">[565 U.S. 213]</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">such as oil rig and drilling platform workers, who are injured while working directly on the OCS to extract its natural resources. They disagree, however, whether employees who are involved in extraction operations but who are injured beyond the OCS are also covered under the OCSLA. This dispute focuses on the meaning of the phrase \u201cany injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf\u2019 in \u00a7 1333(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations. In <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Schlumberger Offshore Service, Inc., </em>849 F.2d, at 811, the Third Circuit held that, because Congress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, \u00a7 1333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d operations on the OCS. The Third Circuit thus concluded that an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig, but who was killed in a car accident on the way to the helicopter that was to fly him to that rig, was eligible for \u00a7 1333(b) benefits. <em>Id., </em>at 806, 811. As the Third Circuit summarized, \u201c \u2018But for\u2019 [Curtis\u2019] travelling to [his drill rig] for the purpose of conducting \u2018operations\u2019 within \u00a7 1333(b), employee Curtis would not have sustained injuries in the automobile accident.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">In <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Director, supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc, adopted a narrower interpretation of \u00a7 1333(b). The court concluded that Congress intended to establish \u201ca bright-line geographic boundary for \u00a7 1333(b) coverage,\u201d and held that \u00a7 1333(b) extends coverage only to employees engaged in OCS extractive activities who \u201csuffer injury or death on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 362. Applying its \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d test, the Fifth Circuit held that a welder who was injured on land during the construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible for \u00a7 1333(b) benefits. <em>Id., </em>at 357, 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">In the case below, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>injury\u201d requirement as unsupported by the text of \u00a7 1333(b), and the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test as too</p>\n<p id=\"ABSqq\">[565 U.S. 214]</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">broad to be consistent with Congress\u2019 intent. 604 F.3d, at 1137, 1139. Instead, the Ninth Circuit adopted a third interpretation of \u00a7 1333(b), holding that a \u201cclaimant must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf\u2019 to be eligible for \u00a7 1333(b) benefits. <em>Id., </em>at 1139. \u201cTo meet the standard,\u201d the Ninth Circuit explained, \u201cthe claimant must show that the work performed directly furthers outer continental shelf operations and is in the regular course of such operations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The Solicitor General suggests yet a fourth interpretation of \u00a7 1333(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This interpretation would extend coverage to two categories of injuries: (1) all on-OCS injuries suffered by employees of companies engaged in resource extraction on the OCS; and (2) the off-OCS injuries of those employees who spend a substantial portion of their worktime on the OCS engaging in extractive operations. Brief for Federal Respondent 32-33. According to the Solicitor General, this test would provide \u00a7 1333(b) coverage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both duration and nature. <em>Id., </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Pacific argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d test presents the best interpretation of \u00a7 1333(b). The crux of Pacific\u2019s argument is that off-OCS injuries cannot be \u201cthe result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 1333(b). Pacific asserts that because Valladolid was injured on dry land, his death did not occur as the result of extraction operations conducted on the OCS, and therefore respondent is ineligible for LHWCA workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">[565 U.S. 215]</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">The OCSLA extends the provisions of the LHWCA to the \u201cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf.\u201d \u00a7 1333(b). Contrary to the view of Pacific and the Fifth Circuit, nothing in that language suggests that the injury to the employee must occur on the OCS. Section 1333(b) states only two requirements: The extractive operations must be \u201cconducted on the outer Continental Shelf,\u201d and the employee\u2019s injury must occur \u201cas the result of\u2019 those operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">Despite the lack of a textual \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d requirement in \u00a7 1333(b), Pacific argues that it is logically impossible for an off-OCS employee to be injured \u201cas the result of\u2019 on-OCS operations. Pacific offers no basis for this assertion, and we find none. Indeed, given that many OCS platforms are physically connected to onshore processing facilities via oil and gas pipelines, it is not difficult to imagine an accident occurring on an OCS platform that could injure employees located off the OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Moreover, if, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of \u00a7 1333(b) was to geo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>graphically limit the extension of LHWCA coverage to injuries that occurred on the OCS, Congress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting the following six words in \u00a7 1333(b)\u2019s text: \u201cas the result of operations conducted.\u201d Had Congress done so, the statute would extend LHWCA coverage to the \u201cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring on the outer Continental Shelf.\u201d But that is not the text of the statute Congress enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Pacific also argues that, because all of \u00a7 1333(b)\u2019s neighboring subsections contain specific situs limitations, we should infer that Congress intended to include a situs-of-injury requirement in \u00a7 1333(b). See, e.g., \u00a7 1333(a)(2)(A) (adopting the civil and criminal laws of the adjacent State as federal law \u201cfor that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the outer</p>\n<p id=\"AaIeE\">[565 U.S. 216]</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon, which would be within the area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf\u2019).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But our usual practice is to make the opposite inference. <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) (  \u201cWhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\u201d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)).  Congress\u2019 decision to specify, in scrupulous detail, exactly where the other subsections of \u00a7 1333 apply, but to include no similar restriction on injuries in \u00a7 1333(b), convinces us that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1333(b) to apply only to injuries suffered on the OCS. Rather, \u00a7 1333(b) extends LHWCA workers\u2019 compensation coverage to any employee injury, regardless of where it happens, as long as it occurs</p>\n<p id=\"A90p\">[565 U.S. 217]</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">\u201cas the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Pacific argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by language in  <em>Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>470 U.S. 414, 105 S. Ct. 1421, 84 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1985), and <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, 477 </em>U.S. 207, 106 S. Ct. 2485, 91 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1986); but neither of those cases held that \u00a7 1333(b) extends only to injuries that occur on the OCS. In <em>Herb\u2019s Welding, </em>this Court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>whether an oil platform welder, who worked both within the territorial waters of Louisiana and on the OCS, was covered under the LHWCA after suffering an injury in the waters of Louisiana. 470 U.S., at 416-417, 105 S. Ct. 1421, 84 L. Ed. 2d 406. The Court explicitly declined to address whether the employee was eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under \u00a7 1333(b) because that question was neither passed upon by the Court of Appeals nor fully briefed and argued before this Court. <em>Id., </em>at 426, n. 12, 105 S. Ct. 1421, 84 L. Ed. 2d 406. Although the Court acknowledged that an employee might walk in and out of workers\u2019 compensation coverage during his employment due to the \u201cexplicit geographic limitation to the [OCSLA\u2019s] incorporation of the LHWCA,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 427, 105 S. Ct. 1421, 84 L. Ed. 2d 406, the exact meaning of that statement is unclear. We cannot ascertain whether the comment was a reference to \u00a7 1333(b)\u2019s explicit situs-of-operations requirement, as respondents suggest, or the recognition of an implicit situs-of-injury requirement, as Pacific argues. In any event, the ambiguous comment was made without analysis in dicta and does not control this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The same is true of the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Offshore Logistics. </em>In that case, the Court considered whether the widows of oil platform workers who were killed when their helicopter crashed into the high seas could file wrongful-death suits under Louisiana law. In the Court\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 1333, it stated, \u201cCongress determined that the general scope of OCSLA\u2019s coverage . . . would be determined principally by locale, not by the status of the individual injured or killed.\u201d 477 U.S., at 219-220, 106 S. Ct. 2485, 91 L. Ed. 2d 174 (citing the situs requirement in \u00a7 1333(a)(2)(A)). In a footnote, the Court commented: \u201cOnly</p>\n<p id=\"AWeL\">[565 U.S. 218]</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">one provision of OCSLA superimposes a status requirement on the otherwise determinative OCSLA situs requirement; \u00a7 1333(b) makes compensation for the death or injury of an \u2018employee\u2019 resulting from certain operations on the Outer Continental Shelf payable under the [LHWCA].\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>n. 2. These comments about the scope of the OCS-LA\u2019s coverage and its determinative \u201csitus requirement\u201d do not provide definitive evidence that \u00a7 1333(b) applies only to injuries that occur on the OCS. As in <em>Herb\u2019s Welding, </em>it is unclear whether the statement in the <em>Offshore Logistics </em>footnote regarding \u00a7 1333(b) was referring to the explicit situs-of-operations requirement or to an implicit situs-of-injury requirement. Moreover, the entire footnote is dictum because, as the Court explicitly stated, \u00a7 1333(b) had no bearing on the case. 477 U.S., at 219-220, 106 S. Ct. 2485, 91 L. Ed. 2d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Finally, Pacific argues that including off-OCS injuries within the scope of the workers\u2019 compensation coverage created by \u00a7 1333(b) runs counter to Congress\u2019 intent in drafting the OCSLA. According to Pacific, Congress intended to create a uniform OCS compensation scheme that both filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated jurisdictional overlaps between existing state and federal programs. Pacific points out that, without a situs-of-injury requirement to narrow the scope of \u00a7 1333(b), an off-OCS worker could be eligible for both state and federal workers\u2019 compensation coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">There is no indication in the text, however, that the OCSLA excludes OCS workers from LHWCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>coverage when they are also eligible for state benefits. To the contrary, the LHWCA workers\u2019 compensation scheme incorporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees might be eligible for both state and federal benefits. An offsetting provision in the LHWCA provides that \u201cany amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed under [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers\u2019 compensation law or [the</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">[565 U.S. 219]</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Jones Act] shall be credited against any liability imposed by [the LHWCA].\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(e). This provision, in addition to the lack of any textual support for Pacific\u2019s argument, convinces us that Congress did not limit the scope of 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b)\u2019s coverage to only those geographic areas where state workers\u2019 compensation schemes do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from the interaction of \u00a7 1333(b) and a provision of the LHWCA. Specifically, Pacific argues that because the LHWCA contains an explicit situs-of-injury requirement, see 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (providing benefits only for injuries occurring \u201cupon the navigable waters\u201d of the United States), and because 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b) extends the LHWCA workers\u2019 compensation scheme to the OCS, \u00a7 1333(b) incorporates the strict LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement from \u00a7 903(a). According to Pacific, the words \u201coccurring as the result of operations\u201d in \u00a7 1333(b) impose a status requirement in addition to the imported LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement, with the result that employees who are injured on the OCS, but whose jobs are not related to extractive operations, are excluded from the workers\u2019 compensation coverage created by \u00a7 1333(b). Thus, an accountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling platform would be ineligible under \u00a7 1333(b) despite being an employee who is injured on the OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Although this alternative argument has the advantage of assigning some meaning to the words \u201coccurring as the result of operations\u201d in \u00a7 1333(b), we still find it unpersuasive. First, it is unlikely that Congress intended to impose a sites-of-injury requirement in \u00a7 1333(b) through such a nonintui-tive and convoluted combination of two separate legislative Acts. As we have already noted, creating an express situs-of-injury requirement in the text of \u00a7 1333(b) would have been simple. Second, combining the \u00a7 1333(b) definition of \u201cUnited States\u201d with the LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">[565 U.S. 220]</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) would result in an OCS workers\u2019 compensation scheme that applies only to the seabed of the OCS and to any artificial islands and fixed structures thereon. See 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b)(3) (stating that \u201cthe term \u2018United States\u2019 when used in a geographical sense includes the outer Continental Shelf and artificial islands and fixed structures thereon\u201d). Pacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navigable waters above the shelf, including the waters immediately adjacent to any drilling platforms. Consequently, under Pacific\u2019s view, even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured during a platform explosion would be excluded from \u00a7 1333(b) coverage. That view cannot be squared with the text of the statute, which applies to \u201cany injury occurring as the result of operations conducted\u201d on the OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of a situs-of-injury requirement, but  policy concerns cannot justify an interpretation of \u00a7 1333(b) that is inconsistent with the text of the OCSLA. \u201c[I]f Congress\u2019 coverage decisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Congress to change them. We should not legislate for them.\u201d <em>Herb\u2019s Welding, </em>470 U.S., at 427, 105 S. Ct. 1421, 84 L. Ed. 2d 406. The language of \u00a7 1333(b) simply does not support a categorical exclusion of injuries that occur beyond the OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The Solicitor General urges us to adopt a status-based inquiry that applies one test to on-OCS injuries and a different test to off-OCS injuries. Specifically, the Government proposes that when a worker is injured on the OCS, he is eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits if he is employed by a company engaged in extractive operations on the OCS. But if the employee is injured off the OCS, the employee will be covered only if his \u201cduties contribute to operations\u201d on the OCS and if he performs \u201cwork on the [OCS] itself that is</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">[565 U.S. 221]</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">substantial in terms of both its duration and nature.\u201d Brief for Federal Respondent 35. This approach is derived from our decision in <em>Chandris, Inc. </em>v. <em>Latsis, </em>515 U.S. 347, 115 S. Ct. 2172, 132 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1995) (establishing criteria by which an employee qualifies as a \u201cseaman\u201d under the Jones Act), and might well have merit as legislation. But it has no basis in the text of the OCSLA as presently enacted. The \u201coccurring as the result of operations\u201d language in \u00a7 1333(b) plainly suggests causation. Although the Government asserts that a status-based test would be preferable to a causation-based test, we cannot ignore the language enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test is nominally based on causation, but it is also incompatible with \u00a7 1333(b). Taken to its logical conclusion, the \u201cbut for\u201d test would extend workers\u2019 compensation coverage to all employees of a business engaged in the extraction of natural resources from the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are doing when they are injured. This test could reasonably be interpreted to cover land-based office employees whose jobs have virtually nothing to do with extractive operations on the OCS. Because Congress extended LHWCA coverage only to injuries \u201coccurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf,\u201d we think that \u00a7 1333(b) should be interpreted in a manner that focuses on injuries that result from those \u201coperations\u201d This view is consistent with our past treatment of similar language in other contexts. In <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation, </em>503 U.S. 258, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992), we considered a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act that provided a cause of action to \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property <em>by reason </em>of a violation of section 1962.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c) (emphasis added). We rejected a \u201cbut for\u201d interpretation, stating that such a construction was \u201chardly compelled\u201d and that it was highly unlikely that Congress intended to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover. 503 U.S., at 265-266, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532. Instead, we adopted a</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">[565 U.S. 222]</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">proximate-cause standard consistent with our prior interpretation of the same lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>guage in the Sherman and Clayton Acts. <em>Id., </em>at 267-268, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532. Similarly, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b)\u2019s language hardly compels the Third Circuit\u2019s expansive \u201cbut for\u201d interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that  the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test is more faithful to the text of \u00a7 1333(b). We understand the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test to require the injured employee to establish a significant causal link between the injury that he suffered and his employer\u2019s on-OCS operations conducted for the purpose of extracting natural resources from the OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Although the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test may not be the easiest to administer, it best reflects the text of \u00a7 1333(b), which establishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a \u201cbut for\u201d test. We are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to determine whether an injured employee has established a significant causal link between the injury he suffered and his employer\u2019s on-OCS extractive operations. Although we expect that employees injured while performing tasks on the OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an employee injured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies\u2014like Vallad-olid, who died while tasked with onshore scrap metal consolidation\u2014is a question that will depend on the individual circumstances of each case. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test in the first instance, and we agree with that disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-15\">.

My disagreement is limited to the last two substantive paragraphs of Part IV, which endorse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test for determining the scope of coverage under 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b). The Court indulges in considerable understatement when it acknowledges that this test \u201cmay not be the easiest to administer,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 222, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 690. \u201cSubstantial nexus\u201d is novel legalese with no established meaning in the present context. I agree with the Court\u2019s rejection of some of the clearer rules proposed by the parties\u2014which, though easier to apply, are unmoored from the text of \u00a7 1333(b). But if we must adopt an indeterminate standard (and the statute\u2019s \u201cas the result of\u2019 language leaves us no choice) I prefer the devil we know to the devil of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s imagining. I would hold that an employee may recover under \u00a7 1333(b) if his injury was <em>proximately caused </em>by operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-17\">The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d is \u201cshorthand for a concept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise to legal liability.\u201d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>564 U.S. 685, 692, 131 S. Ct. 2630, 180 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2011). Life is too short to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>pursue every event to its most remote, \u201cbut-for,\u201d consequences, and the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough guide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of cause and effect. See <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation, </em>503 U.S. 258, 287, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, as the Court notes in rejecting the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test for \u00a7 1333(b) coverage, we have interpreted statutes with language similar to \u00a7 1333(b) as prescribing a proximate-cause standard. See <em>ante, </em>at 221-222, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 689-690.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Although the doctrine of proximate cause is rooted in tort law and most commonly applied in negligence actions, it can also provide a useful guide in no-fault compensation schemes like this one. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>513 U.S. 115, 119, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1994), we considered a no-fault veterans\u2019 compensation statute covering injuries that occurred \u201cas the result of\u2019 medical treatment</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">[565 U.S. 224]</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">(precisely the language at issue here); we suggested that the requisite \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the injury and medical treatment may be \u201climited to proximate causation so as to narrow the class of compensable cases ... by eliminating remote consequences.\u201d Similarly, some state workers\u2019 compensation laws use the concept of proximate cause to determine entitlement. See, <em>e.g., Ex parte Patton, </em>77 So. 3d 591, 595 (Ala. 2011); <em>Marandino </em>v. <em>Prometheus Pharmacy, </em>294 Conn. 564, 591, 986 A.2d 1023, 1041 (2010); <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Grant Textiles, </em>372 S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007). Indeed, the statutory law of California, where Mr. Valladolid died while at work, limits workers\u2019 compensation liability to cases \u201c[w]here the injury is proximately caused by the employment, either with or without negligence.\u201d Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a7 3600(a)(3) (West 2011).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I see no reason why the scope of 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(b) could not similarly be cab-ined by the familiar limits of proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">To be sure, proximate cause is an imperfect legal doctrine; I have no illusions that its tenets are easy to describe or straightforward to apply. Judicial opinions do not provide a uniform formulation of the test, and borderline cases are rarely clear. But \u201cit is often easier to disparage the product of centuries of common law than to devise a plausible substitute.\u201d <em>McBride, </em>564 U.S., at 707, 131 S. Ct. 2630, 180 L. Ed. 2d 637 (Roberts, C. J., dissenting). Unlike the substantial-nexus test, proximate cause provides a \u201cvocabulary\u201d for answering questions like the one</p>\n<p id=\"A_Ecb\">[565 U.S. 225]</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">raised by the facts of this case. It may be productive, for example, to consider whether the injury was \u201cwithin the scope of the risk\u201d created by OCS operations, or whether some \u201csuperseding or intervening cause\u201d exists. <em>Id., </em>at 719, 131 S. Ct. 2630, 180 L. Ed. 2d 637. In addition to that vocabulary, precedents on proximate cause \u201cfurnish illustrations of situa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>tions which judicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the line or the other.\u201d <em>Exxon Co., U.S.A. </em>v. <em>Sofec, Inc., </em>517 U.S. 830, 839, 116 S. Ct. 1813, 135 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">\u201cSubstantial nexus,\u201d by contrast, is an indeterminate phrase that lacks all pedigree. Our case law has used it as a term of art in only one context, first appearing in Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S. Ct. 1076, 51 L. Ed. 2d 326 (1977): We sustain state taxes against Commerce Clause challenges if they are, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201capplied to an activity with a substantial <em>nexus </em>with the taxing State.\u201d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Jefferson Lines, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 175, 183, 115 S. Ct. 1331, 131 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1995) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[S]uch a nexus is established when the taxpayer \u2018avails itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business\u2019 in that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Polar Tankers, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Valdez, </em>557 U.S. 1, 11, 129 S. Ct. 2277, 174 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2009). That clarification\u2014and any further clarification in the Commerce Clause context\u2014will not be remotely helpful to lower courts attempting to apply the substantial-nexus test in the very different legal context of workers\u2019 compensation under \u00a7 1333(b). In this latter context, I assume the Court means by \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d a substantial causal nexus\u2014since \u00a7 1333(b)\u2019s \u201cas the result of\u2019 language \u201cplainly suggests causation,\u201d ante, at 221, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 689. Like the word \u201cnexus\u201d itself, the definition of \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d in our state-tax cases does not require any <em>causal </em>relationship whatsoever. The proximate-cause test, by comparison, represents a much more natural interpretation of a statute that turns on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">[565 U.S. 226]</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Does the Court mean to establish, by the novel \u201csubstantial [causal] nexus\u201d test, a new <em>tertium quid, </em>of causality\u2014somewhere between but-for causality and proximate cause? One might think so, since there is no other sensible reason to (1) reject but-for cause, (2) say nothing about the natural alternative (proximate cause), and (3) embrace the \u201csubstantial [causal] nexus\u201d novelty. On the other hand, the Court\u2019s opinion suggests at least some connection (that is to say, in the Court\u2019s favored law-speak, some \u201cnexus\u201d) between the proximate-cause standard and the substantial-nexus test, since it cites one of our proximate-cause cases just before concluding that \u201c [accordingly, . . . the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u2018substantial-nexus\u2019 test is more faithful to the text of \u00a7 1333(b)\u201d than the Third Circuit\u2019s but-for test. <em>Ante, </em>at 222, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 690. In the opinion below, moreover, the Ninth Circuit purported to endorse the Fifth Circuit\u2019s pre-1989 case law, which required \u201c \u2018that the claimant show a nexus . . . similar to the proximate cause test in tort law.\u2019 \u201d 604 F.3d 1126, 1140 (CA9 2010) (quoting <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>846 F.2d 1013, 1015 (CA5 1988), rev\u2019d en banc, 877 F.2d 356 (1989)). Who knows whether this is a <em>tertium quid, </em>or not? The Court has given us a new test whose contours are entirely undescribed, and which has nothing to be said for it except that it will add complexity to the law and litigation to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Finally, I must note an additional uncertainty (or else a peculiarity) that the Court\u2019s opinion creates: The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>statutory text at issue requires compensation for \u201cdisability or death of an employee <em>resulting from </em>any injury <em>occurring as the result of </em>operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf ....\u201d\u00a7 1333(b) (emphasis added). Before today, I would have thought it clear that courts must apply proximate-cause analysis to the \u201cresulting from\u201d provision; but that would seem quite peculiar if (as the Court holds today) we apply substantial-nexus analysis to the neighboring \u201coccurring as the result of\u2019 provision. Surely both</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">[565 U.S. 227]</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">phrases express the same concept. What a tangled web we weave.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment to remand the case to the Benefits Review Board, but with instructions to apply a proximate-cause test.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-11\"> Strange to say, the California Supreme Court has held that this unmistakable term-of-art reference to a rule found in the common law of torts does <em>not </em>establish a rule \u201cidentical to that found in the common law of torts,\u2019\u2019 but merely \u201celaborat[es] the general requirement that the injury arise out of the employment.\u2019\u2019 <em>LaTourette </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation App. Bd., </em>17 Cal. 4th 644, 651, n. 1, 72 Cal.
