Voluminous consumer complaints</p>\n<p id=\"AtTcR\">[565 U.S. 371]</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">about abuses of telephone technology\u2014for example, computerized calls dispatched to private homes\u2014 prompted Congress to pass the TCPA. Congress determined that federal legislation was needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls.  The Act bans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) to prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices and to recover damages on their residents\u2019 behalf. The Commission must be notified of such suits and may intervene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA suits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts. Congress also provided for civil actions by private parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA or of the Commission\u2019s implementing regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple violations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Services, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced an action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Mims invoked the court\u2019s \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction, <em>i.e., </em>its authority to adjudicate claims \u201carising under the . . . laws ... of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The District Court, affirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims\u2019s complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. Both courts relied on Congress\u2019 specification, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek redress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission\u2019s regulations thereunder) \u201cin an appropriate court of [a] State,\u201d \u201cif [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [that] State.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 227(b)(3), (c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">The question presented is whether Congress\u2019 provision for private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state courts the <em>exclusive </em>arbiters of such actions. We have long recognized</p>\n<p id=\"A-Xp4\">[565 U.S. 372]</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">that \u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.\u201d <em>American Well Works Co. </em>v. <em>Layne &amp; Bowler Co., </em>241 U.S. 257, 260, 36 S. Ct. 585, 60 L. Ed. 987 (1916). Beyond doubt, the TCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will govern the case.  We find no convincing reason to read into the TCPA\u2019s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts any barrier to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>U. S. district courts\u2019 exercise of the general federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed since 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a7 1, 18 Stat. 470; 13D C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, <em>&amp; </em>R. Freer, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). We hold, therefore, that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings relevant here. \u201cUnrestricted telemarketing,\u201d Congress determined, \u201ccan be an intrusive invasion of privacy.\u201d TCPA, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 5, 105 Stat. 2394, note following 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227 (Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omitted). In particular, Congress reported, \u201c[m]any consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance [telemarketing] calls to their homes.\u201d \u00b6 6, <em>ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A]utomated or prerecorded telephone calls\u201d made to private residences, Congress found, were rightly regarded by recipients as \u201can invasion of privacy.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12, <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Although over half the States had enacted statutes restricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal law was needed because \u201ctelemarketers [could] evade [state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.\u201d \u00b6 7, <em>ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). See also S. Rep. No. 102-178,</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">[565 U.S. 373]</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">p. 3 (1991) (\u201c[B]ecause States do not have jurisdiction over interstate calls [,] [m]any States have expressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA principally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it unlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the prior express consent of the called party, to call any emergency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular telephone, or other service for which the receiver is charged for the call. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A). Second, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded voice messages to call residential telephone lines without prior express consent. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act proscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic telephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a business\u2019 telephone lines simultaneously. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban artificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses, \u00a7 227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from the law\u2019s requirements, \u00a7\u00a7 227(b)(2)(B), (C). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Act also directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the privacy of residential</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">[565 U.S. 374]</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">telephone subscribers, possibly through the creation of a national \u201cdo not call\u201d system. \u00a7 227(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Congress provided complementary means of enforcing the Act. State Attorneys General may \u201cbring a civil action on behalf of [state] residents,\u201d if the Attorney General \u201chas reason to believe that any person has engaged ... in a pattern or practice\u201d of violating the TCPA or FCC regulations thereunder. \u00a7 227(g)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). \u201cThe district courts of the United States . . . have exclusive jurisdiction\u201d over all TCPA actions brought by State Attorneys General. \u00a7 227(g)(2). The Commission may intervene in such suits. \u00a7 227(g)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Title 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(3), captioned \u201cPrivate right of action,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-8\">\u201cA person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-9\">\u201c(A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-10\">\u201c(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-11\">\u201c(C) both such actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-12\">\u201cIf the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-13\">[565 U.S. 375]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-14\">amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">A similar provision authorizes a private right of action for a violation of the FCC\u2019s implementing regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">Mims, a Florida resident, alleged that Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, repeatedly used an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims\u2019s cellular phone without his consent. Commencing suit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Mims charged that Arrow \u201cwillfully or knowingly violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>TCPA.\u201d App. 14. He sought declaratory relief, a permanent injunction, and damages. <em>Id., </em>at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The District Court held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Mims\u2019s TCPA claim. Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 was unavailable \u201cbecause Congress vested jurisdiction over [private actions under] the TCPA exclusively in state courts.\u201d Civ. No. 09-22347 (SD Fla., Apr. 1, 2010), App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a-5a (citing <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Hooters of Augusta, Inc., </em>136 F.3d 1287 (CA11 1998)). Adhering to Circuit precedent, the U.

Ct. 3063, 180 L. Ed. 2d 884 (2011), to resolve a split among the Circuits as to whether Congress granted state courts exclusive jurisdiction over private actions brought under the TCPA. Compare <em>Murphey </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>204 F.3d 911, 915 (CA9 2000) (U. S. district courts lack federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA actions), <em>ErieNet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Velocity Net, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 513, 519 (CA3 1998) (same), <em>Foxhall Realty Law Offices, Inc. </em>v. <em>Telecommunications Premium Servs., Ltd., </em>156 F.3d 432, 434 (CA2 1998) (same), <em>Nicholson, </em>136 F.3d, at 1287-1288 (same), <em>Chair King, Inc. </em>v. <em>Houston Cellular Corp., </em>131 F.3d 507, 514 (CA5 1997) (same), and <em>International Science &amp; Technology Inst. </em>v. <em>Inacom Communications, Inc., </em>106 F.3d 1146, 1158 (CA4 1997) (same), with <em>Charvat </em>v. <em>EchoStar Satellite, LLC, </em>630 F.3d 459, 463-465 (CA6 2010) (U.

We now hold that  Congress did not deprive federal courts of federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Federal courts, though \u201ccourts of limited jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Kokkonen </em>v. <em>Guardian Life Ins.

Ed. 257 (1821).  Congress granted federal courts general federal question jurisdiction in 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a7 1, 18 Stat. 470.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As now codified, the law provides: \u201cThe district</p>\n<p id=\"AcQsn\">[565 U.S. 377]</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The statute originally included an amount-in-controversy requirement, set at $500. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a7 1, 18 Stat. 470. Recognizing the responsibility of federal courts to decide claims, large or small, arising under federal law, Congress in 1980 eliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement in federal question (but not diversity) cases. See Federal Question Jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Amendments Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 2369 (amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331). See also H. R. Rep. No. 96-1461, p. 1 (1980)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apart from deletion of the amount-in-controversy requirement, the general federal question provision has remained essentially unchanged since 1875. See 13D Wright &amp; Miller 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the rules of decision, Mims\u2019s TCPA claim, in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u2019s words, plainly \u201caris[es] under\u201d the \u201claws ... of the United States.\u201d As already noted, <em>supra, </em>at 371, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 889,  \u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.\u201d <em>American Well Works, </em>241 U.S., at 260, 36 S. Ct. 585, 60 L. Ed. 987. Although courts have described this formulation as \u201cmore useful for inclusion than for . . . exclusion,\u201d <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>478 U.S. 804, 809, n. 5, 106 S. Ct. 3229, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1986) (quoting <em>T. B. Harms Co. </em>v. <em>Eliscu, </em>339 F.2d 823, 827 (CA2 1964)), there is no serious debate that a federally created claim for relief is generally a \u201csufficient condition for federal-question jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg., </em>545 U.S. 308, 317, 125 S.

In cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law, we note, there is a \u201cdeeply rooted presumption in favor of concurrent state court jurisdiction,\u201d rebuttable if \u201cCongress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a particular federal claim.\u201d <em>Tafflin </em>v. <em>Levitt, </em>493 U.S. 455, 458-459, 110 S. Ct. 792, 107 L. Ed. 2d 887 (1990). <em>E.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 (\u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of: (1) Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction . . . .\u201d). The presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, we have recognized, can be overcome \u201cby an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests.\u201d <em>Gulf Offshore Co. </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>453 U.S. 473, 478, 101 S. Ct. 2870, 69 L. Ed. 2d 784 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Arrow readily acknowledges the presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, but maintains that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 creates no converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead, Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>displaces \u00a7 1331, an earlier, more general prescription. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29; Brief for Respondent 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Section 1331, our decisions indicate, is not swept away so easily. As stated earlier, see <em>supra, </em>at 377, 181 L. Ed. 2d, at 893,  when federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the substantive rules of decision, the claim arises under federal law, and district courts possess federal-question jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"AJ0se\">[565 U.S. 379]</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">under \u00a7 1331.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That principle endures unless Congress divests federal courts of their \u00a7 1331 adjudicatory authority.

Second, Senator Hollings did not mention federal-court jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(3) is intended to divest federal courts of authority to hear TCPA claims.

Third, even if we agreed with Arrow that Senator Hollings expected private TCPA actions to proceed solely in state courts, and even if other supporters shared his view, that expectation would not control our judgment on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u2019s compass.

Indeed, Arrow suggests, defendants could use removal as a mechanism to force small-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit rather than \u201cfigh[t] it out\u201d in the \u201cmore expensive federal forum.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Arrow\u2019s floodgates argument assumes \u201ca shocking degree of noncompliance\u201d with the Act, Reply Brief 11, and seems to us more imaginary than real. The current federal district court civil filing fee is $350. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914(a). How likely is it that a party would bring a $500 claim in, or remove a $500 claim to, federal court? Lexis and Westlaw searches turned up 65 TCPA claims removed to federal district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin since the Seventh Circuit held, in October 2005, that the Act does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on state courts. All 65 cases were class actions, not individual cases removed from small-claims court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There were also 26 private TCPA claims brought initially in federal district courts; of those, 24 were class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Nothing in the text, structure, purpose, or legislative history of the TCPA calls for displacement of the federal question jurisdiction U.
