A petition for certiorari will give the Court an opportunity to consider whether, in light of the huge sums currently deployed to buy candidates\u2019 allegiance, <em>Citizens United </em>should continue to hold sway. Because lower courts are bound to follow this Court\u2019s decisions until they are withdrawn or modified, however, <em>Rodriguez de Quijas </em>v. <em>Shearson /American Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.
