See Allen v. State, 42 Ala.App. 9, 150 So.2d 399, 401 (1963). Nevertheless, the appeal period has now expired and there is no state remedy presently available to determine the validity of appellant\u2019s claims which concern matters dehors the record. Hence, we hold that the exhaustion requirements of 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2254 have been met, since appellant presently has no available state remedy. Bell v. State of Alabama, 5 Cir., 367 F.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-21\">We conclude, therefore, that a return and an evidentiary hearing must be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
