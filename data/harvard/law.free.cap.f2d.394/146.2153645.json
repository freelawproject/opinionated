Therefore, the temporary injunction should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\"> It must be conceded that as a matter of policy the federal court should rarely undertake to inject itself in state court criminal proceedings. In this case the findings upon which the trial court based its decision are hypothetical and supposititious. They do not have the certainty which should be required to justify the trial court\u2019s action. Thus the court found that there will be a <em>\u201clikelihood\u201d </em>of presentation of inadmissible evidence ; the defendants <em>\u201cmight well suffer irreparable injury\u201d; </em>and that there <em>\u201cmight well\u201d </em>be a \u201clikelihood\u201d that a fair jury could not be obtained. In short there is no finding that prejudice or harm would in fact result from an open hearing. In our view a federal court injunction should not be based upon any such findings as those here referred to. Thus we do not reach other basic issues in the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
