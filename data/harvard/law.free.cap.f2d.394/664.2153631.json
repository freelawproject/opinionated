This appeal presents two distinct questions regarding the interpretation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 1051-1127: (1) Can a trademark infringement action be maintained by a trademark owner and his licensee against a sub-licensee while the sub-license agreement is still in effect; and (2) will a trademark infringement action lie where the alleged infringement though occurring in intrastate commerce has a substantial effect on interstate commerce? In the context of the instant case we answer both of the above questions in the affirmative and therefore we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Thomas Carvel, the owner of the Carvel name and trademarks which are registered with the United States Patent Office, has licensed Franchised Stores of New York, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to use the mark in its business which is the franchising of the use of the Carvel name in connection with the sale of ice cream products at retail stores. Franchised Stores, on April 11, 1955, pursuant to a \u201cDealer\u2019s Franchise Agreement\u201d sub-licensed Martin Winter to operate a Carvel store in East Northport, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">We have on a prior occasion dealt with the validity of the entire Carvel operation under the anti-trust laws. Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir.), cert. granted 379 U.S. 885, 85 S.Ct. 158, 13 L.Ed.2d 91 (1964), writ of cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, 381 U.S. 125, 85 S.Ct. 1364, 14 L.Ed.2d 284 (1965). The Federal Trade Commission has also given the matter consideration and filed a comprehensive report. Matter of Carvel Corp., CCH Trade Reg. Rep., Transfer Binder Par. 17,298 (1965). While the findings made by Judge Bar-tels (see infra) and those of Judge Dool-ing are expressed in somewhat different phraseology, they are in substance identical. Indeed, there is no real dispute as to the facts which will be outlined below.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">The basic document is the Dealer\u2019s Franchise Agreement which establishes the contractual relationship between the licensor and approximately 350 dealers operating individual Carvel retail stores in several states on the eastern seaboard. The Carvel operation is an extensive one, involving annual gross sales to the public and sales to the individual stores running into many millions of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The Preamble of the Dealer\u2019s Franchise Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">There has been created a unique system for the production, creation, sale and distribution at retail, of Carvel\u2019s Frozen Dairy Products made up in Car-vel forms and with toppings and flavorings made in accordance with Car-vel Specifications and formula sold in connection therewith. This Frozen Dairy Product is made in accordance with a Carvel formula, consisting of high quality ingredients, and is sold in fine sanitary stores, which are created in accordance with patented designs and specifications. The public has been accustomed to seek Carvel\u2019s Frozen Dairy Product at these unique Car-vel Stores * * *. The Dealer desires to operate a Carvel Store and Car-vel is willing and agrees that the Dealer operate a Carvel Store in accordance with the terms of this agreement. \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">Other pertinent clauses follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-16\">Fourth: During the term of this agreement, the Dealer agrees to sell at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the Carvel Store, Carvel\u2019s Frozen Dairy Product solely in accordance with the Manual and will sell no other product except as hereinafter expressly otherwise provided. If at any time the Dealer fails to maintain and operate a Carvel Store in accordance with the definition contained in this agreement and in the Manual, then the Dealer\u2019s failure to do so shall be deemed to be a breach of a vital term of this agreement and shall entitle Carvel, upon giving written notice to the Dealer, to terminate this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">Sixth : In order to safeguard the integrity of Carvel\u2019s trade-marks, the Dealer agrees that he will purchase from Carvel or from approved sources, designated by Carvel, his entire requirements of Carvel\u2019s Frozen Dairy Product mix, toppings, flavorings and other ingredients, cones and any other items sold as a part of the end product that is offered for consumption to the retail purchaser as scheduled in the Standard Operating Procedure Manual at prices indicated therein; * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">Seventeenth : * * * The Dealer recognizes that his Carvel Store is one of a large number of stores similarly built and selling to the public similar products, and hence the failure on the part of a single dealer to comply with many of the terms of this agreement could cause irreparable damage to all similar stores. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Dealer of any of the covenants or provisions of this agreement, Carvel shall have the immediate right to secure an order enjoining any such breach or threatened breach, and, if the agreement has been terminated, the Dealer may be enjoined from any continued operation of the Carvel Store, or any other operation in violation of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">Thirtieth : The rights and remedies of Carvel specifically provided for herein shall not be exclusive, but shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies to which Carvel shall be entitled at law or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint centers about their allegation that defendant sold certain products to the public in his store which were neither manufactured nor authorized by the Carvel organization. Defendant has admitted using \u201cLiberty\u201d syrup on Carvel products dispensed in \u201cCarvel\u201d marked containers and also selling \u201cMarchiony\u201d ices in unmarked paper squeeze cups, during the years 1964 and 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">A complaint was filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York in July 1965 and in September of that same year Judge Bartels issued a preliminary injunction enjoining defendant from selling non-Carvel items and products not authorized by the Franchise Agreement. Nevertheless, in July 1967, Judge Dooling denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction because the infringing acts occurred in intrastate commerce and were thus in his opinion not within the coverage of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Section 32 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S. C. Section 1114 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">(1) Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">(a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or color-able imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive; ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-15\">shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">Winter contends that Section 1114- has no application to any of his activities, including the sale of no\u00f1-Carvel products, because he has never employed a \u201creproduction, counterfeit or colorable imitation\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s trademarks but merely used the \u201cgenuine\u201d mark. Furthermore, he maintains that a trademark li-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>censor is estopped from proceeding against a licensee under the Lanham Act while the license agreement is still in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">We think Winter has misinterpreted the meaning and intent of Section 1114. The Lanham Act has as its object \u201cthe protection of trade-marks, securing to the owner the good will of his business and protecting the public against spurious and falsely marked goods.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1946), U.S.Code Cong.Serv.1946, p. 1274. The evil sought to be remedied in the trademark infringement action is that of \u201cpassing off\u201d \u2014 the \u201csale of another\u2019s goods as those of the trade-mark owner by use of the owner\u2019s mark.\u201d Developments in the Law, Trade-Marks and Unfair Competition, 68 Harv.L.Rev. 814, 818 (1955). It would be totally illogical to provide protection to a trademark owner where someone uses a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of the mark but to deny protection where the owner\u2019s own mark is employed to palm off on the public the merchandise of someone else. A cause of action for trademark infringement exists, assuming the requisite jurisdiction and connection with commerce are established, where an individual uses a trademark (1) without consent; (2) in connection with the sale of goods; (3) where such use is likely to cause confusion or to decieve purchasers as to the source or origin of the goods. Lyon v. Quality Courts United, Inc., 249 F.2d 790, 795 (6th Cir. 1957); Bulova Watch Co. v. Allerton Co., 328 F.2d 20 (7th Cir. 1964). Cf. Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders, 331 U.S. 125, 67 S.Ct. 1136, 91 L.Ed. 1386 (1947); Coca Cola Co. v. Foods, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 101 (D.C.S.D.1963); 3 Callmann, Unfair Competition and Trademarks, Section 84.2(e)' (2nd Ed. 1950). Though Winter in the instant case initially had permission to use the \u201cCarvel\u201d mark, that consent did not cover use of the mark on non-Carvel goods. It is obvious that the Carvel trademark was used in connection with the sale of unauthorized goods. \u201cLiberty\u201d syrup formed part of the ingredients used in \u201csodas and possibly sundaes\u201d which were dispensed in Carvel containers. Similarly, even though the \u201cMar-chiony\u201d ices were served in plain squeeze cups, the defendant must be deemed to have used the Carvel mark in connection with their sale since the mark \u201ccovers not only Carvel ice cream * * * but also the type of retail outlet at which Carvel ice cream is sold.\u201d In the Matter of Carvel Corp., CCH Trade Reg.Rep., Transfer Binder Par. 17,298 at 22.431 (1965). Finally, the sale of the non-Carvel products at defendant\u2019s store was likely to produce customer confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\"> Moreover, we reject as unsound the contention that a trademark licensor cannot proceed against the licensee while the license agreement is still in effect. The Lanham Act enables a trademark proprietor to enter into a form of \u201ccontrolled licensing.\u201d Thus Section 5 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1055 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhC8\">Where a registered mark or a mark sought to be registered is or may be used legitimately by related companies, such use shall inure to the benefit of the registrant or applicant for registration, and such use shall not affect the validity of such mark or of its registration, provided such mark is not used in such manner as to deceive the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">A related company, as defined in Section 45, 15 U.S.C. Section 1127, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">* * * Any person who legitimately controls or is controlled by the registrant or applicant for registration in respect to the nature and quality of the goods or services in connection with which the mark is used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Furthermore, the trademark owner\u2019s ability to grant licenses is restricted by the fact that failure on his part to control his licensees may result in the cancellation of the mark. Thus, Section 14, 15 U.S.C. Section 1064, provides that a mark may be cancelled if it \u201chas been abandoned\u201d and abandonment is defined in Section 45, 15 U.S.C. Section 1127, as including \u201cany course of conduct of the registrant, including acts of omission as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>well as commission, (which cause) the mark to lose its significance as an indicator of origin.\u201d Consequently, a trademark owner has \u201can affirmative duty * * * to take reasonable measures to detect and prevent misleading use of his mark by his licensees or suffer cancellation of his federal registration.\u201d Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart\u2019s Food Stores, Inc., 267 F.2d 358, 366 (2d Cir. 1959). See also Note, Quality Control and the Antitrust Laws in Trademark Licensing, 72 Yale L.J: 117 (1963). It would be anomalous on the one hand to burden the trademark owner with this \u201caffirmative\u201d duty and then on the other hand deny him a federal forum in which to control his licensees. We refuse to pursue this illogical course and hold that, assuming all the requisite elements of infringement are established, a trademark licensor may succeed in a trademark infringement action against one who is still his licensee. See Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons Co. v. Shelley Knitting Mills, Inc., 212 F.Supp. 715 (E.D. Pa.1962). Cf. Smith v. Dental Products Co., 140 F.2d 140 (7th Cir.), cert. denied 322 U.S. 743, 64 S.Ct. 1146, 88 L.Ed. 1576 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Judge Dooling dismissed the complaint because he felt that Section 1114 required that the alleged infringement actually occur in interstate commerce. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">It is true that prior to the enactment of the Lanham Act a federal remedy for trademark infringement would only lie if the infringing acts occurred in interstate commerce. See Dad\u2019s Root Beer Co. v. Doc\u2019s Beverages, Inc., 193 F.2d 77 (2d Cir. 1951); United States Printing &amp; Lithograph Co. v. Griggs, Cooper &amp; Co., 279 U.S. 156, 49 S.Ct. 267, 73 L.Ed. 650 (1929); Pure Oil Co. v. Puritan Oil Co., 127 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1942). However, by means of the Lanham Act the Congress sought to give trademarks nationally \u201cthe greatest protection that can be given them,\u201d S.Rep. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.1946, U.S.Code Cong.Serv.1946, p. 1277, and in order to effectuate that policy Section 45 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1127, significantly provides that the \u201cword commerce means all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.\u201d The Supreme Court has liberally construed the \u201cbroadened commerce provisions\u201d of the Lanham Act and recognized their \u201csweeping reach.\u201d Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 73 S.Ct. 252, 97 L.Ed. 252 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">It has long since been estabished that the Congress by virtue of its power to'\u201cregulate Commerce * * * among the several States\u201d may regulate purely intrastate commerce which exerts a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See, e. g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964). This interpretation has been widely followed in cases under the Lanham Act and federal subject matter jurisdiction has been upheld where an act of infringement though occurring in intrastate commerce has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See Pure Foods, Inc. v. Minute Maid Corp., 214 F.2d 792 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 348 U.S. 888, 75 S.Ct. 208, 99 L.Ed. 697 (1954); Iowa Farmers Union v. Farmers\u2019 Educational and Co-operative Union of America, 247 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1957); Lyon v. Quality Courts United, Inc., 249 F.2d 790 (6th Cir. 1957); Drop Dead Co. v. S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., 326 F.2d 87 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied 377 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L.Ed.2d 177 (1964). A substantial effect on interstate commerce is present when the trademark owner\u2019s reputation and good will, built up by use of the mark in interstate commerce, are adversely affected by an intrastate infringement. See Pure Foods, Inc. v. Minute Maid Corp., 214 F.2d 792 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 348 U.S. 888, 75 S.Ct. 208 (1954); Iowa Farmers Union v. Farmers\u2019 Educational and Co-operative Union of America, 247 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1957); Lyon v. Quality Courts United, Inc., 249 F.2d 790 (6th Cir. 1957). See also Robert,' Commentary on the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A., Substit. VII, c. 22, 268-269 (1948); Developments in the Law, Trade-Marks and Unfair Competition, 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Harv.L.Rev. 814, 882-883 (1955). Nevertheless, Winter maintains that his unauthorized sales of non-Carvel products, were <em>de minimis </em>and cannot possibly be deemed to have a sufficient effect on interstate commerce. However, the \u201csubstantial effect\u201d in this case does not result from the diversion of money from the Carvel licensor resulting from Winter\u2019s unauthorized sales. The \u201csubstantial effect\u201d test is satisfied because the sale of unauthorized products at individual Carvel stores has a potentially adverse effect on the entire Carvel chain. Thus in Susser v. Carvel Corp., 332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir.), cert. granted 379 U.S. 885, 85 S.Ct. 158, 13 L.Ed.2d 91 (1964), writ of cert. dismissed as improvidently granted 381 U.S. 125, 85 S.Ct. 1364, 14 L.Ed.2d 284 (1965), we recognized the need for quality control in order to protect the public image of the Carvel trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The result we reach here also finds support in our decision in Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart\u2019s Food Stores, Inc., 267 F.2d 358 (2d Cir. 1959). In that case we held that a trademark owner who had developed his mark by use in interstate commerce could enjoin the use by a defendant of a similar offending mark, even though the defendant was engaged in purely intrastate commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the plaintiff in <em>Dawn Donut </em>could maintain a trademark infringement action against a defendant engaged in solely intrastate commerce, Carvel should similarly be able to proceed against Winter. The two cases merely represent different types of infringement and this is not a valid basis for refusing to assert jurisdiction in either instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">American Auto Association v. Spiegel, 205 F.2d 771 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 346 U.S. 887, 74 S.Ct. 138, 98 L.Ed. 391 (1953), relied upon by the District Court below is inapposite. That case merely held that Section 44 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1126, did not give the federal courts jurisdiction over all claims for unfair competition brought by those engaged in interstate commerce. See Vanity Fair Mills, Inc. v. T. Eaton Co., 234 F.2d 633, 645 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 352 U.S. 871, 77 S.Ct. 96, 1 L.Ed.2d 76 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Finally, we note that on remand the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1338(b) and the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction will be able to consider in addition to plaintiffs\u2019 trademark infringement claim, their related causes of action for unfair competition and breach of contract. See Hazel Bishop Inc. v. Perfemme, Inc., 314 F.2d 399, 5 A.L.R.3d 1031 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">The order appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\">. The original agreement was signed by \u201cCarvel Stores of New York, Inc.\u201d but that entity has since changed its name to Franchised Stores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">. The case actually only laid down guidelines for future use, as <em>Dawn Donut Co., </em>at the time suit was commenced, had not attempted to use its mark in defendant\u2019s market area.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
