On April 16, 1959, Mrs. Henley filed an application with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to establish a period of disability which would entitle her to benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416 (i). Her applicatiqn was denied both initially and upon reconsideration. A hearing was granted but the hearing examiner denied Mrs. Henley\u2019s claim based on the testimony and documents presented to him. The Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration declined to review the hearing examiner\u2019s decision. Mrs. Henley brought suit in the court below pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to review the final decision of the Secretary. Relief was refused, and as noted, the court below granted summary judgment for the ap-pellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-27\">The primary question before the court below and before this court is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>there was substantial evidence in the record to support the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that Mrs. Henley was not \u201cdisabled\u201d, as that term is defined in 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 423(c) (2) of the Act, on September 30, 1948, the date on which Mrs. Henley last met the earnings requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c) (1) which would entitle her to disability benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We agree with the court below that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding by the hearing examiner. We also find no merit in the other contentions raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Accordingly, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
