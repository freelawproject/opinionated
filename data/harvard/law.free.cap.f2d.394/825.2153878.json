The penalty provision of this section states that one convicted thereunder shall be imprisoned for \u201cnot less than five or more than twenty years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000.\u201d Each of appellant\u2019s co-defendants received five year sentences but appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve years. He filed a motion to reduce or modify this sentence pursuant to Rule 35, F.R.Cr.P., in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The motion was denied and Rodriquez has prosecuted this appeal in forma pauperis and without appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">The question of appellate review of sentencing has recently received much advocacy as a needed reform to prevent unjustifiable disparities in the sentences meted to co-defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arguments pro and con for such a review have almost universally been left to the legislative branch of government. Appellate courts have generally refused to disturb the trial court\u2019s discretion in this matter unless the punishment is so disproportionate to the offense committed and to the sentences received by co-defendants \u201cas to be completely arbitrary and shocking to the sense of justice and thus to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. See Rogers v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 520.\u201d Boerngen v. United States, 326 F.2d 326, 329 (5 Cir. 1964). The universality of court decisions in refusing appellate review of sentences led Judge Stone to comment in the case of Gurera v. United States, 40 F.2d 338, 340 (8 Cir. 1930):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-18\">\u201cIf there is one rule in the federal criminal practice which is firmly established, it is that the appellate court has no control over a sentence which is within the limits allowed by a statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah-G\">Finding no abuse in the discretion exercised by the trial court in passing sentence, we affirm. Zaffarano v. Blackwell, 383 F.2d 719 (5 Cir. 1967) and other cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\">.
