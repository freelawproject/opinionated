The Board found in a Decision and Order reported at 158 NLRB-(No. 31) (1966) that the Respondent violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5) and (1), by refusing to bargain with the certified bargaining representative of a group of its employees. Respondent does not contest the fact of its refusal to bargain but contends that the unit covered by the certification was inappropriate, and therefore it was under no legal duty to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">The power of this Court' to set aside the Board\u2019s determination of an appropriate bargaining unit is a narrow one, limited to a determination of whether the Board has violated the proscriptions of Section 9(c) (5), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c) (5), by giving controlling weight to the extent of organization or has otherwise abused its discretion. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 330 F.2d 62 (6th Cir. 1964), vacated and remanded on other grounds 380 U.S. 525, 85 S.Ct. 1326, 14 L.Ed.2d 265 (1965). In the instant case the Board found that a grouping of Respondent\u2019s Cleveland 1 and 2 offices, the only offices in the City of Cleveland, was an appropriate bargaining unit. In his decision the Trial Examiner articulated several bases for his ruling. See National Labor Relations Board v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 380 U.S. 438, 443 n. 6, 85 S.Ct. 1061, 13 L.Ed.2d 951 (1965). We cannot say that the Board gave controlling weight to the extent of union organization or otherwise abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">Respondent\u2019s contention that it was denied due process we find to be without substance. It is therefore ordered that the petition of the National Labor Relations Board to enforce its order be, and it is, hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
