Noting that other counsel had been appointed for defendant three months earlier and that the eleventh-hour plea for delay was highly contingent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">On the day of trial, a week after the arraignment, court-appointed counsel made the second motion for a continuance. He alleged that he needed more time to secure the services of a psychiatrist, despite the fact that he had been preparing his ease from August to November, 1967. This motion was also denied, and the case was tried before a jury which found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-23\">Neither when the continuances were requested nor at trial, was any evidence of mental illness presented that might possibly meet even the minimal standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>necessary to put into question the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the commission of the crime. See Hall v. United States, 295 F.2d 26 (4th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Finding no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s denial of either motion for continuance, we affirm the conviction. See United States v. Hutchison, 352 F.2d 404 (4th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-14\">. The contingent event never materialized as defendant\u2019s mother was unable to secure the necessary funds and consequently the lawyer failed to take any further ' steps on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
