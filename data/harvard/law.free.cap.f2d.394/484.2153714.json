The first count of indictment No. 13,746 charges that appellant placed a call from Dallas, Texas to Nashville, Tennessee with the intent to distribute the proceeds of, and to promote an unlawful activity, namely, prostitution, in violation of the laws of Tennessee. The second count charges that on the same date he caused one Barbara Jean White to send a telegraphic money order from Nashville, Tennessee, to him in Dallas, Texas with intent to distribute the proceeds of prostitution. Six counts of the other indictment, on which a conviction was had, charged Wingo with either making telephone calls to Nashville, Tennessee from some other state with the intent of distributing the proceeds of prostitution, or with causing someone to wire him the proceeds of prostitution from Nashville, Tennessee to another state. The remaining count on which he was convicted charged that appellant caused Louise Wingo to travel in interstate commerce from Nashville to Dallas, Texas, with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, and facilitate the promotion, management, establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ment or carrying on of an unlawful activity, that is, prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Appellant has been engaged in promoting prostitution for many years and during the periods with which the indictments are concerned operated a house of prostitution in Nashville, Tennessee. At the same time, he was also engaged in the legitimate business of interstate produce hauling by truck from a Nashville base of operations. The evidence clearly establishes and appellant admits that he used interstate facilities to request and receive the transmission of funds on the dates charged in the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The appeal raises the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to permit the jury to find that these funds were proceeds of his concededly illicit occupation. It also questions the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that he transported his then wife, who was also a prostitute, from Tennessee to Texas with the intent to promote or facilitate the carrying on his unlawful calling. Finally, it raises the question of the correctness -of an illustration employed by the District Court in its instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">A careful examination of the record reveals the existence of a jury question in each of the counts charging the interstate request and transmission of proceeds of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The count which charges appellant with knowingly causing Louise Win-go (his former wife) to travel in interstate commerce from Nashville, Tennessee to Dallas, Texas with intent to promote the carrying on of prostitution also finds ample evidentiary support. The uncontradicted facts show that Louise, who had been introduced into prostitution after bearing appellant\u2019s children, had become addicted to \u201cdope\u201d and that this affliction impaired her efficiency as a prostitute. The purpose of the trip to Texas was to permit her to rest and recuperate in the home of appellant\u2019s parents. She testified that appellant, who suggested and financed the trip, \u201c * * * said I would be better balanced and better equipped to work * * * [at] prostitution.\u201d Compare Mortensen v. United States, 322 U.S. 369, 64 S.Ct. 1037, 88 L.Ed. 1331 (1944), where the interstate transportation of prostitutes was on an innocent vacation and in no way related to the practice of their trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Finally, the contention relating to the example<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> employed in the jury instructions is also without merit. Appellant, relying on Smith v. United States, 230 F.2d 935 (6th Cir. 1956), claims that the illustration did not incorporate his contention advanced in defense that the transmitted funds were proceeds of his lawful trucking business. Other portions of the charge, however, fairly set forth his theory. See United States v. Stirone, 311 F.2d 277 (3rd Cir. 1962). The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>error in the illustration, the requirement of a further act to carry out the unlawful enterprise, favored appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"APn\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">.
