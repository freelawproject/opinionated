Rachlin, attorney for the trustee in bankruptcy of a retail lumber firm in the Western District of New York, requested $3,815 compensation for services to the bankrupt estate, and appeals from the referee\u2019s allowance of only $1,500, which the district court confirmed. He asserts that he devoted 74 hours to preparing the sale of some real estate (12 hours of which were spent in locating a buyer), 15 hours to endeavoring to collect accounts receivable (though his legal expertise concededly was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>quired for only half of this time),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 11% hours to examining the bankrupt\u2019s books, records and officers (which he conceded not to require legal training), and 8% hours to miscellaneous matters (2% of which were not specifically legal work). He computed his requested fee by multiplying this total of 109 hours by his \u201ccustomary\u201d time charge of $35 per hour. Chief Judge Henderson, in confirming the referee\u2019s award, noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5V\">\u201cA review of the petition of the attorney for the trustee indicates that counsel here also undertook general management of the estate and that while much of his effort may have required the exercise of sound judgment, it did not require his legal expertise,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">and \u201cfound the present allowance reasonable for legal services performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The referee and the judge were clearly correct in denying compensation for services which did not require legal expertise. The Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 47, contemplates that it is the trustees who shall \u201ccollect and reduce to money the property of the estates for which they are trustees\u201d and \u201cexamine the bankrupts\u201d ; and \u00a7 48 sets the maximum allowance the trustees may receive for these services. While General Order 44 permits the bankruptcy court to authorize the trustee to employ an attorney where it is satisfied \u201cthat his employment would be to the best interests of the estate,\u201d General Order 42 ensures that the mandate of \u00a7 72 be respected by providing that \u201cNo allowance of compensation shall be made to any attorney for a * * * trustee * * * except for professional services.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, in a similar ease decided by this court thirty-seven years ago, in which the attorney also requested compensation \u201cfor arranging for the sale of the assets, * * collecting accounts due, * * * examining the bankrupt\u2019s papers, and more of the sort,\u201d Judge Learned Hand went out of his way to dispel \u201cthe curious notion,\u201d apparently widespread then too, \u201cthat an attorney may recover for what are not legal services at all.\u201d He pointed out that except for this notion \u201cit would seem scarcely necessary to say that the receiver or trustee, and he alone, can recover for services in collecting the estate,\u201d and that while the line between legal and non-legal services \u201cis not always easy to draw, * * * it is there, and referees should draw it straitly, else the estate will be burdened with a duplication of charges.\u201d In re Eureka Upholstering Co., Inc., 48 F.2d 95, 96 (2 Cir. 1931).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Connelly v. Hancock, Dorr, Ryan &amp; Shove, 195 F.2d 864, 869 (2 Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Appellant argues that even if the nonlegal work he performed was non-com-pensable,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he should still receive more than $20 per hour for the 76 hours he claims to have spent on purely legal matters. He buttresses this by pointing out that the Erie County Bar Association minimum fee schedule calls for $25 to $50 per hour for legal work, and contends that smaller allowances will tend to drive competent men out of bankruptcy practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"> Attorneys\u2019 fees in bankruptcy liquidation are governed by \u201cthe economical spirit of the Bankruptcy Act,\u201d and the amounts which \u201cprivate clients are expected and wont to pay for similar services\u201d are not determinative. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 62.12, and cases cited therein at nn. 76 &amp; 85. Rather, a \u201cbalance must be struck between two competing interests; that the cost of bankruptcy should not itself consume the very res the proceedings are designed to protect; and that fees allowed be such as not to discourage competent counsel from active and effective participation.\u201d Jacobowitz v. Double Seven Corp., 378 F.2d 405, 409 (9 Cir. 1967) (Merrill, J., dissenting). The referee, who is required by \u00a7 35(4) of the Act to reside and have his office in the district for which he is appointed, and the district judge, both directly engaged in supervising the administration of bankrupt estates, are in a better position than circuit judges, often in a distant city, to assess the supply curve of competent attorneys and strike the proper balance. See In re Paramount Merrick, Inc., 252 F.2d 482, 485 (2 Cir. 1958); General Order 47. Moreover, an attorney\u2019s compensation is a function not only of time spent but of other factors as well. We have often indicated our adherence to the generally accepted formula that the \u201cprincipal factors which enter into a determination of what is reasonable are,\u201d in addition to \u201cthe time spent, the intricacy of the questions involved, the size of the estate, the opposition encountered, the results obtained and the \u2018economic spirit\u2019 of the Bankruptcy Act to curtail unnecessary expenses.\u201d In re Paramount Merrick, Inc., supra, 252 F.2d at 485.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\"> We have no reason to doubt that the referee took these factors into account in determining the allowance for the services that were properly compensable. Although a somewhat higher allowance might have been warranted, courts of appeals are properly \u201creluctant,\u201d as we stated in In re Paramount Merrick, Inc., supra, \u201cto overturn the determination\u201d of the referee and the district judge \u201cunless it can be shown that the allowance was arbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d The allowance amounts to 6.5% of the estate, only .6% less than the 1966 national average, see Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Division of Bankruptcy Administration, Tabulation of Costs of Administration 1966. While this would not be determinative if unusual services were involved, see Jacobowitz v. Double Seven Corp., 378 F.2d 405, 407 (9 Cir. 1967) (majority opinion), it provides some assurance that there was no unfairness in a case like this where the services required, while not insubstantial, were in no way extraordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">. The accounts he collected without litigation yielded about $500; those whose collection required litigation apparently yielded even less.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">. The Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States held on March 30-31, 1967 noted at p. 34 that the Committee on Bankruptcy Administration</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201crecommended that General Orders 42 and 44 be closely observed and no attorney\u2019s fee be allowed without an appropriate and detailed fee application which should include professional duties only and should never be based on du-' ties properly performed by a trustee, receiver or other non-professional officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">. Since \u00a7 72 of the Act as amended in 1938 limits the trustee\u2019s compensation only for services <em>required </em>of him, see In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co., 361 F.2d 164, 166 (2 Cir. 1966), some districts have sought to produce somewhat larger individual compensation without burdening the estate, and also to avoid line-drawing problems, by appointing trustees who are also lawyers as attorneys <em>pro se </em>upon proper petition under General Order 44. See Proceedings of Third Seminar for Referees in Bankruptcy 13 (1966); 3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 62.12; 4A id. \u00a7 72.01. This procedure would seem acceptable and even desirable in the ease of small or medium sized estates heading for liquidation, since there is little reason why two people should have to familiarize themselves with the relevant facts at the estate\u2019s expense. Clearly, for example, the six hours the attorney here spent communicating with the trustee would have been saved by a unitary administration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\">. General Order 42 is a sufficient answer to the contention that this work, if not compensable at professional rates, is at least compensable at some lower rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">. In re Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad Co., 339 F.2d 114 (2 Cir. 1964), and In re Wal-Feld Co., Inc., 345 F.2d 676 (2 Cir. 1965), hold that where a law firm provides a wide range of services for a trustee over a considerable period of time and ultimate payment is virtually assured, \u201ctime required\u201d is a principal method of valuation and there is \u201cno excuse for an established law firm to rely on estimates made on the eve of payment and almost entirely unsupported by daily records or for it to expect a court to do so.\u201d This does not mean, however, that even in these cases the referee should ignore the other factors mentioned above.
