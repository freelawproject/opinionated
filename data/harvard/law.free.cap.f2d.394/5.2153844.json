The textwriters suggest that when the observer testifies to the accuracy of his report to the recorder and the latter testifies to the accuracy of the recording, the trial court may in its discretion admit the contents of the written report as the recorded past recollection of the observer. 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 751 (3d ed. 1940); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 279 (1954 ed). In any event, even if the evidence were hearsay reversal would not be required since the admissible evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. United States v. Watkins, 369 F.2d 170, 172 (7th Cir. 1967); United States v. Press, 336 F.2d 1003, 1013 (2d Cir. 1964); United States v. Cianchetti, 315 F.2d 584, 590 (2d Cir. 1963). We note also that in admitting the evidence the Court carefully admonished the jury that \u201cevidence of this type is so far removed or so many steps removed from the person who originally claimed to have noted the license plate, it is sometimes extremely unreliable. Whether or not this is or isn\u2019t will be ultimately for you to weigh and only you, but you should look at it with some degree of caution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
