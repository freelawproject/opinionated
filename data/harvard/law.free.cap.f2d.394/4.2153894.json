Appellant\u2019s conviction preceded Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Appellant\u2019s statements were admissible under the standards established in Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964). The first group of statements was taken during the investigatory rather than the accusatory stage in the criminal process. 378 U.S. at 492, 84 S.Ct. 1758. It does not appear that appellant requested and was denied counsel before giving the second group of statements. Wilson v. Anderson, 379 F.2d 330, 334 (9th Cir. 1967); Manning v. State of California, 378 F.2d 357 (9th Cir. 1967). In light of the contents of the statements, admission of the third group of statements following the proper admission of the first two groups was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. State of California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Thompson v. United States, 382 F.2d 390, 394 (9th Cir. 1967); Wilson v. Anderson, 379 F.2d 330, 331 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
