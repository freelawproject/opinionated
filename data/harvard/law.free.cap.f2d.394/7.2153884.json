Simon, 2 Cir., 393 F.2d 90, cited as a precedent for the relief sought here, the court had the power to issue a writ of mandamus (although it never became necessary for the court to do so because the district judge complied with the court\u2019s suggestion that he voluntarily recuse himself), since that application was accompanied by an affidavit of bias and prejudice. No such affidavit accompanied the instant application. Accordingly we hold that we do not have jurisdiction to entertain the application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
