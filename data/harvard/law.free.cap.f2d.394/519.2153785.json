He now says that he handed copies of a petition (addressed to this court) to the prison notary at Florida State Prison on September 6, 1966, and had them notarized on that date. He attaches a photostat of that petition, including the notarization. He implies, though he does not say explicitly, that he requested that the petition be sent to the court and served on the Government. He does say expressly that other papers he tried to send from that prison to various officials and courts were never mailed by the authorities to whom he gave them, and also (with reference to supporting documentation) that he was punished \u201cso many times for being a \u2018jail house lawyer\u2019 and \u2018counselor\u2019 that he just couldn\u2019t take the risk of further prison punishment\u201d by telling this court that the prison officials had delayed transmitting his papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">In these circumstances \u2014 particularly the handwritten \u201ccomplaint\u201d to this court notarized on September 6, 1966 \u2014 we now think that a trial should be had on the issue of whether plaintiff attempted to send, from jail, a petition to this court on or before September 26, 1966. Cf. Fallen v. United States, 378 U.S. 139, 84 S.Ct. 1689, 12 L.Ed.2d 760 (1964). Plaintiff is very tardy in supporting his claim that he made this attempt, but he is a non-lawyer acting <em>pro se </em>and we shall not treat his case as if he had been represented by counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Accordingly, we vacate our prior order granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismissing the petition as barred by limitations. Instead, we deny the defendant\u2019s motion without prejudice, and remand the case to the trial commissioner for a trial or other proceeding on the issue of whether plaintiff attempted properly to transmit, from jail, a petition to this court on or before September 26, 1966. The commissioner will report the facts and circumstances bearing on that question, together with his recommendation whether or not this suit was timely begun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-11\">. The petition for rehearing shows that, after his release from Florida State Prison in February 1967, plaintiff was incarcerated by the federal authorities until September 1, 1967. We were therefore incorrect in saying, in footnote 4 of our original opinion, that he was not under the handicap of being jailed when he filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>his formal petition in July 1967. See, also, the third sentence of footnote 5 of that opinion. (It remains true that he was not under that handicap when he prepared and filed his briefs on the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-25\">. We do not, in any way, modify our holdings that the claim arose on September 26, 1960, and that the action was commenced <em>no later </em>than October 1966 (toward the end of that month).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
