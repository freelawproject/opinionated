Morehead v. State of California, 339 F.2d 170 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b443-28\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"b443-29\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b443-30\">Appellant contends that the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 has been satisfied because a petition for habeas corpus raising the constitutional issues was submitted to and denied by a state trial court, and \u201cThese issues * * * need only be presented once.\u201d Schiers v. People of State of California, 333 F.2d 173, 174 (9th Cir. 1964) . <em>Schiers </em>holds only that the issues raised and rejected in an appeal from a judgment of conviction need not be submitted a second time to the state courts through state habeas corpus proceedings. Blair v. People of State of California, 340 F.2d 741, 744 (9th Cir. 1965) is to the same effect. <em>Schiers </em>does not hold that a habeas corpus petitioner may move directly from a state trial court to a federal court without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>first submitting the issues to state appellate tribunals. To the contrary, \u201c[i]t is apparent that appellant must first perfect his appeal throughout the State court hierarchy before requesting relief from the federal courts.\u201d Morehead v. State of California, 339 F.2d 170, 171 (9th Cir. 1964). It would be particularly inappropriate to by-pass the state appellate courts in this case for the decision principally relied upon by appellant, Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967), was announced after the denial of appellant\u2019s petition by the state trial court \u201cand the California courts have never had an opportunity to appraise petitioner\u2019s rights in the light of that opinion.\u201d <em>Schiers, </em>supra, 333 F.2d at 177, Accord, <em>Blair, </em>supra, 340 F.2d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
