Plaintiff has twice amended his complaint, by leave of court, and was denied leave to amend again. This was a matter in the District Judge\u2019s discretion and we find no abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-24\">Despite repeated invitations by this court, addressed to counsel for appellant during oral argument, he failed to make a sufficient proffer to distinguish Winter v. Crowley, 245 Md. 313, 226 A.2d 304 (1967), which held that a contempt action arising out of the identical situation which led to the underlying contempt proceeding here was civil in nature. He further failed to indicate any facts which might constitute one of the limited recognized exceptions to the Maryland rule that \u201cno action will lie for the malicious prosecution of a civil suit where there has been no arrest of the person, no seizure of the property of the defendant and no special injury sustained * * Shamberger v.
