Gardner, Sec., 6 Cir., 394 F.2d 111, was whether appellant had reached the age of 65 when he initially applied for Social Security benefits in 1957. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky affirmed the Secretary\u2019s final decision against appellant, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">As in his brother\u2019s ease, appellant relied upon the testimony of numerous witnesses to support his claim that he was born in 1892. However, the Secretary\u2019s finding that appellant was born in 1910, or thereabouts, is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and is therefore conclusive. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Secretary\u2019s further finding that appellant was not without fault in causing the overpay-ments is likewise supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and is conclusive on review. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"AZY\">It is ordered that the judgment of the District Court be and hereby is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
