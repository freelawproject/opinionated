He contends that \u201cthe wages of the wife of the debtor are (were) essential and necessary for the family and for the stability of the proposed Plan,\u201d and that the garnishment proceedings, if maintained, will make his Plan ineffective. The Referee in Bankruptcy denied the application for a restraining order, \u201cthe wife not having filed a Chapter XIII, and she not being a party to the proceedings.\u201d Although finding that the garnishment would \u201cseriously affect the operation of the debtor\u2019s extension plan\u201d, the District Court sustained the ruling of the Referee. In so doing, it expressed sympathy \u201cwith the position of the debt- or\u201d and suggested that injunctive relief could be secured if the wife would \u201cfile a debtor proceeding in her own behalf.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-22\">.
