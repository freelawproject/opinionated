He attacks the sufficiency of the affidavit upon which the Commissioner issued a search warrant that led to the seizure of 695 gallons of illegal whiskey at Turner\u2019s residence. The affidavit described in detail the transfer of plastic containers and cartons, similar to those used in the traffic of illicit liquor, from the defendant\u2019s house to several cars and trucks, and the removal of 5-gallon empty cans from the house, during three nights when the officers kept the premises under surveillance. We agree with the district court that the affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. Cf. United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965). We also find the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s finding of guilt. The conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b156-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
