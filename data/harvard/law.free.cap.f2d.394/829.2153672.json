We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">There are four specifications of error. The first is that the court refused to order the production of daily time and expense sheets maintained by a narcotics agent witness. Following the witness\u2019s testimony appellant demanded production of the agent\u2019s investigative report, his case summary, and his time sheets under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1964). The first two were available and were produced. The last had been sent to Washington and was therefore not available. Appellant moved to strike the agent\u2019s testimony unless the time sheets were immediately produced. The court agreed that appellant was entitled to the reports, but declined to strike the agent\u2019s testimony or to order immediate production of the time sheets since their unavailability would have rendered such an order \u201can idle act.\u201d However, the court informed the appellant that the court would order production of the time sheets for appellant\u2019s future use if appellant wished, and asked whether appellant wanted to make a motion in this respect. Appellant said he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">As we read the record, the court did not deny production of the time and expense sheets. It simply declined to strike the witness\u2019s testimony as a penalty for the government\u2019s failure to have the reports immediately available while offering to require their production later \u2014 an offer which appellant declined.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The court\u2019s refusal to impose a crippling penalty for the government\u2019s inability to produce the reports immediately was not an abuse of discretion, particularly since the court found that the government had transferred the records to Washington as an administrative incident to the agent\u2019s change in station with no intention to interfere with the production of the records. Cf., Ogden v. United States, 323 F.2d 818, 820-821 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Appellant\u2019s second specification of error is that the court should have decided the defense of entrapment rather than submitting it to the jury. Appellant does not contend that the record established entrapment as a matter of law (Cf., Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958)), but rather that the nature of the entrapment defense is such that it can never be adequately and fairly dealt with by a jury. Cf., Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). In view of Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 377, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958) and Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 452, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932), such a change in the law must be left to others. See Robison v. United States, 379 F.2d 338, 347 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">The third specification of error contends that the instruction on entrapment, which took essentially the form approved in Notaro v. United States, 363 F.2d 169, 173 (9th Cir. 1966), was ambiguous. We do not agree. At trial, in response to the court\u2019s request for suggestions as to how the instruction given might be improved, appellant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cI happen to prefer my own instruction, but I have nothing to add to this instruction. Probably I will make an objection for the record, but I have nothing further to add to this instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Finally, we reject the contention that the presumption found in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7174 cannot be relied upon to establish that the heroin was illegally imported in the absence of some evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>record supporting the reasonableness of the inference. See Hernandez v. United States, 300 F.2d 114, 118, nn. 9, 11 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\"> The reason for appellant\u2019s refusal of the court\u2019s offer is probably to be found in the fact that the agent testified that all of the information on the time and expense sheets was included in the reports which were produced. The administrative details contained in the time and expense sheets would probably have been of little value for cross-examination in any event, and insistence upon production of the sheets would have resulted in a substantial interruption and delay of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
