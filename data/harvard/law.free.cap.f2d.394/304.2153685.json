As required by the statute, the indictment also charged that the conspiracy affected interstate commerce, particularly with respect to that firm\u2019s construction of the King Arthur Apartments in Lansing, Illinois. The three defendants were found guilty by a jury. Evans\u2019 and Battaglia\u2019s appeals were heard together and are disposed of in this opinion. Amabile\u2019s appeal has not yet been heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">Because Evans and Battaglia assail the sufficiency of the evidence, it must be summarized in some detail, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government. The evidence showed that William Riley was president of the Riley Management Corporation and that his company was building the King Arthur Apartments in Lansing, Illinois. Since 1962, defendant Evans had been one of his superintendents of construction and was assigned to the Lansing job in June 1964. At that time Riley and Evans discussed letting the sewer contracts for the Lansing apartments. Riley told Evans to line up subcontractors but to keep it secret \u201cfrom the boys in Mel-rose Park,\u201d specifically from defendant Amabile (also known as Joe Shine) and from Nick Palermo. Riley told Evans that if Amabile and Palermo learned of the project, Riley would quite possibly be forced to use them again as subcontractors. Amabile had been connected with earlier Riley projects and had on several occasions threatened Riley and his family. Evans promised to keep the King Arthur Apartment information from Amabile and Palermo. However, a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>days later, Riley was requested to go to the office of the Melrose Park Plumbing Company to meet Nick Palermo. Riley acceded. Both Palermo and Amabile were at the meeting. Palermo insisted on their receiving the plumbing contract for the Lansing project. Amabile said that otherwise he would stop Riley\u2019s other apartment building projects underway in Northlake and Westmont, Illinois, and that Riley \u201cwould be walking the streets with a candy cane.\u201d They told him they knew where Riley\u2019s mother lived and where his children went to school and that they had a baseball bat to handle \u201cwise guys\u201d like him.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">A few days later, Riley complained to Evans about the leak to Amabile and Palermo. Riley told Evans that the Mel-rose Park group was not to receive any Lansing work from Riley Management Corporation. In August 1964, Riley instructed Evans to obtain a sewer contractor that was \u201cforeign\u201d to Amabile and Palermo.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Amabile had told Mike DiVito, a sewer contractor, that Amabile could not get the Lansing sewer work if DiVito\u2019s name were to be on the contract. Amabile advised DiVito and co-conspirator Rocco Pranno to come up with \u201ca good clean fellow\u201d if they were to obtian the business. They suggested Henry La-Key, an experienced construction foreman. In September 1964, La-Key was hired by Pranno and DiVito as construction superintendent for a brand-new firm, Carlson Construction Company, with the title of president.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">DiVito said he and Pranno met with Evans and Amabile at Amabile\u2019s apartment in mid-September.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pranno explained to Amabile that La-Key was \u201cclean,\u201d but Amabile said that before giving Pranno and DiVito the Lansing sewer job he wanted $20,000 in cash. After looking at Evans\u2019 figures, DiVito told Pranno that there would be $20,000 in cash above Pranno\u2019s and DiVito\u2019s costs and profits for the job. Thereupon Pranno told Amabile that he would give him the $20,000 in cash and Amabile accepted the deal. Afterwards, Pranno told DiVito that Evans was Amabile\u2019s \u201cguy\u201d and that DiVito should never say anything in front of Evans because it would get back to Amabile.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">La-Key testified that he attended a September meeting at Amabile\u2019s apartment with Evans, DiVito and Amabile. Amabile said that he was giving the Lansing sewer job to DiVito and Pranno and eared about nothing except getting his $20,000 \u201coff . the top.\u201d In La-Key\u2019s presence, DiVito later relayed the message to Pranno about Amabile\u2019s demand for $20,000. Pranno directed La-Key and DiVito to meet with Amabile and Evans at the El Morocco lounge. At that meeting DiVito told Amabile that there would not be enough money in the contract to pay him $20,000 \u201coff the top.\u201d Amabile then instructed Evans to figure a way to obtain more money from the job. Evans tore up the original contract and wrote a new contract, raising the price from $150,000 to $199,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Pranno gave DiVito and La-Key approximately $13,000 to open a bank account for Carlson. In September 1964, Evans advised Riley that he had selected the Carlson Construction Company as the sewer contractor, that its reputation was excellent, and that it was operated by Henry La-Key. Thereafter, Carlson Construction Company was awarded the sewer contract for about $150,000, to be paid directly to Carlson by a suburban savings and loan association through pay-out slips issued by Riley\u2019s company. Carlson commenced the Lansing work in September or October 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">In mid-October, Evans told La-Key that the only contracts Evans let at Lansing were the ones Amabile told him to. Evans told La-Key that he did not want Riley to know that Evans knew Amabile. In November, Amabile told La-Key that Evans worked for Amabile, that Amabile had placed Evans in Riley\u2019s office, and that Evans would do whatever Amabile told him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Before making the first draw from the savings and loan association, La-Key told Amabile that the draw would be for $57,000. The next day, Amabile and Le-Key drove to the hospital where Evans was a patient. Amabile told La-Key that Amabile was going to give $5,000 to Evans as his cut on the job, instead of $7,500. At the hospital Amabile gave Evans a \u201cwad of bills.\u201d Evans reduced the estimate for the first draw by approximately $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">On November 12, 1964, La-Key received the first draw for $47,517.97 from the savings and loan association. He deposited $39,000 in Carlson\u2019s payroll account, retained $517 for his wages, and gave $8,000 to Rocco Pranno. Three days later, on Amabile\u2019s instructions, he drew out $20,000 from Carlson\u2019s account and gave it to Amabile.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In late November or early December, La-Key accompanied Amabile to a farm in Pingree Grove, Illinois, where Ama-bile introduced La-Key to Battaglia as \u201crunning the job for them\u201d in Lansing, Illinois. La-Key heard Battaglia ask Amabile why Evans was getting \u201cthat kind of money.\u201d Amabile explained that he had made a deal with Evans who had \u201cgot us the job.\u201d Amabile also said he had promised Evans $7,500 and that he would take care of it. The next morning La-Key mentioned to Evans that he had been at Battaglia\u2019s farm, and Evans warned him not to talk about it. Later, Pranno explained to Amabile that La-Key should not have been taken to the farm. When Pranno attemped to hit La-Key, Amabile stopped him, saying that he had La-Key down to the farm and that \u201cthe man [Battaglia] says he is OK.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Prior to the first draw, Pranno, Di-Vito and La-Key borrowed $5,000 because Carlson had run short of money. Pranno gave $4,500 of this amount to La-Key to deposit for Carlson. This loan was not repaid by January 1965. Later that month Pranno told Amabile about this in DiVito\u2019s presence and asked Ama-bile to locate La-Key so that the loan could be repaid. Several days later Pranno told Amabile that he was going to \u201cthe farm\u201d to see \u201cthe man\u201d in order to have Amabile obtain $5,000 from La-Key to pay back the loan. At the resulting Battaglia farm meeting, attended by Amabile, Pranno and DiVito, Pranno mentioned that $20,000 from the Lansing sewer job was intended for Battag-lia, who then nodded. The second time the $20,000 was mentioned for Battaglia, he said \u201cyes.\u201d Battaglia also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">\u201c \u2018Well, I don\u2019t think Hank La-Key is such a bad guy, I like him, I like to work with him,\u2019 that they had other things coming up, and that they could use him again because he was clean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeN\">He told Pranno that he would see what he could do for him as to the $5,000. On the drive back from the farm, Pranno told DiVito that he thought Amabile was short-changing Battaglia and keeping $10,000 of the $20,000 for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">In January 1965, La-Key advised Evans that Carlson did not have enough money to pay for necessary materials. Evans told La-Key not to worry, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">\u201c T will talk to Joe Shine [Amabile] and Joe Shine will talk to the man [Battaglia or Riley<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]. We will see that the money is in the bank for you.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">That same month Amabile told La-Key to prepare the papers for the second draw. La-Key said that the second draw would be for $60,000. Amabile said this was too high and that he would determine how much it should be and would straighten it out with Evans. That same night, Evans went to La-Key\u2019s home and changed prices to bring the draw down to $48,000. Evans told La-Key to present the second draw papers to Sol Meltzer, Riley\u2019s financial officer. However, Melt-zer refused to authorize this draw. Thereupon, La-Key went to see Amabile. Evans was present while La-Key told Amabile what had happened. The next morning La-Key picked up Evans. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>entered Riley\u2019s office separately. Riley said that he would authorize a pay-out only when Carlson had paid its suppliers. At this meeting La-Key told Riley that the cost of the job had gone up to $200,-000. Evans explained that this was because \u201ccomplications set in on the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">La-Key thereupon reported to Amabile that the second draw was still not authorized. Amabile told La-Key to accompany him to Riley\u2019s office the next morning. On the following day Amabile told Riley that he had to pay La-Key because \u201cthe man\u201d [Battaglia] wanted La-Key paid. Amabile said that otherwise there would be \u201call sorts of trouble.\u201d Because of his fear of physical harm and economic collapse, Riley authorized the second draw of $48,512.48. This was the sum mentioned in the indictment and was deposited by La-Key in a Carlson account. A few days later, Amabile instructed La-Key to draw out $17,000. La-Key thereupon obtained $5,000 in cash and a certified check for $12,000. Amabile insisted upon all cash and ordered Evans to accompany La-Key to cash the cheek. After the $12,000 check was cashed, La-Key and Evans went to Amabile\u2019s apartment, and La-Key gave Amabile the $17,000. Amabile then gave La-Key $5,000, of which La-Key gave Evans $1,000. Amabile told La-Key to take a vacation, and he went to Florida. Shortly thereafter, Evans advised La-Key to return to Chicago, at Amabile\u2019s request. Amabile then complained that La-Key had not been paying Carlson\u2019s bills, thus getting Amabile in trouble with Riley and \u201c \u2018making Dave Evans lose his job. You are taking my man [Evans] right out of Riley\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d La-Key then told Amabile that there was no money in the Carlson account because Ama-bile had bled it.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">A few days later, La-Key complained to Evans that the Carlson bills were unpaid because of Amabile\u2019s actions. La-Key asked Evans why he didn\u2019t get out of the business. Evans replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201c T can\u2019t get out. I am in too deep with Joe Shine [Amabile]. I know too much about the other people. * * * I can\u2019t quit. I wish I could get back to my own job where I came from.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acu\">Evans then said that he wished he had never met Amabile and reiterated that he was in too deep to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence as to Evans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Evans and Battaglia concede there was enough evidence of a conspiracy to obtain money from Riley Management Corporation by fraud. Evans admits that there was sufficient evidence that he was a party to that conspiracy. He also admits that Amabile used extortion to induce Riley to authorize the second draw. However, Evans contends that there is no evidence to show that the extortion was pursuant to a conspiracy of which he was a member. We reject that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">On this record, it is obvious that Evans knew of Riley\u2019s fear of Amabile. Although Evans took the stand, he significantly never explained that violence was not contemplated. La-Key was told by Evans that he would talk to Amabile, and that Amabile would talk to \u201cthe man\u201d (Battaglia or Riley in this instance; see note 3 supra) in order to get the second draw paid. Evans knew that Riley was unwilling to pay the second draw because Carlson\u2019s bills were unpaid, and that Riley was afraid of Amabile. The jury could properly infer that Evans knew Amabile would induce Riley \u2014 through fear \u2014 to authorize the second draw. After the second draw, La-Key withdrew another $17,000 for Amabile, who then gave La-Key $5,000, who in turn gave Evans $1,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even though he may not have spoken to Amabile about the second draw, Evans\u2019 own statement to La-Key showed his willingness to take part in a course of action which would cause payment by coercion. It would be unreasonable to suppose that Evans would be so closely associated with Amabile in the scheme to defraud without realizing that Amabile would employ coercive means for obtaining the second draw. Cf. Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>12-13, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435. As in Lefco v. United States, 74 F.2d 66, 68, 69 (3rd Cir. 1934), Evans has resorted to a conspirator\u2019s common contention, made in extremity, that he was a party to a sub-conspiracy not charged in the indictment, but our digest of the evidence discloses evidence quite sufficient to sustain the allegations and finding of his participation in a single conspiracy to obtain money, encompassing extortion as well as fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Evans has relied on Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252; United States v. Critchley, 353 F.2d 358 (3rd Cir. 1965), and Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718 (9th Cir. 1963), certiorari denied, 377 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 1626, 12 L.Ed.2d 498. None is apposite. In <em>Stirone, </em>the Court condemned the variance between indictment and proof. As we have seen, the proof here is consistent with the indictment. In <em>Critchley, </em>the evidence did not show any threat at the critical time, so that there was no extortion. Here there was ample evidence that co-conspirator Amabile threatened Riley with violence to obtain the second draw, and of course Evans is chargeable with his co-conspirator\u2019s acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Carbo, </em>Gibson had legitimate business reasons for his association with the conspirators, whereas Evans\u2019 associations with Amabile were clearly for illegal purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence as to Bat-taglia</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">As noted above, during Di-Vito\u2019s, Pranno\u2019s and Amabile\u2019s February (or early March) 1965 visit to Battaglia\u2019s farm, Battaglia said he liked La-Key and they could use him in other things because he was clean. From this, the jury could infer that Battaglia had embarked \u201cupon a criminal venture of indefinite outline\u201d (United States v. Andolschek, 142 F.2d 503, 507 (2d Cir. 1944)). He was committed to a long-term relationship contemplating the use of La-Key in numerous ventures. Battaglia admitted knowledge of Evans\u2019 paid role. He also acknowledged that he was to receive a $20,000 cut from Riley through the Carlson contract at Lansing. Since Battaglia had a stake in the outcome of the conspiracy, even the stringent test of conspiracy liability evolved by Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Falcone, 109 F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir. 1940), affirmed, 311 U.S. 205, 61 S.Ct. 204, 85 L.Ed. 128, was satisfied. Battaglia was also the arbiter of disputes among the co-conspirators. Being an associate of Amabile in this venture, Battaglia is properly chargeable with knowledge that his confederate, Amabile, would resort to threats if necessary to extract money from Riley. Battaglia had to \u201ctake his chances\u201d as to the methods used by the other co-conspirators. United States v. Andolschek, supra. As in United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459, 468, note 4 (2d Cir. 1963), certiorari denied <em>sub nom. </em>Corallo v. United States, 375 U.S. 835, 836, 84 S.Ct. 62, 11 L.Ed.2d 65, \u201cthere was ample evidence to raise a question for the jury whether he had joined in the conspiracy; if the jury so found, he [a co-conspirator who held the bribe money] was criminally responsible for the acts of the other conspirators and his own failure to perform more than a few overt acts would be immaterial.\u201d Evidence of knowledge of the details of the plan or of participation of others is not required. United States v. Hickey, 360 F.2d 127 (7th Cir. 1966), certiorari denied, 385 U.S. 928, 87 S.Ct. 284, 17 L.Ed.2d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\n<em>Intent to Affect or Knowledge of Effect on Interstate Commerce</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\"> Battaglia insists that it was necessary to find that he intended to affect or had knowledge that the conspiracy would affect interstate commerce, and that there was insufficient evidence of such intent or knowledge. A similar argument was rejected in United States v. Varlack, 225 F.2d 665, 672 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>1955). As we recently held in United States v. Pranno, 385 F.2d 387 (7th Cir. 1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">\u201cAll that must be proved, however, is that defendants conspired to commit extortion, and that the natural effect of carrying out their threat, whether they were conscious of it or not, would affect commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The District Court charged the jury that \u201call that is necessary is that the natural effect of the acts committed pursuant to the conspiracy was to affect, delay or obstruct [interstate] commerce,\u201d and that the requisite effect on commerce would be found if the jury believed \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants\u2019 activities as shown by the evidence in any way or degree obstructed, delayed or ' affected commerce.\u201d These instructions were proper under the Hobbs Act. Neither Battaglia nor Evans argues that the extortion would have no effect on interstate commerce. Here, one of the means to accomplish the extortion was the threat otherwise to cause Riley Management Corporation \u201call sorts of trouble.\u201d Many interstate deliveries were being made to its Lansing project. If Amabile\u2019s threats to destroy Riley had been carried out, this interstate commerce would necessarily have been obstructed. The Hobbs Act covers such a situation. United States v. Pranno, supra. Furthermore, the Riley company\u2019s reserves were depleted by the extortion. Since its business depended, in part, on ability to pay for interstate shipments to the Lansing site, the jury could infer that the extortion would have an effect on interstate commerce. Under the language of this statute (see note 1 supra), that is a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>Denial of BUI of Particulars</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Evans\u2019 briefs do not contest the denial of requests Nos. 2 and 3 in his motion for a bill of particulars.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, Battaglia adopted these requests and argues that the District Court erroneously denied them. Specifically, Bat-taglia asserts that he was entitled to information about the 1962 and 1963 Palermo-Amabile threats to Riley with respect to his Northlake and Westmont, Illinois, projects. But requests Nos. 2 and 3 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\"><em>\u201c2. </em>State the acts or things done by the petitioner [Evans and, by adoption, Battaglia] by which he and the other named and unnamed persons, combined, confederated and agreed together to obstruct, delay and affect commerce as charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">\u201c3. State the dates, times and places when and where the alleged acts set forth in paragraph 2 above were done or performed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Even if the District Court had ordered the Government to answer these requests, the Palermo-Amabile threats would not have been revealed. Since Battaglia did not ask for this information below, he may not assert error in this respect. Furthermore, none of the <em>five </em>requests in the motion for a bill of particulars covered this subject matter. Therefore, the Government was not required to respond as to it. No abuse of discretion has been shown with respect to the partial denial of this motion. Wong Tai v. United States, 273 U.S. 77, 82, 47 S.Ct. 300, 71 L.Ed. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">\n<em>Conspiracy Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">During the early portions of the trial, the District Court refused to permit the Government to have the defendants\u2019 declarations considered against all of them. Later in the trial, upon motion of the Government, the Court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">\u201cBefore we proceed with the taking of further testimony in this case, I have a direction and instruction to give you, to make to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">\u201cYou will recall during the course of this trial certain testimony was admitted in evidence only as to one or more of the defendants, and you were instructed at that time that such evidence was not then to be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>against any defendant to whom the evidence did not pertain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201cIt is now my responsibility under the law, to instruct you that such evidence is admissible against all of the defendants as evidence in connection with the alleged conspiracy charged in the indictment, whether or not each of the defendants was present when the acts or conversations or incidents testified about were done or carried on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\u201cYou may consider then such evidence as pertaining to all of the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Citing United States v. Pronger, 287 F.2d 498 (7th Cir. 1961), Battaglia complains that this instruction was a direction to the jury that a conspiracy had been proven and that each defendant was a member of that conspiracy. However, the last paragraph of this instruction referred to \u201cthe alleged conspiracy\u201d and did not tell the jury that the Government had proved a conspiracy. A later instruction made it plain that the jury could not consider acts and declarations of one conspirator against the others unless the jury found the existence of a criminal conspiracy and that the acts and declarations were in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The <em>Pronger </em>case is not controlling here. The terms of the instruction in that case were dissimilar to those here, and any defect in that instruction was apparently not cured by a later instruction. Conspiracy instructions similar to those here were approved in United States v. Bernard, 287 F.2d 715, 719-720 (7th Cir. 1961), which reinforces our conclusion that the later instruction made the risk of prejudice too slight to justify reversal. <em>Pronger </em>has been confined to a situation where the erroneous instruction was in effect given as part of the charge and does not apply where, as here, trial time intervened between the assailed comments and the final, proper charge. United States v. Alle-gretti, 340 F.2d 254, 256 (7th Cir. 1964, en bane), certiorari denied, 381 U.S. 911, 85 S.Ct. 1531, 14 L.Ed.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Battaglia claims that the jury was not told that it could not consider acts or declarations of a co-defendant made outside the presence of a defendant against the absent defendant unless it found that a conspiracy existed and that the acts and declarations were in its furtherance, but an examination of the transcript shows that such an instruction was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">\n<em>Admission of Pre-indictment Threats Made by Amabile and Palermo and Admission of Statements of Co-conspirator Pranno</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Battaglia also asserts that the District Court erroneously admitted Riley\u2019s testimony of 1962-1963 threats by Amabile and Palermo and erroneously admitted Pranno\u2019s statements outside the presence of the defendants. We agree with the Government that the PalermoAmabile threats were relevant to show the reasonableness of Riley\u2019s fear when confronted with Amabile\u2019s demand to authorize the second draw. The District Court carefully instructed the jury that this testimony was limited to that purpose (Tr. 2564).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">As to Pranno, the evidence concerning his January 1965 visit to Battaglia\u2019s farm, as well as other evidence previously summarized, shows that he was a co-conspirator of Battaglia and Amabile, so that La-Key\u2019s and DiVito\u2019s testimony concerning Pranno\u2019s statements outside the presence of defendants was properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">\n<em>Accomplice Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Battaglia complains that the District Court\u2019s accomplice instruction advised the jury that DiVito and La-Key were accomplices. The instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-17\">\u201cI must tell you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that an accomplice is one who unites with another person in the commission of a crime voluntarily and with common intent. An accomplice does not become incompe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tent as a witness because of participation in the criminal act charged. On the contrary, the testimony of an accomplice alone, if believed by you, may be of sufficient weight to sustain a verdict of guilty even though not corroborated or supported by other evidence. However, you should keep in mind that such testimony is to be received with caution and weighed with great care. You should not convict any defendant upon the unsupported testimony of an accomplice unless you believe the unsupported testimony beyond all reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">This instruction does not say or imply that DiVito and La-Key were accomplices. The instruction obviously means that if a person is found to be an accomplice, his testimony should be scrutinized with special care. A similar instruction has been proposed by Judge Mathes for the use of the District Courts. 20 F.R.D. 244. Such cautionary instructions were advocated in United States v. Bucur, 194 F.2d 297, 305 (7th Cir. 1952); Wainer v. United States, 82 F.2d 305, 308 (7th Cir. 1936), affirmed, 299 U.S. 92, 57 S.Ct. 79, 81 L.Ed. 58, and Ruvel v. United States, 12 F.2d 264, 265 (7th Cir. 1926). Battaglia relies on United States v. Balodimas, 177 F.2d 485, 487 (7th Cir. 1949), but there the district judge termed two named witnesses as accomplices. Here the jury had already been instructed that it was the exclusive fact finder, and there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that La-Key and DiVito were accomplices of the defendants. In this setting, the giving of this instruction was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\n<em>Restriction of Cross-examination and Refusal to Admit Defense Exhibits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aag-dedup-0\">Battaglia assails the District Court\u2019s rulings restricting the cross-examination of DiVito, La-Key and Riley; he also assails the court\u2019s refusal to receive certain defense exhibits. A study of the cross-examination of these witnesses shows that the District Court allowed defense counsel considerable latitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Battaglia\u2019s counsel attempted to show that a tax indictment had been dismissed against DiVito in return for his agreeing to be a government witness in this case. Battaglia\u2019s counsel cross-examined DiVito extensively about a \u201cdeal\u201d to drop the income tax charge if DiVito testified for the Government in the instant case. Later the First Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago testified that the reasons for the Government\u2019s dismissal \u201cwere that Mr. DiVito\u2019s lawyer served us with that motion showing that he had paid his taxes, attaching the check and the receipt and it was obvious that we had no case * * *_\u00bb <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> jje ajso testified that the Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the DiVito case was satisfied that proof the tax had been paid in 1964 was a defense to that indictment. If Battaglia\u2019s counsel was still not satisfied why the DiVito indictment was dismissed, he could have also called the Assistant United States Attorney in charge of that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The District Court refused to permit the defense to put into evidence the court file and docket entries relating to Di-Vito\u2019s tax case, but they were merely cumulative and did not reveal any \u201cdeal.\u201d Hence their exclusion was not prejudicial to Battaglia.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Battaglia endeavored to show that La-Key was responsible for the \u201cmilking\u201d of the Carlson Construction and Equipment Company. The defendants were given ample opportunity to examine La-Key regarding the balances in the Carlson bank accounts. The District Court did sustain the Government\u2019s objection to certain cheeks. But Bat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>taglia was not prejudiced by this ruling, for the checks were already reflected by ledger sheets that had been received, thus enabling Battaglia\u2019s counsel to argue that La-Key had looted the Carlson Company for his own personal gain. In addition, the checks were being offered in an attempt to contradict a witness on a collateral matter not relating to the $48,500 allegedly extorted. This is impermissible. United States v. Masino, 275 F.2d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 1960); United States v. Sweeney, 262 F.2d 272, 276-277 (3rd Cir. 1959). 3 Wigmore on Evidence (3rd Ed. 1940) \u00a7 979. Prior contradiction may be shown only on a matter material to the substantive issues of the trial. Gordon v. United States, 344 U.S. 414, 420, note 13, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447. As noted there, a trial judge has \u201cwide latitude in control of cross-examination, especially in dealing with collateral evidence as to character.\u201d 344 U.S. at p. 423, 73 S.Ct. at p. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Next, Battaglia states that he was precluded from showing Riley\u2019s purchase price for the Lansing land. It is true that the real estate contract was not admitted by virtue of the best evidence rule. But earlier Battaglia had shown through Robert Biederman\u2019s testimony that the price was about $140,-000. Since the disparity between the purchase price and the price used in loan negotiations was already in the record, no prejudice stemmed from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Battaglia complains too that Riley\u2019s February 5, 1960, bankruptcy petition should have been admitted. Again, the District Court had broad discretion to refuse it as a collateral matter. United States v. Bender, 218 F.2d 869, 874 (7th Cir. 1955), certiorari denied, 349 U.S. 920, 75 S.Ct. 660, 99 L.Ed. 1253. Riley\u2019s bankruptcy petition supposedly stated that he owned no stocks or bonds as of that date, but this record does not show that the bankruptcy statement was \u201cobviously perjured\u201d as Battaglia claims. No abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion has been shown in this exclusionary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Battaglia complains that in Amabile\u2019s cross-examination of Riley, Amabile was not permitted to show that Riley\u2019s October 5, 1965, statement to the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not refer to the 1962-1963 threats of Palermo and Amabile. However, Riley testified that he had advised the FBI of these threats and added: \u201cI have only read two pages [of the October 5 statement] and I see it in there, yes, sir.\u201d If Battaglia\u2019s counsel considered the point worth pursuing, he could have called FBI agents Dahlman and Kotsos to prove the contrary. United States v. Borelli, 336 F.2d 376, 391 (2d Cir. 1964), certiorari denied, Cin-quegrano v. United States, 379 U.S. 960, 85 S.Ct. 647, 13 L.Ed.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">In his reply brief, Battaglia\u2019s counsel contends that the Government should have granted his request for production of DiVito\u2019s grand jury testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No particularized need for this testimony was shown, nor was there any showing that the ends of justice required production. Therefore, production was unnecessary. See Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 868-875, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">As to Battaglia\u2019s principal cases cited to show reversible error, in Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed. 624, defense counsel was not permitted to establish that a prosecution witness was in government custody and therefore might expect consideration. In this case, the defense was permitted to show that both DiVito and Riley were in government custody. In Spaeth v. United States, 232 F.2d 776 (6th Cir. 1956) and United States v. Hogan, 232 F.2d 905 (3rd Cir. 1956), the defense sought to cross-examine government witnesses who stood convicted of a federal offense, in an effort to show that they expected leniency in return for their testimony. The District Court refused to allow such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>cross-examination. In this case, Battag-lia\u2019s counsel subjected DiVito to a lengthy cross-examination about the reasons for the dismissal of the tax evasion indictment against him. This also serves to distinguish United States v. Masino, 275 F.2d 129 (2d Cir. 1960), where such cross-examination of government witnesses was not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Gordon v. United States, 344 U.S. 414, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447; United States v. Beekman, 155 F.2d 580 (2d Cir. 1946), and Meeks v. United States, 163 F.2d 598, 11 Alaska 378 (9th Cir. 1947) deal with the exclusion of documentary evidence showing that the prosecution witnesses had been punished for violating federal law and were still subject to the jurisdiction of the court or agency which had imposed the punishment. In each case, the information contained in the documentary evidence tended to prove bias and was not otherwise present in the record. In this case, the District Judge remarked at one point: \u201cI assume that the government is the only one who could voluntarily move for the dismissal [of the tax indictment against DiVito.]\u201d This statement, coupled with the extensive cross-examination of DiVito and the examination of the First Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago, told the jury that the indictment had been dismissed on motion of the government. Defendants do not show that any other significant information was contained in the excluded documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><em>Gordon, Masino </em>and <em>Meeks </em>are further distinguishable because in those cases reversal was based on the cumulative prejudicial effect of two or more errors. This case lacks at least one of the errors found in each of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We approve of the foregoing cases and of the policy of affording the defense wide latitude in showing bias. We do not view the disposition of the issues herein as inconsistent with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We have considered Battaglia\u2019s other points relating to cross-examination, exclusion of documentary exhibits and instructions and find them to be without merit. In closing this discussion, it should be noted that various criticized evidentiary rulings of the District Court were well within those approved in United States v. Lawinski, 195 F.2d 1 (7th Cir. 1952). Taken together, the eviden-tiary rulings here gave these defendants broader latitude than in <em>Lawinski </em>and do not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\n<em>Evans\u2019 Character Witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Evans was precluded from showing his good character through four acquaintances. Relying on Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168, the District Court explained that his evidentiary rulings were based on improperly put questions and on improper foundation. As to some of the questions, this may have been an overstrict application of <em>Michelson. </em>However, no foundation was laid to show that these witnesses knew any of the people who lived in the community where Evans resided. Proof of reputation \u201camong a limited group such as fellow employees in a particular building\u201d has been held inadmissible. 335 U.S. at p. 481, note 17, 69 S.Ct. at p. 221; Williams v. United States, 168 U.S. 382, 397, 18 S.Ct. 92, 42 L.Ed. 509; Kroot v. United States, 66 F.2d 449, 451 (7th Cir. 1933). Although a more liberal approach to character witness rulings has precedential basis, we adhere to Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s precept not to \u201cdisturb rulings of trial courts\u201d in this troublesome field except in rare instances (335 U.S. at p. 480, 69 S.Ct. 213).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">\n<em>Restriction of Evans\u2019 Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Evans argues that the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings during his testimony denied him an opportunity to present an adequate defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">It is true that Evans was not permitted to deny certain secrecy admonitions supposedly made about the Lansing project during Riley\u2019s June 1964 conversation with Evans, but this was because of the leading and suggestive nature of his trial counsel\u2019s questions. To rebut secrecy, Evans\u2019 counsel was permitted to elicit that the Riley company had prepared a brochure to promote sales of the Lansing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>apartments, and that the Hammond <em>Times </em>published a story about the project in August 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The rulings not permitting Evans to answer certain questions as to conversations with Amabile, La-Key, DiYito and Pranno were based on the improper form of the questions and lack of proper foundation. These rulings are supportable under rudimentary rules of evidence. Furthermore, Evans was permitted to deny that he met with those persons after his counsel rephrased his questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">As to the bid sheets, Evans was allowed to testify that there were a signed original and a signed copy of the sewer contract bid sheets, and that the signed original was left in Riley\u2019s office, the very points his trial counsel was attempting to elicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Since Evans was charged with a January 1965 conspiracy, we cannot state that it was erroneous for the District Judge to consider irrelevant whether Riley held Evans in high esteem in August 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Our study of Evans\u2019 testimony shows that he was given great scope in presenting his denials of any part in the conspiracy. The District Court\u2019s exclusionary rulings did not jeopardize his defense and were permissible interpretations of the law of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\n<em>Evans\u2019 Counsel\u2019s Inability to Comment on Battaglia\u2019s and Amabile\u2019s Failure to Testify</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Before the defendants presented their witnesses, the District Court instructed their counsel not to refer to the failure of any of the defendants to take the stand. This instruction was of course to protect the Fifth Amendment rights of the two silent defendants, Battaglia and Amabile. The defenses of the three accused were not mutually exclusive. Also, Evans\u2019 counsel\u2019s closing argument took advantage of Evans\u2019 having taken the stand. There was no \u201cshowing that real prejudice will result from the defendant\u2019s inability to comment\u201d (United States v. Kahn, 381 F.2d 824, 840 (7th Cir. 1967), certiorari denied, 389 U.S. 1015, 88 S.Ct. 591, 19 L.Ed.2d 661, so that severance was not necessitated. <em>Trial Publicity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">Even though defendants successfully objected to sequestering the jury, Battaglia now argues that prejudicial publicity violated his due process rights. In closing argument, his counsel recognized that the trial court repeatedly admonished the jury to ignore news coverage. There is no claim that any jurors read any of the \u201cprejudicial\u201d articles, thus differentiating the case from Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250. In Janko v. United States, 366 U.S. 716, 81 S.Ct. 1662, 6 L.Ed.2d 846, the second conviction was reversed because the trial court had not inquired whether the jurors had read a St. Louis <em>Post-Dispatch </em>article published during the trial and containing \u201cinadmissible prejudicial information.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here the jurors were twice asked whether they had seen articles about the ease. None admitted having done so. United States v. Accardo, 298 F.2d 133 (7th Cir. 1962), and United States v. Largo, 346 F.2d 253, 256 (7th Cir. 1965), certiorari denied, 382 U.S. 904, 86 S.Ct. 240, 15 L.Ed.2d 157, do not hold that the District Court must always interrogate each juror singly. See United States v. Jannsen, 339 F.2d 916, 919-920 (7th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">Battaglia also complains of the presence of a permanent press table inside the bar.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has recently emphatically disapproved of such an installation (Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600), so that the District Judges should consider reserving the bar of the court for counsel in the future (384 U.S. at p. 355, 86 S.Ct. 1507). However, we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>not consider the placement of this press table to constitute reversible error, for this record reveals no \u201cfrequent confusion and disruption of the trial\u201d or \u201cconstant commotion within the bar\u201d (384 U.S. at p. 355, 86 S.Ct.). In our view, the intrusion of the news media into this trial was not so great as to obviate a showing of prejudice (cf. Estes v. State of Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600). Battaglia has failed to satisfy us that he was denied a free trial because of adverse publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>Eavesdropping</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The Government\u2019s brief reprints an August 18, 1967, letter from the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice to the United States Attorney in Chicago. The letter confirms the Department\u2019s pre-trial advice to the United States Attorney that there was no electronic monitoring in this case. Cf. Hoffa v. United States, 387 U.S. 231, 87 S.Ct. 1583, 18 L.Ed.2d 738. Accordingly, it is now academic whether the District Court should have granted a hearing to determine whether electronic eavesdropping had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">No prejudicial error having been shown, the two judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-14\">.

First, I do not believe that the Government introduced evidence sufficient to convict Battaglia and Evans of the crime charged against them. Second, although my views on the sufficiency of the evidence would dictate a reversal without remand, a multitude of prejudicial errors occurred which in combination, if not singly, precluded the defendants from receiving a fair trial. Consequently, on the basis of these trial errors, the case should be remanded for a new trial regardless of the insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Accepting the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence unquestionably showed that Amabile, Pranno, DiVito, Evans, and LaKey devised and executed a scheme to defraud the Riley Management Corporation by using the Carlson Construction &amp; Equipment Company as a facade so that moneys meant for construction purposes could be diverted to those participating in the scheme. But this scheme was not the one charged in the indictment. The evidence also unquestionably showed that Amabile threatened Riley for the purpose of obtaining money. The record is barren, however, of any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to sustain the charge that Battaglia and Evans conspired with Amabile \u201cto obstruct, delay and affect commerce\u201d in the movement of materials for the construction of the Riley dwelling units by means of extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">In early 1964, the Riley Management Corporation began planning the construction of an apartment building at Lansing, Illinois. In June of that year, William Riley, president of the Riley company, requested his construction superintendent, Dave Evans, to start lining up contractors for the Lansing project, but asked Evans to keep the project \u201csecret from Joe Shine [Amabile] and Nick Palermo.\u201d A few days later Riley, at Ama-bile\u2019s request, met Amabile and Palermo at the latter\u2019s Melrose Park plumbing company office. Riley testified concerning this meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-13\">Nick Palermo asked me if I was going to build a project in Lansing, Illinois. I told Mr. Palermo that I was and Mr. Palermo asked me when he was going to get the blueprints so that he could figure the work. I told Mr. Palermo that I did not plan on giving him the work. I told Mr. Palermo that he was behind on his existing projects and with the efficiency that we were now enjoying, it was ridiculous to give him this project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Joe Shine told me that I wasn\u2019t going to give it to anyone else other than them and they asked me basically what the hell I was trying to pull, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">-X- * -X- * * 45-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">Joe Shine told me that if I didn\u2019t give them the work in Lansing, that he would stop the project in Northlake and in Westmont, Illinois. They told me that I had to use them, that if I didn\u2019t use them, that they would put me out of business. I told Nick and Joe that they were now in the process of putting me out of business, the way they were doing it. I was told not to be a smart punk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">Joe Shine told me I shouldn\u2019t be a wise guy.

Upon learning from Amabile about the Riley project in Lansing, DiVito asked if he could obtain some of the sewer work. Amabile said \u201cit was possible,\u201d but that he didn\u2019t want DiVito\u2019s name on the contract. A few days later Amabile told DiVito and Pranno that if they came up with \u201ca good clean fellow,\u201d they could get the sewer contract for the Lansing project. Shortly after this conversation, DiVito and Pranno persuaded Henry LaKey (who had been a foreman on sewer construction jobs) to work for them if they succeeded in getting the Lansing contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">In mid-September, DiVito, Pranno, Evans, and Amabile met in the latter\u2019s apartment in Northlake, Illinois. Pran-no told Amabile that he and DiVito \u201chad a fellow to do the work for us called Hank LaKey and that he was clean.\u201d Amabile replied, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine * * * [but] before I give you this job, I want $20,000 in cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">During this period, DiVito and Pranno hired LaKey to work for them for $200 per week plus a ten per cent bonus upon completion of the job. They told LaKey they were starting a \u201cnew corporation\u201d to be called the Carlson Construction &amp; Equipment Corporation and they would like to have him put \u201con the paper as president\u201d of the company. In contemplation of giving the sewer work to Di-Vito and Pranno, Evans apparently drafted a written contract to be signed by Carlson Construction. The contract that Evans originally drew up, however, was unsatisfactory to DiVito and Pranno because they had decided, after looking over the plans, that there would be insufficient proceeds from the job to pay Ama-bile the twenty-thousand dollars he had demanded \u201coff the top.\u201d At this point, Amabile told Evans to figure a way to get more money out of the job. Evans rewrote the contract raising the price approximately forty to forty-five thousand dollars. After looking at the plans and specifications and seeing the high price of the job pursuant to the rewritten contract, DiVito informed Pranno that \u201cthere would be $20,000 in cash above our costs and profits.\u201d Pranno then told Amabile in the presence of DiVito and Evans that he would give him the twenty thousand dollars. Amabile replied \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d In accordance with their previous discussion, Pranno, DiVito, and LaKey formed the Carlson Construction &amp; Equipment Company. DiVito and Pranno each received forty-five per cent of the stock and LaKey the remaining ten per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">Sometime in September, Riley asked Evans whether he had lined up a sewer contractor. Evans said that he had obtained an excellent contractor, Carlson Construction, operated by a man named LaKey. Evans told Riley that he \u201chad looked into Carlson Construction\u2019s repu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tation, it was excellent, and * * * [he] felt quite confident that this man could do a good job.\u201d Carlson Construction was given the contract under an arrangement whereby Lawn Savings &amp; Loan Association was to pay Carlson upon receipt of payment slips issued by the Riley company. Carlson Construction commenced the sewer work in September or October, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Early in November, Amabile instructed LaKey to get the necessary papers ready for making the first \u201cdraw.\u201d After preparing the papers, LaKey went to see Amabile at the El Morocco, a night club operated by Amabile in Northlake, Illinois. LaKey testified: \u201cJoe Shine [Ama-bile] asked me how much the draw was for. I told him $57,000. * * * Joe Shine said he would get a hold of Dave Evans and straighten this out.\u201d Within a day or two, LaKey and Amabile went to see Evans, who was a patient in Illinois Masonic Hospital. Before they saw Evans, Amabile told LaKey that Evans was going to receive $5,000 as his cut, not $7,500 as originally planned. At the meeting, Amabile gave Evans a \u201cwad of bills.\u201d Evans then looked over the papers for the first draw and crossed out a number of items. After the papers had been retyped, reflecting a reduction of $10,000 in the draw, Evans approved the papers and told LaKey to take them to Riley\u2019s office. On November 12, LaKey received a check for $47,517.97 from Lawn Savings &amp; Loan Association based on a pay-out slip approved by Sol Meltzer, Riley\u2019s comptroller. LaKey deposited $39,000 in the Carlson Construction payroll account. Of the remaining $8,517, LaKey retained $517 and gave Pranno $8,000. Three days later, at Amabile\u2019s direction, LaKey withdrew $20,000 in cash from the Carlson Construction account which he gave to Amabile.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In January 1965, Amabile told LaKey to prepare the papers for a second draw. LaKey got the papers ready and showed them to Amabile who asked how much the draw was for. LaKey replied, \u201c$60,-000.\u201d Amabile thought that this figure was too high, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want that kind of money taken out of the account at this time. * * * I will tell you what to draw.\u201d He also said that he would straighten it out with Evans. That same day, Evans reduced the figure to $48,000 and, after approving the papers, told LaKey to present them to Meltzer for the payment slip. When LaKey presented the papers covering the second draw for approval, Meltzer refused to authorize the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">LaKey immediately went to see Ama-bile, relating in Evans\u2019 presence what had happened. At Amabile\u2019s instruction, Evans and LaKey went to see Riley the next day. Pursuant to Evans\u2019 request, however, they entered the office separately. When LaKey told Riley that he was there to get the second draw, Riley replied that Carlson Construction\u2019s bills were not being paid, and that he would authorize a payment only when LaKey had satisfied these obligations. During the conversation, LaKey told Riley that the cost of the job had gone up from $120,000 to $200,000. When Riley asked Evans to explain why the price had been increased, Evans told Riley, \u201cThere\u2019s complications set in on the job and we had to raise the price up to get the job done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">LaKey reported to Amabile that Riley had refused to authorize the second draw. Amabile replied: \u201cYou be here tomorrow morning. I\u2019ll personally go with you to the office myself. I\u2019ll get this straightened out once and for all.\u201d The next morning LaKey and Amabile arrived at Riley\u2019s office and walked in unannounced. Amabile asked Riley why he did not pay LaKey. Riley said he couldn\u2019t authorize the draw until LaKey had paid his bills. Amabile then told Riley: \u201cI don\u2019t care nothing about that. The man\u2019s got his money coming, Bill, I want you to pay his money.\u201d At that point, Ama-bile and Riley went to the back of the office and commenced a conversation during which LaKey \u201cseen a lot of arms moving by Joe Shine,\u201d who was doing most of the talking. Then Amabile walked towards LaKey, gave him a wink, laughed, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get your money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>now.\u201d Before leaving, Amabile turned to Riley and said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Bill, I want you to pay this man. I want you to pay him now. You know what I mean.\u201d On the way back to the El Morocco, La-Key asked Amabile how he was able to tell \u201ca big man like Riley\u201d what to do. Amabile put up his fist and said, \u201cI got this son of a bitch right here, * * * He\u2019s afraid of me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">On the witness stand, Riley gave this version of the meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Mr. Shine told me that I had to pay this man, that this man was a friend of theirs; that I was expected to pay them; that if I didn\u2019t pay them all sorts of people would get mad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">I told Joe that it would be foolish for me to make this payment; that they were just pushing this company to ruination; that it just was absolutely ridiculous to pay this man and that I did not want to pay him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfU\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">Mr. Shine told me that I had no choice on this matter; that I had to pay this man; that the man wanted him. paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">I told him that this was silly. I had a big loan pending with Equitable Life and this thing would, it could destroy everything that we were trying to build up. I told him that, in fact I begged him not to have to pay him. He told me that I had to pay him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">He told me the man said I had to pay him and he told me if I didn\u2019t pay him there would be all sorts of trouble, and there was no sense in me making this trouble for myself so I better pay him because he was a friend of theirs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2t\">Riley further testified that he subsequently authorized the payment because he was afraid; that he had been subjected to previous threats of physical harm to his family and his employees and ruination of his company by Amabile and Nick Palermo. Shortly after this meeting, LaKey deposited a $48,512.48 check, received from Meltzer, in the Carlson Construction bank account. Later Amabile told LaKey to withdraw $17,000 from the account. Of this amount, Ama-bile gave LaKey $5,000; LaKey in turn gave Evans $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">A close analysis of the evidence in this, case is essential to determine whether the Government proved the crime charged. The precise charge was a conspiracy to extort money from Riley. The gist of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people, rather than the resultant action undertaken pursuant to the agreement. Since the agreement is the gist of the crime, the agreement itself must be proved either by direct or circumstantial evidence. If circumstantial, the circumstances must be such as to warrant the jury in finding that the alleged conspirators had \u201csome unity of purpose, some common design and undertaking, some meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement * * Shannabarger v. United States, 99 F.2d 957, 961 (8th Cir. 1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">The conspiracy charged in this case was allegedly aimed at obstructing and delaying the interstate movement of materials and supplies required for Riley\u2019s Lansing project. That obstruction and delay was to result from the extortion of $48,500 from the Riley Management Corporation by engendering fear of bodily and economic injury in William Riley.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-19\">There is a substantial question concerning the admissibility of many statements testified to by DiVito, LaKey, and Riley, which were neither relevant to the crime charged nor binding on absent alleged coconspirators. Assuming for the sake of argument, however, that all their testimony was relevant and admissible, I still do not believe that the evidence shows either that Evans agreed with Amabile and Pranno or that Battaglia agreed with Amabile and Pranno to commit the extortion charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The evidence with regard to Evans shows that the only agreement or \u201ccommon design and undertaking\u201d to which he was party was one to bilk the Riley company by means of fraud and deceit out of money earmarked for the Lansing job. Consistent with a scheme to defraud, DiYito and Pranno kept in the background, Amabile expressly ordering DiVito to stay off the job. A \u201cgood, clean fellow,\u201d LaKey, was recruited to act through the facade of Carlson Construction. There was constant effort among the conspirators to make sure that Riley was kept in the dark about Ama-bile\u2019s connection with Carlson Construction. Both draws were misrepresented to Riley as being legitimate expenditures. All these facts, as well as many others in the record, are indicia of fraud rather than extortion. Fraud is marked by misrepresentation, deception, and deceit. Extortion is direct and brutal \u2014 the very antithesis of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The Government argues that the most conclusive direct evidence showing Evans to be a \u201cwilling participant\u201d in the conspiracy is a statement made by him to LaKey when LaKey expressed anxiety about paying his bills. Evans said: \u201cI will talk to Joe Shine and Joe Shine will talk to the man. * * * We will see that the money is in the bank for you.\u201d (This statement was made in January 1965, after the first draw and after Ama-bile had gotten his $20,000 \u201coff the top.\u201d) Subsequent to Evans\u2019 statement, arrangements were undertaken for the second draw. Again attempts were made to deceive Riley. Evans decreased the amount of the draw prepared by LaKey. When LaKey failed to get the draw approved, Evans accompanied LaKey to Riley\u2019s office, but by prearrangement they entered the office separately. Evans told Riley on this occasion \u201cthere\u2019s complications set in on the job and we had to raise the price up to get the job done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The foregoing facts, all involving conduct by Evans occurring after his statement relied on so heavily by the Government, suggest only deceptive conduct on his part, rather than complicity in a scheme to extort. Moreover, these same facts highlight the individual action of Amabile in resorting to extortion. When Amabile realized that the subterfuge was no longer working as it had in the past, he decided to take things in his own hands, and, unknown to the others, unmask the fraud and threaten Riley in order to get an approval of the second draw.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The Government also argues that the creation of Carlson Construction merely \u201cput a velvet glove on the iron fist with which Amabile and \u2018The Man\u2019 had terrorized Riley in the past.\u201d Although past extortion of Riley had been used to obtain contracts, the Government contends that in the present situation, Ama-bile, with Evans\u2019 cooperation, did not have to resort to force to obtain the sewer contract; instead Amabile could wait and exert his pressure to obtain the money obligated by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In fact, however, this argument reveals the clear import of the evidence in this case \u2014 that a fraudulent scheme was practiced on Riley. When Riley flatly refused to approve the second draw even though Evans had tried to persuade him in the other direction by making a bald misrepresentation, Amabile unilaterally, and perhaps spontaneously, reverted to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>more accustomed role, that of an extortionist. This unilateral action on the part of Amabile cannot be transformed into a prior agreement with Evans and Battaglia to extort as the Government charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The slender reed on which the Government depends to demonstrate an agreement to extort between Amabile and Evans is not even present with respect to Battaglia. The evidence touching upon Battaglia\u2019s connection with the crime charged may be summarized as follows. Riley testified that although he had never met Battaglia, he had seen him once in early 1964 in Amabile\u2019s night club. DiVito testified that he saw Bat-taglia talk to Amabile in October of that year in Amabile\u2019s club. LaKey testified that in late November or early December, he was with Amabile at Battaglia\u2019s farm in Pingree Grove, Illinois, where he was introduced as \u201cHank LaKey running the job for them in Lansing, Illinois.\u201d While there, he heard Battaglia ask Amabile why Evans was \u201cgetting that kind of money.\u201d Amabile replied: \u201cI made a deal with the man. The man got us the job. * * * I promised him $7,500, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d DiVito testified that in February or March 1965, he went with Pranno to Battaglia\u2019s farm. Amabile came a few minutes later and the three of them awaited Battaglia\u2019s arrival. According to DiVito, Pranno said in Ama-bile\u2019s and Battaglia\u2019s presence, \u201cYou know about this Riley deal in Lansing where we got Hank LaKey to set up the company and do the work for us and figure $20,000 in for you?\u201d Battaglia nodded. Pranno and Amabile then argued whether Amabile had taken LaKey away from Pranno. Battaglia interceded by saying: \u201cCut it out, you fellows. Keep it down.\u201d DiVito further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJH\">Then Jim Pranno continued to talk and he says, \u201cYou know we had to borrow $5,000 to keep this job in Lansing going and now I can\u2019t find LaKey, and you know there was $20,000 in this deal for you.\u201d Mr. Battaglia nodded, says \u201cYes.\u201d And then Jim Pranno continued and says, \u201cI want to know what Joe Shine is doing to me. I want you to tell Joe Shine to get that $5,000 from LaKey so that we can pay back this loan,\u201d and Jim Pranno continued on to say that Hank LaKey was a no good s.o.b. Then Mr. Battaglia says, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Hank LaKey is such a bad guy, I like him, I like to work with him,\u201d that they had other things coming up, and that they could use him again because he was clean. And after a minute or so, a pause of about a minute, then Mr. Battaglia got up out of his chair and said, \u201cRocky, I\u2019ll see what I can do for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8_\">On this record there is absent any evidence, direct or circumstantial, demonstrating that Battaglia knew that money was to be extorted from Riley or that threats were to be made to Riley by Ama-bile. Nor is there any evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Riley feared Battaglia or that Battaglia received any of the money extorted from Riley. Finally, there is no evidence that Battaglia agreed with Amabile, Pranno, or Evans to commit the crime charged against them. Yet the Government argues in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">Just as Evans acted at Amabile\u2019s direction, Amabile worked at the direction of the defendant Battaglia. Ama-bile was the muscle while Battaglia was the brains, setting policy and settling disputes. His veil of secrecy was his supposed anonymity, known to a few as \u201cThe Man.\u201d When one wanted to see \u201cThe Man,\u201d one went to \u201cThe Farm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">From the foregoing evidence a jury could infer that Battaglia had a real interest in the outcome of the Lansing project, that he was participating financially in Carlson Construction\u2019s contract and that all other co-eonspira-tors acted at his direction, directly as with Amabile, or indirectly, as with Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">From his own mouth Battaglia admitted knowledge of Evans\u2019 role and that Evans was being paid. Battaglia knew of LaKey\u2019s role and that Carlson Construction had the contract on the Lansing project. He knew that LaKey was being used as a front, because \u201che was clean.\u201d With Battaglia\u2019s knowledge of the foregoing, the jury could conclude that he was a participant in the conspiracy to place Riley in such a position that when Riley learned that Carlson Construction was in fact Ama-bile and Battaglia, he would authorize payment of the money in the escrow account, not because of the contract, but because he feared Amabile and \u201cThe Man.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">These inferences which the Government seeks to draw, some of them non sequiturs, can rise no higher than speculation and surmise.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Much of the Government\u2019s case against Battaglia rests on identifying him as \u201cThe Man.\u201d But of the numerous instances of the use of that phrase in the record, many refer not to Battaglia, but rather to LaKey,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Evans,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Amabile.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Battaglia\u2019s financial stake in the alleged conspiracy to extort is demonstrated, according to the Government, by his two nods and saying \u201cYes\u201d at the mention of \u201c$20,000 in for you.\u201d Although Battaglia\u2019s responses to the mention of the money indicate that he was not a stranger to the Lansing venture, they are in no way probative of his complicity in a conspiracy to extort. The force of the Government\u2019s argument in this regard is largely diminished by the fact that \u201cthe Brains\u201d [Battaglia], who was supposedly \u201csetting policy,\u201d had to be reminded twice by Pranno that he had money coming to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Reliance is placed by the majority on two Second Circuit cases, United States v. Andolschek, 142 F.2d 503 (2d Cir. 1944), and United States v. Falcone, 109 F.2d 579 (2d Cir.), aff\u2019d, 311 U.S. 205, 61 S.Ct. 204, 85 L.Ed. 128 (1940). <em>Andol-schek </em>is cited in support of the proposition that \u201cBattaglia had \u2018embarked on a criminal venture of indefinite outline\u2019 \u201d and therefore, \u201chad to \u2018take his chances\u2019 as to the methods used by the other co-conspirators.\u201d The full text of the passage, however, is more illuminating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">It is true that a party to a conspiracy need not know the identity, or even the number, of his confederates; when he embarks upon a criminal venture of indefinite outline, he takes his chances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>as to its content and membership, so be it that they fall within the common purposes as he understands them. <em>Nevertheless, he must be aware of those purposes, must accept them and their implications, if he is to be charged with what others may do in execution of them. </em>United States v. Andolschek, supra, 142 F.2d at 507. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">And despite the majority\u2019s assertion that the \u201cstringent test of conspiracy liability\u201d set forth in <em>Falcone </em>was met by the Government here, that case condemned guilt by mere association.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">There are indeed instances of criminal liability of the same kind, where the law imposes punishment merely because the accused did not forbear to do that from which the wrong was likely to follow; but in prosecutions for conspiracy or abetting, his attitude towards the forbidden undertaking must be more positive. It is not enough that he does not forego a normally lawful activity, of the fruits of which he knows that others will make an unlawful use; he must in some sense promote their venture himself, make it his own, have a stake in its outcome. The distinction is especially important today when so many prosecutors seek to sweep within the drag-net of conspiracy all those who have been associated in any degree whatever with the main offenders. United States v. Falcone, supra, 109 F.2d at 581.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">There can be no doubt that Amabile and Battaglia associated together, but, as the court stated in <em>Falcone, </em>a mere association is insufficient evidence of guilt to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">TRIAL ERRORS</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">In urging reversal, Battaglia and Evans point to a number of trial errors which they claim not only unduly prejudiced them, but also prevented them from receiving a fair trial. Contrary to the majority\u2019s disposition of these contentions, I believe that such errors did occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Because of my views on the sufficiency of the evidence, however, I do not believe that an extended discussion of the trial errors is either necessary or appropriate. I only refer to them as they reflect upon the conduct of this trial as a whole, the most striking aspect of which was the unfavorable climate in which the proceedings were conducted. Perhaps no single error occurring outside that climate would be sufficient to require a reversal; however, their cumulative effect, as exemplified by the three errors that will be discussed in detail, leads inevitably to the conclusion that the defendants were denied a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">A. <em>Pre-conspiracy Threats</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">The indictment charged that a conspiracy among the defendants to violate the Hobbs Act began \u201cin or about July, 1964.\u201d Yet, William Riley, the victim of the alleged extortion, was permitted to testify over objection about threats made to him in 1962 and 1963 by defendants Amabile and Nick Palermo. These threats related to Riley\u2019s proposed building project in Northlake, Illinois and the subsequent payment of $30,000 to Ama-bile. Riley also testified about threats made by Amabile and Palermo in 1963 in regard to plumbing work at a Riley building project in Westmont, Illinois. Palermo on that occasion said he \u201cwould bury Hubley,\u201d Riley\u2019s construction superintendent, and Amabile said he \u201cwould hammer the nails on the coffin.\u201d Ama-bile made other threats to Riley at that time. Purportedly, this testimony was admitted for the purpose of showing the basis of Riley\u2019s fear of Amabile in January, 1965. There was ample testimony by Riley, however, of threats made by Amabile after the commencement date of the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">According to the majority, the testimony of these threats was \u201crelevant to show the reasonableness of Riley\u2019s fear when confronted with Amabile\u2019s demand to authorize the second draw. The District Court carefully instructed the jury that this testimony was limited to that purpose.\u201d Although I agree that proof of the reasonableness of an extortion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>victim\u2019s fear by testimony of prior threats is generally permissible, the testimony of threats made by Palermo, who was not even charged as an unindicted coconspirator, was irrelevant for any purpose. Moreover, I am at a loss to find the \u201ccareful instruction\u201d referred to by the majority. Because the testimony of threats by Palermo was both irrelevent and inflammatory, the defendants were prejudiced by the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury to disregard that testimony. Cf. United States v. Critchley, 353 F.2d 358 (3rd Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">B. <em>The Accomplice Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The accomplice instruction was improper because the district judge, in his definition of an accomplice, for all practical purposes told the jury that the crime charged had in fact been committed. In so doing, he invaded the province of the jury. This kind of an instruction would be proper in a prosecution where the alleged accomplice admitted his participation in a conceded criminal offense. In that situation, an instruction like the one given here correctly delineates the weight to be accorded the testimony of the accomplice as that testimony tends to implicate others in the crime that has been committed. In the instant case, however, the crucial question was not who the participants of a conceded crime were, but whether a conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act, the crime charged, had been formed by the alleged conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Because the instruction did not explicitly leave open the question whether any of the witnesses were accomplices, the jury may reasonably have interpreted the instruction as a direction from the judge that the crime charged had been proved. To avoid this substantial risk of prejudice, the instruction should have been framed so that the jurors were unequivocally informed that they were the sole judges of whether any witness was in fact an accomplice. Such modification would have cured the instruction's vice \u2014 the implied assumption that the alleged conspiracy was a proven fact. See Gordon v. United States, 353 F.2d 9 (5th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">C. <em>Evans\u2019 Character Witnesses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Evans sought to elicit testimony of his good character through four witnesses. Conceding the somewhat inept manner in which this undertaking was attempted by Evans\u2019 counsel, the district judge\u2019s treatment of these efforts was nevertheless unduly restrictive. Throughout the course of defense counsel\u2019s efforts to question the character witnesses, Government counsel interposed objections to all questions directed to an assessment of Evans\u2019 general reputation as an honest, truthful, and law-abiding citizen. On almost every occasion, these objections were indiscriminately advanced by the simple statement, \u201cI object.\u201d With equal regularity, the judge sustained the objections, only rarely intimating the reasons for this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">At one point, Evans\u2019 counsel obviously frustrated and bewildered, asked the judge to elaborate on his prior statement that \u201cthe question is improperly put.\u201d In response, the judge should have either demanded that Government counsel frame his objections in more concrete and specific terms or sustained the objections in a manner to convey to defense counsel the reason for his rulings. His failure to do so worked an unnecessary and prejudicial hardship on Evans\u2019 counsel's efforts to elicit character testimony from his witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">In addition, some of the court\u2019s rulings sustaining the Government\u2019s objections were erroneous. On more than one occasion, a foundation was laid to qualify the witness, and the question posed to the witness was properly phrased. The apparent basis for the rulings sustaining the Government\u2019s objections to these particular questions was that the testimony sought related to Evans\u2019 reputation in the business community rather than his reputation in the community where he lived. The majority relied on this distinction, stating, \u201c[N]o foundation was laid to show that these witnesses knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>any of the people who lived in the community where Evans resided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"An4\">Reputation in the business community, however, is no less probative than reputation in the residential community to show the absence or presence of certain character traits in an accused. In this regard, Professor McCormick\u2019s observation is apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">The reputation is usually said to be limited to that which obtained in the community where the accused lived, but this should be extended to embrace any considerable group with whom he constantly associated in his business, work, or other continued activity, and who might reasonably be thought to have a collective opinion about him. C. McCormick, Handbook of the Law of Evidence \u00a7 158, at 335 (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">See also Whiting v. United States, 296 F.2d 512, 517 (1st Cir. 1961). Because the crime charged against Evans had a business setting, the most probative character evidence was kept from the jury by the court\u2019s rulings. These rulings were erroneous. They were also prejudicial. For as the Supreme Court said in Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 476, 69 S.Ct. 213, 219, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948), \u201cThis privilege [of presenting character testimony] is sometimes valuable to a defendant for * * * such testimony alone, * * * may be enough to raise a reasonable doubt of guilt * *</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Instead of the traditional presumption of innocence with which criminal defendants are ordinarily clothed, the record in this case suggests that a presumption of criminality attached to the acts of these defendants because of their infamous reputations and notoriety. The defendants may have been guilty of nefarious conduct for which they deserve imprisonment, or they may have had such bad reputations as to be considered menaces to society. Such facts alone, however, cannot warrant a blinding of eyes, permitting a conviction to stand that is based on surmise rather than evidence. This kind of difficulty is present in this case because the charge on which the defendants were convicted and imprisoned, an agreement to extort money, was not sustained by the evidence. No person should be punished under our criminal laws unless he has been proved guilty of a specific offense by competent evidence in a fair trial. Due process of law demands nothing less.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">. There was no proof that Evans and Bat-taglia had any connection with each other except through common acquaintance with Amabile, DiVito, Pranno, and LaKey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b370-5\">. This use of the phrase \u201cthe man,\u201d like some of its other uses, (See infra notes 5-7 and accompanying text) fails to identify the person being referred to. The majority recognizes that in this instance the phrase could refer to either Battaglia or Riley. Yet they conclude by implication that Evans was referring to Riley, stating, \u201cThe jury could properly infer that Evans knew Amabile would induce Riley \u2014 through fear \u2014 to authorize the second draw.\u201d If he was instead referring to Battaglia, the most damaging aspect of the Government\u2019s case against Evans is neutralized. Because the phrase \u201cthe man\u201d is so indefinite and ambiguous, only speculation and surmise could supply the purport of a reference to Battaglia. But .the same speculation and surmise is necessary to support the majority\u2019s rationale that the statement reflected Evans\u2019 awareness that Amabile was going to exercise extortion on Riley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">. The record indicates that prior to the second draw Evans told LaKey that the only contracts Evans would \u201clet out here [Lansing] are the ones Joe Shine tells me.\u201d Evans\u2019 deep involvement with Ama-bile is further indicated by a statement Evans made to LaKey after the second draw when he said: \u201cI can\u2019t get out. I am too deep with Joe Shine. I know too much about the other people.\u201d The day before this conversation, LaKey had been called back from Florida to a meeting attended by Amabile and Evans. LaKey described what took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">I got in a conversation with Joe Shine first as soon as I got in the Club, he hollered and told me, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not paying the bills, you\u2019re not taking care of the job. You got me in trouble with Riley. Riley\u2019s in trouble. You\u2019re making Dave Evans lose his job. You\u2019re taking my man right out of Riley\u2019s. I don\u2019t know what is going on. You are causing nothing but trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">In sum, although this testimony confirms Evans\u2019 association with Amabile, it just as strongly suggests that their association was in furtherance of a scheme, to defraud. At the time of the meeting testified to by LaKey, Evans was unaware that Amabile had committed extortion upon Riley to obtain the. second draw. The only inference that can properly be drawn from LaKey\u2019s testimony, therefore, was that Amabile was attempting to keep the ruse going by conveying the impression to Evans that the scheme to defraud was still in operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">. When Amabile went to see Riley concerning the second draw, Amabile said, <em>\u201cThe man\u2019s </em>got his money coming, Bill, I want you to pay his money.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">. When LaKey and Amabile were going to visit Evans in the hospital, LaKey said, \u201cJoe, the deal was for $7,500 for <em>the man.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b372-13\">. When Riley first met Amabile and Palermo in April 1962, Riley testified, \u201cMr. Shine who I had just met struck his face in my face and told me he was <em>the man </em>in Northlake.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
