(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The improvement is reflected in claim 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">1. In a process of forming a photographic image in color wherein an exposed silver halide emulsion is developed in the presence of at least one dye developer to provide an image-wise distribution of mobile dye developer, said dye developer being a compound which is both a dye and silver halide developing agent, and said imagewise distribution of mobile dye developer is transferred to a superposed image-receiving stratum to produce a transfer image thereon, <em>the improvement wherein </em>said transfer is effected to an image-receiving element having an ultraviolet light absorber <em>in an alkali-permeable polymeric stratum over </em>the dyeable image-receiving stratum and transferring a substantial portion of the said mobile dye developer through said polymeric stratum to said dyeable image-receiving stratum, said polymeric stratum having less affinity for the said dye developer than the image-receiving stratum, <em>said polymeric stratum comprising an alkali-insoluble polymer and said ultraviolet light absorber being nondiffusible. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Claim 4 recites that a non-diffusible thiazolidine compound is employed as the ultraviolet light absorber, while claim 5 calls for the use of a polymeric ultraviolet light absorber.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Haas patent also discloses and claims an improvement in the process of forming a dye image by diffusion transfer. Claim 1 of that patent, relied on by the board in support of the double patenting rejection, has a format similar to that of appellant\u2019s claim 1, with the improvement recited in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">* * * the improvement which comprises increasing the stability of said positive dye image by <em>contacting </em>said positive dye image with a compound selected from the group consisting of pyrogallol, gallic acid and esters of gallic acid. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">The board agreed with the examiner that the present claims do not define a separately patentable invention from that claimed by Haas. Like the examiner, the board thought it proper to look to the disclosure of Haas \u201cto determine the scope of broad terms\u201d employed in the Haas claims. It found that the step of <em>\u201ccontacting </em>said positive dye image with a compound\u201d recited in claim 1 of Haas \u201cis clearly intended to cover\u201d not only the incorporation of the ultraviolet light absorber <em>in </em>the image-receiving layer itself, but also its use in an <em>overlying </em>layer. It also found the claims of the patent \u201cinclude the non-diffusible as well as diffusible stabilizers,\u201d and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">The differences between claims 1 and 2 herein and the patent claims are thus only in scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">It is evident from the above discussion, as well as the examiner\u2019s reliance on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that, as to claims 1 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>2, both the examiner and board regarded appellant to be claiming the same invention as previously claimed by Haas. Although it is not entirely clear from the opinion of the board precisely what reasoning it employed in determining that Haas and Rogers are claiming the same invention, we can infer the examiner\u2019s reasoning in interpreting the Haas\u2019 claims from the direct references to portions of the Haas disclosure<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appearing in his Answer. The examiner observed that Haas discloses stabilizing the dye image from sunlight by treating it, <em>after </em>its formation by diffusion transfer, with a solution comprising the pyrogallol derivative stabilizing agent and a film-forming polymer, thus forming a layer over the dye image which contains all or at least part of the total amount of stabilizer applied. That process <em>per se, </em>of course, has little relation to what is being claimed here. Or, the examiner noted, Haas may incorporate the stabilizer as part of his image receiving element <em>prior </em>to the transfer process by either (1) mixing the stabilizer with the dyeable material employed as an image receiving layer prior to coating it on its support, or (2) applying the stabilizer \u201cas above, by permeation.\u201d Relying on the latter disclosure, the examiner evidently concluded that Haas contemplated applying to the dyeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>image-receiving layer, <em>prior </em>to transfer, a solution comprising the stabilizer (for example, a non-diffusible gallic acid ester such as lauryl g\u00e1llate) and a film-forming polymer, thus forming a polymeric layer over the image-receiving layer which contains at least some stabilizer and which is later permeated by the dye material during the transfer process.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">While agreeing that it was appropriate for the examiner and board to look to Haas\u2019 disclosure to facilitate a determination of the <em>meaning </em>of the words employed in the patent claims,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> particularly the meaning of the word \u201ccontacting,\u201d appellant urges that the Patent Office has misinterpreted the Haas patent. He contends that the Haas specification, properly construed, discloses the placement of the stabilizer only <em>in </em>the image-receiving layer prior to transfer, and not in a layer <em>over </em>the image-receiving layer.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We need not decide that question, for in our view there are other considerations which convince us that Haas and Rogers are not claiming the same invention. We are presented with a situation in which two inventors have each made an improvement in a basic process. Insofar as Haas\u2019 <em>claimed </em>invention is concerned, the important consideration is the specific compounds employed as ultraviolet light absorbers. Claim 1, relied on by the board, evinces no concern where those compounds are located, whether they are diffusible or non-diffusible, or whether they are associated with a film-forming polymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">On the other hand, insofar as Rogers\u2019 <em>claimed </em>invention is concerned, the <em>location </em>of the ultraviolet light absorber in a layer <em>over </em>the image-receiving layer, its <em>non-diffusible </em>nature and its presence in an <em>alkali-insoluble, film-forming polymer </em>are the important considerations. Claims 1 and 2 demonstrate no particular concern with the specific compounds utilized. Indeed, we note that Rogers makes no mention in his specification of the use of pyrogallol or its derivatives as ultraviolet light absorbers. Under the circumstances, it is difficult, if not impossible, to say that Rogers <em>claims </em>the identical invention disclosed and claimed by Haas when Rogers himself does not even <em>disclose </em>the subject matter of the Haas specification and claims. In our view, this is not a case in which the respective sets of claims recite the same physical structure or steps in language of <em>de minimis </em>difference in scope. Cf. In re Griswold, 365 F.2d 834, 53 CCPA 1565 (1966); In re Knohl, 386 F.2d 476, 55 CCPA- (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The board also affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 4 and 5 as not reciting, in the board\u2019s words, \u201ca patent-ably different invention from that claimed in Haas,\u201d in view of Sawdey, Van Allan or Tulagin. That rejection, which the parties appear to agree is what has become known as \u201cdouble patenting of the obvious type\u201d in nature, would necessarily appear to apply to broader claims 1 and 2 as well, claims 4 and 5 being dependent upon claim 2. Said the examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">With regard to the various secondary references, it is admitted that none of Sawdey, Van Allan et al. or Tulagin et al. deal with diffusion transfer processes employing dye developers. They have been retained to show the problem of dye stability in photography is well known and that this problem is solved by placing ultraviolet absorbers contained in alkali-permeable, alkali-insoluble polymer layers over or within the layer in which the dye image is formed. They have also been retained to show the particular ultraviolet absorbers set forth in the instant claims 4 and 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">Note is taken that applicant\u2019s only exemplified ultraviolet absorbers are those of Sawdey. This reference makes use of the alkali-permeable, alkali-insoluble polymer properties by applying an alkaline developer solution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>to the element and allowing the developer to diffuse through the ultraviolet layer to the underlying layer to couple with a color former to form a dye image, thereby retaining the u-v absorber layer over the dye image layer. * * * it is not deemed unobvious to adapt the idea of Sawdey, Tulagin et al. or Van Allan et al. for use in the claimed process of Haas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">As pointed out by the solicitor, appellant does not appear to argue that the appealed claims would not be an obvious modification in the double patenting sense of the invention claimed in the Haas patent in view of the disclosures of the prior art. Indeed, appellant\u2019s brief contents itself with no more than passing mention of the Saw-dey, Van Allan and Tulagin patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Rather, what argument appellant does present amounts to a challenge to the legal foundation of \u201cobviousness-type double patenting\u201d rejections. He contends :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">The Examiner admits that none of the secondary references relied upon deal with diffusion transfer processes employing dye developers. Yet, these references are employed in combination with Haas as showing that it would be \u201cobvious\u201d to modify the claimed invention of Haas in the manner claimed by appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">Appellant is gravely concerned with this reasoning as applied to double patenting situations and sincerely believes that it is erroneous and contrary to the spirit of the patent system to deny an application on the grounds of double patenting under 35 U.S.C. 101<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> under the rationale that it is \u201cobvious\u201d to modify the patented invention, that is, to change the claimed inventive concept to an entirely different invention, to wit, the invention claimed by appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">This type of thinking has no place under 35 U.S.C. 101 and this \u201cobviousness\u201d test should be left to matters arising under 35 U.S.C. 103.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">Appellant wishes to point out by reference to the case at bar a distressing dilemma confronting corporate practitioners which, if one follows the position taken by the Patent Office* gives rise to clearly inequitable results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">Inventions like the ones defined in the Haas patent and the involved application are not made in a vacuum. They are made in an effort to further the goals of the corporate assignee and there is a considerable exchange of information between the concerned persons. * * * Haas arrived at one solution [to the problem of light stability of dye images] which resulted in the cited patent. Rogers was not a co-inventor of this concept, but independently arrived at a separate solution. Haas never envisioned the Rogers invention and cannot be said to be a party thereto. It is a fair statement to say that, <em>absent any prior art, </em>the corporate assignee, the real party in interest, should be entitled to patent protection on both inventions. * * * Because of the different inventive entities, appellant was compelled as a matter of law to claim his invention in an application separate from that of Haas. Having done what he believes he was compelled to do, appellant finds himself in a box from which, following the rationale of the Patent Office, there can be no escape unless this Court expressly rules that this rationale deprives the corporate assignee, the real party in interest, of the patent protection to which it is entitled * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Appellant asks us to \u201cmodify or distinguish\u201d our \u201crecent line of decisions\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the extent necessary to conform them to the substance of the views he expresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We stated the rationale behind this particular type of double patenting rejection in In re Robeson, 331 F.2d 610, 51 CCPA 1271 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">Where, as here, the claimed subject matter is an obvious modification of what has already been claimed, a second patent is contrary to one of the fundamental principles underlying the patent system, namely, that when the right to exclude granted by a patent expires at the end of the patent term, the public shall be free to use the invention as well as obvious modifications thereof or obvious improvements thereon. Thus, to grant a second patent for an obvious variation deprives the public of those rights. If, however, the second patent expires simultaneously with the first, the right to fully utilize the patented discovery at the expiration date remains unimpaired. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Appellant\u2019s arguments do not convince us that that policy is unsound or in need of modification when applied to the facts here. By the same token, those arguments do not provide us with grounds to distinguish our earlier decisions in principle from the present situation. Nor would it appear appellant and his assignee are in as much of a \u201cbox\u201d as he envisions. See In re Borg, 392 F.2d 642, 55 CCPA-(1968) ; In re Bowers, 359 F.2d 886, 53 CCPA 1590 (1966); Ex parte Deering, 157 USPQ 164 (Pat.Off.Bd.App.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">In that regard, appellant and his assignee filed a terminal disclaimer in the Patent Office the day before he filed his Notice of Appeal to this courti Since that document was neither timely filed nor considered below, we will not consider it here. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 144; In re Heyl, 379 F.2d 1018, 54 CCPA 1608 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">SMITH, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">KIRKPATRICK, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-17\">.

U.S. Patent 3,069,262, issued December 18, 1962, on an application filed March 27, 1958. Both the Haas patent and the present Rogers application are assigned to Polaroid Corporation. The record shows that Rogers filed an affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131 satisfactorily establishing that he reduced to practice the invention of his claims prior to the filing date of the Haas patent, thus effectively removing the Haas patent as evidence of prior art under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-28\">.

As a preliminary matter, appellant contends that the examiner\u2019s double patenting rejection under 35 USO 101 as applied to commonly owned applications of different inventors \u201cis inconsistent with\u201d the position expressed by the Commissioner in his notice of January 31, 1967, appearing at 834 O.G. 1615, and is, without more, \u201cclear grounds for reversal.\u201d That notice, promulgated about a year <em>after </em>the board decision in the present appeal, reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">* * * The term \u201cdouble patenting\u201d is properly applicable only to cases involving two or more applications and/or patents of the same inventive entity and <em>should not he applied to situations involving commonly owned cases of different inventive entities. </em>\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-18\">\u2756 \u2756 <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-19\">In situations involving cases filed by different inventive entities regardless of ownership, Sections 102 and 103 of 35 U.S.C. preclude the granting of two or more patents when directed to identical inventive concepts or when one of the concepts would be obvious in view of the other. A terminal disclaimer can have no effect in this situation since the basis for refusing more than one patent is not connected with any ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>tension of monopoly. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">It may well be that the examiner\u2019s position is inconsistent with the above quoted portion of the Commissioner\u2019s notice. The examiner\u2019s position, however, is not inconsistent with many prior decisions of this court. See, for example, In re Cole, 373 F.2d 532, 54 CCPA 1107 (1967); In re Keim, 229 F.2d 466, 43 CCPA 784 (1956); In re Stanley, 214 F.2d 151, 41 CCPA 956 (1954); In re Borcherdt, 197 F.2d 550, 39 CCPA 1045 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">. Haas discloses in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">The color fastness of the colored photographic images, produced in such processes, upon prolonged exposure to sunlight often leaves something to be desired. I have discovered that by using a compound selected from the group consisting of pyrogallol, gallic acid and esters of gallic acid (i. e., esters wherein the acid group of the gallic acid is esterified with an alcohol) to protect the image, the color stability of the images in sunlight is appreciably enhanced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\"><em>One </em>method of using the above-named stabilizers is to treat the <em>finished </em>colored image with a solution comprising the stabilizer to be used. The solution may conveniently be applied to the colored image by immersion, swabbing, coating, spraying, flowing, etc. In an especially useful embodiment, the solution may also comprise a film-forming polymer, such as gelatin, which will serve as a protective surface coating for the image. In addition, the solution may comprise other stabilizing agents such, for example, as ultraviolet absorbers, etc. Depending upon the solvents present in the solution containing the stabilizer, <em>and upon whether a film-forming polymer is </em>included, the stabilizer may be present in a layer <em>over </em>the image-receiving layer or it <em>may, at least in part, permeate </em>into the image-receiving layer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\"><em>Another mode </em>of carrying out the processes of this invention is to incorporate the stabilizers herein disclosed into the image-receiving <em>element prior to its use </em>in the dye developer transfer processes. The image-receiving element, into which the stabilizer is incorporated, generally comprises a sheet of dye-receptive material and, in preferred embodiments, comprises a support bearing a coating of a dyeable material. The stabilizer may be in-' eorporated by adding it to the coating solution of dyeable material and applying it therewith, <em>or it may be applied, as above, by permeation. </em>* * * * * * <em>ichen it is desirable to prevent the stabilizer from migrating, </em>the It group [of the alcohol R.OH utilized <em>to </em>form the ester of gallic acid] may be a <em>higher alkyl. </em>* * * As examples of esters of gallic acid which are useful in carrying out the processes of this invention, mention may be made of ethyl g\u00e1llate, <em>lauryl gallote, </em>and benzyl gallate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-16\">While it is not known for certain how the stabilizers of this invention function, it is believed that they possess the ability to function both as antioxidants and as ultra-violet light absorbers. * * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\">.
