It is contended there were material issues of fact requiring a trial. We disagree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">These facts are uncontested: Appellant played an active role in the campaign of the \u201cDedmon slate\u201d in the Democratic primary held in the District of Columbia in May 1964. This was the year in which the voters of the District of Columbia were to have their first opportunity to vote, in November, in a national Presidential election. At stake in the May primary were certain political offices within the Democratic Party: delegates to the Democratic National Convention; two members of the Democratic National Committee; and the members of the District of Columbia Central Committee. There were three slates. The so-called Dedmon-McGerr Slate was headed by Jesse 0. Dedmon, candidate for Democratic National Committeeman, and Patricia McGerr, candidate for Democratic National Committeewoman. Appellant, a public relations man in the District of Columbia, was admittedly one of the founders and leaders of the group advocating the Dedmon-McGerr slate, and was chairman of the Jesse Dedmon-Patricia McGerr Democratic Campaign Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">The Evening Star, defendant-appellee, published material allegedly defamatory of appellant on three occasions. In one article he was characterized as having been \u201cchief local spokesman for Malcolm X and his Black Muslim Mosque.\u201d Another article, published after the election, expressed satisfaction at the voters\u2019 rejection of the Dedmon slate and its \u201cblatantly racist appeal.\u201d The third expressed the editorial opinion of the <em>Star </em>that appellant had indulged in appeals to racist prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\"> Under the rule of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a publication defamatory of a public official is not actionable unless made with actual malice\u2014 that is with knowledge that it was false, or with reckless disregard of wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>er it was false or not. In Associated Press v. Walker, a majority of the Court held this rule applicable to \u201cpublic figures.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We think it plain that appellant was a \u201cpublic figure\u201d within the meaning of <em>Walker </em>and Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was not so well-known as Butts and Walker, but that is not controlling. He clearly, played a role in \u201cthe resolution of important public questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In this country political parties are an integral part of the democratic process, providing an opportunity for citizens, exercising their constitutional freedom of association, to participate in discussion of issues of the day and to play a role at a critical juncture in the formation of the governments that will staff and operate the machinery of the state. It is part of the democratic evolution of our country that primary elections have increasingly taken the place of private clubs and close knit caucuses, to select both the holders of party office and nominees for public office. The fitness of candidates for political party office is no less a public issue than the fitness of candidates for public office. The public plainly has a vital interest not only in the calibre of candidates for political office, but in the nature of the groups or factions supporting the candidates, and the quality of candidates\u2019 spokesmen and backers are appropriate considerations to be taken into account. They \u201coften play an influential role in ordering society.\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Appellant did not confine himself to private discussion <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the issues in the primary, but took a prominent role in a group appealing for public support.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">Since the very pendency of a libel action may cut across the public interest in free and untrammeled speech on public issues, a public figure cannot resist a newspaper\u2019s motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 by arguing that there is an issue for the jury as to malice unless he makes some showing, of the kind contemplated by the Rules, of facts from which malice may be inferred.6 This our appellant plainly did not do.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">The Star complied with local Rule 9 (h)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by filing a statement of the mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>rial facts as to which movant contends there is no genuine issue. Plaintiff did not comply with the rule\u2019s requirement that a party opposing summary judgment file a concise \u201cstatement of genuine issues,\u201d setting forth all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue necessary to be litigated. The local rule specifically provides that in the absence of such statement the court may assume the truth of the facts as set forth by the moving party. The Star accompanied its motion and statement with affidavits by the authors of the allegedly defamatory articles, describing the research undertaken to get their facts, setting forth their belief that the articles as published were true, and specifically denying they were in any way animated by malice towards plaintiff. Plaintiff filed no counter-affidavits disputing any of the assertions in these affidavits. He did not seek deferment of the ruling on the motion for summary judgment in order that he might utilize discovery procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Plaintiff, in effect, relied on his pleadings to create an issue of fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That course is impermissible under F.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\"> Fourteen days after summary judgment had been entered appellant presented an affidavit presenting a theory of malice. We need not consider whether the affidavit would have been adequate to stave off summary judgment if it had been timely presented. We decline to find any abuse of discretion in the refusal of the trial court, in an action of this sort,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to reopen the action at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-20\">. 376 U.S. 254, 279-280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\">.

The court canceled the depositions of numerous officials of the Star noticed by plaintiff. On argument defendant-appel-lee tells us the reason was that the depositions were oppressively scheduled. In another ease the nature of the limitation on discovery may warrant attention. Here it suffices to note that plaintiff had not pursued discovery on interrogatories specifically left available; had noticed the case as ready for trial, which under local practice signifies the end of discovery unless specifically authorized; and had not sought leave for additional discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b825-21\">.
