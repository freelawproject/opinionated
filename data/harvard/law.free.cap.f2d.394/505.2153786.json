We conclude that the Tax Court was fully warranted in resolving both of these issues against the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">The petitioner urges that the Tax Court record is inadequate to show the full facts for the tax years involved, because his brother, James Benn, who had conducted most of the transactions for him, failed to appear as a witness at the hearing. He requests a remand for the purpose of eliciting additional proof by James. No such motion was made in the Tax Court during the months the case was under submission, and we conclude that the Tax Court did not err in refusing thereafter to reopen the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">The decision of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
