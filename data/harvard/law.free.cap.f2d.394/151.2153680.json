Four or five times a week, from July 15, 1965, to August 5, 1965, appellants sponsored a dice game on the SS City of Keansburg as the vessel navigated from Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, to Brooklyn, New York, to Manhattan, New York. Many of the passengers were returning from the horse races at Monmouth Park, New Jersey; presumably they were either reckless with their winnings or eager to recoup their losses. Usually, ten or twenty-five of these passengers joined in appellants\u2019 game at one time. The game lasted for the entire trip and on some occasions there was an exchange of money among appellants on arrival m New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-19\">The game followed a consistent pattern. Appellants rented a table from co-defendant Robert Jackson. Brennan, Dello Russo, and Kimmel stationed themselves near the end of the table which had been placed against the bulkhead. They returned the dice to the shooters. Fusco played in the game and kept it going. When Brennan and Dello Russo were arrested, the police found irregular dice in their pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">The district judge found appellants guilty of violating Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, quoted in material part in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and of conspiracy to commit that offense, Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. He found that they had carried on the unlawful activity of common gambling, New York Penal Law \u00a7 970, and of using a table and dice in a game of chance in a vessel on New York waters, New York Penal Law \u00a7 971 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Appellants contend that the \u201cthereafter\u201d in Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 requires that the illegal activity must occur after interstate travel has taken place. Since appellants gambled during the trip, it is argued that they did not violate the statute. The \u201cthereafter\u201d does not mean, however, that the illegal activity must happen after interstate travel has ceased. Here, appellants gambled after the vessel had crossed a state line. This is sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Appellants also argue that the game was not a \u201cbusiness enterprise\u201d; they contend that it was not an \u201c * * entrenched operation rather than a sporadic poker game or a floating crap game.\u201d United States v. Teemer, 214 F.Supp. 952, 958 (D.C.W.Va.1963). However, this floating crap game was an entrenched operation. Its regularity, location, size, operation, participants, and the exchange of money support this finding. As to state law, the evidence indicates that appellants gambled \u201chabitually and frequently,\u201d People v. Marconi, 27 Misc.2d 348, 217 N.Y.S.2d 232, 233 (City Ct. 1961), and as a \u201cmoneymaking pursuit,\u201d People v. Formato, 286 App.Div. 357, 143 N.Y.S.2d 205, 208, 64 A.L.R.2d 812 (App.Div.1955), aff\u2019d, 309 N.Y. 979, 132 N.E.2d 894 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Finally, appellants contend that converting a misdemeanor under New York law into a federal felony violates due process. This is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-12\">. \u201cTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952.
