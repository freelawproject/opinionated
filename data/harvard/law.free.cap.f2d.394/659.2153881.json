The respondent refused to bargain but gave no explanation therefor. Subsequently eight other employees signed au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>thorization cards, thus totaling 47 out of 65 employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">After a pre-election campaign in which respondent took a rather heavy hand, the union lost the election by a vote of 38 to 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Unfair labor practice charges were filed. After a hearing, the Trial Examiner and the Board found that respondent had met the union campaign with coercive threats to close the plant if the union won, with individual interrogations and inducements designed illegally to influence the employees\u2019 votes in the election and by sponsoring a company union.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The Board also found that respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices had occasioned the loss of the union\u2019s majority, which respondent had no good faith reason to doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The Board ordered the vacating of the election proceedings. It also entered cease and desist orders as to the unfair labor practices, an order requiring the disestablishment of the company union, and a bargaining order in favor of the union. While pro forma objection is registered to all of these orders, respondent reserves its real opposition to the bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> On review of the whole reqord in this case, we find substantial evidence to support the findings of the Board. Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The first named remedial orders are well within the Board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">As to the bargaining order, this case presents substantial violations by respondent of sections 8(a) (1), 8(a) (2) and 8(a) (5) of the N.L.R.A. We have previously upheld the powers of the Board to employ this remedy in somewhat less aggravated circumstances. N.L.R.B. v. Delight Bakery, Inc., 353 F.2d 344 (6th Cir. 1965). In this case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201cIn our instant case we have no doubt that the NLRB had a right on this record to conclude that respondent\u2019s illegal interference with its employees\u2019 rights to organize and bargain collectively did cause the union\u2019s loss of majority status. If this is so, it seems to be well within the NLRB\u2019s discretion to seek a remedy which would effectively restore the status quo ante. It seems most unlikely that a simple cease and desist order could be expected to accomplish this result.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Delight Bakery, Inc., 353 F.2d 344, 347 (6th Cir. 1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">We note with interest the views of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit expressed in N.L.R.B. v. S. S. Logan Packing Co., 386 F.2d 562 (4th Cir. 1967). It may be that the record currently before us differs materially from the record in the <em>Logan </em>case in that here the Board found on substantial evidence that respondent Ateo had no good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority. It may also be that our case presents \u201cthe outrageous and pervasive\u201d unfair labor practices which the Fourth Circuit feels are necessary to justify a bargaining order. We do not, however, agree with the view which we think is implied in the <em>Logan </em>case, that the 1947 Taft-Hartley amendment to section 9(c) of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> served to impose restrictions upon the powers of the NLRB to fashion appropriate remedies for employer violations of the unfair labor practice sections of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">In Franks Bros. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 321 U.S. 702, 64 S.Ct. 817, 88 L.Ed. 1020 (1944), Mr. Justice Black spelled out the remedial powers of the Board in language which then commanded the unanimous support of the Court and which has never been modified or overruled. The power granted to the Board by Congress in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a) \u201cto prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 158 of this title) affecting commerce\u201d and in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (c) \u201cto take such affirmative action * * * as will effectuate the policies of this subchapter\u201d has not been altered or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>restricted by Congressional amendment or by Supreme Court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Absent Supreme Court expression on the matter, we do not believe the TaftHartley amendment to section 9(c) pertaining to certification proceedings should be construed as affecting the interpretation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a) and (c), or as overruling the elucidation of those powers in the <em>Franks Bros. </em>ease. See United Steelworkers of America v. N.L.R.B., 376 F.2d 770 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 932, 88 S.Ct. 297, 19 L.Ed.2d 285 (1967); Jas. H. Matthews &amp; Co. v.

Sehon Stevenson &amp; Co., 386 F.2d 551, 554 (4th Cir. 1967) (Judge Sobeloff concurring specially).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Our instant ease is clearly an unfair labor practice case and the Board\u2019s power to enter a bargaining order is clearly founded upon the remedial power sections of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">In general accord with the views recited above are Franks Bros.
