Decedent was a newly married, 22-year-old girl whose medical problems began with symptoms suggestive of pregnancy. She was successively treated by a series of three doctors: a general practitioner, a psychiatrist, and an internist. The general practitioner, a defendant here, treated decedent for \u201cmorning sickness\u201d and malnutrition and, when she did not improve significantly, referred her to the psychiatrist for treatment of a suspected emotional problem. The psychiatrist, also a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>fendant here, hospitalized decedent in defendant hospital and gave her electroshock therapy preceded and followed by administration of the drug thorazine. Decedent\u2019s condition thereupon became critical, and Dr. Schulman, the internist, was called in. He ordered various drugs for decedent, but she failed to respond and died two days after receiving the electroshock therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Dr. Schulman was plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, and his opinion as to the cause of death differed in certain respects from the inferences arising during his cross-examination and from the testimony of Dr. Edmonds, the head of the hospital\u2019s autopsy service. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the trial judge directed verdicts for all three defendants. We affirm as to the hospital and the general practitioner but reverse as to the psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">A <em>prima facie </em>ease of medical malpractice must normally consist of evidence which establishes the applicable standard of care, demonstrates that this standard has been violated, and develops a causal relationship between the violation and the harm complained of.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s case against the hospital is deficient on all three of these particulars, while her case against the general practitioner is devoid of evidence on the third essential \u2014 assuming, without deciding, that the first two factors were present.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Evidence of a standard of care and its violation was also lacking in the case against the psychiatrist. But plaintiff was prevented from supplying these essentials when the trial judge ruled that Dr. Schulman was not qualified to testify concerning electroshock therapy. We think this was error. The fact that an internist is not a specialist in psychiatry or neurology does not preclude him from testifying about the physical effects of electroshock therapy and the ability of a person in decedent\u2019s condition to withstand this treatment. See Baer-man v. Reisinger, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 363 F.2d 309 (1966). Such testimony, if believed by the jury, might have established both the standard of care and its violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\"> Moreover, on the third essential of plaintiff\u2019s case against the psychiatrist \u2014 evidence of causation \u2014 we think there was sufficient proof in the present state of the record to go to the jury. Dr. Schulman testified that in his expert opinion the cause of death was the consecutive administration of thora-zine (a tranquilizer) and electroshock therapy to someone in decedent\u2019s weak condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Edmonds, who directed the autopsy, testified \u2014 in answer to questions by the judge \u2014 that in his view thorazine and electroshock standing alone would not have caused death, but that death was caused when this treatment was followed by administration of another drug, levophed, a combination that resulted in infarction of deceased\u2019s bowels.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Schulman contested that the levophed, which he himself had prescribed, contributed to death. Thus, there was a conflict in the testimony as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>to the cause of death. But conflicts in the testimony of witnesses, including expert witnesses, called by a party are not necessarily fatal to his case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury may assign a preference to one item of testimony over the other \u2014 a preference that may be based on differences in the hypothetical facts assumed by each expert and, in the last analysis, on depth and lucidity of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">.

Agency principles are of no help to plaintiff in establishing liability, since there is no suggestion in the record that any of the doctors involved was an agent of either the hospital or another of the doctors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b997-11\">. Later Dr. Schulman attributed the cause of death to electrolyte imbalance, depression, and phenothiazine reaction. Appel-lees have failed to demonstrate that this testimony on causation was so inconsistent with the earlier testimony of Dr. Schulman as to render the whole testimony inconclusive and require removal of the case from the jury. <em>Compare </em>Quick v. Thurston, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 290 F.2d 360, 88 A.L.R.2d 299 (1961) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b997-17\">.
