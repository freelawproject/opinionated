On the former appeal we remanded the case to the district court for further findings of fact and conclusions of law. 371 F.2d 940, 942.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon remand, the district court made additional findings of fact and conclusions of law, rendered judgment for the government, and taxpayer has appealed therefrom. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">On this appeal the taxpayer contends that the district court committed the following errors: (1) incorrectly included some items and excluded others in the computation of the net worth of the taxpayer, thereby determining that a deficiency existed, (2) improperly imposed a penalty for fraud, and (3) allowed the government\u2019s counterclaim without a factual or legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">This case, like many others of a similar nature, depends in large degree upon the facts involved. Such factual issues related to the sufficiency of taxpayer\u2019s books and records, the existence of a claimed \u201ccash hoard\u201d, the amount of taxpayer\u2019s \u201cloans receivable\u201d, the validity of various expenditures by the taxpayer, and other similar issues. As to all factual determinations, we are bound by the findings of the district court unless such findings are clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P.; United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); Archer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 227 F.2d 270 (5 Cir. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">With respect to the foregoing, the district court found as a matter of fact that the taxpayer pursued a course of conduct calculated to \u201cobstruct, confuse, and distort\u201d any proper determination of his income tax liability for taxable year 1956, that no adequate set of books and records was ever produced by taxpayer, that taxpayer\u2019s assertion of the existence of a $35,000 cash hoard was false, that the government\u2019s calculation of net worth (with minor adjustments)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was correct, and that the value of the items which evidenced an increase in net worth and were the basis of the government\u2019s counterclaim were correct and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-17\">We have examined and considered the record, briefs, and the contentions of the parties and conclude that the judgment of the district court should be and the same is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-12\">. Originally Jake Mladinich, Sr., was a party plaintiff in the district court. He died subsequent to the remand, and Mary Mladinich as administratrix of his estate was substituted as a party by order of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-18\">. As a result of certain proof at the trial the government conceded that its figures for personal living expenses of John Mladinich should be reduced by the sum of $2,500.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
