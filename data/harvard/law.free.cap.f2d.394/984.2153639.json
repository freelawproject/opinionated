The only evidence of any misconduct on his part was that he whistled and made \u201cwolf calls.\u201d There was no evidence of what manner of whistling he engaged in or what a wolf call is, either in general or in this particular instance. Neither mode of expression was defined or described in any way so as to give the jury any basis for finding that Perkins\u2019 actions constituted unreasonable noise, offensive coarse utterance or display, or abusive language. <em>Nor </em>was <em>there </em>evidence to support a conviction of Perkins on a theory of aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-25\">The evidence was sufficient as to the other two appellants and their convictions must be affirmed. The sentences were usually severe for disorderly conduct by minor first offenders. If appellants Johnson and Lahmen wish to seek reduction of their sentences they may do so by filing motions with the district court under Rule 35, Fed.R. Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-26\">Reversed as to appellant Perkins. Affirmed as to appellants Johnson and Lahmen.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-16\">.
