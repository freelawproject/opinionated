Smith, the stevedoring company, posed only issues of fact for determination by the trial court. The appeals likewise present similar questions to us. There was ample evidence to warrant the judgments both on the main claim of Simmons (including the determination that Simmons was not guilty of contributory negligence) and on the cross claim by the Steamship Company against T. Smith, the stevedoring contractor, Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-27\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
