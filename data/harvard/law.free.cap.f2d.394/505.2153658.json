In addition, he faces a future consecutive sentence of one-year-to-life on a conviction for escape without force. Appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus showed on its face that the escape conviction was valid. Appellant attacked only the validity of the narcotics conviction. The district court summarily denied the petition, reasoning that even if appellant\u2019s narcotics conviction were invalid, appellant would have to serve the sentence on the escape charge and thus appellant was not eligible for the writ because he was not entitled to \u201cimmediate release\u201d within the meaning of McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 138, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934), as interpreted by this court in Hoffman v. United States, 9 Cir., 244 F.2d 378, 381-382 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-20\">In its recent decision in Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335, 88 S.Ct. 962, 19 L.Ed.2d 1215 (March 11, 1968), the Supreme Court held that <em>McNally </em>was not a bar to habeas corpus attack on the first of two consecutive sentences. Thus, the ground upon which the district court relied in not reaching the merits of appellant\u2019s petition is no longer tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-21\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
