Relying on prior use and registration on the Supplemental Register ' of \u201cDUST \u2019\u00d1 WAX\u201d for furniture polish, Standard International Corporation opposes, alleging that \u201cDUST \u2019N GLOW\u201d so resembles \u201cDUST \u2019N WAX\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissed the opposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-22\">The board found, and appellee does not dispute, that \u201cthe goods of the parties would readily be assumed to originate with a single source if sold under the same or similar marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-23\">In concluding \u201cthere is no likelihood of confusion, or mistake or deception,\u201d the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-24\">The only similarity between the. marks in issue resides in the parties\u2019 use of \u201cDUST \u2019N.\u201d Opposer\u2019s mark possesses an obvious descriptive connotation as applied to its furniture polish which waxes as one dusts. In this regard we note that opposer\u2019s registration of \u201cDUST \u2019N WAX\u201d issued on the Supplemental Register. Applicant\u2019s mark, on the other hand, merely suggests that which opposer\u2019s mark says definitively. Moreover, the end portions of the marks are different. Op-poser\u2019s mark is inherently weak and where a party uses a weak mark, his competitors, may come closer to such mark without violating his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In support of its view the board cited Fleetwood Company v. Hazel Bishop, Inc., 352 F.2d 841, (CA 7, 1965); Sure-Fit Products Co. v. Saltzson Drapery Co., 254 F.2d 158, 45 CCPA 856, (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We agree that the opposer\u2019s mark is inherently weak, but the \u201cDUST \u2019N\u201d part of it is not entirely without a certain distinctiveness and although the end portions of the marks are entirely different words, \u201cGLOW\u201d is at least suggestive of the effect of using a wax polish upon furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We do not agree with the conclusion reached by the board. It is true, as pronounced in the <em>Fleetwood </em>and <em>Sure-Fit </em>cases, that owners of inherently weak trademarks do not ordinarily enjoy the wide latitude of protection afforded owners of strong marks. However, a mark which is initially a weak one may, by reason of subsequent use and promotion, acquire such distinctiveness that it can function as a significant indication of a particular producer as source of the goods with which it is used. Clinton Detergent Co. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., 302 F.2d 745, 49 CCPA 1146, (1962), and Jenkins Publishing Co. v. Metalworking Publishing Co., 315 F.2d 955, 50 CCPA 1218, (1963). In the present case, we think the original weakness of appellant\u2019s mark, which limited its registration to the Supplemental Register, is offset significantly by appellant\u2019s subsequent expenditures for promotion and the resulting sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Thus, sales of \u201cDUST \u2019N WAX\u201d polish from the period 1961 through the first nine months of 1964 exceeded $4,000,000 and advertising expenses in connection with the mark during the same period amounted to in excess of $2,000,000. The predominant portion of those sales and expenditures took place before May 27, 1963, the date appellee filed its application for registration and to which it is limited for first use because of absence of any proof of earlier use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Kiekhaefer v. Willys-Overland Motors Inc., 236 F.2d 423, 43 CCPA 1013, (1956). Recognizing that each case must be considered on its own facts, we are of the view that \u201cDUST \u2019N WAX\u201d has acquired such significance as an indication of the source of appellant\u2019s polish that the use of \u201cDUST \u2019N GLOW\u201d for appellee\u2019s polishing cloth is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive. Under the circumstances, appellee has acted at his peril in adopting so similar a mark for such closely related goods and any doubt there might be must be resolved against him.
