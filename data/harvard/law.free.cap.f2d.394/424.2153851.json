The crime for which each appellant was convicted was the violation of \u00a7 2118(a) of Title 18, United States Code, which section defines, inter alia, robbery of a bank by intimidation, and \u00a7 2 of Title 18, United States Code, aiding and abetting one Par\u00e9 in the robbery of a bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Evidence was received at the trial of the appellants which supports the following narrative of pertinent events. At about 4:30 in the morning of September 20, 1966, the appellant Elmenhorst, a cab driver, picked up Alan Par\u00e9, a 21 year old man, in the North Beach area of San Francisco. The two were well acquainted, having lived together previously. Par\u00e9 told Elmenhorst that he was desperate for money at the time. Elmen-horst said that they could pull an armed robbery of a bank at 4th and Brannan Streets. They were at that time driving around the block in which that bank was located. Elmenhorst explained the layout of the bank to Par\u00e9, and said it would be an easy one to rob. Par\u00e9, said that the bank was \u201cfederal\u201d and he did not want to get mixed up in a federal case. Elmenhorst said there had been five or six federal bank robberies in the last month and that no one had been caught. Elmenhorst had, sometime before, suggested to Par\u00e9 that Par\u00e9 rob a bank in San Mateo, California, but Par\u00e9 had not followed that suggestion. An arrangement was made for Elmenhorst to pick Par\u00e9 up at a designated place at about 1:30 p. m. on that same day. At about noon on that day, Elmenhorst contacted appellant Asher, who lived in an apartment in the same building in San Mateo in which Elmenhorst lived. Asher was a San Mateo policeman who was working a midnight to 8:00 a. m. shift. Elmen-horst invited Asher to ride into San Francisco with Elmenhorst and his wife, who was to be taken to a hairdresser. Asher accepted the invitation. Elmen-horst\u2019s wife was dropped off at her hairdresser\u2019s place, then Elmenhorst drove to the place where he had agreed to pick up Par\u00e9. Par\u00e9 got into Elmenhorst\u2019s car at about 1:30 p. m. Asher had met Par\u00e9 some months before in a bar and had seen him four or five times thereafter. Par\u00e9 inquired of Elmenhorst why Asher was with him and Elmenhorst replied that Asher just wanted to come along and \u201cmaybe we\u2019d need him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">There was discussion among the three men in the automobile concerning the robbing of a bank. All participated freely in the discussions. As we shall see, both appellants, Elmenhorst and Asher, urge that they did not take the discussions seriously. We discuss that question hereinafter. Par\u00e9\u2019s direct testimony was that he asked Asher what would happen to him if he got caught and that Asher said he would get eighteen months and a chance for a good education. It would have been natural for Par\u00e9 to address that question to the policeman Asher rather than to the cab driver Elmenhorst. Par\u00e9\u2019s testimony as to the person to whom the question was addressed and the person who had answered it was shaken on cross-examination. Par\u00e9 testified, without attributing the language specifically to either of the appellants, that they said that they had an alibi and it would not do Par\u00e9 any good to \u201ccop out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">The car then was driven by Elmen-horst to a Woolworth store. Elmenhorst gave Par\u00e9 three dollars and directed him to buy a toy pistol and a notebook tablet, which Par\u00e9 did. Then Elmenhorst dictated a suggested version of the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>which Par\u00e9 was to hand to the teller in the bank to initiate the robbery. Par\u00e9 discarded the Elmenhorst text and composed and discarded several versions, finally settling on the one he used. Then Elmenhorst drove to a grocery store where Par\u00e9 obtained a bag in which to put the bank\u2019s money. Then they drove around the vicinity of the bank, looking for a hiding place for Par\u00e9 after he had robbed the bank. Elmenhorst decided on an automobile which was standing in a parking lot in a block adjoining the block in which the bank was located. Elmenhorst unlocked that automobile with a wire coat-hanger and directed Par\u00e9 to wait in it for Elmenhorst to pick him up after the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Elmenhorst and Asher then drove away and Par\u00e9 proceeded to rob the bank by presenting a threatening note to the teller, holding the toy pistol, covered by his sweater, and indicating its presence to the teller. He obtained $1,121 in paper currency in the robbery. He ran to the pre-arranged hiding place in the automobile and waited there for the return of his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Elmenhorst and Asher, after leaving Par\u00e9 near the bank before the robbery, went to a bar a few blocks away, then to a bail bondsman, of whose secretary Elmenhorst made an inquiry. Then they went to the Hall of Justice, where Elmen-horst paid a parking ticket and arranged an appearance on another traffic violation. In the basement cafeteria there they had coffee, then drove back to Par\u00e9\u2019s hiding place, heard him whistle, stopped, and Par\u00e9 got into the car with them. Par\u00e9 exhibited the money which proved that he had robbed the bank. Elmenhorst ordered Par\u00e9 to stay down in the back seat of the auto. They drove to the freeway. Elmenhorst said, \u201cI knew you could do it.\u201d Asher asked him how much he got and he answered $700 or $800. Elmenhorst demanded the money and Par\u00e9 gave it to him. Having left the freeway just before they got to San Mateo, Elmenhorst and Asher were talking about making Par\u00e9 out to be a student so that they could pull off the road, and Asher said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a perfect front, being a cop, you know.\u201d Par\u00e9\u2019s hair was shoulder length and Asher and Elmenhorst decided that he must have his hair cut. Asher objected to his being taken to his, Asher\u2019s, barber, but Par\u00e9 objected to being taken to just any barber, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to any, you know, crew cut cat, man, I want to go to a stylist.\u201d So they took him to Asher\u2019s barber.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">An attendant at the parking lot in San Francisco where Par\u00e9 had hidden after the robbery had discovered Par\u00e9 sitting in the car in the lot and had told him he could not stay there. As Par\u00e9 left that car to walk toward the street side of the lot he had dropped a bundle of $20 bills. The attendant called his attention to them, Par\u00e9 retrieved them, walked on, and whistled. Elmenhorst\u2019s car stopped in the street and Par\u00e9 got into it, as we have seen. The attendant made a note of the license number of Elmenhorst\u2019s car. The number was traced to Elmenhorst\u2019s San Mateo address, and the police and the FBI arrived there in the evening of the robbery at about 8:30 p. m. Elmenhorst and Asher were arrested at their apartments, $525 of the money, which Asher said he had hidden, at Elmenhorst\u2019s suggestion, in his garbage disposal unit, was turned over to the FBI; Elmenhorst went with the FBI to the shopping center in San Mateo where Par\u00e9 was having his hair cut, and Par\u00e9 was arrested there.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Par\u00e9, Elmenhorst and Asher were indicted in one count for the robbery of the bank. Par\u00e9, on November 7, 1966, pleaded guilty and was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b) and 5017(c) of Title 18, U.S.Code, as a youth offender. In the trial of Elmenhorst and Asher, the prosecution\u2019s theory was that they aided and abetted Par\u00e9 in the robbery, thereby becoming liable as principals under \u00a7 2 of Title 18, U.S.Code. That section says, in its subsection (a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>procures its commission is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">ELMENHORST</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\"> Elmenhorst\u2019s activities, as recited above in this opinion, place him easily within the quoted provision. He suggested the robbery of the bank as the solution of Par\u00e9\u2019s financial stringency; he encouraged Par\u00e9 to commit the robbery by telling him that bank robbery was a frequent occurrence and that bank robbers were seldom caught; he drove to San Francisco to help in the final arrangements for the robbery; he advanced the money and the idea for the purchase of the simple implements for the robbery; he supplied the idea of a near-by off-street hiding place for Par\u00e9 after the robbery, and used his skill to unlock the parked car so that Par\u00e9 could hide in it. It is hard to think how anyone could have been more intimately involved in this project without accompanying Par\u00e9 into the bank, which Elmenhorst of course did not do. Elmenhorst\u2019s defense on the merits is that, in spite of all the steps preliminary to a bank robbery, in which steps he had been the principal actor, he did not expect, when he and Asher left Par\u00e9 in the vicinity of the bank and drove away, that Par\u00e9 would rob the bank. But the most that the jury could possibly have gathered from the evidence was that, although Elmenhorst had instigated and planned a robbery by Par\u00e9, Elmenhorst was still skeptical as to whether Par\u00e9 would really proceed to try to rob the bank, or succeed if he did try. Since Par\u00e9 did in fact rob the bank, the skepticism of Elmenhorst as to whether Par\u00e9 would, or could, accomplish their joint objective did not mean that Elmenhorst had not aided and abetted the accomplishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Elmenhorst specifies several alleged errors committed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">As we have seen, Elmenhorst\u2019s defense on the merits was that he had no idea that Par\u00e9 was going to rob a bank. On that issue, a question of first-rank importance would be: What did Elmen-horst know, before Par\u00e9 robbed the bank here in question, about Par\u00e9\u2019s proclivities for criminal activities and his capacity for robbing, by intimidation, an institution from which money could be obtained by robbery? Elmenhorst, having testified that he had no idea that Par\u00e9 would or could rob a bank was asked, on cross-examination, whether he knew, before the day of the bank robbery, that Par\u00e9 had robbed the Luxor Cab Company. Elmenhorst\u2019s answer was, \u201cYes, I knew.\u201d The question was proper and the answer was important. Elmenhorst gave further testimony indicating that he was not in town at the time of the Luxor robbery, that other cab drivers had told him about the robbery in a coffee shop. These statements, if allowed to stand uncontradicted, would have considerably weakened the effect of Elmenhorst\u2019s brief answer, \u201cYes, I knew,\u201d by indicating that he knew only by hearsay that Par\u00e9 was capable of committing a robbery. The Government therefore wanted to show that Elmen-horst\u2019s knowledge of Par\u00e9\u2019s robbery of the Luxor Company was much more direct than his testimony had indicated. It wanted to ask Elmenhorst whether he had not said to Inspector Dyer of the Police Department that he had, on the occasion of the Luxor Cab robbery, sent Par\u00e9 in to the cab company office. Elmenhorst\u2019s counsel objected. The court was troubled by the \u201cother crimes\u201d aspect of this line of questioning and proposed a rather roundabout line of questioning of the Inspector which would partially fulfill the Government\u2019s objective. Elmenhorst\u2019s counsel refused to stipulate to the court\u2019s proposed procedure. Then the court allowed the Government to ask Elmenhorst if he had not told Inspector Dyer that he knew of the Luxor Cab robbery because he had sent Par\u00e9 in to the robbery. Elmenhorst denied that he had made the statement, and said that he had sarcastically said to Inspector Dyer that he had sent Par\u00e9 in to rob the Queen Mary. When the Government proposed to question Inspector Dyer about Elmenhorst\u2019s statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>him there was objection, but. the court permitted the question, \u201cDuring one of these conversations, did he state to you that he had sent Mr. Par\u00e9 in to the Luxor Cab Company?\u201d The Inspector\u2019s answer was \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Elmenhorst\u2019s brief asserts error in regard to the foregoing incident on account of (a) improper impeachment, and (b) no foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> Although there was frequent mention of impeachment in the discussion between court and counsel before the Inspector took the witness stand, there was really no problem of impeachment. Whatever a party to a suit has said may be used against him by his adversary. If what he has said relates to an issue in the case, such as, in this case, Elmenhorst\u2019s knowledge of Par\u00e9\u2019s capacity to commit a robbery. Elmenhorst\u2019s statement showing such knowledge is substantive evidence that he possessed that knowledge. It may be proved, like any other fact, by cross-examination or by extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> Elmenhorst makes much of the fact that the questions and answers just discussed created an inference of criminality. So far as they attributed criminality to Par\u00e9, that was, of course, no concern of Elmenhorst. So far as the questions and answers about the Luxor Cab robbery attributed criminality to Elmenhorst, this is simply another instance in which evidence of the involvement of a defendant in a crime other than the one for which he is on trial is admissible if that involvement tends to prove, <em>inter alia,, </em>knowledge and knowledge is an issue in the case on trial. In the instant case, knowledge by Elmenhorst of Par\u00e9\u2019s capacity to rob was the key issue in Elmenhorst\u2019s case. The evidence was clearly admissible in spite of its tendency to prejudice Elmenhorst in the mind of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Elmenhorst attributes error to a question of the prosecuting attorney addressed to Elmenhorst asking him whether Par\u00e9 had any reason to testify falsely against him, Elmenhorst. The question was objected to, but Elmenhorst was allowed to answer, and went into a good deal of detail as to the fact that Par\u00e9 was mad at Elmenhorst because the latter had led the police to Par\u00e9 in the evening after the bank robbery. Then Government counsel asked Elmenhorst if he had not put the police on Par\u00e9 in connection with the Luxor Cab robbery. This question was objected to as bringing in the subject of other crimes. It did not, of course, refer to other crimes of the defendants and was not objectionable on that ground. There were other developments in the trial relating to the Luxor Cab robbery, and we have discussed the \u201cother crimes\u201d problem in that connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Elmenhorst specifies as error that the court, over objection, gave an instruction on exculpatory statements to the effect that if a defendant voluntarily makes a statement tending to establish his innocence, which statement is later shown to be false, an inference of consciousness of guilt may be drawn by the jury from such evidence. Elmenhorst argues that there was no occasion for such an instruction because, although he at first told the police that he knew nothing about the robbery of a bank, he changed his story shortly thereafter and admitted that he knew all about the robbery. This prompt abandonment of his exculpatory statement might have a bearing on the weight which the jury should attach to it. But the instruction was proper. In our discussion of Asher\u2019s case, infra, we have also treated this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">We do not discuss Elmenhorst\u2019s criticism of the court\u2019s treatment, in its original instruction and its supplemental instruction, of the subject of what constitutes aiding and abetting in the law of crimes. The evidence as to Elmenhorst\u2019s part in the crime would make futile any discussion of delicate distinctions between being just inside and just outside the undefined line between aiding and abetting, <em>vel non. </em>Elmenhorst was, according to all the evidence, clearly inside the line. His defense is that he had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>idea that there was going to be a crime and for that reason he could not have intended to aid and abet the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The indictment in this case charged that the defendants \u201ctook by force, violence and intimidation, a certain sum of money from a bank,\u201d etc. Elmenhorst asserts in this appeal that the prosecution failed to establish the <em>corpus delicti, </em>since it did not produce the teller of the bank to testify as to whether she was intimidated by Par\u00e9 when she put the bank\u2019s money in his paper bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Counsel stipulated at the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201c * * * that the United California Bank, 4th and Brannan Street office, had a loss of $1,121 as a result of the actions of Alan Hugh Par\u00e9 alleged in the above-entitled case, and that Exhibit 3 may be admitted into evidence in the trial of the above-entitled case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Exhibit 3, of Miscellaneous Exhibits, is the typewritten statement of Alan Hugh Par\u00e9. This statement narrated the events of Pare\u2019s robbery of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The court\u2019s instructions to the jury included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\u201c * * * And the stipulation bears a date of January 9, 1967, and carries the signatures of all counsel, all three of the attorneys in the case. And, as I say, the facts stated in this stipulation are not open to question and are, for all purposes, conclusively established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">No question was raised at the trial about the validity or the effect of the stipulation. The <em>corpus delicti </em>question raised in this appeal has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">ASHER</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">In the foregoing part of this opinion we have discussed appellant Elmenhorst\u2019s case. We have said that on the evidence presented and which could rationally have been believed by the jury, Elmenhorst was deeply involved in the robbery of the bank, from the time that he suggested the robbery to the time that Par\u00e9 was placed in the vicinity of the bank with the necessary implements for its perpetration. As to the appellant Asher, the situation is quite different. He did not come upon the stage until after it had been agreed between Elmen-horst and Par\u00e9 that there was to be a robbery of a designated bank at approximately a specified time. When Elmen-horst brought Asher, known by Par\u00e9 to be a policeman, to Elmenhorst\u2019s meeting with Par\u00e9 to make the final preparations for the robbery, Par\u00e9 was, naturally, suspicious and asked why Asher was there. Elmenhorst said, \u201cWe might need him.\u201d Then the discussion of the intended robbery began: the inquiry as to Par\u00e9\u2019s punishment if he should be captured; the alibis which Elmenhorst and Asher would have if Par\u00e9 should be captured; the request of Par\u00e9 for the use of Ash-er\u2019s gun in the robbery and Elmenhorst\u2019s prudent judgment that Par\u00e9 should not have a lethal weapon; the necessity to provide Par\u00e9 with a threatening note and a non-lethal simulation of a lethal weapon; and the provision of a hiding place where Par\u00e9 would conceal himself after the robbery until he would be picked up by Elmenhorst and Asher. Asher heard and acquiesced in all of these decisions and took some part in the discussion. The jury could rationally have concluded that Asher\u2019s contention that he had no idea that a robbery or an attemped robbery was imminent was unbelievable. The discussion and the preparatory steps were not carried on in the spirit and mood of children playing a game of cops and robbers. They bore no resemblance to a game of make-believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">Asher complains that the court did not adequately instruct the jury on the subject of aiding and abetting when the jury returned to the court for further instructions after it had begun its deliberations. Specifically, what Asher complains of is that the jury was not <em>re-instructed </em>on aiding and abetting in the supplemental instruction which the court gave in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry. The jury\u2019s question was, \u201cIs there a verdict that we can give that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>would be \u2018Guilty after the fact, or guilty as accessory after the fact\u2019 ? \u201d Before the jury was called back to receive the answer to its inquiry, the court and counsel considered in detail what the answer should be. It was agreed that, the charges against the defendants being what they were, the jury could not bring in such a verdict as its inquiry suggested. The court said, \u201cand then I\u2019m going to read the standard instruction on aiding and abetting.\u201d When the jury was called in, the court answered its question about \u201cguilty after the fact,\u201d and then discussed at considerable length the concept of aiding and abetting, the crime with which the defendants were charged. In addition, as we have seen, the court had, in its original charge to the jury, specifically and in detail instructed on aiding and abetting. We think it was quite unnecessary for the court in the supplemental instruction to again discuss aiding and abetting, which was not the problem raised by the jury\u2019s inquiry. The court in its supplemental instruction said nothing that was inconsistent with its original instruction on aiding and abetting, or inconsistent with good law. Our conclusion is that the jury was both instructed and re-instructed on the subject of aiding and abetting and that there was no error in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Asher complains because the trial court instructed the jury on the significance of exculpatory statements by a defendant, which statements are later proved to be false. The instruction included this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cIt is reasonable to infer that an innocent person does not ordinarily find it necessary to invent or fabricate a voluntary explanation or statement tending to establish his innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In the discussion concerning instructions which the court was proposing to give, counsel for Asher, urging that the proposed instruction on exculpatory statements not be given, said that there was no evidence of any exculpatory statements, and referring to Elmenhorst\u2019s first answer to police inquiry about a bank robbery, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d argued that because Elmen-horst, within a matter of minutes, admitted that he knew a great deal about the robbery, his prior statement was not exculpatory. Counsel\u2019s position was wrong as to Elmenhorst. If counsel had urged that Asher had not made any exculpatory statement, the court might have given special attenion to that argument. The instruction as given contained this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201cWhether or not evidence as to a defendant\u2019s voluntary explanation or statement points to a consciousness of guilt, and the significance, if any, to be attached to such evidence, are matters for determination by you, the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">If, as seems to have been the fact, there was no exculpatory statement within the meaning of the applicable rule on the part of Asher, it is hard to see in what manner the jury could have misused the instruction. We do not resolve the question, raised for the first time on appeal, that exculpatory statements, to come within the rule, must be extra-judicial to the instant lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The judgment is affirmed as to each defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
