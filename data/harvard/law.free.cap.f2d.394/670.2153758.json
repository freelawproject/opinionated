Therefore he requested \u201cfull aviation coverage,\u201d understood by him and defendant\u2019s soliciting agent to provide that the double indemnity payable to the policy beneficiary in the event of an accidental death would be payable in the event that death resulted from an accidental aircraft crash while the insured was piloting the aircraft. \u201cFull aviation coverage\u201d was granted and Harrell paid an additional premium of $29.00 to have it added to the original premium of $9.20 for double indemnity if death occurred from an accident. A policy was issued on February 26, 1964 which stated that the annual premiums were $220.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">On December 23, 1965 Harrell died from injuries he received when an Air National Guard plane he was piloting crashed. The plaintiff, the beneficiary of the deceased\u2019s policy, was paid the face of the policy but was not paid the added $10,000, the company maintaining that an exclusion in the policy from accident indemnity coverage applied. This exclusion, applicable to accident indemnity, provides that no double indemnity \u201c * * * shall be payable * * * if the death of the Insured results directly or indirectly * * * from service, travel or flight in any kind of aircraft except as a passenger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number> The court below, after a full hearing, found that both the decedent and defendant\u2019s agent understood that this exclusionary provision would not deprive the insured\u2019s beneficiary of double indemnity in the event the insured was accidentally kiled while piloting an airplane in that an extra premium was paid for \u201cfull aviation coverage\u201d; and that, in view of this understanding and this payment, if there is any possible doubt as to the meaning of \u201cfull aviation coverage\u201d that doubt should be resolved against the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Judgment below for $10,000 and interest was awarded to the plaintiff. We agree with the disposition below.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
