The United States has joined in the motion to the extent of suggesting remand for dismissal or other appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-21\">Where a convicted defendant dies pending review of his case the appeal is to be dismissed. Wetzel v. Ohio, 371 U.S. 62, 83 S.Ct. 111, 9 L.Ed.2d 26 (1962), and cases there cited. There was no fine imposed, hence there is no occasion for an order concerning disposition of a fine. See American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 90 L.Ed. 1575 (1945); United States v.
