In late April of the following year, over 50 of its shareholders notified the FDIC that they intended to sue the former officials of the bank and called on it \u201c[i]n the event that the FDIC owns the causes of action\u201d to bring suit upon them. According to the allegations of the complaint which they filed two months later, they received no response to their demand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Acting in its capacity as receiver, the FDIC removed the case to federal court, moved to intervene in its corporate capacity, and in addition sought dismissal of the shareholders\u2019 action. Those motions were granted, and the FDIC filed its own action. This appeal from the order of dismissal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-23\">Appellants do not dispute that the causes of action that they seek to bring are derivative ones, or that the FDIC owns them. Their sole contention is that the asserted failure of the FDIC to reply to their demand letter justified their action in bringing suit. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-24\">A derivative action by shareholders to enforce corporate rights is a remedy of last resort. Over one hundred years ago, the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-25\">[Bjefore the shareholder is permitted in his own name to institute and conduct a litigation which usually belongs to the corporation, he should show to the satisfaction of the court that he has exhaust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ed all the means within his reach to obtain, within the corporation itself, the redress of his grievances, or action in conformity with his wishes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"><em>Hawes v. Contra Costa Water Co., </em>104 U.S. 450, 460-61, 14 Otto 450, 460-61, 26 L.Ed. 827 (1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The Court\u2019s observation has stood the test of time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">Since the corporation alone has standing to sue both insiders and outsiders for actionable wrongs committed against it, courts have been careful to regard the derivative suit, as an extraordinary remedy, available to the shareholder, as the corporation\u2019s representative, only when there is \u201cno other road to redress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2-\">Note, \u201cDemand on Directors and Shareholders as a Prerequisite to a Derivative Suit,\u201d 73 Harv.L.Rev. 746, 748 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Rule 23.1, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, requires that such a complaint \u201callege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action he desires from the directors or comparable authority ... and the reasons for his failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort.\u201d In this instance, plaintiffs allege merely that they made two demands on the FDIC in April and, when the FDIC failed to respond to their demands and without further contact, filed suit in June. In light of the requirements of Rule 23.1, we are justified in assuming that plaintiffs did no more in this respect than they allege they did. They make no claim that the FDIC refused to proceed or was not acting in good faith, merely one that it did not respond to plaintiffs\u2019 demand. By the time plaintiffs\u2019 suit was dismissed, the FDIC had brought its own against the same former bank officials that plaintiffs sought to sue on behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">To establish his right to bring a derivative action, a shareholder must \u201cshow, to the satisfaction of the court, that he has exhausted all the means within his reach to obtain\u201d the action he desires. <em>Hawes v. Contra Costa Water Co., </em>104 U.S. 450, 460-61, 14 Otto 450, 460-61, 26 L.Ed. 827 (1882); <em>see Galef v. Alexander, </em>615 F.2d 51, 59 (2d Cir.1980) (Rule 23.1 \u201cis essentially a requirement that a stockholder exhaust his intracorporate remedies before bringing a derivative action\u201d). The demand required by Rule 23.1 \u201cmust be more than pro forma; the plaintiff must make a serious request ... and specify the nature of the activity in question.\u201d <em>Smachlo v. Birkelo, </em>576 F.Supp. 1439, 1443 (D.Del.1983). Stated otherwise, the shareholder \u201cmust make an earnest, not a simulated effort ... to induce remedial action.\u201d <em>Hawes, </em>104 U.S. at 461, 14 Otto at 450. This requirement is consistent with the general principle that \u201cthe responsibility for determining whether or not a corporation shall enforce in the courts a cause of action for damages is, like other business questions, ordinarily a matter of internal management.\u201d <em>Landy v. FDIC, </em>486 F.2d 139, 146 (3d Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Courts have required more than a simple demand that the corporation file suit; they have also required plaintiffs to make reasonable efforts to assist the corporation in initiating action. Thus, in <em>Shlensky v. Dorsey, </em>574 F.2d 131 (3d Cir.1978), the court refused to allow a derivative action where the plaintiffs requested action against unidentified third parties. The court found this demand \u201ccompletely lacking in the specificity which would give the directors a fair opportunity to initiate the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141. Similarly, the First Circuit has stated that the directors must be \u201cgiven full knowledge of the basis for the claim.\u201d <em>Halprin v. Babbitt, </em>303 F.2d 138, 141 (1st Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">In light of these authorities, we conclude that appellants\u2019 efforts were inadequate as a matter of law. They did not inform the FDIC of \u201cthe basis for the claim(s)\u201d they wanted it to assert. See <em>Halprin, </em>303 F.2d at 141. Although they informed the FDIC of the identity of the prospective defendants by enclosing a copy of the complaint they had drafted, they included no information about the allegedly wrongful actions of the Bank\u2019s officials. Appellants\u2019 complaint contains only conclusory charges without factual allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Furthermore, appellants\u2019 letter demand states merely that they <em>might </em>be willing to share their information with the FDIC, and then only if it filed suit promptly. This can hardly be called an earnest effort to induce action by the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Appellants\u2019 reliance upon the FDIC\u2019s alleged failure to respond is unjustified. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the FDIC in fact failed to respond, its failure was not surprising in light of the language of appellants\u2019 letter, which does not appear to call for a response. Although appellants demanded that the FDIC bring suit, they never stated that they would forego their own suit if it did so; and they evinced an intention to file suit regardless of the FDIC\u2019s actions. The only response that the letter requested was \u201ca copy of the contract of sale or any other documents which you claim gives rise to the FDIC\u2019s ownership of the causes of action that we are asserting.\u201d Although they admit that they were aware of the FDIC\u2019s investigation, they took no steps to assist the investigation or to determine its status before filing. In short, appellants\u2019 efforts to induce action by the FDIC can only be characterized as pro forma and therefore were inadequate as a matter of law. Surveying them, we find it hard to avoid the conclusion that from the outset plaintiffs were resolved upon making a trip to the briar patch and sought only an excuse to be thrown in.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Moreover, the record reveals that at present the actions which plaintiffs wished to bring derivatively are being pursued directly by the FDIC, the proper party to assert them, against the same officials whom plaintiffs sued. Nor do plaintiffs assert that the actions are not proceeding properly or that any conflict of interest is present. In such circumstances, even had plaintiffs\u2019 bringing suit been justified, we would see little, if any, occasion for a reversal of the trial court\u2019s order. See <em>Lan-dy, supra, </em>486 F.2d at 151-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The order of the district court dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-18\">. An affidavit attached to the motion to dismiss filed by the FDIC, executed by counsel representing it, asserts that she conferred with the shareholders\u2019 counsel by telephone in response to the April letter, advising her that the claims in question belonged to the FDIC and would be proceeded upon when its investigation was completed. Shareholders\u2019 counsel recalls no such conversation. Given our disposition of the appeal, this controversy need not be resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
