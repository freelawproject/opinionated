BROWN, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Defendant-appellant Thomas L. Pack appeals from a jury verdict convicting him on one count of conspiracy and three substantive counts for violations of the tax laws of the United States. Pack was jointly indicted with co-defendant Neal Todd on one count of conspiracy (Count I). In separate counts, the Grand Jury charged Pack with filing of a false income tax return and willful attempts to evade or defeat payment of income taxes (Counts II, III, IV). The Grand Jury also charged Todd with three counts of felonious failure to file currency transaction reports (\u201cCTRs\u201d) (Counts V, VI, VII). Pack and Todd were tried before the same jury. The jury found Pack guilty of having violated three separate federal statutes: (1) 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conspiring to defraud and to impede the United States in its collection of income taxes; (2) 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7206(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> willful filing of a false income tax return; (3) 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7201,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> willful attempts to evade or defeat payment of income taxes. The jury also found Todd guilty of conspiracy and felonious failure to file CTRs with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), as required by 31 U.S.C. Secs. 1081, 1059 (1970), and the regulations promulgated under these provisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Only Pack is seeking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>review of the judgment of his convictions in this appeal. Assigning the following allegations of error, Pack claims that he was denied a fair trial. First, he asserts that the district court erred in admitting hearsay evidence relating to the conspiracy under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Next, he claims that the court erred in refusing to grant his motion for severance at trial under Rule 14, F.R.Crim.P. Finally, Pack maintains that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury sufficiently on his theory of defense. A careful review of the record reveals that none of these contentions has merit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">It is axiomatic that in reviewing a criminal conviction, we must evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, deferring to the jury\u2019s weighing of the evidence and credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Pilling, </em>721 F.2d 286, 288 (10th Cir.1983). We will not recite the defendant Pack\u2019s versions of the facts, since the jury obviously did not credit them. Pack was an electrician by trade and a member of the Electrical Workers Federal Credit Union in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Todd was the manager of this credit union until September 1979 when he was terminated from this position. The conduct for which Pack and Todd were indicted occurred between 1978 and 1980. During these years, Pack earned substantial income from his bookmaking ventures in wagering the outcome of the football and basketball games. These wagering activities usually generated large amounts of cash. Pack needed a method for depositing these wager earnings which would frustrate the IRS from ascertaining their sources and assessing taxes due on such revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Pack met Todd in March, 1978 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At that time, Todd was having numerous financial problems at the credit union. Many of the borrowers from the credit union were in default of their loans.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The deposits by union members into the low interest yielding member-share savings accounts did not generate the funds which would sufficiently offset the losses sustained in delinquent loans. In attempting to balance its financial posture, Todd established special \u201cnote payable accounts\u201d for those investors with the arrangement that their investments and earnings would not be reported to the IRS for tax assessments. One of these investors was Pack, who opened a \u201cnote payable account\u201d at the credit union in March 1979. Todd instructed the employees at the credit union that the transactions in Pack\u2019s \u201cnote payable account\u201d would be managed in a manner which would circumvent the IRS reporting requirements. Between March 1978 and September 1979, Pack made several large deposits into and withdrawals from this \u201cnote payable account.\u201d Each of these transactions was over $10,000 in cash. There were no CTRs prepared and submitted to the IRS for each of these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The Government presented the cash expenditure method of proof to establish that during the tax years of 1977, 1978, and 1979 Pack had earned large amounts of unreported income from his gambling business. He also earned approximately $5,890 in 1977 as commission from his employment at Mid-Region Petroleum, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He did not declare this earning in his \u00cd977 tax return filed on May 26, 1978. The Government presented evidence and testimony to show that Pack attempted to prevent the IRS from discovering his actual income in 1978 and 1979 by placing the ownership titles for major items he purchased for himself in the names of several nomine\u00e9s. During these years, Pack purchased two cars, a boat, and various expensive home entertainment equipment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Most of which were paid in cash. Although Pack had an annual income in excess of $73,000 for each of these two years, Pack did not file either a 1978 or 1979 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Pack\u2019s first claim of error is two-fold: First, that the district court impermissibly departed from the \u201cpreferred order of proof\u201d by refusing to hold a separate <em>Andrews-Petersen </em>hearing in determining the admissibility of co-conspirator\u2019s hearsay statements; and second, that the district court erred by admitting hearsay statements of an alleged co-conspirator without sufficient independent evidence of the existence of a conspiracy. Pack contends that the Government failed to prove by the preponderance of the evidence, independent of the hearsay statements by Todd to his employees, he and Todd were participants of an agreement to defraud the United States and they acted in pursuit of that illegal objective by impairing or impeding the IRS in its tax collection functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Hearsay statements made by one member of a conspiracy is admissible evidence against co-conspirators under certain circumstances. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). In <em>United States v. Petersen, </em>611 F.2d 1313 (10th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 905, 100 S.Ct. 2986, 64 L.Ed.2d 854 (1980), we elucidated on the procedures announced in <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>585 F.2d 961 (10th Cir.1978), in admitting statement made by one member of a conspiracy against other members of a conspiracy. First, the trial judge must determine whether or not there is substantial, independent evidence of a conspiracy. Second, the trial judge must decide as a factual matter whether or not the prosecution has shown by a preponderance of the evidence independent of the hearsay statement (1) that a conspiracy existed, (2) that the co-conspirator and the defendant against whom the co-conspirator\u2019s statement is offered were members of the conspiracy, and (3) that the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Petersen, supra, </em>611 F.2d at 1313. We suggested that, whenever possible, it is preferable for the prosecution to first introduce its independent proof of the conspiracy and the defendant\u2019s connection with it before admitting the incriminating hearsay declarations of the co-conspirators. <em>Id., </em>at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The record reveals that the district court was thoroughly familiar with the <em>Andrews-Petersen </em>preferred order of proof procedures. Although the district court allowed the Government to proceed with its proof of the alleged conspiracy in the early phase of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, the court was very careful in requiring the Government to solicit only non-hearsay testimony and evidence supportive of the alleged conspiracy and the involvements of each of the defendants in it. In making its offer of proof, the Government established by independent evidence and testimony that: (1) Pack opened a \u201cnotes payable account\u201d at the credit union for the purpose of managing the cash earnings obtained from his wagering activities; (2) Todd, who was manager of the credit union, assisted Pack with the opening of his \u201cnotes payable account\u201d and also in verifying each of the currency transactions in Pack\u2019s account\u2014 all of which was in excess of $10,000; (3) Todd knew of the requirements for filing currency transaction report for cash transaction over $10,000, but did not submit any of such reports to the IRS for each of the currency transactions in Pack\u2019s account; (4) Todd directed his employees to keep the records of transactions for the \u201cnotes payable accounts\u201d in a special notes payable accounts ledger book instead of handling them in a manner consistent with the reporting procedures for transactions in the member-share savings accounts; (5) Pack withdrew from his \u201cnotes payable account\u201d all of his deposits and closed out this account immediately following the dismissal of Todd from his manager position at the credit union in September 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Participation in a criminal conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence; a common purpose or agreement to accomplish an unlawful objective may be inferred from a \u201cdevelopment and a collocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>circumstances.\u201d <em>Glosser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680, 704 (1942). Even a single overt act by the defendant can be sufficient to connect him to the conspiracy if that act leads to a reasonable inference of intent to participate in an unlawful agreement or criminal enterprise. <em>United States v. Pilling, supra, </em>721 F.2d at 292-293. In this case, there was substantial non-hearsay independent evidence to establish the existence of a conspiracy with the dual complimentary objectives to impair or impede the IRS in its function of identifying Pack\u2019s income and collecting taxes due and owing on such income. The credit union needed additional capital assets to counterbalance its losses in delinquent loans. To attract these investments, Todd established the \u201cnotes payable accounts.\u201d The bookkeeping procedures were arranged in such manner so as to serve Pack\u2019s purpose in hiding the true sources of his wagering income from the IRS during the years in question. We find there was substantial independent evidence that a conspiracy to defraud the United States existed, that Pack was one of the participating members of that conspiracy, and that the district court properly admitted the hearsay declarations by Todd which incriminated him and Pack for their involvements in conspiring to obstruct the tax collection functions of the IRS under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) after the court found the Government had met its burden of proof under the <em>Andrews-Petersen </em>standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The last two assignments of error which Pack has asserted on appeal have even less merit and do not require extended discussions. Before and during the trial, Pack moved for a separate trial under Rule 14, F.R.Crim.P.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claiming he was misjoined in the Indictment under Rule 8(b), F.R. Crim.P.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These motions were denied. Pack now contends that the failure to grant his motions for severance at trial was a reversible error. Without alleging any specific facts to support this contention, Pack merely asserts that he was prejudiced by the. spillover effects from the evidence introduced against co-defendant Todd.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Multiple defendants may be charged jointly in the same indictment upon the allegations that the defendants engaged in the same acts or series of transactions which constitute the offense of conspiracy. Rule 8(b), F.R.Crim.P.; <em>United States v. Petersen, supra, </em>611 F.2d at 1331. The general rule in conspiracy cases is that persons indicted together should be tried together. <em>United States v. Beathune, </em>527 F.2d 696 (10th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 996, 96 S.Ct. 2211, 48 L.Ed.2d 821 (1976). The trial court may, in its discretion, grant a severance of defendant from the action if prejudice to that defendant resulted from such joinder. Rule 14, F.R.Crim.P.; <em>United States v. Bridwell, </em>583 F.2d 1135, 1142 (10th Cir.1978). In determining the merits of a motion for severance, the trial court must balance two competing interests by weighing the prejudice to a particular defendant caused by the joinder against the considerations of economy and expedition in judicial administration. <em>United States v. Walton, </em>552 F.2d 1354 (10th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 2685, 53 L.Ed.2d 277 (1977). The trial court\u2019s decision on the motion for severance will not be disturbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>on appeal in the absence of abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hopkinson, </em>631 F.2d 665, 668 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 969, 101 S.Ct. 1489, 67 L.Ed.2d 620 (1981). To establish an abuse of discretion, the defendant must factually demonstrate that the denial of severance deprives his right to a fair trial, <em>United States v. Butler, </em>494 F.2d 1246, 1256 (10th Cir.1974), not merely that a separate trial might have offered him a better chance of acquittal. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>488 F.2d 1154, 1160 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We have reviewed the entire trial record. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in trying the defendants jointly. Although there were over two hundred exhibits admitted into evidence, the trial was neither unusually lengthy nor complex and the jury could compartmentalize the evidence as to each of the defendants and properly apply it to the court\u2019s instructions. There were numerous bench conferences requested by counsel for the defendants at trial, where the trial judge required the Government to excise some arguably prejudicial pieces of evidence which would be admissible to one defendant but not the other. The evidence against Pack for his involvement in the conspiracy to defraud the United States was only one part of the overall proof of this illegal scheme. There was additional independent evidence which was limited to and focused at the charges against Pack for false declaration on tax return and willful tax evasions. Even if Pack was tried separately, Todd\u2019s incriminating hearsay statements would have been admissible in the trial against Pack under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), Fed.R.Evid., in connection with the proof of the alleged conspiracy. Pack has not shown, and we do not find,- any factual basis to support a finding that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced by having been jointly charged and tried with co-conspirator Todd. .</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The final claim raised by Pack is that the district court committed reversible error when it refused to adopt his version of the proposed jury instruction on his defense to the charges of having violated the federal tax statutes. The Government established that Pack received substantial taxable compensations and commissions from his brokerage business in oil and gas sales during the years in question, and he made no reports to the IRS on these taxable earnings. His requested jury instruction on his theory of defense was that some of the money he received during these years were loans, rather than employment compensations, from his friends which need not be reported for tax assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">When reviewing a claim of error relating to jury instructions, the instructions must be evaluated as a whole. <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400-401, 38 L.Ed.2d 368, 373 (1973). The adequacy of the entire charge must be determined in the context of the whole trial. <em>United States v. Metropolitan Enterprises, Inc., </em>728 F.2d 444, 451-452 (10th Cir.1984). Although a criminal defendant is entitled to an. instruction regarding his theory of the case, a trial judge is given substantial latitude and discretion in tailoring and formulating the instructions so long as they are correct statements of law and fairly and adequately cover the issues presented. <em>United States v. Nolan, </em>551 F.2d 266, 274-275 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 302, 54 L.Ed.2d 191 (1977). There is no requirement that a trial judge must follow the exact language from the jury instructions offered by the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The district court instructed the jury that not all money and property, including the proceeds of loans, received by a taxpayer was subject to income tax assessments under our tax laws; that Pack contended that certain funds claimed by the Government as taxable income were proceeds of loans he borrowed from his friends; and that if the jury found any \u201cfunds received by Thomas Pack were loans, (they) are instructed that the defendant was not required, and was under no duty to report in his income tax returns any funds so received as loans to him, nor to pay any tax upon said loans.\u201d ROA Vol. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>I, at 146-148. We conclude that the jury was properly charged with the instruction on the defendant\u2019s theory of defense, and that the instructions were comprehensive and sufficient for the jury to return the guilty verdict on the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Finding no reversible error in the trial of the case, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\">.
