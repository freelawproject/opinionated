In light of New York\u2019s strong policy favoring apportionment of damages among tortfeasors on the basis of relative culpability and given the legislature\u2019s failure to address the contribution issue in the Act, we conclude that the no-fault law did not extinguish the right of noncovered persons to seek contribution from covered joint tortfeasors. Accordingly, we reverse that part of the judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Wexler, <em>J., </em>600 F.Supp. 1459, denying the cross-claim brought by the City of New York (City) against the United States for the latter\u2019s equitable share of plaintiffs\u2019 basic economic loss. We remand to the district court for entry of judgment in favor of the City on its cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">This litigation arose from an automobile accident that occurred on a municipally owned highway in Brooklyn, New York in December 1977. The facts are undisputed. An automobile owned by the United States and driven by a federal employee crossed the median divider of the Belt Highway and collided with plaintiffs Goodkins\u2019 vehicle. Plaintiffs sued, among others, the United States and the City. Federal jurisdiction was premised on the Federal Tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346 &amp; 2671 <em>et seq. </em>(1982); the claim against the City was pendent to the federal claim. All of the claims were governed by state law. <em>See Mandelbaum v. United States, </em>251 F.2d 748, 750 (2d Cir.1958); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) &amp; 2674.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">At the trial on liability, the jury found only the City and the United States liable. The jury apportioned seventy percent of the liability to the City for its negligence in maintaining the highway and thirty percent to the United States. The jury\u2019s verdict, which was only advisory as to the United States, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2402 (1982), was adopted <em>in toto </em>by the district court. At the subsequent trial on damages, the jury determined plaintiffs\u2019 total damages to be $500,000. The district court adopted the jury\u2019s award as to the United States. By special findings, the court determined that $49,067 and $15,473 of the general award were attributable, respectively, to plaintiff Berill Goodkin\u2019s and plaintiff Phyllis Good-kin\u2019s basic economic loss as defined by the no-fault law, N.Y.Ins.Law \u00a7 5102. The district court correctly acknowledged that the no-fault law precluded covered persons, such as plaintiffs, from recovering basic economic loss from other covered persons, such as the United States. It therefore concluded that the City, a noncovered person, .should likewise be unable to recover in an action for contribution against the United States for amounts attributable to plaintiffs\u2019 basic economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">A. <em>New York\u2019s No-Fault Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">No-fault laws were created to remedy a long recognized and serious problem \u2014 the inability of the tort system to rapidly, adequately and fairly compensate victims of automobile accidents. 12A Couch on Insurance 2d \u00a7 45:661 (rev. ed. 1981). In <em>Montgomery v. Daniels, </em>38 N.Y.2d 41, 378 N.Y. S.2d 1, 340 N.E.2d 444 (1975), upholding the constitutionality of New York\u2019s no-fault law, the New York Court of Appeals enumerated three particular problems that the legislature intended the Act to address: (1) the excessive and needless expense of the tort system; (2) the unfair and inequitable distribution of compensation among accident victims, including long delays in payment, and (3) the strain placed on the state judicial system by tort litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 378 N.Y.S.2d at 8-9. The Act sought to remedy these problems by, <em>inter alia, </em>removing minor claims from the courts, eliminating fault as a required predicate for recovering certain losses from a predicate determination of liability based on fault, requiring payments to be made immediately on accrual of loss and requiring all owners of motor vehicles to carry no-fault insurance. The preeminent purpose of the no-fault law, according to the Court of Appeals, was \u201cto assure the prompt and full reimbursement of the \u2018economic\u2019 losses those injured in automobile accidents may suffer.\u201d <em>Perkins v. Merchants Mutual Insurance Co., </em>41 N.Y.2d 394, 396, 393 N.Y.S.2d 347, 348, 361 N.E.2d 997, 998 (1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">New York\u2019s no-fault legislation provides a plan for compensating victims of automobile accidents without regard to fault. In essence, it is a two-pronged, partial modification of the preexisting system of reparation for personal injuries suffered in automobile accidents under which system liability was grounded in negligence under classic principles of tort law. One prong deals with compensation; the other with limitation of tort actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-11\"><em>Montgomery, </em>38 N.Y.2d at 46, 378 N.Y. S.2d at 4, 340 N.E.2d at 446. The Act partially but not completely eliminated the rights of automobile accident victims to recover in tort for their injuries. It replaced what it excised with a relatively simple and straightforward compensation system designed to quickly reimburse injured parties, up to certain limits, for the common, out-of-pocket expenses generated by their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">A general overview of the statutory particulars provides a useful foundation for our evaluation of the question presented. Under the Act, every owner of a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>vehicle is responsible, regardless of fault, to a specified class of persons for any and all basic economic loss resulting from injuries occasioned by the use or operation of that vehicle. The class of persons includes the owner himself, operators and occupants of his vehicle and pedestrians. By definition, basic economic loss is limited to an aggregate maximum of $50,000 per person and includes the cost of professional health services ascertainable within one year, lost earnings and the cost of substitute services up to $1,000 per month for not more than three years and other expenses up to $25 per day for not more than one year. N.Y. Ins.Law \u00a7 5102(a). Reimbursement for basic economic loss minus certain specified deductions constitutes first party benefits, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5102(b), which are due and payable when the loss is incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The Act imposes two limitations on recovery for personal injuries. By their terms, these limitations apply only to actions between covered persons: \u201c[njotwith-standing any other law,\u201d a covered person cannot recover against another covered person for basic economic loss, and a covered person who has not sustained serious injury as defined in section 5102(d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cannot recover against another covered person for non-economic loss. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5104. Non-economic loss is \u201cpain and suffering and similar non-monetary detriment.\u201d \u2022 <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5102(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">A covered person as defined by the Act is \u201cany pedestrian injured through the use or operation of, or any owner, operator or occupant of, a motor vehicle which has in effect the financial security required ... or which [is among the exceptions in N.Y.Veh. &amp; Traf.Law \u00a7 321 (McKinney Supp.1984), which includes vehicles owned by the United States] or any oth\u00e9r person entitled to first party benefits.\u201d N.Y.Ins.Law \u00a7 5102(j). With certain exceptions, the motor vehicle owner\u2019s liability carrier must pay first party benefits to any person, \u201cother than occupants of another motor vehicle or a motorcycle,\u201d whose injury arises out of the use or operation of the owner\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 5103(a)(1). It must also pay first party benefits to \u201c[t]he named insured and members of his household, other than occupants of a motorcycle,\u201d for injuries arising from the use or operation of any insured vehicle outside of New York but in the United States or Canada or any uninsured vehicle in the United States or Canada. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5103(a)(2). Finally, it must pay first party benefits to any New York resident not' otherwise entitled to such benefits whose injury results from the use or operation of the owner\u2019s vehicle outside of New York but in the United States or Canada. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5103(a)(3). Everyone not entitled to first party benefits is a noncovered person.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Intended to address only minor personal injury claims, the no-fault law leaves unaffected the right to recover in tort for economic loss in excess of the basic economic loss limitations and the right to recover for non-economic loss associated with serious injury. The Act by its terms and operation simply eliminates the right of an injured covered person to recover in tort against another covered person for basic economic loss. In most instances, of course, the practical result of this is that covered defendants will not be liable for any amounts attributable to basic economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The Act affects the right of a covered person to recover in tort against a noncov-ered person only to the extent that it imposes a statutory lien in favor of the insurance carrier on any recovery attributable to basic economic loss for which the carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>has already reimbursed the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5104(b). The Act does not refer at all to the rights of noncovered persons against covered persons. Specifically, the Act contains no language to indicate its intended effect, if any, on the right of a noncovered party to claim contribution against a covered person.</p>\n<p id=\"A4-\">B. <em>New York\u2019s Law of Contribution</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGj\">The law of contribution in New York has both common law, <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>30 N.Y.2d 143, 331 N.Y.S.2d 382, 282 N.E.2d 288 (1972), and statutory, N.Y.Civ. Prac.Law \u00a7 1401 <em>et seq. </em>(McKinney 1976), roots. The now established rule that contribution is apportioned according to the relative culpability of each tortfeasor was first articulated in <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical, </em>30 N.Y.2d at 153, 331 N.Y.S.2d at 391-92, 282 N.E.2d at 294-95. The holding in that case was subsequently codified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">The amount of contribution to which a person is entitled shall be the excess paid by him over and above his equitable share of the judgment recovered by the injured party; but no person shall be required to contribute an amount greater than his equitable share. The equitable shares shall be determined in accordance with the relative culpability of each person liable for contribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkT\">N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \u00a7 1402.</p>\n<p id=\"ayy-dedup-0\">New York law embodies a marked preference for contribution and a decided disinclination to limit a defendant\u2019s right to recover contribution from a joint tortfeasor. <em>E.g., Garrett v. Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>58 N.Y.2d 253, 258-59, 460 N.Y.S.2d 774, 777, 447 N.E.2d 717, 720 (1983); <em>see also Gregory v. Garrett Corp., </em>578 F.Supp. 871, 879 (S.D.N.Y.1983); <em>Quintel Corp. v. Citibank, N.A., </em>100 F.R.D. 695, 699 (S.D.N.Y.1983); <em>Lippes v. Atlantic Bank, </em>69 A.D.2d 127, 135-38, 419 N.Y.S.2d 505, 510-11 (1st Dep\u2019t 1979). Furthermore, the law is clear that claims for contribution concern only defendants, and the resolution of the attendant apportionment issues has no effect on the amount of recovery to which a plaintiff is entitled. <em>Klinger v. Dudley, </em>41 N.Y.2d 362, 367-68, 393 N.Y.S.2d 323, 327-28, 361 N.E.2d 974, 977-78 (1977); <em>Kelly v. Long Island Lighting, </em>31 N.Y.2d 25, 30, 334 N.Y.S.2d 851, 855, 286 N.E.2d 241, 243 (1972); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"AfH\">C. <em>Contribution and Noncovered Persons Under the No-Fault Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"AiF\">The no-fault law is a statute in derogation of the common law and, thus, must be strictly construed. <em>Maxwell v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>92 A.D.2d 1049, 1050, 461 N.Y.S.2d 541, 544 (3d Dep\u2019t 1983); N.Y.Stat.Law \u00a7 301 (McKinney 1971). Although it abrogates certain rights of recovery, the no-fault law does not address either implicitly or explicitly the noncovered defendant\u2019s right to contribution. We are, therefore, hesitant to read into the no-fault law a limitation of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"Ate\">Moreover, we do not believe that permitting the City to prevail on its .cross-claim for contribution for amounts attributable to basic economic loss will in any way compromise the functions or purposes of the no-fault law. The plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover basic economic loss from the carrier arose when the loss was incurred. The City\u2019s right to actually receive contribution from the United States will not arise until the City has paid an amount exceeding its equitable share of the plaintiffs\u2019 basic economic loss. <em>See Klinger v. Dudley, </em>41 N.Y.2d at 369, 393 N.Y.S.2d at 328-29, 361 N.E.2d 974, 978, 980. The two rights arise at different times and are completely separate \u2014 whatever the outcome on the cross-claim, it cannot by law affect the amount of recovery to which plaintiffs are entitled. If the City recovers on its cross-claim, that result will in no way affect the plaintiffs\u2019 right under the no-fault law to receive prompt and full reimbursement of their basic economic loss. <em>See Perkins, </em>41 N.Y.2d at 396, 393 N.Y.S.2d at 348, 361 N.E.2d at 998. Indeed, in this case and others like it, the plaintiffs will have received their first party benefits long before the determination on contribution is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Furthermore, permitting a right of contribution for basic economic loss will not encourage litigation that the no-fault law would ordinarily discourage. Except for the lien on recoveries, suits against noncov-ered persons are simply not implicated by the Act. Only in those circumstances where the Act would otherwise permit no recovery against a covered tortfeasor, <em>i.e., </em>where the plaintiffs injuries are not serious and his total damages are less than or equal to basic economic loss, is that covered tortfeasor likely to be involved as a third-party defendant but not as a defendant. Because these circumstances are, for economic reasons, also those least likely to result in litigation, that type of third-party action should be uncommon. Thus, allowing the right of contribution herein sought will not noticeably affect the costs and burdens associated with the tort system.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We are not unmindful that permitting contribution in cases like this produces a somewhat anomalous result. Where a covered tortfeasor is 100 percent at fault, he will not be liable for any basic economic loss. Where, however, he is less than 100 percent liable and his joint tortfeasor is a noncovered person, the covered tortfeasor may be liable on a contribution claim for amounts attributable to plaintiff\u2019s basic economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Such anomalous results, however, are not uncommon under New York\u2019s law of contribution. Emphasizing \u201cthe important policy that responsibility for damages to an injured person should be borne by those parties responsible for the injury, in proportion to their respective degrees of fault,\u201d the New York Court of Appeals recently noted that \u201ccontribution rights on behalf of concurrent wrongdoers have been upheld in numerous circumstances in which the injured person has himself had no right of recovery against [the] third party.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Holiday Inns, 58 </em>N.Y.2d at 258-59, 460 N.Y.S.2d at 777, 447 N.E.2d at 720. In <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical, </em>for example, the court upheld the right of the defendant chemical company to make a third-party claim for contribution against plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s employer even though the plaintiff was barred from suing the employer by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws, N.Y. Work.Comp.Law \u00a7 11 (McKinney Supp.1984). <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical, </em>30 N.Y.2d at 152, 331 N.Y.S.2d at 390-91, 282 N.E.2d at 294-95. Similarly, in <em>Klinger v. Dudley, </em>the court upheld claims for contribution against three groups of third-party defendants. 41 N.Y.2d at 365, 393 N.Y.S.2d at 326. The first group could not have been sued directly by the plaintiffs because of the exclusive remedies provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, N.Y.Work. Comp.Law \u00a7 11 (barring actions against employers) &amp; \u00a7 29(6) (barring actions against co-employees) (McKinney Supp. 1984). The second group had originally been defendants and had successfully moved to have plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against them dismissed. The third group could have been but never were sued directly by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">In light of the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 consistent pro-contribution position, we believe that we must reverse the district court. Nonetheless, we should mention two state trial court opinions that were discussed by the district court and exhaustively analyzed by the parties on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">In Cole <em>v. Lord, </em>91 Misc.2d 178, 397 N.Y.S.2d 537 (Sup.Ct.Broome Cty.1977), the court was primarily concerned with the peculiar status of motorcyclists under the no-fault law. Because motorcycles are specifically excluded from the definition of motor vehicle under the Act, motorcycle owners are not required to' obtain coverage for no-fault benefits. If a motorcycle is involved in an accident with an automobile, however, the motorcyclist is apparently nevertheless entitled to receive first party benefits from the automobile owner\u2019s carrier. <em>Id. </em>at 179, 397 N.Y.S.2d at 538; <em>see also Perkins, </em>41 N.Y.2d at 395-97, 393 N.Y.S.2d at 348-49, 361 N.E.2d at 997-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The <em>Cole v. Lord </em>litigation arose from an accident involving a motorcycle and a car. The plaintiff, Cole, a passenger on the motorcycle, sued Cronk, the motorcycle owner/operator, and Lord, the operator of the automobile. The .jury apportioned sixty percent of the fault to Lord and forty percent to Cronk and determined both non-eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>nomic and economic loss damages. On the theory that both defendants were covered persons, Cole sought judgment for non-economic loss only. Lord contended, however, that Cronk was a noncovered person and, therefore, that a separate judgment for basic economic loss should enter against him. This, of course, would work to the advantage of Lord\u2019s carrier who would be entitled to a statutory lien on that judgment for first party benefits it had paid to Cole. The court agreed that Cronk was a noncovered person and that plaintiff could recover against him under the common law. <em>Cole v. Lord, </em>91 Misc.2d at 182, 397 N.Y. S.2d at 540. But the court also held that Cronk\u2019s liability for basic economic loss should be limited to his relative responsibility. Otherwise, the court reasoned, Lord\u2019s carrier, by operation of the statutory lien, would be reimbursed for damages flowing from its insured\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The issue of contribution was not raised in <em>Cole v. Lord. </em>Moreover, the result appears contrary to the basic tenet, stated in N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \u00a7 1404(a), that the relative culpability of the defendants shall not affect the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. <em>See Klinger v. Dudley, </em>41 N.Y.2d at 367-68, 393 N.Y.S.2d at 327-28, 361 N.E.2d at 978-79; <em>Kelly v. Long Island Lighting, </em>31 N.Y.2d at 30, 334 N.Y.S.2d at 855, 286 N.E.2d at 243. Finally, the inequitable result that the court sought to avoid was made possible by Cronk\u2019s failure to cross-claim against Lord for contribution. Therefore, we do not believe that <em>Cole v. Lord </em>has any application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The United States and the court below relied substantially on <em>Seward v. Northrup, </em>123 Misc.2d 420, 473 N.Y.S.2d 754 (Supp.Ct.Del.Cty.1984). The jury in <em>Seward </em>found defendant Northrup, a covered person, to be sixty-five percent culpable and defendant county and defendant town, both noncovered persons, to be respectively thirty percent and five percent responsible. The noncovered defendants moved to have the economic loss award against them reduced by sixty-five percent. Relying on the rule that the relative fault of defendants may not affect a plaintiff\u2019s recovery, the court denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 422-23, 473 N.Y.S.2d at 756-57. Our result here is not contrary to the <em>Seward </em>decision. In any event, <em>Seward, </em>like <em>Cole v. Lord, </em>is distinguishable from this case because it did not involve a claim for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Given New York\u2019s clearly articulated policy favoring contribution among tortfeasors according to each one\u2019s relative culpability, we will not construe the New York no-fault law to abrogate by implication a noncovered person\u2019s right to recover against a covered joint tortfeasor on a claim for contribution for amounts attributable to basic economic loss. We do not believe that our result will in any way interfere with the no-fault law\u2019s primary purpose of assuring that victims of automobile accidents receive prompt reimbursement for the out-of-pocket expenses associated with their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">That part of the judgment of the district court that denied the City\u2019s cross-claim against the United States for contribution of the United States\u2019 equitable share of plaintiffs\u2019 basic economic loss is reversed. The cause is remanded to the district court for entry of judgment on the cross-claim in favor of the City.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\">.
