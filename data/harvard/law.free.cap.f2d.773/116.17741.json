CAMPBELL, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Petitioner Rodney Gross was convicted of rape and murder in the Circuit Court of Rock Island County, Illinois. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 75-100 years. The Appellate Court of Illinois, Third District, affirmed the conviction. The Illinois Supreme Court denied Gross\u2019 motion to appeal. Gross subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois. Judge Michael M. Mihm denied Gross\u2019 application for habeas corpus relief. Gross now appeals Judge Mihm\u2019s denial under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">A brief recital of the facts surrounding the case is as follows. On August 29, 1976 at 3:00 P.M. police officers entered the Rock Island apartment of Della Masen-garb. In the living room they found Ms. Masengarb\u2019s body, nude and with multiple stab wounds. It is estimated Ms. Masen-garb died from the stab wounds 12-15 hours before the police entered the apartment. Having observed Ms. Masengarb\u2019s body the police officers entered one of the bedrooms in the apartment and found a one-year old boy in a crib and a four-year old girl hiding under the covers of a bed. The policemen asked the girl a few general questions through which the girl offered her name, who she lived with, that her father was in jail, and that \u201cRodney\u201d had been at the apartment \u201clast night.\u201d It is from those statements that police began to piece together a scenario that led to the indictment and conviction of petitioner Gross on rape and murder charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">Petitioner Gross raises numerous issues on appeal. The first concerns testimony at trial from an Assistant State Attorney named Malvik. Petitioner claims that at trial Malvik improperly commented upon his silence. Petitioner claims this reference to his silence was constitutional error in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Yet we note petitioner did not raise this Fifth Amendment objection in a timely manner at trial or in a post-trial motion. Petitioner did object to the hearsay aspect of Malvik\u2019s testimony. However, he did not raise a Fifth Amendment objection. According to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 615 (Ch. 110A, S.H.A. \u00a7 615), petitioner\u2019s failure to object in a timely manner concerning any issue constitutes a waiver of his right to appeal that issue at a subsequent hearing. In sum Rule 615 mandates objections be made in a timely manner in order to preserve the issue on appeal. See <em>People v. Anderson, </em>77 Ill.App.3d 907, 33 Ill.Dec. 323, 396 N.E.2d 850 (1970); <em>People v. Long, </em>39 Ill.2d 40, 233 N.E.2d 389, (1968). Of course, at the federal court level <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>L.Ed.2d 594 (1972) dictates we adhere to state court procedural rules absent a showing of cause or prejudice as a result of the rule. Petitioner has failed adequately to show cause or prejudice here and therefore we hold he is barred from raising his Fifth Amendment argument concerning Malvik\u2019s testimony on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Petitioner asserts the procedural default on his part was not explicitly mentioned/adopted by the Illinois Appellate Courts on appeal meaning <em>Sykes </em>is inapplicable and he is not barred procedurally from advancing his Fifth Amendment argument. First, while there is an absence of discussion concerning petitioner\u2019s apparent procedural waiver in the Illinois Appellate decision, there is also a similar absence of discussion about the merits of petitioner's Fifth Amendment argument concerning his silence, signaling the issue was never presented before the state court. Secondly, assuming <em>arguendo </em>petitioner did not waive his Fifth Amendment argument, he must still show the error in admitting Malvik\u2019s testimony into evidence reached constitutional dimensions. We conclude even if admitting Malvik\u2019s testimony was error, it was harmless error in light of the other substantial evidence of petitioner\u2019s guilt. The State Appellate Court provides the following summary of Malvik\u2019s testimony: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cOn August 30, [Petitioner Gross], after being informed of his rights, was interrogated by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Malvik. Malvik sought to. obtain the confession of the. [Petitioner] by confronting the [Petitioner] with the evidence. [Petitioner] denied killing Della Mesengarb, or being in her house at the time of the killing. Malvik told the [Petitioner] that he \u2018knew it was a horrible thing\u2019 and that he \u2018was sure that [the person responsible] didn't mean to do it.\u2019 Malvik testified also that [Petitioner] at that point \u2018didn\u2019t say anything and then he said \u2018take me back to' my cell.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"av-dedup-0\">Malvik\u2019s reference to petitioner\u2019s silence must be compared to the following evidence of petitioner\u2019s guilt. A pair of blood-soaked jeans were found in a room in which petitioner often slept. Petitioner\u2019s blood type, which is rare, was found on the jeans. Petitioner had little explanation for the pants while testifying at trial. Three county jail inmates testified petitioner admitted he killed Ms. Masengarb. A fourth inmate testified petitioner told him he had killed a woman with a knife. It is inconceivable from the record before us that all four inmates would be involved in a conspiracy to frame petitioner. In addition to. the above, the state also introduced testimony of a friend of petitioner\u2019s who was drinking with him the night of the incident. The friend testified petitioner was in a fight that night at the bar and after the fight said to him, \u201cLet\u2019s go out and fuck someone up.\u201d In light of the overwhelming evidence against petitioner we conclude the admission of Malvik\u2019s testimony was not prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">For similar reasons we must reject petitioner\u2019s second contention that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated cross-examination technique emphasizing the veracity of state witnesses is reversible error. The only time petitioner objected to such testimony was during the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">Q. [By State] Did you have any conversation with Michael McDowell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">A. [By Petitioner] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">Q. Mike McDowell is a liar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\">Mr. Shick [sic]:' [Petitioner\u2019s Attorney] I will object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmF\">By the Court: [Petitioner\u2019s Attorney] Objection is well taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">We believe such trial techniques on the part of the prosecution, while not to be condoned, ^ere not reversible error in view of the other evidence against petitioner documented above.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">Petitioner\u2019s third contention is that the admission of \u201cother crimes evidence\u201d was in violation of his right to due process because the crimes were not sufficiently related to invoke the <em>modus operandi </em>doctrine. We disagree. The state produced two witnesses, both women in the seventeen to twenty-year old age bracket, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>testified petitioner broke into their parents\u2019 home where they resided during the early morning hours. They further testified petitioner had brandished a potentially deadly weapon in hand, threatened them and then sexually assaulted them \u2014 facts similar to the case at bar. These two assaults took place four and thirteen months before the murder in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Evidence of the above incidents was properly admitted for the limited purpose allowed \u2014 to show either intent, motive, design, identification or presence. See <em>People v. Pavic, </em>104 Ill.App.3d 436, 60 Ill.Dec. 175, 432 N.E.2d 1074 (1982). The evidence attempted to identify petitioner as involved in a series of crimes with his signature/handiwork attached to them. We do not believe evidence of these other crimes so unrelated or prejudicial that it violated petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. We deem the evidence relevant and believe the jury was entitled to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We also note to reverse the state court evidentiary ruling concerning other crimes evidenced here, the standard originally enunciated in <em>United States ex rel. Harris v. Illinois, </em>457 F.2d 191, 198 (7th Cir.1972) must be met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">Generally, ... the admissibility of evidence is a matter of state law and unless there is a resultant denial of fundamental fairness or the denial of a specific constitutional right, no constitutional issue is involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In <em>United States ex rel. Bibbs v. Twomey, </em>506 F.2d 1220 (7th Cir.1974), it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad-\">The following general rule ... remains intact that evidentiary questions are not subject to review by a federal court in a habeas corpus proceeding by a state prisoner unless there is an error of such magnitude as to deny fundamental fair-ness____ In this area, federal courts must proceed with caution____ To hold otherwise would put federal courts in the role of reviewing courts over the courts of the states even when no constitutional errors have been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1223. See also <em>Spencer v. Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967); <em>U.S. ex rel. Clark v. Fike, </em>538 F.2d 750, 757 (7th Cir.1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">In sum, we see nothing fundamentally unfair or conspiciously prejudicial here in admitting the other crimes evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">As part of his argument concerning the admission of other crimes evidence petitioner further claims he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights because the trial court gave the jury an improper limiting instruction concerning the <em>modus operandi </em>doctrine. Petitioner asserts the trial judge erred when he told the jury it could consider the other crimes evidenced solely on the issue of petitioner\u2019s identification, presence, intent, motive and design. We agree with the district court that considering the other crimes evidence was properly admitted, the trial judge\u2019s limiting instruction did not further prejudice petitioner\u2019s case. Further, the trial judge carefully reminded the jury in the instruction that the other crimes evidence was only to be considered for \u201cthe limited purpose for which it was received.\u201d (See district court order p. 2.) We see no reversible error in the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">Petitioner\u2019s fourth contention is that the admission into evidence of a police officer\u2019s testimony concerning the out-of-court statement of a four-year old child was inadmissible hearsay and in violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The issue here concerns the statement made by the four-year old at the victim\u2019s apartment that \u201cRodney [petitioner] had been at the apartment last night.\u201d The state trial court held the statement fell under the <em>res gestae </em>exception to the hearsay rule as an excited utterance. Petitioner contends this ruling was erroneous. He believes the child\u2019s unavailability as a witness was never justified and that any statement concerning him made twelve hours after he allegedly committed the murder could in no way be considered an excited utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">It is well-established that the lapse of time between the startling event and the out-of-court statement, although relevant, is not dispositive in the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tion of the <em>res gestae </em>exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">... [W]hile the time element is important, it is not in itself controlling. Indeed, as has been well asserted, no inflexible rule as to the length of interval between the act charged against the accused and the declaration of the complaining party, can be laid down as established. It has been held, moreover, that where, as in the present case, the victim is of such an age as to render it improbable that her utterance was deliberate and its effect premeditated, the utterance need not be so nearly contemporaneous with the principal transaction____ The declarations of the child \u2014 a party to the actual occurrence \u2014 were made under such circumstances and so recently after the occurrence of the transaction as to preclude the idea of reflection or deliberation. (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Beausoliel v. U.S., </em>107 F.2d 292, 295 (D.C.Cir.1939).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0u\">In <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>473 F.2d 191 (D.C.Cir.1972) it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Declarations relating to the circumstances of a violent crime, made, by the victim shortly after its occurrence, are sometimes admitted in evidence as exceptions to the hearsay rule, upon the theory that the shock of the injury and the excitement of the moment have produced an utterance that is spontaneous and sincere as distinguished from one engendered by deliberation and design. Such statements may be admissible although made in response to an inquiry. The decisive factor is that the circumstances reasonably justify the conclusion that the remarks were not made under the impetus of reflection. Whether this conclusion is justified depends upon the facts of each case and must be determined by the District Court in the exercise of sound judicial discretion. Such discretionary action is of course subject to review and must be reversed if clearly erroneous. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 194-95. See <em>Haggins v. Warden, Fort Pillow State Farm, </em>715 F.2d 1050, 1058 (6th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Iron Shell, </em>633 F.2d 77, 85-86 (8th Cir.1980); <em>People v. Parisie, </em>151 Ind.App. 157, 278 N.E.2d 310 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">We are sufficiently convinced the lower courts used their discretion soundly in allowing the out-of-court statement of the four-year old child to be admitted. There is no reason to believe her statement to the officer was made with any premeditation, design or reflection. All indications are the youngster was petrified and cowering beneath the covers of a bed. The child\u2019s temperament appears to be one of shock and fear. Her answers to the officer\u2019s questions cannot reasonably be deemed insincere or the product of some premeditated deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">We are also unconvinced the failure to put the four-year old on the stand was reversible error. A cross-examination of this child would more probably have confused the child and quite possibly could have generated inaccurate statements from that child. Considering we are concerned with a four-year old with a limited memory, her most reliable and trustworthy account of her mother\u2019s murder probably took place upon inquiry from police officers as soon as possible after the crime occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">The case of <em>Stewart v. Cowan, </em>528 F.2d 79 (6th Cir.1976) cited by petitioner is easily distinguishable. That case stands for the principle that a police officer may not take the stand and accuse the defendant of a crime claiming he received his evidence from anonymous phone callers. In <em>Stewart </em>defendant did not even know who his accusers were. In the case <em>sub judice </em>petitioner knew the four-year old who had made the statement. A cross-examination of the child at trial long after the incident had occurred would have had little impact on the jury even if her memory failed her due to her tender age. Further, it should also not be forgotten that the four-year old\u2019s statements were hardly pivotal in the end in view of the other evidence petitioner failed to sufficiently refute (his confession in front of the inmates and the blood-soaked jeans, for example).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>We see no clear reversible error in admitting the hearsay statement of the four-year old child through the police officer under the <em>res gestae </em>exception. The decision, which was within the discretion of the trial court, reveals no abuse of that discretion considering the particular circumstances surrounding this case and the age of the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Finally, we disagree with petitioner that the state appellate court did not employ the harmless error standard properly in its review of the case. Petitioner\u2019s argument here suggests that unless a reviewing court explicitly states in its decision, \u201cwe do not find the errors harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and/or cites <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), its harmless error analysis falls short of federal constitutional requirements. The state appellate court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">We do not believe, even considering that respective errors referred to and charged by defendant to exist in this case, that any other verdict would have been returned by the jury if such evidence objected to was present in the cause____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">It is clear that the evidence of defendant\u2019s admission of guilt and the corroborating evidence from defendant\u2019s bloody jeans, which was presented in the instant case was adequate, without more, to support the finding of guilt as to defendant. It is also apparent from the record, as noted in the recital of the facts, that the finding of guilt resulted, not from potential errors charged by defendant, but rather from the evidence of the confession and the bloody jeans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We cannot conclude as petitioner does that a state court decision which uses such language has not applied the harmless error standard appropriately. Petitioner seizes upon certain words and phrases used by the state-appellate court (such as when that court says, \u201cthe evidence of guilt outweighs the prejudicial effect of errors assigned by defendant.\u201d See 393 N.E.2d at 1311) to conclude the strict \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard had not been applied. Yet the concluding paragraphs printed above satisfy us that the harmless error standard was appropriately applied in this case. After all, the test does not revolve around what words are used or which cases are cited. The key is in the review of the reasoning and analysis behind the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the rule should be employed in affirming a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">In the case at bar we believe that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>error was committed, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We see no compelling reason to reverse a similar conclusion reached by a state appellate court which simply used less familiar verbiage. For the reasons set forth above, the order of the district court denying petitioner habeas corpus relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">. According to both federal constitutional standards and the criteria set forth in <em>Eberhardt v. Bordenkircher, </em>605 F.2d 275, 279 (6th Cir.1979), a case heavily cited by petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
