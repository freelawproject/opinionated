GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">Estella Roberts and Bertha Burden appeal a judgment entered on a jury verdict against them on their claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) that the Van Bur\u00e9n Public Schools Board of Directors impermissibly failed to renew their teaching contracts in retaliation for their exercise of their first amendment rights. The teachers argue that the district court erred in submitting to the jury the constitutional issue of whether their conduct was protected speech. We vacate and remand on the first amendment issue as to Roberts insofar as her claim is based on certain union activities but affirm the judgment of the district court in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-18\">Roberts and Burden were fifth-grade teachers at City Heights Elementary School in Van Bur\u00e9n, Arkansas. On evaluations near the end of the 1980-81 school year, Roberts\u2019 second in the district and Burden\u2019s first, school principal James Star-bird rated them both \u201csatisfactory\u201d \u2014 the highest rating \u2014 in every category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-19\">Later that month, however, the teachers filed with Starbird three written grievances on forms developed by the Van Bur\u00e9n Education Association, local affiliate of the Arkansas Education Association teachers union. Two of the grievances related to the fifth-grade trip to Little Rock, the first expressing dissatisfaction with the manner in which parental complaints concerning seating arrangements for the bus had been handled, and the second criticizing the failure of the school to provide monetary support for the trip. The third grievance pertained to the inadequacy of teaching supplies and particularly to the necessity of sacrificing <em>Weekly Readers </em>to obtain greater classroom allowances for other supplies. Starbird passed these grievances directly to Superintendent of Schools James R. Tate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>who responded by directing the teachers either to meet with him to work out the problems or to present the grievances directly to the school board (for which purpose he offered to call a special meeting if they desired). When Roberts and Burden answered indicating their desire to meet, however, Tate stated that he saw no purpose in such a meeting and said he felt the grievances indicated a lack of confidence in both him and Starbird.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">The next spring when Starbird completed teacher evaluations for the 1981-82 school year, he. dropped Roberts\u2019 and Burden\u2019s ratings to \u201cneeds to improve\u201d in approximately half the categories and recommended that the district not renew the contract of either. He stated as to both teachers that the grievances filed the previous spring had been responses to his attempts to work with them on their deficiencies and had accused him of incompetence and dishonesty and threatened him with legal action. He further stated as to Roberts that her efforts to recruit union members had \u201coften attempted to create poor relations between administration and faculty, instead of cooperation for the good of the children.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 12. Superintendent Tate, relying in part on Star-bird\u2019s evaluations and comments, recommended to the Board that Roberts and Burden\u2019s contracts not be renewed, and the Board unanimously agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">After their requests for hearings were denied, Roberts and Burden filed this action. They allege that Starbird, Tate, and the Board, by acting in retaliation for their protected speech activities, deprived them of their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, in failing to bring to their attention and help remedy their teaching deficiencies, deprived them of their rights under the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act of 1979. Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 80-1264.6 (1980) (repealed effective July 4, 1983<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>). Roberts\u2019 and Burden\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction requiring that they be reinstat\u00e9d pending trial on the merits was denied, and we affirmed. <em>Roberts v. Van Buren Public Schools, </em>731 F.2d 523 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">At the subsequent trial the district court submitted to the jury the following interrogatory with respect to each teacher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-11\">Do you find that [teacher\u2019s name] was engaged in activity protected by the First Amendment and that the protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in <em>any of the defendants </em>decisions not to renew her teaching contract?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">The jury answered \u201cno\u201d to this interrogatory with respect to both Roberts and Burden and similarly answered the interrogatory relating to the state law claim in favor of the school district. Judgment was entered consistent with these special verdicts, and after the district court denied the teachers\u2019 motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">Roberts\u2019 and Burden\u2019s constitutional claims invoke the holding in <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), that \u201c[p]ublic employee[s do] not relinquish First Amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest by virtue of government employment.\u201d <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 140, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1686, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). Consideration of such claims involves a three-step analysis. First, plaintiffs must demonstrate that their conduct was protected; second, plaintiffs must demonstrate that such protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision; and third, the employer may show that the employment action would have been taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>even in the absence of the protected conduct. <em>Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <em>Bowman v. Pulaski County Special School District, </em>723 F.2d 640, 643-44 (8th Cir.1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Identification of protected activity since <em>Connick </em>is a two-step process in itself. As a threshold matter, the speech must have addressed a \u201cmatter of public concern,\u201d 461 U.S. at 143, 146, 103 S.Ct. at 1687, 1689; <em>see Collins v. Robinson, </em>568 F.Supp. 1464, 1468 (E.D.Ark.1983), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>734 F.2d 1321 (8th Cir.1984); then, the interest of the employee in so speaking must be balanced against \u201cthe interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1735. This <em>\u201cPickering </em>balance,\u201d as it has come to be known, looks to the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atk-dedup-0\">(1)- the need for harmony in the office or work place; (2) whether the goyernment\u2019s responsibilities require a close working relationship to exist between the plaintiff and co-workers when the speech in question has caused or could cause the relationship to deteriorate; (3) the time, manner, and place of the speech; (4) the context in which the dispute arose; (5) the degree of public interest in the speech; and (6) whether the speech impeded the employee\u2019s ability to perform his or her duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\"><em>Bowman, </em>723 F.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Roberts and Burden argue that the district court erred in submitting to the jury through the interrogatories the issue of whether or not the speech and activities in which they engaged were protected under the first amendment. \u201cThe inquiry into the protected status of speech is one of law, not fact.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 148 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. at 1690 n. 7. While proper resolution of this issue, particularly as to the balancing, may involve determination by the jury of certain underlying facts, <em>e.g., McGee v. South Pemiscot School District R-V, </em>712 F.2d 339, 342 (8th Cir.1983) (jury to decide whether speech created disharmony between employee and immediate supervisor); <em>see Kim v. Coppin State College, </em>662 F.2d 1055, 1062, 1064 (4th Cir.1981); <em>Schneider v. City of Atlanta, </em>628 F.2d 915, 919 n. 4 (5th Cir.1980), the ultimate decision is for the court. <em>Brockell v. Norton, </em>732 F.2d 664, 667 (8th Cir.1984); <em>see Czurlanis v. Albanese, </em>721 F.2d 98, 102, 105 (3d Cir.1983). Thus, use of the jury instruction here was clearly improper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Loya v. Desert Sands Unified School District, </em>721 F.2d 279, 281-82 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Stern v. Shouldice, </em>706 F.2d 742, 747-48 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 487, 78 L.Ed.2d 683 (1983); <em>Schneider, </em>628 F.2d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">Furthermore, the instructions in this case have two additional shortcomings. First, the issue of whether the protected conduct was a substantial factor in the employment decision was combined with the issue of whether the conduct was protected so that we do not know how causation was decided by the jury; and second, the jury, because it found in the negative to the two-issue interrogatory, was instructed not to decide the question of whether Roberts and Burden would have been renewed absent any protected conduct. This latter question and the causation question, in contrast to the protected speech question, are issues of fact to be determined by the jury, <em>Collins, </em>568 F.Supp. at 1468; <em>Wheeler v. Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation Authority, </em>752 F.2d 1063, 1069 (5th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 78, 88 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985); <em>see Greminger v. Seaborne, </em>584 F.2d 275, 278 (8th Cir.1978); and a jury finding on either could have disposed of this case (or at least substantially altered the issues on appeal). Now, should we conclude that any of the conduct in question here is protected, we will have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>to reverse and remand for further proceedings, a particularly regrettable consequence given the length of the original trial. <em>See Loya v. Desert Sands Unified School District, </em>721 F.2d 279, 281-82 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir.1983) (reversing and remanding on similar instruction); <em>cf. Derrickson v. Board of Education, </em>703 F.2d 309, 316-17 (8th Cir.1983) (district court\u2019s causation findings inadequate when they failed to address the speech that was actually protected). It is essential in cases such as this that the factual issues be submitted to the jury in separate interrogatories and that the consideration of these interrogatories not be foreclosed by earlier answers so that the court will be able to properly combine the factual findings with its legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Because the protected nature of speech is a question of law, however, we may determine this issue in the first instance at the appellate level, possibly making remand unnecessary or limiting the scope of the issues to be considered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hughes v. Whitmer, </em>714 F.2d 1407, 1418 n. 11 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1275, 79 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984); <em>Czurlanis, </em>721 F.2d at 102. <em>But cf. Patteson v. Johnson, </em>721 F.2d 228, 232 (8th Cir.1983) (remand <em>to </em>give district court the initial opportunity to properly balance the competing interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">In determining whether speech addresses a matter of public concern, we consider the \u201ccontent, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147-48 &amp; n. 7, 103 S.Ct. at 1690 &amp; n. 7. We need not proceed to the <em>Pickering </em>balance when the employee spoke not as a citizen but as an employee expressing a personal grievance as to internal office policy. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 154, 103 S.Ct. at <em>Collins, </em>568 F.Supp. at 1468. The state has a greater interest in regulating the speech of its employees than it has in regulating the speech of its citizenry in general, <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1734, and respect for fundamental rights does not require that the first amendment be read to afford to state employees a grant of immunity for job-related grievances not afforded to those who do not work for the state. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147, 103 S.Ct. at 1690.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">The public nature of the subject of the speech, however, is not negated by the fact that, as here, the employees chose to communicate their concerns privately. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 103 S.Ct. at 1689 (citing <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979)). A teacher has a \u201cconstitutional right * * * to privately express to his superiors, in a reasonable manner, his criticism of * * * educational or disciplinary policies.\u201d <em>Derrickson v. Board of Education, </em>703 F.2d 309, 316 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">That the content of rules governing the conduct of fifth-graders on a field trip halfway across the state is a matter of public concern is made clear by the degree of parental dissatisfaction apparently expressed after Roberts and Burden distributed the itinerary and behavior guid\u00e9lines. <em>See Bowman, </em>723 F.2d at 644 (\u201cThe question of what constitutes the proper care and education of children is one of the most frequently debated issues in the public forum. * * * [Activities of the parents are a good indication of the public\u2019s interest in these events.\u201d). Conceivably, it also might be of public concern whether the school district was being responsive to such paren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>tal input. Roberts\u2019 and Burden\u2019s grievance, however, is more fairly construed as objecting to the internal aspects of dealing with complaints \u2014 Starbird\u2019s refusal to tell them the names of the complaining parents and his lack of clarity as to what changes he expected them to make \u2014 as well as to the manner in which the rules were reviewed before promulgation. The charges in the grievance went more to the relationship between Starbird and the teachers as supervisor and employees rather than to the discharge by Starbird and the school of their public function of education. <em>See Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 148, 103 S.Ct. at 1690; <em>cf. Renfroe v. Kirkpatrick, </em>722 F.2d 714 (11th Cir.) (per curiam) (teacher\u2019s grievance concerned whether, because of seniority and experience, she was entitled to a full-time rather than a job-sharing position; not whether job sharing was inimical to welfare of students), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 98, 83 L.Ed.2d 44 (1984). Thus, we conclude that Roberts\u2019 and Burden\u2019s first grievance did not involve protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">The other grievances to the contrary touched on expenditures of public funds \u2014 whether the district should provide support for the educational trip to the state capital; whether teachers should have to use their own money to properly do their jobs; and whether adequate money was available for classroom supplies and how such money should be used. The seminal <em>Pickering </em>case itself involved speech as to a school system\u2019s need for more funds and its allocation of existing funds. 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731; <em>e.g., Greminger v. Seaborne, </em>584 F.2d 275, 277 (8th Cir.1978) (\u201cAllocation of funds for increased teachers\u2019 salaries is a subject of public concern upon which teachers may certainly comment.\u201d); <em>Knapp v. Whitaker, </em>757 F.2d 827, 840-41 (7th Cir.1985) (inequitable mileage allowances and alleged failure of school district to provide liability insurance for teachers transporting students to extracurricular activities matters of public concern), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>53 U.S.L.W. 3854 (U.S. June 4, 1985) (No. 84-1824). Money for the state capital outing was raised by parents and students, a public involvement inconsistent with any characterization of the trip as an \u201cinternal office affair\u201d within the contemplation of <em>Connick. </em>461 U.S. at 149, 103 S.Ct. 1691.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Upon applying the <em>Pickering </em>balance to these matters of public concern, however, we may now take into account the fact that the speech, despite its subject, was made privately: \u201c \u2018When a government employee personally confronts his immediate superior, the employing agency\u2019s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the employee\u2019s message but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 152-53, 103 S.Ct. at 1693 (quoting <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 415 n. 4, 99 S.Ct. 693, 696 n. 4, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979)); <em>accord Nathanson v. United States, </em>702 F.2d 162, 165 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 352, 78 L.Ed.2d 316 (1983). Roberts\u2019 and Burden\u2019s speech in the grievances, unlike the speech in <em>Bowman, </em>723 F.2d at 644-45, was not in response to conduct or decisions of the school district or other school personnel at a time when such conduct or decisions were the subject of active public dispute. Superintendent Tate\u2019s letter indicates that the fifth-grade trip as funded had been \u201capproved,\u201d presumably by the Board or the administration, and that the decision between <em>Weekly Readers </em>and more supply money had been made a month before at a faculty meeting. The concerns underlying the <em>Pickering </em>balance suggest that a government as an employer has a legitimate interest in achieving compliance with decisions that, while once open to dispute and discussion, have been made through proper channels. <em>See Kelleher v. Flawn, </em>761 F.2d 1079, 1084 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cIt is firmly established that the First Amendment\u2019s shield does not extend to speech and conduct amounting to insubordination directed at school officials.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Because the time and manner of the speech here implicate to a great degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>legitimate concerns of the government, as an employer, with insubordination versus respect for proper authority and decision-making procedures, we conclude as a matter of law that the grievances filed by Roberts and Burden were not protected under the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">While this disposes of the first amendment claim as to Burden, we still must consider as to Roberts whether certain union activities also alleged to be a motive for her discharge were in fact constitutionally protected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">We have stated, citing Supreme Court precedent, that it is \u201cclear that * * * a public employer may not constitutionally prohibit its employees from joining together in a union, or from persuading others to do so.\u201d <em>Arkansas State Highway Employees Local 1315 v. Kell, </em>628 F.2d 1099, 1102 (8th Cir.1980) (relying on <em>Smith v. Arkansas State Highway Employees Local 1315, </em>441 U.S. 463, 99 S.Ct. 1826, 60 L.Ed.2d 360 (1979) (per curiam)); <em>see also Norbeck v. Davenport Community School District, </em>545 F.2d 63, 67 (8th Cir.1976) (constitutional right to join a union extends to teachers the same as to other public employees), cer<em>t. denied, </em>431 U.S. 917, 97 S.Ct. 2179, 53 L.Ed.2d 227 (1977). Thus, the only union activity cited by Starbird in his evaluation of Roberts \u2014 her efforts at recruiting other teachers as members \u2014 was protected conduct. To the degree that the nonrenewal decision may have been influenced by further union activities of Roberts shown by the record \u2014 the posting of notices on the bulletin board in the teachers\u2019 lounge, the distribution of pamphlets and other information, the collection of dues, and the handling of inquiries concerning the credit union \u2014 we conclude that this conduct also was within the scope of first amendment freedom of association. As we have recognized, the right of union membership would be \u201cmeaningless\u201d unless an employee\u2019s right to participate in union activities were also recognized. <em>Carter v. Kurzejeski, </em>706 F.2d 835, 838 (8th Cir.1983) (employees held leadership positions in union, filed numerous unfair labor practice complaints, and participated in grievance proceedings); <em>see also Professional Association of College Educators v. El Paso County Community College District, </em>730 F.2d 258, 262 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[T]he first amendment is violated by state action whose purpose is * * * to intimidate public employees * * * from taking an active part in [union] affairs or to retaliate against those who do.\u201d) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 248, 83 L.Ed.2d 186 (1984); <em>Columbus Education Association v. Columbus City School District, </em>623 F.2d 1155, 1159 (6th Cir.1980) (\u201c[A] reprimand to retaliate against the zealous representation by a union spokesperson of a member\u2019s grievance impermis-sibly infringes upon the constitutional right of free association * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">As in the case of speech, however, an associational right must be balanced, against, and may be overridden by, the government\u2019s interest as an employer in efficiency. For example, association will not be protected if the employee engages in the allegedly protected activities on the job, interfering with the performance of his duties, <em>Hughes v. Whitmer, </em>714 F.2d 1407, 1424 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1275, 79 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984), or if the employee harasses coworkers and disrupts operations. <em>Greminger v. Seaborne, </em>584 F.2d 275, 278 (8th Cir.1978); <em>cf. Norbeck, supra </em>(school may prevent principal from representing in collective bargaining the teachers whom he was hired to supervise, discipline, and evaluate).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>While Starbird stated in his evaluation of Roberts that her recruiting activities caused disharmony, the record does not demonstrate that that was the case. The only difficulties between Roberts and other teachers shown by the evidence resulted from disputes over other matters; and while Starbird could name none of the numerous teachers he said complained to him of being badgered by Roberts to join the union, several testified that none of Roberts\u2019 organizational activities was offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Assuming Roberts\u2019 union activities were protected, however, she would still have to show that her discharge had been based in substantial part on those activities. Superintendent Tate, for example, denied that he considered the references in Starbird\u2019s evaluation in recommending that the Board not renew Roberts, and all of the Board members testified that their votes would have been the same had the union activities not been mentioned. Three members of the Board specifically stated that they would have voted for nonrenewal even absent Tate\u2019s recommendation, and four mentioned receiving parental complaints about Roberts. Starbird\u2019s evaluation also cited Roberts\u2019 poor rapport with administration, staff, and parents and her uncompromising viewpoints and insistence that she was always right plus a high rate of requests from parents that their children not be assigned to her classroom. Substantial evidence was introduced concerning the numerous parental complaints. While the evidence was not the strongest that Roberts\u2019 union activities were a motivating factor in the Board\u2019s failure to renew her contract and that, absent such activities, her contract would have been renewed, we believe that, giving her the benefit of all favorable inferences, these are issues of fact to be decided by the jury. The union activities are mentioned in Starbird\u2019s evaluation, and Tate, while denying reliance on that conduct, admitted that it was difficult for him to say whether he would have recommended nonrenewal absent Starbird\u2019s evaluation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the interrogatory submitted to the jury in this case combined the issues of protected conduct and causation, we cannot tell how the jury decided the latter issue, and we must remand for further proceedings on Roberts\u2019 claim that she was impermissibly discharged for her union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">Roberts and Burden also argue that the district court\u2019s instructions on the first amendment claim were deficient in that, in a certain passage, the name of defendant Starbird was omitted, confusing the jury as to whether it could find a constitutional violation based on his conduct alone. To the extent that the teachers rely on their grievances as protected speech, any error was harmless as we have found against them on that issue as matter of law; to the extent that Roberts relies on her union activities, any error may be cured on remand. We observe that, should the individual liability stage be reached, the district court should reconsider its ruling, in response to an objection by Roberts and Burden, that the existence of qualified immunity is a matter of fact for the jury. <em>See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2818, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (reference to the \u201cpurely legal question on which [defendant\u2019s] claim of [qualified] immunity turns\u201d); <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 815-16, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736-37, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (\u201cOn summary judgment, the judge appropriately may determine, not only the currently applicable law, but whether that law was clearly established at the time an action occurred.\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Joseph v. Brierton, </em>739 F.2d 1244, 1249 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Czurlanis v. Albanese, </em>721 F.2d 98, 108 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Windsor v. The Tennes</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number><em>sean, </em>719 F.2d 155, 165 (6th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 105, 83 L.Ed.2d 50 (1984); <em>cf. Tubbesing v. Arnold, </em>742 F.2d 401 (8th Cir.1984) (finding qualified immunity after district court denied summary judgment on the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"AsUa\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">Finally, Roberts and Burden argue that the jury instructions and interrogatories on their state law claim erroneously required them to show that they \u201csuffered damages as a proximate cause\u201d of Starbird\u2019s failure to comply with the Arkansas Teacher Fair Dismissal Act. Although the specific provision of the statute at issue here \u2014 that requiring principals to raise with teachers and attempt to help remedy their teaching deficiencies<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 apparently has not been construed by the Arkansas courts, we believe certain general principles developed in other teacher dismissal cases are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">The Arkansas Supreme Court has held that a school district may reasonably be expected to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with statutory requirements and its own personnel policies. <em>McElroy v. Jasper School District, </em>273 Ark. 143, 617 S.W.2d 356, 357, 358 (1981); <em>Maxwell v. Southside School District, </em>273 Ark. 89, 618 S.W.2d 148, 149 (1981). \u201cStrict compliance\u201d is not necessary absent a showing of prejudice from the want of such conformity, <em>Lee v. Big Flat Public Schools, </em>280 Ark. 377, 658 S.W.2d 389, 390 (1983); however, a nonrenewal may successfully be challenged when the district\u2019s actions do not even reach the level of \u201ccolorable compliance.\u201d <em>Maxwell, </em>618 S.W.2d at 150. \u201cProximate cause\u201d as such plays no role in this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\">But here, the actual focus of the jury instructions was whether, despite any technical variance from the statute by the school district, Roberts and Burden were aware of the problems that lead to their nonrenewal and whether the district took any steps to help them correct such problems. Similar factors have been considered relevant by the Arkansas Supreme Court in determining whether actions constituted \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with a statute or school policy. <em>E.g., McElroy, supra </em>(school district substantially complied with its policy concerning teacher evaluations when, although plaintiff neither received nor signed written copies of such evaluations, plaintiff was aware of their contents, had frequent conferences and had received counseling as to her problems in maintaining classroom discipline); <em>Lee, supra </em>(arguably unclear letter sufficient to give notice of nonrenewal in light of earlier conversations and communications); <em>Allred v. Little Rock School District, </em>274 Ark. 414, 625 S.W.2d 487 (1981) (same). Thus, reading the charge as a whole, we conclude that, despite some less than ideal terminology, the instructions fairly and adequately put before the jury the factors appropriate to the decision of Roberts\u2019 and Burden\u2019s state law claim, and we will not disturb the verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Monahan v. Flannery, </em>755 F.2d 678, 681 (8th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>We affirm the judgments against Roberts and Burden as to their claims under Arkansas law, against Burden as to her claim under the first and fourteenth amendments, and against Roberts as to her claim under the first and fourteenth amendments insofar as she relies on the grievances as protected speech. We vacate the judgment on the jury verdict against Roberts on her constitutional claim insofar as she relies on her union activities, and we remand for a new trial in conformity with this opinion on the issue of whether the school district impermissibly failed to renew her contract in retaliation for any such activities which may be found to be protected.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">. Roberts and Burden also asserted that due process required that they receive hearings since the circumstances of their nonrenewals resulted in stigma affecting their opportunities for future employment, thus implicating their liberty interests. The jury also found for the district on this claim, and this result is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">.

The school district\u2019s argument that submission of the protected speech issue to the jury was \"harmless error\" merely assumes that the jury found the speech unprotected and that it was correct in so finding and does not foreclose our consideration of that issue of law. <em>See Loya v. Desert Sands Unified School District, </em>721 F.2d 279, 282 (9th Cir.1983) (submission of balancing test to jury could not be regarded as nonprejudicial error where court determined that at least most of the speech in question was protected); <em>see also Schneider v. City of Atlanta, </em>628 F.2d 915, 920 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1980) (defendant prejudiced by submission of first amendment question to jury where jury found that plaintiffs rights had been violated.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">. At various points \u2014 though not in their pleadings or closing arguments to the jury \u2014 Roberts and Burden have suggested that their speech in proposing to the PTA that an Easter party not be held for fifth-graders was among the protected conduct against which the Board retaliated. The main concern of the Board (and the parr ents) in regard to this incident, however, was the teachers\u2019 subsequent failure to allow their classes to attend the party when their proposal was not adopted, not the teachers\u2019 speech.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">. Furthermore, as we observed in a footnote in our opinion reviewing the denial of the preliminary injunction, the decline in Roberts\u2019 evaluation marks may not be used to justify her dismissal insofar as the lower scores may be traced to Starbird\u2019s disapproval of her union activities. 731 F.2d at 527 n. 3 (citing with approval <em>Hickman v.

Section 80-1264.6 provided in part that [w]henever a principal or other school administrator charged with supervision of a teacher finds it necessary to admonish a teacher for a reason that the administrator believes may lead to termination or nonrenewal, the ad-, ministrator shall bring the matter to the attention of the teacher involved in writing and shall document the efforts which have been undertaken to assist the teacher to correct whatever appears to be the cause for potential termination or nonrenewal.</p>\n<p id=\"Avod\">For the current statutory language, see Ark.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 80-1266.6 (Supp.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AZIH\">. The school district, in addition to defending the instructions, also argues that for two reasons the state claim should never have reached the jury: (1) the district court was without jurisdiction because the Arkansas Teacher Fair Dismissal Act provides for judicial review of Board decisions only as to \"nonprobationary\u201d teachers, that is, those who have been employed with the district at least three successive years; and (2) the statute on which Roberts and Burden relied does not grant a private right of action. Arkansas cases, however, clearly contemplate that, under a proper pleading, a probationary teacher may bring an original action in circuit court alleging that a school district has breached its contract by failing to comply with statutes and policies that may be implicitly incorporated therein. <em>Head v. Caddo Hills School District, 277 </em>Ark. 482, 644 S.W.2d 246 (1982); <em>Springdale </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number><em>School District v.

Given our conclusion on the instruction issue, we need not decide whether Roberts and Burden successfully pled such an action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
