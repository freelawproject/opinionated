He challenges the district court\u2019s voir dire of the jury venire, the admission of evidence concerning other illegal acts on his part, the court\u2019s instruction concerning the standard of knowledge necessary for willful tax evasion, and the court\u2019s summary of the evidence. We find no error and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b662-22\">George Martin was charged with willfully evading the payment of the full amount of income tax owing- by him in the years 1977, 1978, and 1979. Martin did not contest that he understated his income on returns filed for those years and stipulated at trial to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s computation of his income and the taxes owing thereon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue at trial was Martin\u2019s actual knowledge that the unreported income was taxable. Martin maintained in pretrial interviews that his unreported income was derived from gambling winnings and that he thought only winnings from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>wager at 300 to 1 or higher odds were taxable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Prior to trial Martin filed motions <em>in limine </em>in response to indications that the government would seek to introduce evidence that Martin\u2019s income was derived from \u201cbookmaking\u201d and from selling stolen chickens. Martin also sought to exclude statements made by an attorney who represented him in an IRS audit in 1979; the attorney allegedly admitted to the IRS that Martin had not reported income from selling chickens stolen from his employer, Holly Poultry.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">On the first morning of trial the district court held a hearing on the motions <em>in limine. </em>Though the court initially believed that neither line of evidence would be properly admitted in the government\u2019s case-in-chief, it ruled that the government could inquire into the sale of chickens, without making reference to them as stolen, and into the statements by attorney Kalichman. The court made no ruling concerning evidence of Martin\u2019s bookmaking activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">On voir dire of the jury venire, defense counsel requested a series of questions concerning jurors\u2019 gambling experience.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court declined to ask the specific questions, instead questioning the jury more generally about gambling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One potential juror asked to approach the bench and stated that he had strong opinions about taxation of gambling income. He was stricken for cause. Martin renewed his request for voir dire concerning jurors\u2019 gambling practices; the court again refused the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">In the course of presenting its case-in-chief, the government elicited the testimony of IRS auditor Darlene Baker concerning attorney Kalichman\u2019s statements that Martin had made at least $30,000 from the sale of chickens. Virginia Ward, Martin\u2019s former mistress also testified that Martin had told her that he sold chickens and made $50,000 a year tax free. She stated that she had seen Martin leave a farmers\u2019 market with an envelope of money on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">Ms. Ward further stated that Martin occasionally played the numbers and bet on sporting events. She testified over objection that a woman had once called for Martin and that Martin had identified the woman as his employee in a bookmaking operation he was backing. Ms. Ward identified two documents as items she had taken from a nightstand in Martin\u2019s house and turned over to the IRS. A government expert witness testified over objection that the documents were bookmaking records, but handwriting exemplars indicated that Martin had not written the documents. Other bookmaking evidence included testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>mony from an associate of Martin\u2019s at Holly Poultry who stated that Martin had once said he had an interest in a small bookmaking operation. The government introduced other evidence that Martin was a \"frequent gambler.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Martin testified on his own behalf and, consistent with his pretrial interviews, denied any knowledge of the taxability of gambling income. He also denied any involvement in bookmaking or selling chickens. He presented several witnesses who testified that Martin gambled and sometimes placed bets for others but always paid out fully on any winning bet he had placed for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Following the court\u2019s summary of the evidence and instructions, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts and an active sentence of confinement was imposed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We first consider Martin\u2019s challenge to the admission of evidence that he received income during the taxable years from bookmaking activities and from selling chickens. This, he says, was \u201cother acts\u201d evidence which, per Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, should not have been admitted because the \u201cother acts\u201d were not established by clear and convincing evidence. Furthermore, he contends, its admission abused the discretion conferred by Fed.R. Evid. 403 which requires a balancing of probative value against the risk of unfair prejudice. Neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Rule 404(b) is concerned with the possible irrelevance and high risk of unfairness of any evidence of a person\u2019s conduct, particularly his \u201cbad acts,\u201d other than that directly in litigation issue. It therefore makes such evidence flatly inadmissible for the most marginally relevant and manifestly unfair purpose of proving the person\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d in order to suggest propensity. But in a concession to the reality that for \u201cother purposes,\u201d such evidence may be highly relevant (or possibly necessary) to prove a disputed issue, it authorizes admission for such purposes, including the specific purposes of proving disputed states of mind of the person. Where such other purposes do exist, protections against improper admission nevertheless remain in Rule 104 relevancy standards and in Rule 403\u2019s requirement that probative value yet be balanced against the risk of \u201cunfair prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Some courts, concerned with the marginal relevance of such evidence even for purposes other than to prove \u201ccharacter,\u201d have imposed a further judicial requirement that only \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of the commission of such other acts may be admitted for such purposes\u2014 particularly (and perhaps only) when the purpose is to prove a disputed state of mind. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gustaf-son, </em>728 F.2d 1078, 1083 (8th Cir.1984). Other courts, however, have thought that the general protections afforded by Rule 104\u2019s threshold relevancy standard and Rule 403\u2019s added requirement that even relevant evidence be assessed for possible unfair prejudice are sufficient safeguards against improper uses of such evidence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jardina, </em>747 F.2d 945, 952 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">While we have not before directly addressed the matter in these terms, we have not imposed any \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard in our applications of Rule 404(b). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith Paving &amp; Grading Inc., </em>760 F.2d 527, 530-31 (4th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Tate, </em>715 F.2d 864, 865-66 (4th Cir.1983). Because we agree with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach, we decline to adopt such a requirement as urged by Martin in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">On this basis, we conclude that the evidence of income from bookmaking and chicken sales was properly admissible under Rule 404(b) and Rule 403. The evidence was not offered or submitted to the jury to prove Martin\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d; but rather to prove that Martin received income that he was required to report but did not report, a requisite to his conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. <em>See United States v. Mogavero, </em>521 F.2d 625, 627-28 (4th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>1975). While the amount of unreported income was stipulated, its reportability was not, and this could only be established by proof of its source. The evidence in question was manifestly relevant for this \u201cother purpose\u201d than proof of Martin\u2019s character. That the activity producing the income may have been illegal does not preclude admission of the evidence under Rule 404(b). <em>See United States v. Heyward, </em>729 F.2d 297, 301 (4th Cir.1984); <em>cf. United States v. Simpson, </em>709 F.2d 903, 907 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Neither can we find any abuse of the discretion imposed by Rule 403 to assess the risk of unfair prejudice before admitting relevant evidence, balancing against that risk the probative value of the evidence. Here, as indicated, the probative value was high, approaching if not reaching absolute necessity to prove an essential element of the charged offense. Given the fact that the court excluded any evidence that the chickens sold had been stolen, no possible \u201cunfairness\u201d attended the admission of evidence that income was realized from those sales. In the total balance, the probative value of the evidence of bookmaking income could not be thought outweighed by any countervailing \u201cunfairness\u201d resulting from its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">There was no error in admitting the alleged bookmaking records and the expert testimony concerning those records. The records themselves need not come within an exception to the rule against hearsay. That the documents were bookmaking records and that they were found in Martin\u2019s constructive possession were the probative facts proven by evidence of the form and location of the records; the records were not therefore offered to establish the truth of the transactions recorded in them and would not be considered hearsay evidence. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>532 F.2d 641 (8th Cir.1976) (drug transaction records).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The expert witness\u2019 testimony identifying the documents as bookmaking records was a necessary foundation for admitting the documents as they had no relevance otherwise. The district court was well within its discretion in admitting such expert testimony to aid the jury\u2019s understanding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Martin also challenges the admission of evidence concerning attorney Kalichman\u2019s statements to the IRS on the grounds that the statements were hearsay not within an exception and that the statements were protected by the attorney-client privilege. We hold that the court properly admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Kalichman\u2019s statement to the IRS auditor that Martin had made additional unreported income by selling chickens was made during the .course of his representation of Martin pursuant to a power of attorney filed with the IRS. While the written power of attorney was limited to certain ministerial duties, Kalichman in fact dealt with the IRS auditors as Martin\u2019s representative. We agree with the district court that Kalichman was authorized to make statements concerning Martin\u2019s taxes in the scope of his representation. Kalichman did not exceed the scope of his authority by relating the existence of unreported income as he qualified his statement by asserting that Martin did not know the additional income was reportable. Though an attorney\u2019s admission of criminal liability might not be admissible against the client, <em>see </em>C. McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 267 at 643-44 (2d ed. 1972), this statement does not rise to that level. Kalichman did not admit liability due to the qualification' noted. The statement was admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) because Kalichman \u201cwas authorized to make, on the principal\u2019s behalf, any statements concerning the subject matter.\u201d <em>Restatement of Agency 2d </em>\u00a7 286 (1958). <em>See also United States v. Dolleris, </em>408 F.2d 918 (6th Cir.1969); <em>United States v. Tuschman, </em>405 F.2d 688 (6th Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">Neither was the statement inadmissible because of the attorney-client privilege. Matters communicated to an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ney by his client may be cloaked with the privilege, but the party asserting the privilege must establish the existence of the confidential relationship. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>696 F.2d 1069, 1072 (4th Cir.1982). To be privileged it must be intended that information given an attorney remain confidential; information given with the intent that it be used, for example, to compromise tax liability, is inconsistent with the confidentiality asserted. <em>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>727 F.2d 1352, 1356 (4th Cir.1984). To the extent such confidentiality was intended, Martin waived the privilege by authorizing Kalichman to represent him before the auditor. <em>See United States v. Mierzwicki, </em>500 F.Supp. 1331, 1334 (D.Md. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We next consider the district court\u2019s instructions on the knowledge element of willful income tax evasion. The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">The element of knowledge that I have referred to may be satisfied by inferences that have been drawn from proof that a defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">A finding beyond a reasonable doubt of a. conscious purpose to avoid enlightenment would permit an inference of knowledge. Stated another way, a defendant\u2019s knowledge of a fact may be inferred from his willful blindness to the existence of a certain fact or facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">It is entirely up to you as jurors as to whether you find any deliberate closing of the eyes and the inferences from any such evidence. A showing of negligence or mistake is not sufficient to support a finding of willfulness or knowledge. You should note that if a person in good faith believes that he has paid all the taxes he owes, he cannot be guilty of an attempt to evade the tax. But if a person acts without reasonable grounds for belief that his conduct is lawful, then you must decide whether he willfully intended to evade the tax. You must decide this issue of intent, namely, whether the defendant willfully attempted to evade the tax by considering, as I have indicated, all the evidence in the case that bears upon his state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">(App. 352-53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">This instruction is consistent with the principle that \u201c \u2018the term \u201cwillfully\u201d ... requires more than a showing of careless disregard of the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Eilertson, </em>707 F.2d 108, 110 (4th Cir.1983), quoting <em>United States v. Pomponio, </em>429 U.S. 10, 12, 97 S.Ct. 22, 23, 50 L.Ed.2d 12 (1976). The instruction here read as a whole does not permit an inference of knowledge from a mere showing of careless disregard. The positive admonition to consider \u201cconscious purpose\u201d and <em>\u201cdeliberate </em>closing of the eyes\u201d juxtaposed with the negative admonition that negligence or mistake is not sufficient, conveyed to the jury that knowledge may be inferred only from deliberate disregard for the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">We decline to follow <em>United States v. Callahan, </em>588 F.2d 1078 (5th Cir.1979) which held a similarly worded instruction to equate willful blindness with reckless disregard. We believe that the deliberateness aspect of this instruction places the proper emphasis on intent required for willful tax evasion. - Therefore, we hold that the court did not err in instructing the jury that knowledge could be inferred from willful blindness.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">We find no merit to appellant\u2019s challenges to the court\u2019s voir dire of the jury and its summary of the evidence. Comparing the questions proffered by the defense to those actually put to the jury reveals that the defendant\u2019s concerns were adequately addressed by the district court. Accordingly we do not find that Martin\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury was infringed by an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion to conduct voir dire under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See United States v. Brunty, </em>701 F.2d 1375 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Similarly, though the district court\u2019s summary of the evidence might have been more balanced, we do not find that the judge went so far as to express an opinion of Martin\u2019s guilt. <em>Cf. United States v. Tello, </em>707 F.2d 85 (4th Cir.1983). Accordingly we find no error in the court\u2019s summary of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-14\">. The indictment alleged that Martin filed a return in 1977 showing income of $10,483 with tax due and owing of $532, whereas his income was actually $62,857.83 with a tax due of $20,-340.65. The 1978 return states income of $6,984 and a tax of $114 when Martin\u2019s income was actually $64,755.45 with a tax due of $18,000.20. In 1979, Martin stated his income to be $6,249 and owed no tax whereas he actually had income of $19,864.45 resulting in a tax of $2475.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. Martin said he held this belief because of the fact that casinos and racetracks must only withhold taxes and report the amount of winnings on bets placed at 300 to 1 or higher odds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">. Martin\u2019s counsel proposed the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">Has any member of the jury panel ever gambled at a race track or casino? If so, do you go to the track or casino more frequently than six times per year? (If the answer to the latter question is in the affirmative, counsel would request that the jurors be called to the bench to answer the following questions individually).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">(a) How frequently would you estimate that you gambled, either at a race track or at a casino?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">(b) When you go to either the track or casino, do you ever bet in amounts greater than f 100 per bet? If so, what is the average amount of your bets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">(c) Have you ever received any information from the I.R.S., accountants or any other source regarding the taxability of your gambling income?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-18\">(d) What is your understanding of whether your gambling winnings are taxable?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b663-19\">. The court asked the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-20\">Any member of the panel or members of your immediate family employed in any capacity at a race track?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-21\">Any member of the panel or members of your immediate family employed in any capacity with the state lottery or any lottery operation? Do you know of any reason why you may be prejudiced for or against the Government or for or against the defendant because of the nature of the charges or otherwise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-22\">Do you have any belief or opinion that the offenses with which the defendant is charged are unique in any respect in the sense that they should be pursued with extraordinary vigor, that they should not constitute an offense, or that they may carry penalties which you may consider improper?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
