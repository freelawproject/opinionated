Ricket (\u201cRicket\u201d) filed a 1982 income tax return containing only his signature and the date, and invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination with respect to the other relevant questions. Ricket was assessed a $500 civil penalty under I.R.C. \u00a7 6702<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for filing a frivolous return. He then filed suit under 1. R.C. \u00a7 6703(c) for a refund of the assessed penalty. The district court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-24\">On appeal, Ricket contends that (1) the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because there was a genuine issue as to the validity of his Fifth Amendment claim; (2) \u00a7 6702 unconstitutionally penalizes the exercise of the First Amendment right of free speech; and (3) \u00a7 6702 is unconstitutional because the term \u201cfrivolous\u201d in the IRS\u2019 interpretations of the statute is vague. These arguments are patently frivolous, and the judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-25\">In addition, the government has urged this court to award double costs and attorney\u2019s fees under Fed.R.App.P. 38.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Ricket was put on notice about the inadequacy of his income tax return when the IRS assessed a $500 penalty against him for filing a \u201cfrivolous\u201d return and moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the district court. The lower court\u2019s opinion dismissing with prejudice his complaint also provided a warning to him that his suit was frivolous. Other circuits have uniformly rejected similar claims asserted by taxpayers seeking a refund of the \u00a7 6702 penalty, and have assessed double costs and attorneys for prosecuting frivolous appeals. <em>Paulson v. United States, </em>758 F.2d 61, 62 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Boomer v. United States, </em>755 F.2d 696, 697 (8th Cir.1985); <em>Martinez v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>744 F.2d 71, 72-73 (10th Cir.1984), Ricket nevertheless appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The legal theories advanced by Ricket have been rejected uniformly as frivolous, both in the \u00a7 6702 context presented in this case, and in clearly analogous contexts. On appeal, this court has indicated that it will impose double costs and attorney\u2019s fees where a taxpayer prosecutes a frivolous appeal. <em>See Biermann v. Commissioner, </em>769 F.2d 707, 708 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Waters v. Commissioner, </em>764 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir.1985). Under these circumstances, we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to award double costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. We remand to the district court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to the government for the cost of defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">.
