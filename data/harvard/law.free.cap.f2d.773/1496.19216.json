We reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"a-h-dedup-0\">\n<em>A. Proceedings in the District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aj2\">Gallardo was originally indicted on November 10, 1982 on three counts of interference with commerce by threats or violence and six counts of bank embezzlement. He was arraigned on those charges on November 12, 1982. While those charges were pending, the district court granted six continuances under the STA's \u201cends of justice\u201d provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8). Section 3161(h)(8) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1580-5\">The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which ... [a criminal] trial must commence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1580-6\">____ Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or his counsel or at the request of the attorney for the Government, if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. No such period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court in accordance with this paragraph shall be excludable under this subsection unless the court sets forth, in the record of the case either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1580-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-10\">All of the continuances were requested jointly by both parties, based upon specific reasons relating to their scheduling needs and ability to prepare for trial. All but the second request were initiated and drafted by Gallardo\u2019s attorney. The district court judge issued separate, written orders articulating his reasons for granting each continuance, and for finding that the period of each continuance was excludable under section 3161(h)(8)(A). The six \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1580-11\">OLD NEW WHO MOTION CONTINUANCE TRIAL DATE TRIAL DATE ORIGINATED FILED GRANTED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADW2\">12/28/82 2/15/83 Defendant 12/9/82 12/15/82</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ast-dedup-1\">2/15/83 4/19/83 Government 1/21/83 1/25/83</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"av5-dedup-0\">4/19/83 6/14/83 Defendant 4/4/83 4/6/83</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ay_-dedup-0\">6/14/83 9/13/83 Defendant 5/26/83 6/2/83</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"at3m-dedup-0\">9/13/83 12/6/83 Defendant 8/30/83 10/3/83</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkzJ\">12/6/83 3/6/84 Defendant 11/29/83 12/8/83</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1580-12\">Gallardo filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him on October 21, 1983. The court granted that motion in part on January 20, 1984, and required the government to make an election of counts and drop at least three counts within ten days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>The government failed to comply with the court\u2019s order within the allotted time, however, because it was preparing for trial in another case. According to the government, when it realized it had missed its ten-day deadline, it decided that the \u201cmost appropriate\u201d course of action was to file a superseding indictment against Gallardo, which dropped four counts from the preceding indictment, although the district court\u2019s order had not required the filing of a new indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-5\">On February 22, 1984, the government charged Gallardo in a second superseding indictment with four counts of interference with commerce and one count of embezzlement from a savings and loan association.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gallardo was arraigned on the new indictment on March 2, 1984, and the district court rescheduled trial for April 3, 1984, ostensibly to give Gallardo\u2019s counsel 30 days to prepare for trial on the new charges, as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1581-6\">On March 16, 1984, Gallardo moved to dismiss the second superseding indictment for violation of the STA\u2019s 70-day indictment-to-trial limitation provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). The district court granted Gallardo\u2019s motion and dismissed his indictment without prejudice on May 30, 1984. Gallardo contended that the court\u2019s dismissal should be <em>with </em>prejudice, since the government had failed to comply in a timely manner with the court\u2019s order requiring an election of counts. However, the district court weighed the factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2) for determining whether to dismiss with or without prejudice, and rejected Gallardo\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-11\">The government appeals the dismissal of Gallardo\u2019s indictment, and Gallardo separately appeals the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss without prejudice. Gallardo also contends that the district court\u2019s decisions to grant the third, fourth, and fifth \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances in his case constituted an abuse of discretion, and provide this court with an alternative basis to affirm the dismissal of his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-12\">\n<em>B. Computations Under the STA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ap-x\">The parties agree that Gallardo\u2019s November 12, 1982 arraignment commenced the running of the STA\u2019s 70-day clock in his case. \u25a0 The parties also agree that various pretrial motions tolled the running of the 70-day period for at least 84 days.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>further agree that although two superseding indictments were issued against Gallar-do on March 3,1983 and February 22,1984, neither one tolled or caused a restarting of the 70-day clock.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1582-4\">The threshold issue in this case is the effect upon the running of the 70-day period of the six \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances granted by the district court under section 3161(h)(8)(A).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government maintains that such continuances <em>toll </em>the running of the STA\u2019s 70-day clock, regardless of how much time is remaining on it: as a result, when an \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance is granted, the amount of time remaining on the 70-day clock at the end of that continuance is exactly the same as the amount remaining when the continuance began. In contrast, Gallardo espouses the approach recommended by the <em>Judicial Conference Guidelines to the Administration of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, as amended </em>(1974) (hereinafter <em>\u201cGuidelines\u201d), </em>which were employed by the district court clerk, and which provide that \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances are <em>\u201ctacked-on\u201d </em>to the end of the 70-day limitation period, and do not stop the running of the 70-day clock until there would otherwise be no time remaining on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-5\">Thus, the government maintains that Gallardo\u2019s 70-day clock was tolled in December, 1982 with the beginning of the first \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance, and continued to be tolled until March 6, 1984, at the end of the sixth consecutive continuance. At that point, the government maintains there was still sufficient time remaining on the 70-day clock\u201437 days\u2014to allow for an April 3, 1984 trial date, as set by the district court. In contrast, Gallardo maintains that under the Guidelines\u2019s approach, his 70-day clock was totally unaffected by the first \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance and all but the last four days of the second continuance, until the 70-day period elapsed on April 15, 1983; at that point, the remaining continuances extended the time for trial, but on March 6, 1984, when the last continuance ended, there was no time left on the 70-day clock. According to Gallar-do, March 6, 1984 was the final date he could be brought to trial without violating the STA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-13\">Based primarily upon the STA\u2019s language and legislative history, we conclude that \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances <em>toll </em>the running of the STA\u2019s 70-day clock, and conclude as a result that the 70-day period did not elapse in Gallardo\u2019s case. We also reject Gallardo\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>third, fourth, and fifth continuances. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gallardo\u2019s indictment. Because of our ruling, we need not address the issues raised in Gallardo\u2019s separate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-5\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the STA, including the court\u2019s methods of computing excludable delay for \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances. <em>United States v. Frey, </em>735 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir.1984); <em>accord United States v. Henderson, </em>746 F.2d 619, 622 (9th Cir.1984). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its STA determinations, including its findings that exclusions of certain blocks of time from the 70-day limitation period \u201cserved the ends of justice,\u201d under the \u201cclear error\u201d standard of review. <em>Henderson, </em>746 F.2d at 622; <em>Frey, </em>735 F.2d at 352. We review the district court\u2019s decisions granting the third, fourth, and fifth \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion and whether Gallardo suffered prejudice as a result. <em>United States v. Maybusher, </em>735 F.2d 366, 369-70 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 790, 83 L.Ed.2d 783 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-9\">\n<em>B. Expiration of the STA\u2019s 70-Day Period</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-10\">As noted above, whether or not the STA\u2019s 70-day period elapsed in Gallardo\u2019s case depends upon the method employed in computing excludable delay for the district court\u2019s six \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances. If the government is correct and these continuances tolled the 70-day clock, then the period did not elapse in Gallardo\u2019s ease. On the other hand, if Gallardo and the <em>Guidelines </em>are correct, then the STA\u2019s 70-day limitation was violated;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1583-12\">\n<em>1. Plain Wording of Section 3161(h)(8)(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-13\">The plain language of the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision, section 3161(h)(8)(A), suggests that Congress intended \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances to toll the running of the STA\u2019s 70-day clock. Section 3161(h) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1583-14\">(h) <em>The following periods of delay shall be excluded </em>... in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1583-15\">(8)(A) <em>Any period of delay </em>resulting from a[n \u201cends of justice\u201d] continuance</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1583-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A) (emphasis added). Congress\u2019s use of the word \u201cany\u201d suggests that <em>every </em>\u201cends of justice\u201d continuance is <em>totally </em>excluded from STA calculations. For Gallardo\u2019s, or the <em>Guidelines\u2019s, </em>interpretation to be correct, the phrase \u201cany period of delay\u201d in section (h)(8)(A) must be read to mean \u201cany period of delay <em>after the 70-day clock has elapsed.\u201d </em>In <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>746 F.2d 619 (9th Cir.1984), we recently rejected an attempt to read additional requirements into the provisions of section 3161(h) that were not reflected in its plain language. In <em>Henderson, </em>a set of criminal defendants maintained that the STA\u2019s 'exclusion provision for pretrial motions, section 3161(h)(1)(F), authorizes excludable delays for pretrial motions only when such delays are \u201c \u2018reasonably necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622. We noted that section (h)(1)(F) authorizes exclusions for <em>\u201c[a]ny period of delay ... </em>including ... delay resulting from <em>any pretrial motion,\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) (emphasis added); <em>\u201c[o]n its face, </em>the statute excludes delays resulting from pretrial motions <em>without </em>qualification____ It does not say \u2018any reasonable period of delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We declined to rewrite the phrase \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>period of delay\u201d to mean \u201cany reasonable period of delay,\u201d noting that Congress was perfectly capable of writing the provision that way if it had intended that meaning. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-4\">Similarly, in the case of \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances, Congress could easily have provided that such continuances are \u201cexcluded\u201d only once the STA\u2019s 70-day clock has elapsed. The STA is an extremely detailed, precisely drafted statutory scheme. Yet Congress did not write such a provision into the STA. We must therefore apply the language of section 3161(h)(8)(A) that Congress chose to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-5\">\n<em>2. Wording of Surrounding Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-6\">The wording of other STA provisions also suggests that \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances toll the 70-day clock. Section 3161(h) enumerates eight different types of \u201cperiod[s] of delay\u201d that \u201cshall be excluded\u201d in STA computations. Seven of these eight \u2014 those enumerated in sections 3161(h)(l)-(6) and (8) \u2014 begin with or include the phrase \u201cany period of delay,\u201d as does the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As we indicated in <em>Henderson, </em>the fact that Congress chose to employ the same phrase in these provisions suggests that it intended them to be interpreted uniformly. <em>See </em>746 F.2d at 622. Since many of these provisions create exclusions for occurrences and stages in a criminal action that are likely to arise long before 70 days have elapsed\u2014 <em>see, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161(h)(1)(A) (exclusion for competency examinations), (h)(1)(F) (pretrial motions), (h)(3)(A) (fugitive defendant or witness), (h)(4) (mental incompetence or physical inability of defendant to stand trial) \u2014 they clearly authorize tolling of the 70-day clock. We conclude that the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision authorizes tolling of the 70-day clock as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-8\">Moreover, in <em>Henderson, </em>we concluded that Congress\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cany period of delay\u201d in various provisions of section 3161(h) indicated that any continuances granted under those provisions would result in \u201cautomatic\u201d exclusions from the 70-day clock. <em>See id. </em>Thus, an \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance granted under section (h)(8) must also result in an automatic exclusion from the 70-day clock, rather than resulting in an exclusion only if the 70-day period has already elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-14\">\n<em>3. Legislative History of the STA and Its 1979 Amendments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-15\">The legislative history of the STA and its 1979 amendments also supports the conclusion that \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances toll the running of the 70-day clock. First, the legislative history in 1974 contains a number of passages discussing \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances, which suggest that Congress believed these continuances would \u201ctoll\u201d the running of the 70-day clock before it elapsed and \u201ccarve out\u201d blocks of time in the 70-day limitation period. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1508, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p. 7401, (\u201cends of justice\u201d provision \u201cwould permit a judge ... to grant a continuance <em>which would toll the time limits of the bill\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); 120 Cong. Rec. 41774 (1974) (\u201cends of justice\u201d provision authorizes trial judge <em>\u201cto suspend the running of the time limits </em>by motion to continue\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-16\">Second, several of the 1979 amendments suggest that Congress understood the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision to authorize continuances during the middle of the 70-day limitation period. For example, one amendment to section (h)(8)(B) authorized the granting of an \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance so as not to \u201cdeny the defendant reasonable time to obtain counsel.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv). The need for such a continuance would almost always arise <em>before </em>the expiration of 70 days, and Congress specifically recognized that such a continuance would <em>\u201ctoll the time limit </em>for a reasonable period,\u201d and would \u201c \u2018stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>the clock\u2019 ... until the defendant obtains counsel.\u201d S.Rep. No. 212, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 35 (1979) (emphasis added). Moreover, the 1979 Congress expressly indicated that \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances could be employed by trial courts to increase their time to hold a matter \u201cunder advisement\u201d beyond the 30-day maximum prescribed by section 3161(h)(l)(J), or to complete \u201cextensive discovery based on complex transactions.\u201d <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 212, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 33-34 (1979); H.R. Rep. No. 390, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1979), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1979, pp. 805, 816. These situations would all normally arise before 70 days have elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">Third, the 1979 Congress specifically criticized the \u201ccautious\u201d approach to the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision contained in the Judicial Conference <em>Guidelines, </em>noting that the section had been under-used since the STA\u2019s passage, and Congress especially commended the alternate set of STA guidelines adopted by the Second Circuit as being \u201cworthy of consideration by all districts as a model for future implementation.\u201d <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 212, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1979) (\u201ctoo often, [those drafting the <em>Guidelines </em>] have erred on the side of caution\u201d). In its guidelines, the Second Circuit had adopted a \u201ctolling\u201d approach to the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision and criticized the Judicial Conference Guidelines\u2019s \u201ctacking-on\u201d approach on the grounds that it would result in a last-minute rush to bring many defendants to trial or obtain new continuances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-6\">The Second Circuit had recognized that many courts normally schedule trial to commence on the final day of an \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance: if such a continuance tolls the 70-day clock, \u201cthere [would often] be substantial unused non-excluded time available\u201d as of the day of trial; however, under the Guidelines\u2019s \u201ctacking-on\u201d approach, there would never be any time remaining. <em>See Second Circuit Guidelines, </em>40-41. Thus, if something unforeseen occurs, such as the illness of potential jurors or the judge, requiring a trial to be delayed, under the tolling approach, there would usually be no need for an additional continuance, whereas under the tacking-on approach, there always would be.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet a new \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance cannot be granted simply to serve the court\u2019s own scheduling needs, as opposed to the needs of the parties. <em>See United States v. Nance, </em>666 F.2d 353, 356 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 918, 102 S.Ct. 1776, 72 L.Ed.2d 179 (1982); <em>United States v. Janik, </em>723 F.2d 537, 543 (7th Cir.1983). Although it is widely recognized that there are \u201cinevitable slips in getting a case to trial,\u201d <em>Janik, </em>723 F.2d at 543, it is the purpose of the 70-day period, and not of a new \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance, to provide a \u201csafety margin.\u201d <em>See id. </em>As a result, the Second Circuit had concluded that granting an \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance tolls the running of a defendant\u2019s 70-day clock:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1585-9\">... There is nothing inconsistent with the statutory purpose in reading an [\u201cends of justice\u201d] continuance as a form of excluded time.

Campbell, </em>706 F.2d 1138 (11th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Campbell, </em>the Eleventh Circuit reached a conclusion similar to that of the Second Circuit in its STA guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-4\">Campbell had been joined in a narcotics conspiracy action with several co-defendants. After 21 days had run on his 70-day clock, Campbell\u2019s co-defendants filed a series of motions to dismiss that resulted in STA exclusions for all defendants under sections (h)(7) and (h)(8). Four months later, the trial court granted these motions to dismiss, leaving Campbell as the sole defendant in the action. <em>Id. </em>at 1140-41. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-5\">Campbell maintained, as does Gallardo, that under the <em>Guidelines\u2019s </em>approach, his 70-day clock ran down to zero before the section (h)(8) (and also the section (h)(7))<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> exclusions began to take effect. Therefore, he claimed that the court\u2019s failure to begin his trial or grant a new continuance on the day after his co-defendants were dismissed \u2014 since that was when his 70-day clock began to run again \u2014 constituted an STA violation. The Eleventh Circuit rejected his claim and expressly rejected the <em>Guidelines </em>approach to computing excluda-ble delay for \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances. The court noted, as had the Second Circuit, that the \u201ctacking-on\u201d approach advocated in the <em>Guidelines </em>would routinely create situations, as in Campbell\u2019s case, where the government has only one day to bring a defendant to trial. <em>See id. </em>at 1142-43 &amp; n. 9.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-9\">\n<em>5. The Judicial Conference Guidelines</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-10\">The Judicial Conference <em>Guidelines </em>support Gallardo\u2019s position on the effect of the six \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances. Although this court generally looks to the <em>Guidelines </em>as a useful interpretation of the STA, in this case they plainly conflict with Congress\u2019s intent concerning the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision. Under such circumstances, we cannot be bound by them. <em>See United States v. Rush, </em>738 F.2d 497, 503-04 (1st Cir.1984) (noting that \u201c[t]he <em>Guidelines, </em>of -course, are not binding,\u201d especially when they appear to conflict with congressional intent), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1355, 84 L.Ed.2d 378 (1985); <em>United States v. Novak, </em>715 F.2d 810, 815 (3d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1293, 79 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>see also Guidelines </em>16 (indicating that this circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>724 F.2d 1452 (9th Cir.1984), does not follow the Guidelines\u2019s interpretation of section 3161(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-15\">We therefore reject the \u201ctacking-on\u201d approach to \u201cends of justice\u201d contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>uances contained in the <em>Guidelines, </em>and instead conclude that such continuances toll the STA\u2019s 70-day clock. As a result, the 70-day clock did not elapse in Gallardo\u2019s case, and the STA was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-4\">\n<em>C. The Granting of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth \u201cEnds of Justice\u201d Continuances.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-5\">As an alternative basis for affirming the dismissal of his indictment, Gallardo contends that the district court abused its discretion in granting the third, fourth, and fifth \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances, which provided excludable delay from April 19, 1983 to December 3, 1983. Gallardo maintains that each of these challenged continuances was granted \u201cbecause the [district court] magistrate had not [yet] ruled on Gallardo\u2019s pretrial motions which were filed on December 30, 1982.\u201d According to Gallardo, the magistrate had withdrawn all of Gallardo\u2019s pretrial motions from submission on February 2, 1983, probably \u201cdue to [his] workload,\u201d but also possibly for some other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-6\">Gallardo maintains that because the delay in addressing his pretrial motions was caused by the court\u2019s workload, and because this delay in turn necessitated the granting of the three \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances, the district court violated section 3161(h)(8)(C) of the STA, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1587-7\">No continuance under paragraph 8(A) of this subsection [the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision] shall be granted <em>because of general congestion of the court\u2019s calen-</em>dar____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1587-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(C) (emphasis added); <em>see Nance, </em>666 F.2d at 359. Gallardo contends that even if the withdrawal of his pretrial motions was not due to the magistrate\u2019s workload, there was still not a sufficient basis for the district court to grant the three challenged continuances. As a result, he maintains that the periods covered by these three continuances were not properly excluded from the STA\u2019s 70-day clock, and therefore, the 70-day period elapsed long before March 7, 1984, when the district court found the STA had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-11\">We reject Gallardo\u2019s challenge to the granting of the three continuances. Gallardo is correct in his assertion that a continuance granted simply \u201cbecause of general congestion of the court\u2019s calendar\u201d is not excludable under section 3161(h)(8). <em>Nance, </em>666 F.2d at 355-56 &amp; n. 4; <em>accord United States v. Perez-Reveles, </em>715 F.2d 1348, 1352 (9th Cir.1983); H.R.Rep. No. 1508, 93d Cong. 2d Sess. 22, <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 7401, 7415. However, this limitation applies only to continuances granted by courts in direct response to their own crowded dockets. <em>See, e.g., Nance, </em>666 F.2d at 359 (impermissible to exclude block of time \u201con the ground that three custody cases were set for trial before the court during that time\u201d); <em>United States v. New Buffalo Amusement Corp., </em>600 F.2d 368, 376 (2d Cir.1979) (impermissible to exclude two- and-one-half month period \u201c \u2018in the public interest\u2019 \u201d because of trial judge\u2019s \u201ccommitment to the trial of other cases\u201d during that time). It does not apply in cases like Gallardo\u2019s where the continuances are only indirectly attributable to the court\u2019s congestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-12\">The district court did not grant the three contested continuances on its own motion, or in direct response to its own calendar needs. It granted them in response to signed stipulations by both parties that they needed additional time to prepare for trial. The fact that these stipulations all referred to the pendency of Gallardo\u2019s pretrial motions as a reason the parties required more time for trial preparation does not indicate that the continuances were granted because of the court\u2019s congested calendar. In each case, had a continuance not been requested, the court would presumably have ruled on the pending motions on or prior to the trial date. If the parties then needed additional time for trial preparation, they presumably could have requested it at that time. The disputed continuances were at most only indirectly attributable to the court\u2019s scheduling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>problems. None of the district court\u2019s orders granting the continuances referred to the court\u2019s scheduling needs as a basis or justification: they were all premised upon reasons provided in section 3161(h)(8)(B), and were therefore fully in keeping with the requirements of the STA. <em>See Henderson, </em>746 F.2d at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-4\">Furthermore, Gallardo was the moving force behind the granting of each continuance that he is now challenging. In each case, Gallardo\u2019s counsel drafted the stipulations, initiated discussions with the government concerning the need for a continuance, and drafted the court\u2019s order granting the continuance. He therefore cannot maintain that these continuances give rise to an STA violation. <em>See Rush, </em>738 F.2d at 508 (\u201calthough defendants do not bear the primary responsibility for alerting the court to speedy trial deadlines, this does not mean that they may deliberately obtain an (h)(8) continuance for their own convenience ... and then later claim that the court abused its discretion in granting the requested continuance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-5\">Gallardo contends that under the <em>Guidelines, </em>a defendant cannot' be held to have \u201cwaived\u201d his rights under the STA. <em>See Guidelines </em>62-63. However, there has not been such a waiver in this case. The district court made all the required findings to grant the three \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances based on the representations made to it by the parties in their stipulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It found that \u201cdenial of [any of the three] continuance[s] ... would deny counsel [for both parties] the reasonable time necessary for effective trial preparation,\u201d and that therefore, \u201cthe ends of justice [would be] served by ... granting [the] continuance^].\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8). We conclude that these findings were not clearly erroneous. <em>Henderson, </em>746 F.2d at 624; <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>726 F.2d 510, 511-12 (9th Cir.1984); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A), (B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-9\">Since we conclude that the STA\u2019s 70-day clock did not elapse in Gallardo\u2019s case, and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the third, fourth, and fifth \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gal-lardo\u2019s indictment. Therefore, we need not reach the issues presented in Gallardo\u2019s separate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1579-16\">. Section 3161(c)(1) provides that: \"[T]he trial of a defendant ... shall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). Section 3161(h) lists eight different types of periods that are excluded from the 70-day time limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1580-13\">. Gallardo contends that this court could affirm the district court's dismissal of his indictment on an alternative ground: he claims that the district court improperly granted three continuances under the STA, and therefore, regardless of how excludable delay is computed under the STA, the 70-day period was exceeded in his case. We reject that claim. <em>See </em>Analysis, Section C, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1580-15\">Moreover, Gallardo has separately appealed the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his indictment without prejudice. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2). Because we rule that the STA was not violated in Gallardo\u2019s case, we need not decide whether the indictment should have been dismissed with or without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1581-7\">. The government's original indictment had charged Gallardo with bank embezzlement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 (1982), rather than with embezzlement from a savings and loan association, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 651.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AcS-\">. The district court appears to have been relying on this circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>724 F.2d 1452 (9th Cir.1984), which held that section 3161(c)(2) requires that a defendant be provided a minimum of 30 days for trial preparation from the filing of any superseding indictment containing new charges against him. <em>But cf. United States v. Adu, </em>770 F.2d 1511, 1513-14 (9th Cir.1985), (section 3161(c)(2)\u2019s 30-day requirement does not apply in cases where the superseding indictment only makes clerical changes in the prior indictment and does not affect the defendant\u2019s preparation for trial).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ad-dedup-0\">The district court\u2019s postponement of Gallar-do\u2019s scheduled trial date in order to satisfy section 3161(c)(2)\u2019s 30-day rule, whether or not completely necessary to satisfy that requirement, could possibly have been interpreted to constitute the granting of a seventh \"ends of justice\u201d continuance, had the district court made the findings required in \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A) when Gallardo brought his motion under the STA. <em>See United States v.

For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>the government to prevail, we must conclude that the granting of the six \"ends of justice\u201d continuances tolled the running of the STA\u2019s 70-day clock. <em>See </em>Analysis, Section B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1582-7\">.

Even though the district court ordered the government to make an election of counts in its first superseding indictment on January 20, 1984, the court did not dismiss that indictment, or require the filing of a superseding indictment. Therefore, the first condition of section 3161(d)(1) was not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"AR9e\">Moreover, under this circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>724 F.2d 1452 (9th Cir.1984), section 3161(d)(l)\u2019s use of the word \"thereafter\u201d indicates that it does not apply in cases where a superseding indictment is \u201cfiled <em>before </em>the [prior] indictment [is] dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1454 (emphasis original).

This issue has nothing to do with the validity or advisability of the six \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances, nor does it concern such - issues as whether \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances should be liberally or conservatively granted, or for what length of time they should be granted. All that is at stake is the method of computing excludable delay for continuances that have already been validly granted under the STA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1583-11\">. We acknowledge that either the government\u2019s approach for computing excludable delay for \"ends of justice\u201d continuances or the approach espoused by Gallardo and the <em>Guidelines </em>would be logically consistent and administrable. However, it is our responsibility to determine <em>what Congress intended </em>when it adopted the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision. We examine the provision\u2019s language and legislative history, along with several other considerations, in order to make that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1584-9\">. Of these seven provisions, all but one \u2014 section 3161(h)(6) \u2014 actually begin with the phrase \"any period of delay,\u201d whereas section 3161(h)(6) contains the phrase in its midst. The eighth provision, section 3161(h)(7), which relates to the joinder of co-defendants, begins with the phrase \"[a] reasonable period of delay.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1585-7\">. Arguably, under the <em>Guidelines </em>approach, courts could still schedule trial a day or two before the end of the continuance period in order to be safe, but \"padding\" the length of the continuance in this way may violate the spirit of what is required under section (h)(8)(A). <em>See United States v. Janik, </em>723 F.2d 537, 543 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1586-6\">. A number of court decisions contain passing references to \"tolling\u201d or \"carving out\u201d time for \"ends of justice\" continuances that appear to support the conclusion that these continuances toll the running of the STA\u2019s 70-day clock. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

However, with the exception of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Campbell, </em>none of these decisions has directly addressed the issue of whether an \u201cends of justice\u201d continuance tolls or is tacked-on to the STA\u2019s 70-day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"AWZU\">.

The Eleventh Circuit also noted that \u2018\u2018[r]ather than requiring one single approach to the (h)(8) calculation, as the Guidelines suggest, we think it preferable to permit the trial court to exercise its discretion, based on the particular facts of each case, and determine when an (h)(8) exclusion should begin and end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1143. However, this analysis seems flawed. As the <em>Campbell </em>court itself indicated, the STA was intended in large part to foster predictability in the scheduling of criminal trials, <em>see id. </em>at 1142 n. 9, and therefore, authorizing courts to change the rules in every case seems to defeat the STA\u2019s purpose. Moreover, trial courts will have broad discretion to manage the scheduling of cases regardless of how excludable delay is computed: as long as these courts retain the right to grant \u201cends of justice\u201d continuances, they will be able to adapt to the needs of individual cases, and the method of computing delay will only alter the timing of when they will need to grant continuances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1588-20\">. There is a significant difference between a defendant\u2019s having \"waived\u201d his rights under the STA, which implies that the court did not undertake to determine independently whether the STA\u2019s requirements were satisfied before it granted the continuance, and the situation in the present case, where the court relied upon the representations of Gallardo\u2019s counsel, but then performed a full-scale \u201cends of justice\" analysis under the STA before granting the continuances.</p>\n<p id=\"Avnp\">The <em>Guidelines </em>only state that \u201d[i]t would be inconsistent to permit a defendant, through a purported \u2018waiver,\u2019 to relieve the court of this obligation [of balancing the different factors and considerations listed in section 3161(h)(8) ].\u2019\u2019 <em>Guidelines, </em>63.
