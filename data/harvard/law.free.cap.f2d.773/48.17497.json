Count 1 of Indictment No. 84-99 charged that Matthews and Frank Lentino together with unindicted co-conspirators conspired to commit extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (1982). Counts 2, 3, and 4 charged independent Hobbs Act violations; count 5 charged Matthews with a Travel Act violation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 (1982). Matthews entered a not guilty plea to all five counts of Indictment No. 84-99 on April 13, 1984. Indictment No. 84-150, filed May 15, 1984, charged Matthews with three counts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act. Both indictments resulted from investigations into Matthews\u2019s conduct during his tenures as Mayor and as Atlantic City\u2019s Commissioner and Director of Revenue and Finance.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">On November 27, 1984, after four weeks of trial before a jury, Matthews retracted his plea of not guilty to count 4 of Indictment No. 84-99 and entered into a plea agreement whereby the government agreed to dismiss all remaining counts of the two indictments. Count 4 charged that Matthews willfully committed extortion by obtaining $25,000 from Piedmont, an FBI-created real estate development group, under color of official right, in exchange for a bargain sale of Atlantic City, property zoned for casino use.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">This case arises from Matthews\u2019s subsequent sentence under that plea by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for violating the Hobbs Act, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. The district court sentenced Matthews to 15 years incarceration and a $10,-000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">Under the plea agreement, the government agreed not to take any position with respect to the court\u2019s determination of sentence, but reserved the right to inform the sentencing court about \u201cthe government\u2019s evidence of the nature and extent of Matthews\u2019s activities with respect to this case; and all other facts favorable and otherwise in its possession relevant to sentence.\u201d Supplemental Appendix for Appellee at 1-2. Although Matthews\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement agencies was not a part of the plea agreement, the government also reserved the right to advise the sentencing court that Matthews\u2019s lack of cooperation should be considered in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">Prior to sentencing, the government submitted a sentencing memorandum containing the government\u2019s version of the offense. Matthews moved to strike portions of the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum, or in the alternative, to withdraw his plea agreement. The sole matter in the presentence report controverted by defense counsel was the government\u2019s evidence of Matthews\u2019s organized crime ties. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(3)(D)(ii), the court assured the defendant that it would not consider those allegations concerning organized crime in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">Matthews raises two issues on appeal: (1) that the district court erred in failing to abide by its stated intention not to consider certain portions of the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum in imposing sentence; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>and (2) that the district court abused its discretion by imposing an excessive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Defendant alleges that the district court short-circuited the sentencing process by promising not to consider the organized crime connections simply to avoid a separate hearing on these matters, suggesting that the district court later ignored its promise to strike the controverted material. Matthews fails to offer any clear evidence of judicial misconduct to support these allegations, however. Indeed, Matthews\u2019s sole basis for his position is the length of his sentence and the district court\u2019s comments to Matthews when it imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Defense counsel did not seek a <em>F\u00f3tico </em>hearing, <em>see United States v. Fatico, </em>603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1073, 100 S.Ct. 1018, 62 L.Ed.2d 755 (1980), to test the government\u2019s evidence of Matthews\u2019s ties to organized crime. Defendant apparently believes that a district court must hold a <em>Fatieo </em>hearing whenever there is a <em>possibility </em>that it might rely upon disputed matters in sentencing. We reject this contention. Where, as in the instant case, defendant had an adequate opportunity to examine and correct controverted information and request an evidentiary hearing, the error is counsel\u2019s and not the court\u2019s. <em>Cf. United States v. Robin, </em>545 F.2d 775 (2d Cir.1976) (district court\u2019s failure to afford defendant an adequate opportunity to examine presentence report reversible error). Counsel cannot ask this court to vacate his client\u2019s sentence when counsel failed to make a proper request for an evidentiary hearing as to the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Recognizing that his assertion that the district court improperly relied upon Matthews\u2019s organized crime connections in passing sentence is \u201clargely circumstantial,\u201d appellant nevertheless suggests that an inference that Matthews\u2019s due process rights were violated may be gleaned from the district court\u2019s comments when imposing sentence. A district court cannot accept a guilty plea without \u201cfirst, by addressing the defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement.\u201d Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11(d). Matthews admitted his guilt in a manner later characterized by the district court as more of a press release containing a lot of \u201chot air\u201d than an ordinary guilty plea. The district court also admonished Matthews about his demeanor on the stand while he made his Rule 11 statement, contrasting Matthews\u2019s debonair appearance and exploitation of his offices with former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia\u2019s dishevelled attire and impeccable public service. Finally, appellant identifies the district court\u2019s remarks concerning the money that Matthews could expect \u201cdown the road\u201d from his misdeeds as confirming the use of impermissible information in passing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">In this circuit, the test to evaluate whether a sentence has been based on criteria violative of a defendant\u2019s due process right is two-fold: (1) has misinformation of a constitutional magnitude been given to the district court; and (2) has that misinformation been given specific consideration by the sentencing judge? <em>United States v. Janiec, </em>464 F.2d 126, 129 (3d Cir.1972); <em>see United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446-47, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591-92, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); <em>Townsend v. Burke, </em>334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948). This court need not address whether the organized crime allegations constitute misinformation because the sentencing judge specifically declined to consider them. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>494 F.2d 1216, 1218 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 852, 95 S.Ct. 94, 42 L.Ed.2d 83 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">With respect to the district court\u2019s comment about the amount of anticipated money from future payoffs, there was no showing that the court relied on any misinformation. Factual matters considered as a basis for sentence must have \u201csome minimal indicium of reliability beyond mere allegation\u201d and must \u201ceither alone or in the context of other available information, bear some rational relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ship-to the decision to impose a particular sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Baylin, </em>696 F.2d 1030, 1040 (3d Cir.1982). <em>See also Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707, 713 (2d Cir.1978) (reliability must be ensured through cross-examination or otherwise). The evidence of defendant\u2019s anticipated profits more than satisfies this reliability requirement. The court heard tape recordings of the defendant\u2019s words and testimony about the defendant\u2019s confession, both subject to thorough cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion by noting that Matthews\u2019s prepared Rule 11(d) statement contained a lot of \u201chot air.\u201d Matthews\u2019s statement attempted to limit the extent of his greed, denied making a confession to the FBI, and declared that his real motive in taking the bribe was not personal gain, but to help provide affordable housing for Atlantic City\u2019s lower income citizens. We note that testimony over the four weeks of trial directly contradicts each of these assertions. Thus, the district court\u2019s consideration of evidence contradicting Matthews\u2019s altruistic protests is entirely proper under <em>Baylin </em>\u2019s reliability prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Assuming that the district court relied upon information reflected in its challenged comments, we find that these matters more than meet Baylin\u2019s relevancy prong. The trial judge\u2019s comments about Matthews\u2019s expected fortunes illuminate the gravity of the public corruption crime admitted by appellant. Observations concerning Matthews\u2019s demeanor and the nature of his Rule 11(d) speech evidence a lack of contrition and cooperation on appellant\u2019s part. The use of these factual matters in imposing sentence falls completely within the scope of the district court\u2019s authority. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3577 (1982) (no limit on information covering \u201cbackground, character, and conduct\u201d of a person which may be considered for imposing sentence); <em>Baylin, </em>696 F.2d at 1038-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Matthews\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion by imposing an excessive sentence also fails. It is well settled that the district court has virtually unfettered discretion in imposing a sentence if it falls within the statutory limits. <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 357, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 593 (1977). <em>See also United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. at 443, 447, 92 S.Ct. at 591, 592 (the sentence imposed by a federal district judge, if within the statutory limits, is generally not subject to review); <em>United States v. Felder, </em>744 F.2d 18, 20 (3d Cir.1984) (absent procedural defects, reviewing court will not interfere with trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion if sentence falls within the statutory limitation); <em>accord United States v. Dickens, </em>695 F.2d 765, 782 n. 26 (3d Cir.1982), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1092, 103 S.Ct. 1792, 76 L.Ed.2d 359 (1983); <em>United States v. Del Piano, </em>593 F.2d 539, 540 (3d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 944, 99 S.Ct. 2889, 61 L.Ed.2d 315 (1979); <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Richardson, </em>498 F.2d 892 (3d Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The Hobbs Act provides for a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 for each violation. A fifteen year sentence and a $10,000 fine falls well within the statutory maximum. Defendant\u2019s surprise that a plea bargain results in a prison term within the statutory limits does not constitute abuse of discretion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
