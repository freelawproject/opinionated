The district court granted the motion to appeal in forma pauperis but did not rule on the motion for certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">We remand to the district court for entry of an order on the motion for certificate of probable cause, but retain jurisdiction of this case pending receipt of such an order. <em>See Clements v. Wainwright, </em>648 F.2d 979, 980 and n. 2 (5th Cir.1981); and <em>Fabian v. Reed, </em>707 F.2d 147 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
