He challenges three rulings by the trial court: (1) admitting testimony that following his arrest, Valencia refused to sign a form waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights; (2) permitting a DEA agent to testify concerning his interpretation of the word \u201cpaperwork\u201d as it was used in a monitored telephone conversation involving Valencia; and (3) delivering its primary charge to the jury, including its instruction concerning the presumption of innocence, <em>prior </em>to the closing arguments by counsel. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-15\">On September 4, 1983, Joseph Cusanelli, Larry Fuls, and four other men were arrested at the Van Ness Holiday Inn in San Francisco when they attempted to sell 50 kilograms of cocaine to undercover FBI and DEA agents for $2,725,000. After the arrest, Cusanelli identified Valencia as the source of the cocaine. Valencia was arrested later that same day at the Travelodge near San Francisco\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-16\">Cusanelli testified in great detail concerning a series of cocaine transactions in which Valencia, who resides in Florida, allegedly supplied large quantities of cocaine to Cusanelli and Fuls for distribution in their cocaine trafficking operation on the West Coast. The September 4, 1983 attempted sale was the last and by far the largest in this series of transactions. Although Cusanelli\u2019s credibility was challenged because he had entered into a favorable plea agreement with the government, his testimony was fully corroborated by telephone, airline, and hotel records confirming that Valencia had traveled to California and contacted Cusanelli and Fuls at all the critical times when Cusanelli maintained the transactions occurred. It was also supported by the ledger Fuls and Cu-sanelli maintained in their cocaine trafficking business, which reflected all the transactions that Cusanelli claimed had occurred, although it did not contain Valencia\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-17\">Moreover, on the day he was arrested, Valencia had on his person Fuls\u2019s current home and business telephone numbers, along with a home telephone number for Fuls that was four months out of date, and three telephone numbers for Cusanelli\u2014 two in Florida and one in California. He had placed two separate calls to Fuls and Cusanelli just hours after the sale of the 50 kilograms was scheduled to occur. After the attempted sale occurred and Cusanelli was arrested, Cusanelli made a monitored telephone call to Valencia at the Travel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>odge and said to him \u201c[w]e\u2019re done,\u201d and Valencia responded that he wanted to \u201csee ... the paperwork and everything\u201d; Cusa-nelli testified at trial that he and Valencia always used the term \u201cpaperwork\u201d in their telephone discussions as a code word to signify money. DEA Special Agent Neal Van Horn also testified at trial, over Valencia\u2019s objection,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the term \u201cpaperwork\u201d is commonly used by individuals involved in narcotics transactions to refer to money. Valencia\u2019s girlfriend, who was sharing a room with him at the Travelodge, testified that at the time he was arrested, Valencia was waiting to meet Cusanelli because Valencia \u201cwas supposed to get some money from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">At trial, FBI Special Agent Thomas Car-lon testified that following Valencia\u2019s arrest, Carlon requested Valencia to sign a standard waiver form enumerating his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but Valencia refused. However, according to Carlon, Valencia then made a series of exculpatory statements, commenting that he \u201cwasn\u2019t involved in any cocaine trafficking and ... had merely come to San Francisco to sightsee,\u201d and that he had called his girlfriend in Los Angeles, who joined him in San Francisco. Valencia objected to Carlon\u2019s testimony about the waiver form, contending that it constituted \u201can impermissible comment on [Valencia\u2019s] assertion of constitutional rights after arrest [and] serv[ed] no relevant purpose whatsoever.\u201d The government maintains that it introduced Carlon\u2019s testimony merely to \u201clay[] the foundation for the admissibility of [Valencia\u2019s] subsequent statements to Carlon\u201d; the government was seeking to establish that Valencia had been informed of his rights and to \u201canticipate[ ] an argument by defense counsel [which was never made] that having failed to sign the form[, Valencia] had, in fact, invoked his right to remain silent.\u201d The trial court overruled Valencia\u2019s objection, and admitted Carlon\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">Following the presentation of all the evidence at Valencia\u2019s trial, but prior to closing arguments by counsel, the trial court delivered its primary charge to the jury concerning the elements of the crimes with which Valencia was charged and the principles of reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof. After the closing arguments, the court did not repeat these instructions in their entirety, but merely explained the mechanics of how the jury should deliberate and arrive at its verdict. Valencia did not object at the time, but now claims that the trial court\u2019s actions violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d He claims that it was prejudicial for \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s closing rebuttal argument ... [to be] the last impression left with the jury\u201d before they began their deliberations, rather than the court\u2019s instructions concerning the applicable law and the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">In his appeal, Valencia challenges the admission of Carlon\u2019s testimony about Valencia\u2019s refusal to sign the <em>Miranda </em>-waiver form, the admission of Van Horn\u2019s testimony about Valencia\u2019s use of the word \u201cpaperwork\u201d in his telephone discussion with Cusanelli, and the timing of the trial court\u2019s primary charge to the jury. We agree with Valencia that the trial court erred in permitting Carlon\u2019s testimony concerning Valencia\u2019s refusal to sign the <em>Miranda </em>-waiver form. However, we conclude that in light of the extremely strong and detailed case against Valencia, that error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and therefore does not provide a basis for reversal. We find the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>errors claimed by Valencia to be, at most, harmless, and therefore affirm Valencia\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">\n<em>1. Testimony Concerning Valencia\u2019s Refusal To Sign The Waiver Form '</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">The Supreme Court and this court have consistently held that \u201cit is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his fifth amendment privilege [to remain silent] when he is under police custodial interrogation,\u201d and that as a result, prosecutors \u201cmay not ... use at trial the fact that [a defendant] stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1625 n. 37, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); <em>accord, United States v. Branson, </em>756 F.2d 752, 753-54 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Quigg v. Crist, </em>616 F.2d 1107, 1110 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 922, 101 S.Ct. 323, 66 L.Ed.2d 150 (1980); <em>United States v. Wycoff, </em>545 F.2d 679, 681 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1105, 97 S.Ct. 1135, 51 L.Ed.2d 556 (1977); <em>Scarborough v. Arizona, </em>531 F.2d 959, 961 (9th Cir.1976). \u201c[T]he probative value of [a defendant\u2019s] pretrial silence ... [is generally] outweighed by the prejudicial impact of admitting it into evidence,\u201d <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 173, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 2135, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975); \u201cevery post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous,\u201d and therefore is of \u201clittle probative force,\u201d yet it carries with it a \u201cstrong negative inference\u201d that the defendant is guilty. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2244, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 176, 180, 95 S.Ct. at 2136, 2138. Moreover, it is unfair and misleading for police officers arresting a suspect to inform him of his right to remain silent under <em>Miranda, </em>if there is no \u201cassurance that [his] silence will carry no penalty.\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 617-18, 96 S.Ct. at 2244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">Accordingly, it violates due process for a prosecutor to impeach a defendant\u2019s exculpatory story at trial by cross-examining him concerning his silence when he was arrested and received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. at 2241, 2245. \u201cIn a criminal prosecution, it is an error of constitutional proportions to admit evidence that a defendant chose to exercise the right to remain silent after arrest.\u201d <em>Quigg, </em>616 F.2d at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">We have maintained in a number of cases that \u201cdeclining to sign a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form [is equivalent to] an assertion of the right to silence____\u201d <em>United States v. Boyce, </em>594 F.2d 1246, 1250 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 855, 100 S.Ct. 112, 62 L.Ed.2d 73 (1979); <em>accord United States v. Heldt, </em>745 F.2d 1275, 1278 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Wycoff, </em>545 F.2d at 681.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A defendant\u2019s refusal to sign a waiver-of-rights form, such as the one Carlon asked Valencia to sign, cannot be introduced into evidence if the defendant remains silent while in custody. <em>See Wycoff, </em>545 F.2d at 681; <em>United States v. Bridwell, </em>583 F.2d 1135, 1138-39 (10th Cir.1978) (concluding that admission of testimony on this subject \u201cconstituted a clear infringement on defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Wycoff, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>an agent testified that when he arrested the defendant, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and presented him with a waiver form, the defendant \u201crefused to sign\u201d and \u201csaid he would rather talk to an attorney\u201d \u2014testimony not unlike Carlon\u2019s in the present case. We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-5\">[b]y eliciting such testimony, the government put before the jury the fact that appellant remained silent and requested an attorney. The natural tendency of the use of the testimony in this manner is to prejudice the defendant by attempting to create an inference of guilt in the jury\u2019s mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">545 F.2d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">In <em>Wycoff, </em>we admonished the government that we were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-8\">concerned and alarmed about the increasing attempts by government counsel in this circuit to make reference to or elicit testimony regarding an accused\u2019s silence at the time of arrest. Government counsel are on the verge of the precipice and jeopardizing solid cases by such prac-tice____ In future cases government counsel must scrupulously avoid all reference to or use of an accused\u2019s assertion of his right to remain silent or his right to counsel except where permitted by established rules of law. The conduct here, though we cannot know that it was maliciously deliberate, was reprehensible nevertheless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">545 F.2d at 682; <em>see also Bridwell, </em>583 F.2d at 1139 (expressing \u201cconcern over the seriousness of the error [in admitting testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s refusal to sign a waiver form] at trial\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-15\">The only exception to the proscription against testimony that defendants have invoked their <em>Miranda </em>rights following arrest is recognized in cases where shortly after invoking their rights, defendants have confessed or made incriminating statements. <em>See United States v. Two Bulls, 577 </em>F.2d 63, 66 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (testimony concerning defendants\u2019 exercise of their <em>Miranda </em>rights can only be admitted into evidence \u201c[i]n certain atypical situations,\u201d but such a situation is presented when the defendant has made \u201ca later inculpatory statement\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 931, 99 S.Ct. 322, 58 L.Ed.2d 326 (1978). In such cases, the prosecution must establish that the confession or incriminating statement was made voluntarily before it can be admitted into evidence, and the jury is expected to consider evidence on the issue of voluntariness in determining what weight to give to the confession. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>Thus, testimony indicating that a defendant fully understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and freely exercised them prior to making a confession is relevant foundation evidence that the jury should be permitted to consider. Moreover, if a defendant has already confessed or has made other incriminating statements, he will not be significantly prejudiced by testimony that he invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to making those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Thus, in this limited set of eases, this court and others have permitted testimony that a defendant exercised his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See United States v. Masters, </em>612 F.2d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir.1979) (permitting testimony that defendant had \u201cexpress[ed] ... his intention to remain silent during Customs questioning\u201d in order to demonstrate that his subsequent incriminating statements were made voluntarily), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 847, 101 S.Ct. 134, 66 L.Ed.2d 57 (1980); <em>United States v. De La Luz Gallegos, </em>738 F.2d 378, 383 (10th Cir.) (admitting testimony that defendant requested an attorney prior to making unsolicited, self-incriminating statements to law enforcement officials, because \u201c[t]he knowing exercise of defendant\u2019s right to consult with an attorney before answering questions may refute the inference that any later statement made was involuntary\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 574, 83 L.Ed.2d 514 (1984); <em>Two Bulls, </em>577 F.2d at 66 (permitting testimony that after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, defendant who later made inculpatory statements initially refused to give a statement, on grounds that \u201cthe knowing exercise of the privilege to remain silent may refute an inference that a later statement was involuntary\u201d and that testimony concerning defendant\u2019s temporary silence constituted \u201crelevant evidence on the issue of voluntariness\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">However, when the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements are <em>exculpatory </em>or <em>innocuous, </em>as in Valencia\u2019s case, voluntariness is simply not an issue. In such cases, there is nothing to indicate that the defendant\u2019s statements were involuntarily made, and the defendant does not oppose their admission into evidence. Thus, testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights is not probative, although it is potentially highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">Unlike cases where the defendant has subsequently made inculpatory statements, in cases like Valencia\u2019s, where the defendant has made only exculpatory or innocuous statements, <em>Miranda </em>-related testimony will be far <em>more </em>prejudicial than the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements: it is the only evidence creating an inference that the defendant is guilty. <em>See Wycoff, </em>545 F.2d at 681 (testimony about waiver form \u201cereate[s] an inference of guilt in the jury\u2019s mind\u201d). As a result, the potential prejudicial impact of the <em>Miranda </em>-related testimony will far outweigh any possible probative value such testimony could have. <em>See Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 173, 95 S.Ct. at 2135 (probative value of defendant\u2019s exercise of <em>Miranda </em>rights is outweighed by the prejudicial impact of admitting it into evidence). We therefore hold that the. admission of such testimony violates due process. The district court erred in admitting agent Car-Ion\u2019s testimony that Valencia refused to sign the <em>Miranda </em>-waiver form.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>\n<em>2. Valencia\u2019s Remaining Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Valencia\u2019s two remaining claims are largely without merit. The testimony by agent Van Horn concerning the meaning of the word \u201cpaperwork\u201d during Valencia\u2019s monitored conversation with Cusanelli was merely cumulative: Cusanelli had previously testified that the two men always used the term to signify money in their telephone conversations. As a result, Van Horn\u2019s testimony provided, at most, indirect corroboration for Cusanelli\u2019s testimony. Moreover, in his cross-examination of agent Van Horn, Valencia\u2019s attorney skillfully extracted a series of concessions from Van Horn that Cusanelli and Valencia could have been referring to a variety of items when they used the word \u201cpaperwork,\u201d including financial documents; Valencia\u2019s counsel also had ample opportunity to dispute Van Horn\u2019s prof erred interpretation in his closing argument. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>519 F.2d 516, 521 (9th Cir.1975); <em>United States v. McCoy, </em>539 F.2d 1050, 1062 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 919, 97 S.Ct. 2185, 53 L.Ed.2d 230 (1977). Thus, even if there was not sufficient foundation for agent Van Horn to testify as an expert or lay witness concerning the terminology customarily employed in cocaine transactions, <em>see United States v. Fleishman, </em>684 F.2d 1329, 1335-36 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1044, 103 S.Ct. 464, 74 L.Ed.2d 614 (1982); <em>see also United States v. Rogers, </em>769 F.2d 1418, 1425 (9th Cir.1985), we conclude that his testimony concerning the term \u201cpaperwork\u201d did not prejudice Valencia\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Valencia\u2019s claim that the timing of the trial court\u2019s primary charge to the jury violated Federal Rule 30 is also without merit. This court has held that a trial court\u2019s violation of Rule 30 constitutes reversible error only if it results in actual prejudice to the defendant. <em>See United States v. McCown, </em>711 F.2d 1441, 1452 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Abushi, </em>682 F.2d 1289, 1303 (9th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Harvill, </em>501 F.2d 295, 296-97 (9th Cir.1974). In the present case, Valencia does not contend that the trial court\u2019s instructions were \u201cmisleading or inadequate\u201d in any way, <em>United States v. Pazsint, </em>703 F.2d 420, 424 (9th Cir.1983), or that they omitted any essential information; his challenge is based exclusively upon the time at which they were given. Valencia does not contend that his counsel\u2019s argument would have been any different had it been delivered <em>prior </em>to the trial court\u2019s primary charge to the jury. Moreover, in its final instructions to the jury, following the parties\u2019 closing arguments, the trial court reiterated the principle that the burden was on the government to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. As a result, even though the timing of the district court\u2019s primary charge did not comply with Rule 30,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that this resulted in actual prejudice to Valencia.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">\n<em>3. Harmless-Error Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-12\">Although the district court erred in permitting agent Carlon to testify concerning Valencia\u2019s refusal to sign the <em>Miranda-</em>waiver form, and although such an error will in many cases require reversal of a conviction, in light of the powerful oral testimony and documentary evidence linking Valencia to the Fuls-Cusanelli cocaine conspiracy, we conclude that the error in this case was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>Wycoff </em>545 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>682; <em>Bridwell, </em>583 F.2d at 1139. Moreover, even were we to assume that the district court also erred in admitting agent Van Horn\u2019s testimony concerning the use of the term \u201cpaperwork\u201d in the telephone conversation between Valencia and Cusa-nelli, our conclusion would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">. On appeal, Valencia challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of Agent Van Horn\u2019s testimony, contending that the testimony transformed a seemingly innocuous conversation involving a word that has a number of common meanings into a coded conversation about narcotics. He argues that this was extremely prejudicial, and that the jury should have been permitted to listen to the recorded conversation and formulate their own conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AOG\">. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 provides that \"... the [trial] court shall instruct the jury <em>after </em>the [closing] arguments are completed.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">. In light of our decision in <em>Heldt, </em>agent Car-Ion\u2019s description of his interview with Valencia suggests that Valencia\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights may have been violated during the questioning session. Carlon testified that after Valencia refused to sign the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form, he acted \"noncommittal\u201d about speaking with Carlon, but subsequently answered a few of Carlon\u2019s questions. Under <em>Heldt, </em>once Valencia had refused to sign the waiver form, the \u201d[i]nvestigat-ing officers should clearly inform the accused that his failure to sign the waiver does not prevent statements he makes from being used against him.\u201d 745 F.2d at 1278-79. There is no indication in the record that Carlon conveyed this information to Valencia. Moreover, to the extent that Valencia intended to invoke his right to remain silent, Carlon should not have continued to question him about the charges on which he had been arrested. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Diaz, </em>630 F.2d 661, 664-65 (9th Cir.1980) (holding, however, that law enforcement officers can continue to question suspect \u201cfor the limited purpose of clarifying whether the defendant is invoking his right to remain silent or has changed his mind regarding an earlier assertion of the right\u201d). Since all the statements Valencia made to Carlon were exculpatory, there is no need to suppress them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AFrn\">. In <em>Bridwell, </em>the defendant was initially questioned at his office in a non-custodial situation, and voluntarily answered a number of questions. Sometime later, a government agent in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>formed the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked if he would sign a form waiving those rights; the defendant refused and subsequently made no further statements to the authorities. 583 F.2d at 1138. The defendant remained silent during the entire period of his custodial interrogation as defined under <em>Miranda. </em>As a result, his refusal to sign the waiver form was totally separate from the statements he made to law enforcement personnel, and could shed no light upon the voluntariness or veracity of those statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">. A number of courts have suggested that law enforcement officials are always permitted to testify on direct examination concerning the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s arrest and the fact that he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the time. <em>See United States v. Whitley, </em>734 F.2d 1129, 1135 (6th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Jonas, </em>639 F.2d 200, 205 (5th Cir.1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>578 F.2d 1058, 1073 (5th Cir.1978), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>446 U.S. 956, 100 S.Ct. 2928, 64 L.Ed.2d 815 (1980). As the Sixth Circuit has indicated, \"testimony on direct examination by a government witness that a defendant had been given the <em>Miranda </em>rights, followed by neither questions as to what defendant said nor by testimony concerning that defendant\u2019s failure to make statements after the giving of said rights, does not constitute improper comment upon that defendant\u2019s right to remain silent,\u2019\u2019 and therefore would not provide a basis for reversal. <em>Whitley, </em>734 F.2d at 1135 (citations omitted); <em>accord Jonas, </em>639 F.2d at 205 &amp; n. 8; <em>Warren, 578 </em>F.2d at 1073; <em>but see United States v. Two Bulls, </em>577 F.2d 63, 66 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (\"[T]he detailed conversation relating to <em>Miranda </em>warnings ordinarily ought not be admitted into evidence if no statement is given.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 931, 99 S.Ct. 322, 58 L.Ed.2d 326 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1123-17\">. Section 3501 provides that if the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s confession is at issue, the trial judge must determine, out of jury\u2019s presence, that the confession was voluntarily made; once he has made such a determination, he \"shall permit the jury to hear relevant evidence on the issue of voluntariness.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501. If the defendant does not contest the voluntariness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>of his confession, the trial court is not required to conduct a hearing on the issue out of the presence of the jury. <em>See United States v. Ya-mashita, 527 </em>F.2d 954, 955 (9th Cir.1975) (per curiam). Nevertheless, the prosecution is entitled to present testimony on the voluntariness issue so that the jury can determine the weight to give to the confession. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">. In both <em>Wycoff </em>and <em>Bridwell, </em>the district courts gave forceful cautionary instructions to the jury immediately after the testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s refusal to sign the <em>Mi</em>randa-waiver form, and in <em>Wycoff, </em>the trial judge gave a similar instruction in his final charge. <em>See Wycoff, </em>545 F.2d at 681-82; <em>Brid-well, </em>583 F.2d at 1138-39. The trial judge\u2019s decision in the present case not to give such an instruction may have been a tactical choice to avoid focussing the jury\u2019s attention on agent Carlon's potentially impermissible testimony. <em>See generally Branson, </em>756 F.2d at 753 (defendant chooses not to object to avoid focussing jury\u2019s attention on his silence). We need not evaluate this tactical decision in light of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>conclusion that the admission of Carlon\u2019s testimony was harmless error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">. We note in passing that if a district court wants to deliver its primary charge to the jury prior to closing arguments by counsel, the best and most simple approach for it to follow is to obtain a stipulation signed by both parties agreeing to this procedure and waiving any possible Rule 30 claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1125-13\">. The one case cited by Valencia in which a district court was reversed for the \"timing\u201d of its jury instructions, <em>United States v. Dilg, </em>700 F.2d 620 (11th Cir.1983), involved a trial in which the district court never technically instructed the jury concerning the presumption of innocence once it had been officially constituted; it only read such an instruction prior to jury selection. <em>Id. </em>at 621-22, 624-25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
