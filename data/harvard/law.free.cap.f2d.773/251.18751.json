Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the standard of review is \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d <em>see Van Bourg, Allen, Weinberg &amp; Roger v. NLRB, </em>751 F.2d 982, 984 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam), we find that the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. The only evidence that might tend to show a possible invasion of privacy consists of statements by two USDA administrators that on unspecified occasions in the past two USDA undercover agents were mildly harrassed when their identities were released. The administrators also admitted that during the most recent fiscal year the identities of 146 undercover agents were released with no apparent adverse consequences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-0k\">The Government\u2019s petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
