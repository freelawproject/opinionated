The principal legal issues presented are whether supplementary evidentiary hearings were required at the compliance filing stage; whether the compliance filing diverged from the underlying order and, if so, whether such divergence renders Commission approval invalid; and whether the filed schedules set forth the practices affecting CEI\u2019s rates in the degree of detail the law and regulations require.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-15\">CEI, a public utility regulated under the Federal Power Act, ch. 285, 41 Stat. 1077 (1920) (codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791a-828c (1982)), may change the rates, terms and conditions under which it supplies power to Cleveland only in accordance with \u00a7 205 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d, requiring changes to be submitted for Commission approval before they can become effective. Section 205(c) requires the filing and approval to embrace not merely the rates, but also the \u201cpractices ... affecting such rates,\u201d which include, of course, practices affecting the electrical service for which the rates are charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-16\">An understanding of the current controversy requires appreciation of two underlying facts: First, that it is no more possible to set forth <em>all </em>of the practices affecting rates and services than it is to set forth <em>all </em>of the terms and conditions of a contract, leaving nothing whatever to be implied or to be governed by an unspecified standard of reasonableness. In the normal situation of ongoing purchase-sale relationships between utilities and their customers the specification of minor practices is not often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>the subject of dispute. The second underlying fact causes the present case not to be the normal situation \u2014 to wit, the hostile relationship of these two reluctant commercial partners, reflected by the following statement in the City\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-5\">In the City of Cleveland, City\u2019s municipal electric system and CEI are in vigorous competition for residential, commercial and industrial customers. CEI\u2019s objective of many years standing is the destruction of the City\u2019s system and with it the competitive threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">Brief for Petitioner at 13 n. 8. As a consequence, neither the City nor, as we shall see, the Commission, was willing to leave as many practices unspecified as is ordinarily the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">The present dispute began on November 19, 1982, when CEI submitted a proposal that would, <em>inter alia, </em>change the terms and conditions under which emergency and firm power service would be made available to the city, effectively eliminating the availability of short-term and limited-term power service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., </em>22 F.E.R.C. (CCH) H 61,016, at 61,030-31 (Jan. 18, 1983). The Commission accepted CEI\u2019s submittal for filing on January 18, 1983, suspended the operation of the new rate schedule for five months, and granted Cleveland\u2019s request for intervention and for an expedited hearing on the issue of the terms and conditions of CEI\u2019s service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 61,031-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-8\">In the hearings, CEI altered its position, offering to continue short-term and limited-term service, but subject to a number of terms and conditions. One was that the service would be provided \u201conly when in the sole judgment of the supplying party it is available.\u201d The administrative law judge rejected this condition, though similar provisions were contained in rate schedules governing service to other CEI customers. In its place, he ruled that the schedule should provide for the services to be furnished when \u201creasonably available,\u201d and for a written statement of reasons to be given when services are denied or curtailed. <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., </em>23 F.E.R.C. (CCH) 1163,055, at 65,197, 65,198 (May 9, 1983) (\u201cAU Decision\u201d). In Opinion No. 172, the Commission agreed with the AU that, in light of the \u201ccompetition between and antipathy of the parties,\u201d it would not constitute discrimination to require a \u201creasonably available\u201d provision instead of the \u201csole judgment\u201d clause used by CEI elsewhere. <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., </em>23 F.E.R.C. (CCH) H 61,-380, at 61,808 (June 16, 1983) (\u201cOpinion No. 172\u201d). At the suggestion of its staff and with the approval of Cleveland, the Commission made the AU\u2019s \u201cstatement of reasons\u201d requirement more specific, providing for \u201cestimates of loads, capacities and other relevant data by means of which the reserving or purchasing party can assess the availability of such power or need for curtailment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,806. Another of CEI\u2019s proposed conditions provided that \u201cservice shall be dispatched in the same manner as is done currently.\u201d AU Decision at 65,198. The AU rejected this as \u201cunacceptably vague,\u201d <em>id., </em>and prescribed instead a provision that would require Cleveland to provide CEI a schedule of the amount of power to be delivered throughout the sales period, and would permit Cleveland to make changes in that schedule at any time, including increases. He stated that this was \u201cconsistent with the manner in which CEI scheduled and dispatched power to Painesville [another of CEI\u2019s customers] during the past year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Opinion No. 172, the Commission rejected Cleveland\u2019s proposal that there be added to this requirement approximately two pages of detailed scheduling and dispatching pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>cedures which the City asserted represented current practices, finding no support in the record for that contention. It accepted instead CEI\u2019s proposal \u201cthat it will include its practices and policies in its compliance filing, to which [the] City may raise any objections.\u201d Opinion No. 172 at 61,806. The Commission rejected, however, CEI\u2019s contention that there need not be included among these practices and policies any provision for Cleveland to make changes in its schedule. Though it agreed that the AU\u2019s provision for unlimited changes may have gone too far, since \u201cthe testimony does not state that CEI\u2019s practice is to allow frequent schedule changes,\u201d it observed that \u201cthe evidence indicates that Painesville was permitted to receive more power than originally scheduled several times in 1982.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,808-09. The Commission resolved this issue by ordering that the practices and policies to be set forth by CEI in its compliance filing should assure that Cleveland \u201cbe accorded the same flexibility as Painesville, and no more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,809.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">Opinion No. 172 was issued on June 16, 1983. On August 30, CEI submitted the revised schedules for filing, and in comments filed on October 3 Cleveland objeet-ed to a number of provisions as being inconsistent with Opinion No. 172. After CEI filed an Answer and Response, the Commission by letter order of March 1, 1984, rejected the City\u2019s objections (with minor exceptions) and accepted CEI\u2019s schedules for filing. <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., </em>26 F.E.R.C. (CCH) 11 61,-320 (Mar. 1, 1984) (\u201cAcceptance Order\u201d). Cleveland has appealed that action under \u00a7 313(b) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825\u00cd (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-13\">Cleveland contends that CEI\u2019s compliance filing failed to comport with Opinion No. 172 in significant respects. In particular, it points to three provisions concerning scheduling and dispatch<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and three provisions concerning availability and curtailment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cleveland argues that FERC\u2019s failure to conduct further hearings before accepting the compliance filing was contrary to law; that its acceptance of the provisions that deviated from Opinion No. 172 was arbitrary and capricious; that the \u201cdeviant\u201d provisions are not supported by substantial evidence; and that they are in sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>eral instances impermissibly vague. We discuss these contentions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">Cleveland\u2019s principal claim is that the Commission\u2019s acceptance of the contested provisions of the compliance filing without holding further hearings \u201cresulted in the denial ... of due process of law.\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 27. That could mean, of course, either a denial of the process \u201cdue\u201d under applicable statutes, or a denial of the minimal procedural protections guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Perhaps the ambiguity is intentional. We decline to conduct our analysis in constitutional terms, since even if a general utility-regulation statute such as the Federal Power Act could be thought to confer upon customers individual property rights of the sort that would invoke the due process clause, <em>but see Georgia Power Project v. Georgia Power Co., </em>409 F.Supp. 332, 338-41 (N.D.Ga.1975); <em>Sellers v. Iowa Power &amp; Light Co., </em>372 F.Supp. 1169, 1172 (S.D.Iowa 1974),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as far as the outcome of this case is -concerned it would make no difference. Federal courts would hardly interpret the unspecified \u201cfull hearings\u201d requirement of \u00a7 205(e) to permit procedures so inadequate that, if the due process clause were applicable, they would not pass muster. We see the issue before us, then, to be what procedures were required by \u00a7 205 (in light of what might be termed the common law of administrative process to which its \u201cfull hearings\u201d provision referred) and by the subsequently enacted provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-59 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">More specifically, the question is whether the Commission contravened these provisions of law by denying Cleveland an opportunity to introduce record evidence, and to produce and cross-examine witnesses, after CEPs submission of its compliance filing. It would be absurd to contend that these procedures were required merely because the text of the provisions contained in the compliance filing was new. If FERC could approve no final language without evidentiary hearings on the particular text, ratemaking proceedings would stretch on interminably \u2014 the hearings on one text leading to a revision which would in turn have to be the subject of evidentiary hearings. <em>Cf. Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, </em>749 F.2d 50, 58 (D.C.Cir.1984). The abstract objection of lack of opportunity to have an evidentiary hearing on the specific text is akin to the objection of a petitioner who contests the outcome of an informal rulemaking proceeding on the ground that the proposed rule set forth in the notice of rulemaking did not contain a provision ultimately promulgated. In that context we have said \u201c[njotice [under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)] need not contain every precise proposal which the agency ultimately may adopt as a rule. Rather notice is sufficient if the description of the \u2018subjects and issues involved\u2019 affords interested parties a reasonable opportunity to participate in the rulemaking.\u201d <em>Trans-Pacific Freight Conference of Japan/Korea v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>650 F.2d 1235, 1248 (D.C.Cir.1980) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 984, 101 S.Ct. 2316, 68 L.Ed.2d 840 (1981). <em>Mutatis mutandis, </em>the same principle applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">The precise questions before us, then, are (1) what issues were relevant to Commission approval of the compliance filing; (2) whether, as to those particular issues, the opportunity for an evidentiary hearing had to be provided; and (3) if so, whether that opportunity was adequately provided in the evidentiary hearings that preceded Opinion No. 172. To simplify our analysis, we intend to omit the second step, assuming without deciding that an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>hearing was required as to all relevant issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">The principal issue presented by this compliance filing, as by any, was whether the provisions included in the schedule accorded with the directions of the underlying order. Cleveland asserted errors of both commission and omission\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>the <em>inclusion </em>of certain provisions that did <em>not </em>reflect, as Opinion No. 172 said they should, CEI\u2019s general practices or its practices specifically applicable to Painesville; and the <em>omission </em>of provisions that <em>did. </em>As to both, we think Cleveland had ample opportunity to present its own evidence and to test CEI\u2019s, by cross-examination and otherwise, in the earlier proceedings. A major object of the hearings before the ALT was to identify the practices of CEI. Whether the ultimate inclusion or omission of certain practices is not supported by the evidence is a separate question, which we shall address in due course below. But the contention that Cleveland had no opportunity to make a record on the point is simply unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">Cleveland argues that in the circumstances of the present case a further issue presented by the compliance filing was whether its provisions were, as the statute requires, just and reasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such an argument can normally be rejected out of hand when, as here, the petitioner attacks a compliance filing made pursuant to an underlying order the petitioner accepted as valid. (Cleveland acknowledges that it \u201cdid not and does not contest\u201d the findings of Opinion No. 172. Reply Brief for Petitioner at 9.) Since the underlying order consists precisely of a determination that what it prescribes will produce just and reasonable rates, the only issue remaining is whether the compliance filing accords with what it prescribes. When, however, the prescription is as indeterminate as some of the provisions at issue here (notably, the prescription that CEI set forth the practices governing scheduling and dispatch of its service to Painesville, without prior determination of what those practices were) it seems to us correct that no determination of justness and reasonableness can realistically be said to have been made and acquiesced in at the stage of the original order. That issue also, however, was plainly the subject of the earlier hearings, at which Cleveland had ample opportunity to demonstrate that those practices which CEI sought to establish were unjust and unreasonable, or that it would be unjust and unreasonable not to adopt additional practices as well. Cleveland concedes that \u201cpolicies and practices or terms and conditions of service, their meaning, implementation, and consistency with the ratemaking standards of the Power Act were fully explored at the hearing and in subsequent briefs,\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 9-10, and that \u201cconsiderable cross-examination was devoted to CEI\u2019s practices, policies and procedures relating to marketing and scheduling of short-term and limited term [s*c] power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. The Commission may have deferred its final judgment on justness and reasonableness until the compliance filing; and the adequacy of the evidence to support that judgment can assuredly be challenged; but the claim of denial of opportunity to develop evidence is simply unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-8\">Our decision on this point is unaffected by the Commission\u2019s assurance in Opinion No. 172 that CEI \u201cwill include its practices and policies in its compliance filing, to which [the] City may raise any objections.\u201d Opinion No. 172 at 61,806. That cannot reasonably be read as a commitment to reopen the evidentiary stage of the proceeding. Cleveland was permitted to file written objections and arguments based on the existing record, which we think fully redeems the Commission\u2019s pledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">Cleveland argues that the Commission\u2019s acceptance of a compliance filing that did not conform with its underlying order was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d agency action, prohibited by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Counsel for the Commission deny any lack of conformity. On at least several of the contested points, Cleveland has the better of that argument. Opinion No. 172, fairly read, contemplated a specific description in the schedules of the so-called \u201cmarket day practices\u201d by which availability of service is determined. <em>See </em>Opinion No. 172 at 61,-809, 61,809-3. The compliance filing, however, only made generic reference to the existence of these practices (there referred to as \u201cmultilateral procedures\u201d); and the Commission\u2019s response to Cleveland\u2019s objections was that \u201cwe believe that the other modifications made to the contract at the Commission\u2019s direction, together with the less detailed language included herein, will serve to protect the interest of [the] City while still affording CEI flexibility to operate.\u201d Acceptance Order at 61,694. This seems to us not a finding of compliance but a sober second thought; the Commission concluded that the degree of detail it had contemplated in the first instance was not really needed. Similarly, although Opinion No. 172 prescribed that, as to schedule changes, the \u201cCity should be accorded the same flexibility as Painesville,\u201d and acknowledged that Painesville had been \u201cpermitted to receive more power than originally scheduled several times in 1982,\u201d Opinion No. 172 at 61,809, the Commission accepted a provision in CEI\u2019s filing that limited schedule changes to the reserved amount. Its explanation was that \u201c[w]e believe that CEI has made a good faith attempt to meet the Commission\u2019s requirements, while ensuring that CEI is not left open to unlimited and frequent schedule changes. With respect to the limitation of changes up to the reserved amount, we believe this is appropriate, inasmuch as revisions over the reserved amount would constitute a new request for service.\u201d Acceptance Order at 61,693 (footnote omitted). We think it more accurate to characterize this as approval of adjustment than determination of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-7\">There is, however, nothing wrong with such adjustments, so long as, at the conclusion of the proceeding, when the Commission has accepted the compliance filing, its reasons for doing so have been adequately set forth, are reasonable, and have factual support in the record. It is not the case that the Commission\u2019s underlying order\u2014 Opinion No. 172 \u2014 is a final judgment to which the compliance filing <em>must </em>conform. To the contrary, it is merely one stage in an ongoing proceeding that is not completed until the rates themselves are approved. <em>See Electrical District No. 1 v. FERC, </em>774 F.2d 490 (D.C.Cir.1985). If the Commission chooses to hold the compliance filing to every jot and tittle of the underlying order, that is well and good (assuming the order itself is adequately supported); but it may also entertain second thoughts and revise its earlier judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-8\">Petitioner\u2019s assertion of arbitrary or capricious action would nonetheless be sustainable if the basis for the Commission\u2019s approval was not an evaluation of the altered provisions on their own merits, but an erroneous belief that they \u201ccomplied\u201d with earlier determinations. An indication of this state of affairs is arguably to be found in the Commission\u2019s general introduction to discussion of the short-term and limited-term firm power service schedules, which expressed the conclusion \u201cthat CEI has constructed [those] schedules in compliance with the Commission\u2019s directives.\u201d Acceptance Order at 61,692. Reading the Acceptance Order as a whole, however, we think it clear that the Commission was,'in the few respects in which compliance was not achieved, reevaluating the compliance filing on its own merits. The Order specifically addressed each of Cleveland\u2019s objections in some detail, reflecting, as we have described above, an awareness that certain adjustments were being made. We view the conclusion of \u201ccompliance\u201d set forth in the preface to that detailed discussion as an exaggeration rather than an indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>of confusion \u2014 or more charitably (if one considers ambiguity a less serious failing than exaggeration), as an assertion of \u201ccompliance in spirit\u201d rather than compliance with text. While it would have been most precise and candid for the Commission to acknowledge outright that it had changed its mind on a few points en route to its conclusion, the superlative degrees of those particular qualities are rarely to be found even separately; to demand them in concert would place an unrealistic burden upon the administrative process. It is clear from the Acceptance Order as a whole that the Commission was under no illusion as to whether the compliance filing technically conformed to Opinion No. 172; that its assertion of technical compliance, if any, was exaggeration rather than self-delusion; that, in short, it knew what it was doing. The Commission\u2019s \u201cpath may reasonably be discerned,\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, </em>419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974), and petitioner\u2019s objections on this score must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">Cleveland\u2019s remaining objections go to the merits of the Commission\u2019s judgment. First, the City asserts lack of record support for a number of the factual premises underlying that judgment \u2014 in particular, for the proposition that the various challenged features of the schedule represented the practices CEI followed in providing service to Painesville and other customers. We have examined each of these contentions and find substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">Second, Cleveland contends that certain provisions of the compliance filing are im-permissibly vague. We noted previously that \u00a7 205(c) of the Federal Power Act requires rate filings to recite \u201cthe ... practices ... affecting such rates and charges.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(c). FERC regulations go even further, requiring that rate schedules set forth \u201cclearly and specifically,\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.1(a) (1985), \u201call ... practices ... which in any manner affect or relate to ... service, rates, and charges,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 35.2(b). Cleveland argues that in accepting some of the vague provisions of the compliance filing FERC violated the statute and the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">As we observed earlier, there is an infinitude of practices affecting rates and service. The statutory directive must reasonably be read to require the recitation of only those practices that affect rates and service <em>significantly, </em>that are realistically <em>susceptible </em>of specification, and that are not so generally understood in any contractual arrangement as to render recitation superfluous. It is obviously left to the Commission, within broad bounds of discretion, to give concrete application to this amorphous directive. <em>See Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>745 F.2d 677, 697 (D.C.Cir.1984) (particularly broad discretion accorded to an agency charged with applying \u201ca standard of ... inherent imprecision\u201d). For the same pragmatic reasons, we do not read the Commission\u2019s regulations, more verbally profuse though they might be, as prescribing numeration of the innumerable; they essentially serve to repeat the statutory prescription with added warning that the Commission may require filings to be as specific and detailed as (within the law) it wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">The issue, then, is whether the provisions challenged as exclusively vague fall short \u2014 not of some absolute prescribed standard literally set forth in the statute and regulations \u2014 but of the minimum specificity that the Commission could reasonably require. If the question were merely whether Cleveland\u2019s rate schedule had to be more specific than the schedules for CEI\u2019s other customers, we might find that the antagonistic relationship between these two parties reasonably required such treatment. But considerably greater specificity <em>has </em>been provided. Almost all of the challenges before us pertain to provisions which, as vague as they are, go beyond what is set forth in CEI\u2019s rate schedules for its other customers. We are asked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>reverse the Commission because it did not provide a sufficient <em>degree </em>of added specificity \u2014 much more of a judgment call. We find no basis for upsetting the Commission\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">The \u201cmultilateral procedures\u201d referred to in \u00a7 2.11 could certainly have been spelled out, a possibility the Commission itself grudgingly acknowledged. <em>See </em>Acceptance Order at 61,694. But especially in light of the fact that the term referred to procedures extensively explained in the record, <em>see id. </em>at 61,696 n. 5, we cannot find such specification to be indispensable. Similarly, the provision of \u00a7 5.3 that in determining the availability of service CEI may \u201cconsider any factors it deems to be relevant, including, but not limited to, [certain specified factors]\u201d is assuredly vague. It is not, however, open-ended, since as the Commission noted it is inherently limited by the provision of \u00a7 2.1 that service shall be provided when reasonably available. And we cannot second-guess the Commission\u2019s expert judgment (indeed, our inexpert guess would conform to the Commission\u2019s conclusion) that the provision for \u201cany factors\u201d was \u201cnecessarily general to permit adaptability to changing day-to-day operations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 61,695. Likewise the provision of \u00a7 2.11 permitting curtailment \u201cwhen ... conditions arise that could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time of the reservation and cause the transmission to be burdensome to the supplying party\u2019s system.\u201d Enumerating unforeseen conditions is a risky business. It might have been practically possible to specify the \u201ccertain transactions\u201d referred to in \u00a7 5.1 that would \u201crequire authorization by an officer of the company.\u201d But that hardly seems a provision of such central importance \u2014 even in this antagonistic setting\u2014 as to require specification, especially since, as the Commission noted in accepting the language, CEI has been directed \u201cto follow up any refusal of power with a written explanation of the criteria for refusal,\u201d and Cleveland \u201chas recourse to the Commission should CEI refuse power on an improper or discriminatory basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">The short of the matter is that the Commission has required and approved a rate schedule significantly more detailed, for this type of interruptible service, than is customary, and one that could reasonably be thought to provide adequately for the special needs of this hostile relationship. It may not be as restrictive as Cleveland would desire. Indeed, it may not even be as restrictive as Cleveland had good reason to <em>expect </em>after the expansive language of Opinion No. 172. But insofar as that expectation pertained to matters within the scope of agency discretion, the Commission tentatively gaveth and the Commission hath ultimately taken away. So long as proper procedures have been followed, intelligible reasons have been given, and factual findings are supported by record evidence, the Commission must be affirmed. That is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-8\">The petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-9\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1453-9\">.

In <em>Northern California Power Agency v. Morton, </em>396 F.Supp. 1187, 1192-94 (D.D.C.1975), the court apparently upheld constitutional due process claims of ratepayers where the requisite property interest had been conceded by the government. What was at issue, however, was not sales of privately generated power by a rate-regulated company, but sales by the Department of the Interior of energy generated by a federal reclamation project and statutorily required to be sold to municipalities and cooperatives as preference customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">. Cleveland also asserts that the nondiscrimina-toriness of the terms and conditions was at issue. We disregard that contention. Except with regard to those matters on which Cleveland was to receive treatment more favorable than other customers (of which it has no standing to complain), Opinion No. 172 required the filed provisions under challenge here to consist of CEI\u2019s practices and policies applicable to other customers. The issue of discrimination and the issue of compliance with the Opinion were therefore one and the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
