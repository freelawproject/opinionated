Following his incarceration, appellant filed a number of civil actions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York concerning the propriety of his arrest, conviction and subsequent imprisonment. In each case, he sought to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>A number of these actions were dismissed by the district court as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-23\">As Abdullah\u2019s litigation increased in quantity but not in quality, the district court decided that Abdullah was abusing its processes. In light of the \u201cundue burden on judicial resources\u201d caused by the multiplicity of Abdullah\u2019s actions and their utter lack of merit, the court issued an injunction directing the clerk to \u201crefuse any additional filings or complaints by Ab-dullah arising out of the same general subject matter ... [of] his arrest, trial, conviction and imprisonment without Abdullah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>first paying the appropriate court costs and filing fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The present cases were rejected by the clerk in accord with the injunction. Abdul-lah\u2019s papers, construed liberally, call into question the propriety of that injunction. He claims that because he is unable to bring actions in the federal courts other than by proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the injunction unconstitutionally bars him from bringing any action whatsoever concerning his imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">A district court has the authority, in determining whether to grant or deny a prisoner\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>to \u201cimpose conditions upon a litigant \u2014 even onerous conditions \u2014 so long as they assist [the] court in making [its case by case determination of poverty, frivolity, or maliciousness], and so long as they are, taken together, not so burdensome as to deny the litigant meaningful access to the courts.\u201d <em>In re Green, </em>669 F.2d 779, 786 (D.C.Cir.1981). A district court not only may but should protect its ability to carry out its constitutional functions against the threat of onerous, multiplicitous, and baseless litigation. <em>In re Martin-Trigona, </em>737 F.2d 1254 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We believe that the district court was within its discretion in limiting Abdul-lah\u2019s ability to bring <em>in forma pauperis </em>actions at will. We believe, however, that the order is overbroad in effectively blocking any action whatsoever relating to his arrest, conviction and imprisonment in that it precludes Abdullah from filing even a meritorious claim. Whatever overbreadth exists, however, can be easily cured by modifying the injunction to require Abdul-lah to seek leave of the district court before filing such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">We do not remand these cases, however, because we have independently determined them to be frivolous. We therefore deny the motions for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismiss the appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). We trust nevertheless that the injunction will be modified in the manner described in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
