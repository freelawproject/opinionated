On appeal, Parsons-Gilbane asserts that the district court erroneously concluded that a dispute with Mar-Len of Louisiana, Inc. (Mar-Len) regarding the validity of certain contract modifications is beyond the scope of an arbitration agreement between the parties. This Court finds that the dispute is subject to the party\u2019s arbitration agreement. The order of the district court is vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Acting as construction manager of the Department of Energy\u2019s Strategic Petroleum Reserve Project, Parsons-Gilbane contracted with Mar-Len of Louisiana, Inc. on April 28, 1981, to construct and install a fire and flushwater system at West Hack-berry, Louisiana. The original contract between Parsons-Gilbane and Mar-Len provided that Mar-Len would complete construction and testing of the system by December 18, 1981, and would be paid $4,387,-500.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Eventually, the parties added thirty-nine modifications to the basic contract. These modifications increased the contract price to $5,607,205.30 and extended the completion date for the contract work to January 29, 1982. Two of these modifications are central to the current dispute. In Modification 22, Parsons-Gilbane granted Mar-Len a waiver of a backfill specification that Mar-Len considered expensive and time consuming. The contract originally required that pipeline hydrostatic testing be done before backfilling was accomplished. Modification 22 granted Mar-Len a performance time extension and a change to allow post-back-fill testing. In return, Mar-Len agreed to waive certain delay claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">On September 3, 1982, after Mar-Len\u2019s activities at the worksite had ceased, Mar-Len delivered to Parsons-Gilbane a seven-volume claim package alleging various deficiencies and inefficiencies and requiring that Mar-Len receive an additional $6,153,-629.25 for performance of the contract work. Attempts to resolve this dispute concerning the amount of compensation due Mar-Len for its performance began shortly after the claim package was reviewed by Parsons-Gilbane and government auditors, but only a partial compromise was reached. This compromise became Modification 39. Modification 39 granted Mar-Len an additional $300,000 in compensation for work done at the site which Mar-Len claimed was beyond the scope of its contractual responsibilities. Mar-Len later repudiated Modifications 22 and 39 alleging that they were obtained without its consent due to the exertion of economic duress by Parsons-Gilbane.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">The Parsons-Gilbane/Mar-Len contract contains the following language governing the resolution of disputes between the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">\u201cARTICLE <em>XIY </em>\u2014 Disputes (July 1979)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUCF\">1.0 Any dispute arising under this subcontract that is not settled by agreement of the parties, or pursuant to the administrative relief provided for in the following paragraphs of this Article, shall be settled by arbitration as provided in Clause 5.0 of this Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">5.0 In the event of any dispute not settled by agreement of the parties, or pursuant to the administrative relief provided for in the preceding Paragraphs 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 of this Article, between Contractor and Subcontractor <em>with respect to the interpretation or performance of this Subcontract, </em>the same shall be settled by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAssociation\u201d) before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Association\u2019s Construction Industry Arbitration Rules, at New Orleans, Louisiana.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">Because Mar-Len had repudiated the two modifications, Parsons-Gilbane initiated arbitration on January 17, 1983, before the American Arbitration Association. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>arbitration proceeding, Parsons-Gilbane sought a declaration that Modification 22 waived certain delay claims contained in the seven-volume claim package and that Modification 39 settled amounts Mar-Len claimed for extra work. Arbitration proceedings were stayed to.allow the parties time to explore settlement negotiations. The stay ended on July 18, 1983, after attempts at amicable resolution had failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Mar-Len then filed suit on August 5, 1983, in the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, seeking reformation or voidance of Modifications 22 and 39 of its contract with Parsons-Gilbane based on lack of consent (economic duress) in contracting for these two provisions. On August 16, 1983, Parsons-Gilbane removed the action to the United States District Court, Western District of Louisiana. Parsons-Gilbane then filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings. On November 30, 1983, the federal district court denied the motion to stay and to compel arbitration and ordered the trial of Mar-Len\u2019s action. The district court concluded that the Parsons-Gilbane/Mar-Len arbitration agreement was \u201cnot susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d The district court held that the arbitration agreement covered only disputes involving the interpretation and performance of the contract but not challenges to the validity of subsequent contract modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Parsons-Gilbane appealed the district court\u2019s determination to this Court. In <em>Mar-Len of Louisiana, Inc. v. Parsons-Gilbane, </em>732 F.2d 444 (5th Cir.1984), a divided panel of this Court dismissed the appeal. This Court concluded that the district court\u2019s denial of Parsons-Gilbane s motion to stay and to compel arbitration was not an appealable interlocutory order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Subsequent to this Court\u2019s order dismissing Parsons-Gilbane\u2019s appeal, Mar-Len filed a motion requesting the district court to issue an injunction prohibiting any further proceedings in the pending arbitration. On December 12, 1984, the district court issued the requested injunction based on that court\u2019s earlier conclusion that the dispute between Mar-Len and Parsons-Gil-bane is not within the scope of their arbitration agreement. On January 2, 1985, Parsons-Gilbane properly perfected this appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting the injunction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, ParsonsGilbane argues that the district court improperly stayed the arbitration because of the district court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that the Mar-Len/Parsons-Gilbane dispute was not arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">II. ARBITRABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">The question of arbitrability is determined on the basis of the existence of an arbitration clause that on its face appears broad enough to encompass the parties\u2019 claims. <em>Commerce Park at DFW Freeport v. Mardian Construction Co., </em>729 F.2d 334, 338 (5th Cir.1984). A presumption of arbitrability exists requiring that whenever the scope of an arbitration clause is fairly debatable or reasonably in doubt, the court should decide the question of construction in favor of arbitration. <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigational Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 583, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>80 S.Ct. 1347, 1353, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960). The weight of this presumption is heavy: arbitration should not be denied \u201cunless it can be said with positive assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that could cover the dispute at issue. <em>Wick v. Atlantic Marine, Inc., </em>605 F.2d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"AV5\">The presumption favoring arbitrability is based in large part on policy considerations. A primary consideration recognized by the courts has been the desirability of relative speed and economy of arbitration \u201cnot subject to delay and obstruction in the courts.\u201d <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Manufacturing Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 404, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 1806, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967). A second consideration which has \u25a0influenced courts to embrace the resolution of disputes by arbitration is the desirability of \u201ceas[ing] the congestion of the Court dockets.\u201d <em>Southwest Industrial Import and Export, Inc. v. Wilmod Co., Inc., </em>524 F.2d 468, 470 (5th Cir.1975). Furtherance of these objectives requires broad construetion of arbitration agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">Given the heavy presumption of ar-bitrability, this Court concludes that the arbitration clause in the Parsons-Gil-bane/Mar-Len contract is sufficiently broad to cover Mar-Len\u2019s challenge to the disputed contract modifications. The broad arbitration clause in question covers any dispute with respect to the interpretation or performance of the Parsons-Gil-bane/Mar-Len contract. In interpreting a similar arbitration clause, the Seventh Circuit stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZC\">[w]here there is a broad arbitration clause covering all disputes involving the \u2018interpretation, application, or implementation\u2019 of a contract, \u2018[i]n the absence of any express provision excluding a partie-ular grievance from arbitration, we think only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFoz\"><em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>551 F.2d 136, 140 (7th Cir.1977), <em>quoting United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigational Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 584-85, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1354, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"AQ8n\">Mar-Len describes its challenge to Modifications 22 and 39 as a claim that the agreement was procured by economic duress The arbitration clause in dispute in the instant case lacks any express provisions excluding claims such as that asserted by Mar-Len. Moreover, Mar-Len has failed to produce evidence of a purpose to exclude its claim from arbitration. To the contrary, questions of interpretation or performance of the Parsons-Gilbane/Mar-Len contract are central to Mar-Len\u2019s claim that the modifications were obtained through economic duress. The economic duress alleged by Mar-Len arose out of a dispute regarding performance of the original contract. This dispute led to Modifications 22 and 39. To allow Mar-Len\u2019s conclusory allegations that the modifications are invalid to defeat arbitrability of a dispute clearjy within the scope of the arbitration clause WOuld be contrary to the presumption of arbitrability.</p>\n<p id=\"akk-dedup-0\">Several courts have permitted arbitration of disputes regarding alleged fraud \u00a1n the inducement of a contract under arbitration clauses similar to the Parsons-Gilbane/Mar-Len clause. In <em>Schacht v. Beacon insurance Co., </em>742 F.2d 386, 389 (7th Cir.1984), for example, the court referred the appellant\u2019s fraudulent inducement defense to an arbitrator under an arbitration clause covering differences of opinion \u201cwith respect to the interpretation of [the] Agreement or the performance\u201d of the contract obligations. Similarly, in <em>Hannah Furniture Co. v. Workbench, Inc., </em>561 F.Supp. 1243 (W.D.Pa.1983), the court held that an allegation of fraud in the inducement of a franchise relationship was within the scope of an arbitration clause covering \u201cdisputes or grievances between the parties involving questions of interpretation\u201d 0f any 0f the contract\u2019s provisions. The Court in <em>Hannah Furniture </em>could not \u201cescape the conclusion that all of plaintiff\u2019s claims involve the contractual relations between the parties and defendant\u2019s perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>anee of that contract, requiring interpretation of the contract, and are therefore subject to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245. This Court is also compelled to conclude that Mar-Len\u2019s claim involves the contractual relations between Parsons-Gilbane and Mar-Len and is therefore subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The district court, in the instant case, relied in large part on <em>In re Kinoshita, </em>287 F.2d 951 (2d Cir.1961), in concluding that Mar-Len\u2019s claim was beyond the scope of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement. The court in <em>Kinoshita </em>had concluded that a clause requiring arbitration of \u201cany dispute or difference ... aris[ing] under\u201d the agreement was not sufficiently broad to encompass a claim of fraudulent inducement. <em>Id. </em>at 952-53. Recently, however, the Second Circuit itself observed that <em>Kinoshita </em>is inconsistent with federal policy favoring arbitration. S.A. <em>Mineracao Da Trindade-Samitri v. Utah International, Inc., </em>745 F.2d 190, 194 (2d Cir.1984). Although declining to overrule <em>Kinoshita, </em>the Second Circuit \u201cconfine[d] <em>Kinoshita </em>to its precise facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the arbitration clause in the instant case differs from that in <em>Kinoshita </em>and recognizing that <em>Kinoshita </em>is inconsistent with federal policy favoring arbitration, this Court concludes that the district court erred in applying <em>Kinoshita </em>to grant Mar-Len\u2019s request to stay arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. An order staying arbitration pending disposition of litigation before the court is an appealable interlocutory order granting an injunction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). <em>City of Meridian </em>v. <em>Algernon Blair, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 525, 527 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Texaco, Inc. v. American Trading Transportation Co., </em>644 F.2d 1152, 1153-54 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. International Union, </em>Etc., 476 F.2d 603, 604 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The district court\u2019s order staying arbitration is distinguishable from its earlier nonappealable order refusing to stay its own hand in deference to the arbitration proceedings. Arbitration is not a mere extension of a court\u2019s proceedings but involves a separate tribunal. The instant order was not an exercise by the district court of its inherent power to control its own proceedings. In the instant case, the district court was asked to interfere with proceedings in another forum. The district court exercised its equity powers to halt action of its litigants outside of its own proceedings \u2014 the classic form of an injunction. <em>A &amp; E Plastik Pak Co. v. Monsanto Co., </em>396 F.2d 710, 713 (9th Cir.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
