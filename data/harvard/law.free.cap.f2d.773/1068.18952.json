His conviction was reversed because the government had failed to show that Reed used an explosive, as required under the statute. Fireman\u2019s Fund, the insurer of the building, brought this civil action against Reed for restitution. The district court granted summary judgment for Fireman\u2019s Fund. The court held that Reed was collaterally estopped from challenging his liability because the reversal of the conviction did not affect the validity of the jury\u2019s determination that Reed had destroyed the building. Reed appeals the district court\u2019s application of collateral estoppel. We REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-17\">Federal law governs, the collateral estoppel effect of a federal case decided by a federal court. <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories v. University of Illinois Found., </em>402 U.S. 313, 324 n. 12, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 1440 n. 12, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-18\">A determination adverse to the winning party does not have preclusive effect. <em>United States v. Cheung Kin Ping, </em>555 F.2d 1069, 1076 (2d Cir.1977); <em>cf. Ornellas v. Oakley, </em>618 F.2d 1351, 1356 (9th Cir.1980) (the determination sought to be used was reversed and did not have preclusive effect); IB J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>It 0.416[2], at 518 (2d ed. 1984) (if the appellate court affirms on one ground used by the trial court without passing on a second ground used by the trial court, the second ground does not have preclusive effect); <em>id. </em>110.443[5. \u2014 1], at 781-83 (the judgment of a court is conclusive of only those issues whose determination supports the judgment); <em>but cf. id. </em>1t 0.416[2], at 517-18 (if the appellate court reverses and remands, expressly leaving certain findings of the trial court intact, those findings may later be used if they are necessary to the trial court\u2019s judgment on remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-19\">The rule promotes fairness and efficiency. A litigant should not be compelled to challenge every basis of an erroneous judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>ment when one meritorious challenge will suffice for reversal. Moreover, an appellate court typically will address only those arguments that are necessary to reach its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In Reed\u2019s criminal case, the appellate court reversed Reed\u2019s conviction because Reed had not used an explosive. Reed is not collaterally estopped from challenging the trial court\u2019s finding that Reed had destroyed the building because the appellate court did not pass on that issue, <em>see id. </em>110.416[2], at 518, and because that finding did not support the appellate judgment in favor of Reed, <em>see id. </em>It 0.443[5. \u2014 1], at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
