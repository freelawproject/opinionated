Thus the income for the support of this 81 year old widow suddenly dropped from $695 to $105 per month. She was told by the Railroad Retirement Board that it would take five or six months before the Board could compute what she was legally entitled to receive as a surviving widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-19\">After her attorney wrote without response to both agencies, suit was filed on April 23, 1982, in the form of a class action seeking relief for the multitude of individuals with dual coverage for benefits. The Board thereupon agreed to increase her interim benefits, and finally decided on May 24, 1982, that, she was entitled to $575.90 per month, retroactive to January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-20\">Though the class action never proceeded to determination of a class, settlement negotiations continued, and on November 16, 1982, a consent decree was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The consent decree provided for the establishment of procedures for the benefit of other surviving spouses than Mrs. Gotches which averted some of the disadvantages of the former \u201cdual eligibility\u201d cut-off. The Railroad Retirement Board agreed to pay interim benefits equal to the amount of \u201cspouse\u201d benefits under both Acts. Schedules for implementation of the new system, and procedures for verifying compliance and reporting to the Court were also included in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The case comes before us in connection with plaintiffs counsel\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees, presenting perhaps the common situation deprecated by Judge Aldisert where the \u201cside-show\u201d eclipses the \u201cmain tent,\u201d and the inquiry as to the amount of the fee assumes \u201cmassive proportions, perhaps even dwarfing the case in chief.\u201d <em>Lindy Bros. Inc. v. American Radiator, </em>540 F.2d 102, 116 (3rd Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The fee award is governed by the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b), which permits the award of reasonable \u201cfees and expenses of attorneys, in addition to ... costs ... to the prevailing party in any civil action brought ... against the United States or any agency____\u201d It is further provided that \u201cThe United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Fees may be denied, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) if the court finds \u201cthat the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances made an award unjust.\u201d Fees may also be reduced or denied under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(C) if the prevailing party \u201cengaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">By virtue of these statutory provisions for fees the case at bar is removed from operation of the general \u201cAmerican\u201d rule prohibiting fee-shifting. See <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 260, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1616, 1623, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">The government argues that its position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d and that \u201cequitable considerations\u201d exist amounting to \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d making an award unjust.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">It is hard to find anything inequitable in plaintiff\u2019s concern for and efforts to ameliorate the lot of victims of the prior bureaucratic practice. If anything was inequitable (rather than merely ridiculous) it was that prior practice itself. It is difficult to see why the beneficiary of double coverage should suddenly become worse off than if she had had only one string to her bow.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">More meritorious is the government\u2019s contention \u201cthat the position of the United States was substantially justified.\u201d With respect to Mrs. Gotches\u2019 own benefits, however, the government\u2019s position was clearly not justified, and the District Court correctly held that she was entitled to counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">The basic test for determining whether the government\u2019s position is \u201csubstantially justified\u201d is one of reasonableness. <em>Ramos v. Haig, </em>716 F.2d 471, 473 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Berman v. Schweiker, </em>713 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir.1983); <em>McDonald v. Schweiker, </em>726 F.2d 311, 316, (7th Cir.1983); <em>Bittner v. Sadoy &amp; Rudoff, </em>728 F.2d 820, 830 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">On this issue the District Court\u2019s discussion is persuasive and evinces no abuse of discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">In the present case, Mrs. Gotches was unable to secure relief from the agency after her benefits were reduced from $691.00 per month to $105.00 per month. Both agencies must have been aware that regardless of which of the two eventually assumed payments of Mrs. Gotch-es\u2019 survivors benefits, her benefits would exceed $105.00 per month. Yet when presented with Mrs. Gotches\u2019 problem, the agencies did not voluntarily raise her level of benefits. Rather, the government chose to defend its policy in litigation and filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. In order for the government to show that its position was substantially justified, it must show that the decision to litigate had a reasonable basis in law and fact____ In this case, the decision to litigate, with the knowledge that Mrs. Gotches was entitled to a survivors benefit larger than the interim benefit which she was receiving cannot be considered reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The litigation instituted by plaintiff has indeed fulfilled the policy of Congress to vindicate the public interest by encouraging \u201cprivate attorneys general.\u201d She is clearly entitled to her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, to be determined by the District Court, for her valuable public service in improving the efficiency of government operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">However, with respect to other parties affected by the class action, we are of opinion that the government was substantially justified in continuing its opposition. No determination of class membership was ever made. Negotiations for the benefit of other victims of the governmental snafu, as distinguished from the original client Mrs. Gotches, were carried on by counsel at his own risk as a matter of <em>pro bono publico </em>service. Even though some relief was obtained for other victims, he never fully prevailed and won a complete victory. The government might properly resist large-scale class-action litigation seeking institutional restructuring and possibly involving some degree of on-going supervision by a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">A district court may award attorney fees to a prevailing party under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2412(d) unless the position of the government was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d This court has interpreted \u201csubstantially justified\u201d to mean reasonable. <em>Ramos v. Haig, </em>716 F.2d 471, 473, (7th Cir.1983). Further, \u201c[t]he government must have a solid though not necessarily correct basis in fact and law for the position it took in this action.\u201d <em>McDonald v. Schweiker, </em>726 F.2d 311, 316, (7th Cir.1983). The parties entered into settlement negotiations on the class action claim a short time after this suit was filed in the district court. Although the parties agreed on several points and several procedures were implemented by the Board during the negotiations, the settlement negotiations collapsed over the computerization of the claims of plaintiffs who received their benefits under an earlier version of the Railroad Retirement Act, referred to in the consent decree as Old Act cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">The Board was willing to computerize cases arising under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (\u201cNew Act Cases\u201d) but was unwilling to make an absolute commitment to computerizing the Old Act cases at some point in the future; according to the record, the Board wanted to obtain experience with computerizing the New Act cases before making a long-range commitment to computerizing the Old Act cases. During an in-chambers conference, the district court judge persuaded the plaintiffs that the Old Act claimants would be adequately protected by the Board\u2019s commitment to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ati-dedup-0\">\u201cgive serious consideration to computerizing \u2018Old Act\u2019 cases, once it has sufficient experience with \u2018New Act\u2019 cases to evaluate the effectiveness of computerizing that process, and thereby pay interim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>benefits equal to the combined RRB and SSA spousal benefits pending adjudication of the survivor\u2019s status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">An affidavit submitted by the Board Director after the consent decree was entered demonstrates that the Board\u2019s reservation about computerizing the Old Act cases was well founded. Robert S. Kaufman, the Director of the Board, stated that the number of Old Act cases coming before the Board is constantly declining; that the Board\u2019s lack of access to Social Security payment information would substantially complicate the Board\u2019s computerization effort; that the Board\u2019s resources have been further taxed by Social Security legislation enacted after the consent decree; and, that the old Act cases would eventually be computerized as part of the implementation of a new computerized payment system for all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">This court will not award attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act if the government had \u201ca solid though not necessarily correct basis in fact and law for the position it took ...\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>726 F.2d at 316. As the foregoing review of the facts demonstrates, the government\u2019s resistance to an immediate computerization of the Old Act cases was reasonable. Hence, the government\u2019s refusal to \u201ccave-in\u201d was substantially justified as that term is used in The Equal Access to Justice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Therefore it is necessary to remand this case to the District Court for a specific determination of the amount of fees earned up through May 24, 1982, the date when the Railroad Retirement Board agreed to award increased benefits to Mrs. Gotches.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">This should be a simple time-based calculation since the government has not objected to the reasonableness of the hourly rate or the method of computation, but merely to payment of fees for services with respect to which the government\u2019s position was thought to be substantially justified. Since this Court has clarified the lines of demarcation with respect to that issue, the parties and the District Court should have no difficulty in arriving at an appropriate figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-21\">. To use a Presbyterian locution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">. It is also argued that plaintiff was not a \u201cprevailing party.\" This contention is almost frivolous. As the District Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">Within eleven days of service of process on the defendants, Mrs. Gotches\u2019 benefits were increased from $105.00 per month to their proper level of $575.00 per month. Certainly it can be inferred that the prompt increase in Mrs. Gotches' benefits was directly related to the filing of her lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">Furthermore, ... the Railroad Retirement Board agreed to provide class-wide relief to surviving spouses of those persons insured under both ... Acts. Through the litigation process Mrs. Gotches was able not only to secure benefits for herself, but for others similarly situated____ Clearly she must be considered a prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-20\">Inclusion of this issue in defendants\u2019 40 page brief indicates that the government is fighting \u201ctooth and nail\u201d [726 F.2d at 317]. The residuals of over a century of sovereign immunity make it hard to accept an innovative Congressional policy with respect to fees.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b194-10\">POSNER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">I agree with the result in the majority opinion but have reservations about some of its reasoning and about what seems to me the opinion\u2019s unduly harsh tone of criticism of the government. I shall therefore explain my own reasons for reaching the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The. Equal Access to Justice Act, which expired recently but remains applicable to this case, allows a prevailing party in a suit by or against the federal government to recover his attorney\u2019s fees and related expenses \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The government appeals from an award of fees and expenses to the plaintiffs of slightly less than $13,000, and the issue is whether this amount or some part of it must be abated because of the statutory language I have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Penelope Gotches, the named plaintiff in this class action, was married to Steven Gotches, who until his death received benefits under both the Railroad Retirement Act and the Social Security Act, while she received spouse benefits. Between them the Gotches received almost $700 a month in benefits. On January 2, 1982, Mr. Gotches died. His entitlement to benefits died with him. Mrs. Gotches, however, became entitled to survivor benefits. But under the law survivor benefits cannot be paid to the same person by both the Railroad Retirement Board and the Social Security Administration. When a person dies who has been receiving benefits from both agencies, the Railroad Retirement Board must determine which agency will pay survivor benefits, and that agency must then determine how much to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">As required by law, both the Railroad Retirement Board and the Social Security Administration terminated Mr. Gotches\u2019 re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tirement benefits and Mrs. Gotches\u2019 spouse benefits upon his death. At the same time the Board began paying Mrs. Gotches $105 a month as an interim survivor\u2019s benefit pending determination of her full entitlement to such benefits. The Board wrote her to this effect on February 23 but did not indicate when she would start to receive her full survivor benefits; at the time, about half of all survivor claims were paid within 90 days, 70 percent within 120 days, and 99 percent within six months. The letter said, \u201cIf you have any questions about your claim, you may get in touch with any social security office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On April 9, more than 90 days after Mrs. Gotches\u2019 claim for survivor\u2019s benefits had first accrued and while she was still receiving her modest interim benefit, the Board received a letter from her lawyer, dated April 6. ' The letter said, \u201cshe needs as much income as she is legally entitled to immediately.\u201d On April 23, the Board not having replied, suit was filed against both the Board and the Social Security Administration on behalf of Mrs. Gotches and all other survivors of \u201cdual insureds.\u201d The suit sought immediate payment of survivor benefits that were due Mrs. Gotches and injunctive relief to prevent future delays in the payment of such benefits to members of the class. On May 24, 1982, a month after the suit was filed and almost five months after her husband\u2019s death, Mrs. Gotches was awarded a survivor\u2019s benefit of $575.90 a month, retroactive to January 1, the day before her husband\u2019s death. The injunctive part of the suit continued until November 16, 1982, when the judge signed a consent decree which provides for higher interim payments, computerized processing of claims, and other methods of ameliorating the hardships that are caused when the payment in full of survivor benefits is delayed because of the legal ban on paying both railroad retirement and social security benefits to the same survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">To apply the Equal Access to Justice Act to this lawsuit, the suit must be decomposed into two phases. Phase I is the suit for Mrs. Gotches\u2019 survivor benefits, and ended on May 24 when she received them, retroactive to January 1. Phase II is the suit for an injunction; it ended, with the entry of the consent decree, six months after Mrs. Gotches was paid. As to Phase I, it seems reasonably clear that the government\u2019s defense was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d Although the government responded to the complaint by filing a motion to dismiss, it has not indicated what the legal grounds for the motion were. There never was any doubt that Mrs. Gotches was entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits substantially exceeding $105 a month and no reason has been forthcoming on why the government set her interim benefit so low. Maybe an argument could be developed that Mrs. Gotches had no legal right to immediate payment of any particular level of benefits \u2014 that her only legal right was to full retroactivity whenever the government finally got around to processing her claim. But the government\u2019s effort to develop such an argument is perfunctory and does not persuade me (as it did not persuade the district court) that the government was substantially justified in filing a motion to dismiss the complaint, thus forcing Mrs. Gotches to litigate for a month before the government \u201ccaved.\u201d If it had taken the government a month to make a responsible decision on how to respond to her complaint, then, as I shall show in connection with Phase II of the case, there would be substantial justification; but the government does not argue that in connection with Phase I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The government\u2019s main argument about Phase I is that Mrs. Gotches sued prematurely. This is an appeal to \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d the other statutory basis for refusing to award attorney\u2019s fees. The government is correct in pointing out that if someone sues it to get a benefit that he could get for the asking without incurring the expense of suit, he cannot get an award of attorney\u2019s fees; the expense of the suit is caused by his own precipitance, not the government\u2019s obduracy. But the district court was entitled to find, on the present record, that filing a suit was necessary to spur the agencies to grant Mrs. Gotches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the benefits to which she was entitled. The letter that the Board received on April 9 demanding immediate payment should have alerted the Board to the possible existence of an emergency that required quick action. Maybe if Mrs. Gotches\u2019 name were Rockefeller the fall in her government benefits from almost $700 to barely $100 a month would have caused no perturbation. But most widows of retired railroad workers are not wealthy, and Mrs. Gotches\u2019 lawyer was entitled to conclude when he received no answer to his letter for more than two weeks that he had better sue if he wanted her to get higher benefits quickly. He made a prudent choice for which he and his client should not be penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">But regarding Phase II, the injunctive part of the case, the government\u2019s position must as a matter of law be regarded as substantially justified, once the nature of that position is correctly apprehended. The government did not oppose injunctive relief to speed up the processing of claims of dual insureds, though it might have, cf. <em>Heckler v. Day, </em>467 U.S. 104, 104 S.Ct. 2249, 81 L.Ed.2d 88 (1984); <em>Wright v. Califano, </em>587 F.2d 345 (7th Cir.1978); and <em>Deloney v. Califano, </em>488 F.Supp. 610 (N.D.Ill. 1980). What the government did was not opposition; it was analysis and consideration followed by acquiescence in the core though not the details of the plaintiffs\u2019 demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">When the federal government is confronted by a demand to make far-reaching changes in the administration of major programs, under the supervision of a federal judge, the public interest is disserved if the government simply caves in and signs a consent decree drafted by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, without careful consideration of the costs, consequences, and ramifications. Government by judicial decree is not yet the norm in this country, and a public agency does neither the courts nor the taxpaying public a favor when it consents too readily to the entry of a far-reaching decree curtailing its freedom of action. It was prudent for the government to take several months to consider and negotiate over the plaintiffs\u2019 proposals. See <em>Ashburn v. United States, </em>740 F.2d 843, 850-51 (11th Cir.1984); <em>White v. United States, </em>740 F.2d 836, 842 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Alspach v. District Director of Internal Revenue, </em>527 F.Supp. 225, 229 (D.Md.1981); <em>Brener Bldg. Maintenance Co. v. United States, </em>8 Cl.Ct. 277 (1985). As a matter of fact the decree signed in November 1982 followed closely the government\u2019s proposals submitted to the plaintiffs in May. The six months were well spent. Government must not be deterred from successful settlement negotiations by having to pay in effect double attorney\u2019s fees, its own and the plaintiffs\u2019, during the period of negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">This would be a considerably more difficult case if we had to decide whether \u201csubstantial justification\u201d refers just to the government\u2019s litigating position, or whether it refers as well to the position taken by the government before litigation. Once it was sued, the government acted reasonably in negotiating the consent decree that ended the suit. But it is less clear that before then the government had been reasonable to take as long as it often did to determine survivors\u2019 benefits, having cut off the survivor, at the death of her spouse, from what must in most cases be vitally needed income. The circuits are divided on the relevance under the Equal Access to Justice Act of the government\u2019s prelitigation position. See <em>Temp Tech Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>756 F.2d 586, 589-90 (7th Cir.1985); Comment, <em>The Equal Access to Justice Act in the Federal Courts, </em>84 Colum. L.Rev. 1089, 1101-11 (1984). Our circuit has not spoken to the question. See <em>Temp Tech Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>756 F.2d at 590. Although if the prelitigation position is relevant, the government\u2019s case here is undermined, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel does not argue that it is relevant; his position is that the government\u2019s prelitigating and litigating positions were the same, and he therefore does not challenge the district court\u2019s ruling that only the litigating position is relevant. But they were not the same. Before the litigation began the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>government acted as if it had no obligation to expedite the payment of survivors\u2019 benefits; after the litigation began it took the position that it would agree to an appropriate consent decree requiring expedition. The difference is fundamental, and the litigating position, at least, was reasonable, or in the language of the statute \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d Naturally we will not overturn the district court\u2019s ruling on a difficult question \u2014 the (irrelevance of the government\u2019s prelitigating position \u2014 when the party who would benefit from that overruling does not ask us to.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">All this assumes that the government would have had no solid basis in fact or law (the meaning of not \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d <em>McDonald v. Schweiker, </em>726 F.2d 311, 316 (7th Cir.1983)) for resisting, as distinct from tempering, the plaintiffs\u2019 demands; for if it would have had a solid basis, there would be no occasion to distinguish between resistance and negotiation as possible \u201cpositions.\u201d But it is not necessary to decide that issue either. Even if the plaintiffs had an unquestionable right to speedier procedures for paying survivor benefits to the survivors of dual insureds, the government had solid justification for taking time to consider and to reformulate the plaintiffs\u2019 specific proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">All this may seem to overlook a more direct route to the conclusion that the government is not liable for attorney\u2019s fees in Phase II. The suit was a class action with Mrs. Gotches the only named plaintiff. Her claims were fully satisfied on May 24 and became moot, for the government\u2019s tardiness in commencing the payment of survivor benefits could no longer harm her. Cf. <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 104, 109, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1666, 1669, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). This would not have mattered if another class member had been named as plaintiff before the class was certified, but none ever was; the class, in fact, was never certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">This would suggest that when the consent decree was signed, the suit was moot. See, e.g., <em>Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 402, 95 S.Ct. 553, 558, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975); <em>Parks v. Pavkovic, </em>753 F.2d 1397, 1403 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Dudley v. Stewart, </em>724 F.2d 1493, 1494-95 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., </em>651 F.2d 1030, 1041 (5th Cir.1981). An argument could be made that since no named plaintiff would have a claim outstanding for more than a few months (unless he was in the extreme tail of the claims-processing distribution), this is a case capable of repetition but evading review (because each individual case becomes moot before the judicial process can be completed), so that it falls within an exception to the rule that moot cases are not justiciable. See <em>Inmates of Lincoln Intake &amp; Detention Facility v. Boosalis, </em>705 F.2d 1021, 1023 (8th Cir.1983); 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3533.9, at pp. 418-21 (2d ed. 1984). <em>Weinstein v. Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975) (per curiam), is to the contrary, however; it requires \u201ca reasonable expectation that <em>the same complaining party </em>would be subjected to the same action again\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 149, 96 S.Ct. at 349, emphasis added), and that feature is missing here. But moot or not, the suit \u2014 and the consent decree, even if it is void \u2014 achieved its goal; the payment procedures have been speeded up. Whether a plaintiff can be said to be a prevailing party for attorney\u2019s fees purposes if the case becomes moot is an unresolved issue. See Comment, <em>Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards in Moot Cases, </em>49 U.Chi.L.Rev. 819 (1982). But this issue and its application to the unusual facts of this case, like the underlying issue of mootness itself, need not be resolved in this case, the government having prevailed on other grounds on its challenge to the claim for attorney\u2019s fees in Phase II.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
