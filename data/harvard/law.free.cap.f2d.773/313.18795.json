In our first decision, we held the then record too sparse and inadequate for us even to consider the position of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) that it lacked jurisdiction over this case, and therefore we vacated the Board\u2019s initial decision and remanded for full further proceedings. <em>Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>734 F.2d 1471 (Fed.Cir.1984). On remand, the Board\u2019s presiding official held a hearing and concluded again that the Board had no jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (The presiding official did, however, also consider the merits to some extent.) Petitioner has appealed, once again, to this court. We now hold' that the MSPB did have jurisdiction but that the presiding official correctly held in his decision that petitioner was entitled to no relief from the MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">The facts are undisputed. In 1981 the IRS requested from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) a civil service certificate for 78 Revenue Officer, GS-7 positions, at 11 Southern California locations. OPM issued a certificate with 378 names, and after an availability questionnaire to those individuals IRS determined that 77 were available for at least one of the desired locations. Using those individuals, and their civil service rankings, IRS created a \u201cspreadsheet\u201d listing each available certified eligible in rank order, and showing the locations for which he or she was available. IRS then proceeded to make appointments at the various desired locations, each time considering the then top three eligi-bles (available for the particular location) who had not previously been selected. But IRS also utilized 5 C.F.R: \u00a7 332.405 (the \u201crule of three\u201d), permitting an appointing officer to drop from consideration \"an eligible who has been considered by him for three separate appointments from the same or different certificates for the same position.\u201d That is, an eligible who had been considered three separate times, but was not selected during those three considerations, was dropped from further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Lackhouse (who claims preference eligibility) was in 17th place out of the 77 names, and he had listed himself for each of the 11 locations. He was properly considered, in order, for three appointments at three different places, but was not selected. In none of these three selections was he passed over in favor of a lower-ranked non-preference eligible. After petitioner had been considered and non-selected those three times, IRS eliminated him from fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ther consideration (just as it did with other comparably situated listees). After IRS had made 20 appointments from the OPM certificate, it was returned to OPM without making any more Revenue Officer appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Petitioner then appealed to the MSPB, urging <em>inter alia </em>that (1) the so-called \u201crule of three\u201d which IRS applied to him pursuant to the explicit OPM regulation was invalid because in conflict with the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, and (2) IRS\u2019 use of the \u201cspreadsheet\u201d was improper. Those two claims are still pressed before us, but before we consider them we shall discuss the MSPB\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction of Lackhouse\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The Board\u2019s appellate jurisdiction is, as has been repeatedly held, limited to those actions made appealable to it by law, rule or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1205(a)(1); <em>Cowan v. United States, </em>710 F.2d 803, 805 (Fed.Cir.1983). In this instance Lack-house\u2019s claim is that he was the victim of improper employment practices \u2014 the use of the \u201cspreadsheet\u201d and application of the \u201crule of three.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction over that type of appeal stems from 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.104(a) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">A candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in \u00a7 300.103 [including any employment practice discriminatory in a \u201cnon-merit\u201d factor] is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-13\"><em>See Dowd v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">The presiding official below held that neither the use of the \u201cspreadsheet\u201d nor use of the \u201crule of three\u201d was applied to Lackhouse <em>by the Office of Personnel Management </em>\u2014 but rather by the IRS alone \u2014 and accordingly that there is no jurisdiction in the MSPB under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.104(a), <em>supra. </em>We differ with this result (as to the \u201crule of three\u201d regulation) because OPM promulgated the \u201crule of three\u201d \u2014 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.405, <em>supra </em>\u2014 which directly and specifically authorized IRS to refuse to consider further <em>any </em>civil service eligible previously considered by the same appointing officer from the same or a different certificate for the same position. Without doubt OPM\u2019s unqualified adoption of the regulation expressly allowed IRS to follow the allegedly improper employment practice of disregarding Lackhouse\u2019s veterans\u2019 employment preference. It was OPM\u2019s explicit authorization that impelled IRS to act as it did.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">It follows that the MSPB presiding official erred in saying that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the question of the validity of the \u201crule of three\u201d (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.405) as applied to veteran preference eligibles. MSPB did have that precise authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">There is, of course, a plain difference between the existence of jurisdiction in the tribunal and a petitioner\u2019s failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. \u201cAs frequently happens where jurisdiction depends on subject matter, the question whether jurisdiction exists has been confused with the question whether the complaint states a cause of action.\u201d <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., </em>341 U.S. 246, 249, 71 S.Ct. 692, 694, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951). <em>See also Ralston Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>340 F.2d 663, 667-69 (Ct.Cl.), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 950, 85 S.Ct. 1803, 14 L.Ed.2d 723 (1965). In this ease, we must likewise hold that, though the Board did have jurisdiction, Lackhouse has no remediable claim because the \u201crule of three\u201d was validly adopted under the Civil Service Reform Act and preexisting legislation, clearly survived the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, and was lawfully applied to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">There is, first of all, no facial conflict between the \u201crule of three,\u201d now embodied in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.405, and the portions of the Civil Service Reform Act dealing with veterans\u2019 preference in the civil service. In particular, \u00a7 3318(b)(1) prohibits only the passing over of preference eligibles in favor of lower ranked non-preference employees \u2014 an action which did not occur here \u2014 and deals with no other interrelation of veterans\u2019 preference and job selection. Similarly, \u00a7 3317(b) treats only with discontinuance of certification of a preference eligible who has been three times passed over for a lower-ranking non-preference eligible (which, as we have already observed, also did not happen here) \u2014a process which is quite distinct from the historic \u201crule of three\u201d for all civil service applicants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Second, the long history of the \u201crule of three\u201d (or its analogue) shows that it has always co-existed with veterans\u2019 preference in the civil service. The civil service rules contained in the First Annual Report of the Civil Service Commission provided that \u201c[n]o person upon any register shall be certified more than four times to the same office in the customs or postal service, or more than twice to any department in Washington, unless upon request of the appointing officer____\u201d United States Civil Service Commission, <em>First Ann. Rpt., </em>Appendix No. 2, Rule XVI(4) (1884). In 1886 this was reduced to three considerations. United States Civil Service Commission, <em>Third Ann. Rpt., </em>Appendix No. 2, Rule XVI(4) (1886). These specific rules coexisted with contemporary recognition of veterans\u2019 preference. <em>Id., </em>Rule XI; <em>First Ann. Rpt., supra, </em>Rule XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Nor did the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 389, alter this coexistence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The former Civil Service Commission, which administered the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act (with respect to the civil service), contemporaneously promulgated a regulation which was substantially the same as current 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.405. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 18.4(c) (1944). This early and continued Commission (and OPM) interpretation of the Act should be given great deference <em>(United States v. Clark, </em>454 U.S. 555, 565-66, 102 S.Ct. 805, 811-12, 70 L.Ed.2d 768 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>(1982)), especially since there is no contrary indication in statute, regulation, legislative history, or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We have to conclude, therefore, that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.405 \u2014 the current \u201crule of three\u201d \u2014 is lawful and was rightly applied to petitioner Lackhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The end-result is that we reverse the Board\u2019s holding that it lacked jurisdiction over Lackhouse\u2019s appeal but we need not remand because the only issue we find within MSPB jurisdiction is purely legal and the presiding official discussed and correctly decided that very issue (though he erroneously thought he had no jurisdiction to do so). As to that aspect of the MSPB decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">REVERSED AS TO LACK OF JURISDICTION, AFFIRMED AS TO THE MERITS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-15\">. The MSPB Docket No. is SF300A8111043.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">. Petitioner also says he was improperly \u201cpassed over\u201d in favor of a lower-ranked non-preference eligible, but the facts show that that was not true in this case. He was never \u201cpassed over\u201d in favor of a non-veteran, and IRS never had any occasion to submit reasons for such a \u201cpassover\u201d to OPM under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3318(b)(1). Nor was Lackhouse ever determined to be ineligible for further consideration under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3317(b) (which calls for three \"pass-overs\u201d in favor of a non-veteran). The latter situation is also not at all involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">. In its brief, MSPB argues that <em>Dowd, supra, </em>implicitly refused to accept in that case the OPM promulgation of a regulation as an adequate basis for Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.104(a), but the critical distinction is that the general <em>Dowd </em>regulation was nowhere near as explicit, direct, and specific as the \"rule of three,\u201d and it could well be said in that case that \"OPM played no part in the ineligible rating given to petitioner by the Department of the Army.\u201d 745 F.2d at 651. In the current case, in contrast, it would be wholly fanciful and unrealistic to say that OPM's promulgation of the \u201crule of three\u201d \"played no part\u201d in Lackhouse\u2019s elimination from consideration. Rather, it was the direct cause of that action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b397-17\">. IRS\u2019 use of the \u201cspreadsheet\u201d was obviously not a practice applied to Lackhouse <em>by OPM </em>under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.104(a) but, in any event, the presiding official was quite correct that the \"spreadsheet\u201d fully accorded with standard OPM and civil service practices. There was- no unlawful act or practice as to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"Atin\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Lackhouse seems to urge that the Board has general jurisdiction (under Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978, 92 Stat. 3783), over <em>all </em>veterans\u2019 preference matters, but it is clear that this is not so. Section 1302 of Title 5, U.S.C., gives this general authority to the OPM, and MSPB has appellate jurisdiction only over the matters specifically given it by law, rule, or regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. Petitioner, who is <em>pro se, </em>confuses a \"passover\" of a veteran by a non-veteran under \u00a7\u00a7 3317(b) and 3318(b)(1) with the \u201crule of three\u201d which applies, independently of such a \"pass-over,\u201d to <em>all </em>civil service \u201celigibles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b398-12\">. That Act\u2019s legislative history does not deal directly with \"the rule of three,\" but Congress was generally aware of prior civil service practices with respect to veterans, and did not exhibit any desire to depart radically from the then-prevailing civil service rules. S.Rep. No. 907, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1944); 90 Cong.Rec. 3503 (Rep. Rees); <em>id. </em>at 3505 (Rep. Ramspech). In its consideration of the Act, Congress did not mention an exemption from the \u201crule of three\u201d among the \"principal changes from existing practices____\u201d H.R. 1289, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 3-4 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
