A and wife, in January, 1878, executed a deed of trust on certain land to B, to secure a debt due to 0, evidenced by a note payable two years after its date, with interest. In March, 1879, B, the trustee, sold the land to 0 for a default in the payment of interest, and G shortly after leased the premises to A. In April, 1878, D recovered a judgment against A, upon which an execution issued, and was, in December, 1878, levied on a crop of growing wheat sown by A in the fall of 1878, on the premises, and the wheat was by the sheriff sold to D, who in 1879 took possession of the same, and cut and shocked it: 22eld, in an action of replevin by C, that the wheat belonged to him, affirming a judgment in his favor.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\" pgmap=\"490\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the Third District ;\u2014heard in that court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Pike county; the Hon.

Upon these judgments executions were issued, and were by the sheriff of said county, on December 12, 1878, levied upon the wheat growing upon the lands, and which had been sown by Hoskins in the fall of 1878. At the sheriff\u2019s sale, on January 3, 1879, the wheat was sold to appellant Anderson, who bought for himself and the other appellants.

He was not a party to the proceedings, and his rights were not affected thereby. The purchaser at the sheriff's sale took subject to the rights of the grantee under the trust deed, which were not cut off or affected by such sale. Had the grantor in the trust deed severed the crops, in fact, as did the purchaser under the. executions, such severance would not have given him title to the grain as against the holder of the deed of trust. The purchaser at the sheriff's sale acquired only the rights of the maker of the deed of trust. The clause in the deed of trust permitting the grantor to enjoy the rents, profits and issues until default, was merely declaratory. Such was the legal effect of the deed, independent of the clause. As soon as'default occurred, that permission ended.</p> <p id=\"b494-8\" pgmap=\"494\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
