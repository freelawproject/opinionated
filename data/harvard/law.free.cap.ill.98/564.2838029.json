They thereupon sued out this writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-8\" pgmap=\"571\">Messrs. Page &amp; Plum, for the plaintiffs in error:</attorneys><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-9\" pgmap=\"571\">The only question presented is, do the plaintiffs in error take, under the will, a fee, or only a life interest in the undivided one-third of the ten acres.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-10\" pgmap=\"571\">The intention of the testator is, of course, the object to be sought, and in attaining which are to be considered the particular clause supposed to confer the right, such clause in connection with other portions of the instrument, the character and situation of the properties devised, and the relations of the testator thereto, and to the parties interested.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-11\" pgmap=\"571\">The controlling feature, as we deem it, corroborated, indeed, by other portions of the will, is the personal charge upon the devisees,' in respect of this property, for the contingent support of their father.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-12\" pgmap=\"571\">So ancient and uniform is the rule that such charge carries the fee, that it seems necessary only to refer to the ordinary text books: 4 Kent\u2019s Com. * 540; 3 Wash. Real Prop. * 694; 2 Jarman on Wills, 248; Abrams v. Winshup, 3 Russ. 350; Doe v. Phillips, 3 Barn. &amp; Adol. 753; Frogmorton v. Holyday, 2 Burr. 1618; Goodtitle v. Maddern, East, 496; Jackson v. Merrill, 10 Johns. 191.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-5\" pgmap=\"572\">How far it is a matter of public policy that real estate should not be tied up, and how strongly courts lean to give the inheritance to the first donee, see Leiter v. Shephard, 85 Ill. 242; Sherman v. Wooster, 26 Ia. 272; 1 Redfield on Wills, 421, and note 1.</p><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-6\" pgmap=\"572\">Mr. H. F. Vallette, for the defendants in error:</attorneys><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-7\" pgmap=\"572\">It is claimed by plaintiffs in error, first, that by the terms or language of this clause of said will, the daughters, upon the death of the testatrix, eo instanti took the fee of the premises mentioned therein ; second, that the imposition of a burden upon the daughters in consideration of the bequests mentioned in said clause, furnishes evidence of the intention of the testatrix to give the daughters more than a mere life estate. To these propositions I reply:</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-8\" pgmap=\"572\">1. That as the testatrix in this clause of the will not only made the devise to the daughters, but provided for disposition of the property in case of the death of one of them, and without limiting the time when such death should occur to her own lifetime, it seems clear that the intention of the testatrix was to give only a life estate to those daughters. Would any other construction be consistent with all the language employed ?</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-9\" pgmap=\"572\">The weight of authority favors this construction. Blair v. Van Blarcum, 71 Ill. 290; Jackson Chew, 12 Wheat. 153; Anderson v. Jackson, 16 Johns. R. 382.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-11\" pgmap=\"572\">2. That the imposition of a burden upon a devisee does not of itself create a fee, is a self-evident proposition. It seems equally clear, that a burden may be imposed, if testator so wills it, as well upon a life estate as upon a fee. Where, by the express terms of a will, a life estate is devised, no amount of burden imposed upon the devisee could possibly change the construction of such a will.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-12\" pgmap=\"572(32) 573(44)\">If, then, only a life estate was created by the first part of clause 4, the provision of that clause,that \u201cin consideration of the above bequests, which shall be shared equally between my above named daughters, if their father, Charles E. Peck, shall become destitute, they will provide him with the actual needs of life,\u201d can in no manner be evidence of an intention other than that designated in the former part of said clause.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-6\" pgmap=\"573\">3. The situation or condition of the property devised can not furnish any evidence of the intention of the testatrix as to the extent of the estate devised to her daughters. The testatrix might reasonably have supposed that this property, situated in the vicinity of Chicago, could be so used, managed or rented, as to furnish an income to the daughters, and from which support could be afforded to their father.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-7\" pgmap=\"573\">4. It is only in case of doubt about the construction of a will, as to whether it gives a life estate or a fee, that a construction can be placed upon it (if consistent with the balance of the will) which will give the donee or devisee a fee rather than a less estate. But in this case no doubt remains.</p> <opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b573-8\" pgmap=\"573\">Mr. Justice Craig</author> <p id=\"A2my\" pgmap=\"573\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b573-9\" pgmap=\"573\">The only question presented by this record is, whether, under the fourth clause of the will of Sarah M. Peck, deceased, her daughters, Marian A. Johnson and Helen M. Peck, took h life estate or the fee in and'to the kind therein described. The provision of the will in question is as follows :</p> <p id=\"b573-10\" pgmap=\"573(101) 574(12)\">4th. \u201cI give and bequeath to my above named daughters an undivided third of ten acres of land, situated in the south-east quarter of section 4, town of Lake, county of Cook, State of Illinois, to be divided equally. In case of the death of either of the above daughters without issue, the share of the deceased shall revert to the remaining daughter. If either die leaving children, deceased\u2019s share shall be divided equally between her offspring. In consideration of the above bequests, which shall be shared equally between my. above named daughters, if their father, Charles E. Peck, shall become destitute, they shall provide him with the actual needs of life.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b574-6\" pgmap=\"574\">In making the will, if the testator had stopped at the first concluding clause with the word \u201c equally,\u201d then it is clear the \u25a0two daughters would have taken the fee in the property devised; but the testator, for some reason, saw proper not to do so, but added another provision, which materially changes and limits the clause first written. If, in placing a construe-' tion on the will, the latter clause could be rejected,.then there would be no difficulty in holding that the fee passed to the two daughters; but we are aware of no authority which would sanction a construction of that character. One of the familiar rules of construction of a will, or other instrument of writing, is, where there is uncertainty and doubt, all of its parts should be considered together, and, if possible, give every clause and provision effect according to the intention of the maker. Brownfield v. Wilson, 78 Ill. 467.</p> <p id=\"b574-7\" pgmap=\"574\">If, in this case, full force and effect are given to each clause of the will, what estate in the land devised did the testator intend to give to the two daughters? Was it an estate in fee, or for life only? If the language used in the last clause is to be considered and given force and effect, which we are bound to do, it seems plain that the daughters took only a life estate in the property.</p> <p id=\"b574-8\" pgmap=\"574\">In Bergan v. Cahill, 55 Ill. 160, it was expressly held that a devise of the fee may be restricted by subsequent words in the will, and changed to an estate for life. Here, the testatrix, after devising the property to her two daughters, declares that if either die leaving children, the share of the daughter so dying shall descend to her offspring, and be divided equally between them. This is a plain and unambiguous declaration, and means, in as plain terms as the English language could well express it, that the daughters are to hold this land for life, and upon their death it shall descend to their children, who shall take the fee.</p> <p id=\"AENF\" pgmap=\"575\">It is, however, urged, that the personal charge upon the daughters in respect of the property, for the support of the father, is conclusive evidence of the intention of the testatrix to pass the fee. We perceive no reason why a charge may not be placed upon the devisee of property devised for life as well as property devised in fee, and we are well satisfied that where, by the terms of a will, it clearly appeared that the testator devised a life estate, a charge imposed upon the devisee, however great, in consideration of the bequest, could not change the construction of the will. If the devise was indefinite, a different rule would prevail.</p> <p id=\"b575-6\" pgmap=\"575\">The doctrine on this question is clearly stated in Jarman on Wills, vol. 2, page 126, as follows : \u201c The rule under consideration, however, is confined to indefinite devises; for where the. direction to pay is imposed on a person to whom there is given an express estate for life, or an estate tail, (whether limited in express terms, or arising constructively by implication from words introducing the devise over,) the charge is inoperative to enlarge such estate for life or estate tail to a fee simple.\u201d See, also, Goodtitle v. Edmunds, 7 Durn. &amp; E. 635; Willis v. Lucas, 1 P. W. 474; Denn v. Slater, 5 Durn. &amp; E. 335; Doe v. Owens, 1 Barn. &amp; Adol. 318.</p> <p id=\"b575-7\" pgmap=\"575\">There is nothing indefinite in regard to the devise in this case, but, on the contrary, it is clear and definite. The terms of the will are so plain, that there is no room for doubt in regard to the intent of the testator.</p> <p id=\"b575-8\" pgmap=\"575\">We are of opinion that the decision, rendered in this case, that the daughters took only a life estate, was correct, and it will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b575-9\" pgmap=\"575\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
