(\u201cBristol\u201d) and plaintiff Joseph Gibbons (\u201cGibbons\u201d) (collectively, \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) filed an amended consolidated class action complaint (\u201cCCAC\u201d) after this Court dismissed Bristol\u2019s amended complaint in full. Familiarity with the Court\u2019s prior opinion is presumed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court now considers motions of defendants China Valves Technology, Inc. (\u201cChina Valves\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), its named officers and directors (\u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), and the Company\u2019s auditors, Moore Stephens Wurth Frazer and Torbet, LLP (\u201cIndependent Auditors\u201d), to dismiss the CCAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Bristol and Gibbons allege that China Valves and the Individual Defendants improperly failed to disclose material facts concerning the related party nature of two of the Company\u2019s acquisitions and a third transaction, and materially overstated China Valves\u2019 financial results in the registration statement made effective on December 14, 2009 (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) and in the subsequent prospectus supplements (collectively, \u201cOffering Documents\u201d) in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They allege also that the Auditor Defendants are liable under Section 11 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act for material misstatements made in the audit opinions that were incorporated in at least some of the Offering Documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AbWb\">\n<em>I.

Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">China Valves is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Kaifeng City, China.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It purports to develop, manufacture, and sell metal pressure valves to customers in China.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At all relevant times, its common stock has traded on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cCWT.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Individual Defendants are ten officers and directors of China Valves.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defendant Siping Fang is the Company\u2019s founder and chairman who, from the beginning of the Relevant Period through October 11, 2010, was the Company\u2019s chief executive officer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He signed the 2009 10-K and Registration Statement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendant Jianbao Wang served as China Valves\u2019 chief executive officer from October 11, 2010 through the end of the Relevant Period.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defendants Gang Wei, Renrui Tang, and Ichi Shih served as the Company\u2019s chief financial officer at various times during the Relevant Period.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Defendant Binjie Fang served as China Valves\u2019 chief operating officer from January 2008 through the end of the Relevant Period, was a director, and signed the Company\u2019s 2009 10-K and Registration Statement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Defendants Zengbiao Yu, Peter Li, and William Haus were directors and members of China Valves\u2019 audit committee; each signed the 2009 10-K and Registration Statement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Defendant Bin Li is a 84 percent shareholder of the Company.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">The Auditor Defendants issued an audit opinion dated March 15, 2009 with respect to the Company\u2019s financial statements for 2007 and 2008 and consented to its incorporation into the Offering Documents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It issued another such opinion with respect to the financial statements incorporated into the Company\u2019s Form 10-K for 2009.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">\n<em>II. Substantive Allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">\n<em>A. Changsha Valve Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-19\">On December 14, 2009, Able Delight Investment Limited (\u201cAble Delight\u201d) agreed to purchase Watts Valve (Changsha) Company (\u201cChangsha Valve\u201d), a subsidiary of Watts Water Technologies, Inc. (\u2018Watts Water\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Two months later, on February 8, 2010, China Valves announced in a press release and 8-K that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement with Changsha Valve/Able Delight for $15 million.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Plaintiffs allege that defendants omitted two material facts regarding the Changsha Valve transaction in their public statements and SEC filings. First, they allege that the defendants failed to disclose that the deal was a related-party transaction in which Qing Lu, the wife of China Valves\u2019 34 percent shareholder Bin Li, formed Able Delight at China Valves\u2019 behest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, they allege that the defendants failed to disclose that Changsha Valve was the subject of an investigation for possible Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) violations when China Valves purchased it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege additionally that China Valves misstated the purchase price, which the Company\u2019s filing with China\u2019s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (\u201cSAIC\u201d) listed as $6.07 million \u2014 $8.93 million less than the amount that the company announced to the public.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\">China Valves filed an amended 8-K on November 18, 2010 (\u201cNovember 8-K\u201d), explaining that it acquired Changsha Valve through Able Delight, that it had arranged for Qing Lu to form Able Delight, that the $8.93 million difference in the publicly announced price and the SAIC price represented money used to satisfy Changsha Valve\u2019s third-party debts, and that it paid Qing Lu $50,000 for her assistance.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The 8-K did not disclose that Qing Lu and Bin Li are married.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The CCAC further alleges that the SEC requested various information from China Valves regarding this transaction.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This request prompted China Valves to explain that it structured the transaction as it did because Qing Lu is a Canadian citizen and Watts Water preferred that a foreign owned entity purchase Changsha Valve.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> China Valves later added that Watts Water preferred not to sell Changsha Valve to a public company.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants had motive and opportunity to conceal the related-party nature of the transaction \u201cbecause [it was] highly suspicious and would raise the ire of analysts and investors\u201d and that defendant Siping Fang had a motive to inflate the company\u2019s financial results due to certain performance-based salary incentives.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Plaintiffs further allege that China Valves failed to disclose that Changsha Valve was under investigation for FCPA violations at the time of the acquisition.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Watts Water disclosed the investigation in its November 4, 2009 10-Q,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> but China Valves did not disclose it in its own filings until November 21, 2011, at the SEC\u2019s prompting.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The SEC had issued already a cease and desist order against Watts Water by then, having found multiple FCPA violations.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Although the FCPA investigation did not result in any financial penalties for China Valves, plaintiffs allege that the omission was material because FCPA violations can artificially inflate revenues by securing, for example, more busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ness and higher earnings through corrupt activity than a company otherwise would achieve.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This, in turn, may make the company\u2019s business prospects and earnings potential without corruption uncertain. Plaintiffs allege as well that the FCPA violations could have resulted in liability for and penalties against China Valves.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege additionally that defendants knew about the possible FCPA violations at Changsha Valve based on the facts that China Valves conducted its own investigation<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and that Watts Water previously had disclosed the issue to the SEC.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\n<em>B.Hanwei Valve Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Plaintiffs challenge also the manner in which defendants purchased Shanghai Pu-dong Hanwei Valve, Co., Ltd. (\u201cHanwei Valve\u201d). China Valves announced its intent to purchase Hanwei Valve on February 11, 2010, and subsequently described the transaction in its April 9, 2010 8-K as an asset purchase for $21 million.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This description of the transaction, however, did not match that in China Valves\u2019 SAIC filings. There, China Valves disclosed that it purchased Shanghai Hanhuang Valve, the 50 percent owner of Hanwei Valve, on March 1, 2010.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that, in consequence of this initial 50 percent purchase, China Valves\u2019 later purchase of the other half of Hanwei Valve was a related-party transaction.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Moreover, plaintiffs allege that China Valves labeled the transaction an equity acquisition for $7.47 million completed on October 2010 in its SAIC filings.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Plaintiffs further allege that defendants knew or recklessly disregarded all of these facts,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> that the individual defendants (excepting Bin Li) had a duty to monitor this transaction,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and that Siping Fang, Ichi Shih, Binjie Fang, Peter Li, William Haus, and Zengbiao Yu knew about the misstatements or were reckless in failing to discover them because they were required to review the Company\u2019s 2009 report included in its 10-K.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 motive and opportunity allegations summarized above apply to this transaction as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">\n<em>C. The Binjie Fang Receivable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">The final related-party transaction that plaintiffs allege is a $322,725 loan to Binjie Fang from Zenghou City ZD Valve Co. Ltd. (\u201cZD Valve\u201d), a China Valves subsidiary, recorded at the end of 2009 <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Binjie Fang is the legal representative of ZD Valve, a director and chief operating officer of China Valves, and the son of Siping Fang, China Valves\u2019 founder, chairman, and ex-chief executive officer<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">\n<em>D. China Valves\u2019 2008 and 2009 Financial Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-18\">Plaintiffs allege also that China Valves misstated its financial results in 2008 and 2009. They rely on differences between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the Company\u2019s SEC and SAIC filings as follows:<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">_Revenue_Gross Profit_Net Income_</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">_SEC_SAIC SEC_SAIC SEC_SAIC</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">2008 $65,947.615 $55,598,826 $25.865,463 $15.567.721_</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">2009 $95,370.012 $67.604.98 5 346.842.676 $17.421.555 $23.353.093 $5.647.195</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The Court\u2019s previous opinion held that Bristol had failed to allege that differences between SEC and SAIC figures were not due to differences in accounting principles or, in any case, that the figures reported to the SEC, as opposed to the SAIC numbers, were incorrect.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Plaintiffs seek to overcome that holding by alleging that Chinese companies face the risk of \u201csevere penalties\u201d for making false SAIC filings.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend also that differences in the accounting standards that apply in China and the United States do not account for the discrepancies because \u201cAuthoritative bodies have specifically noted that there are not significant differences between U.S. GAAP and \" Chinese GAAP.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Financial statements containing these results were incorporated into China Valves\u2019 December 1, 2009 registration statement, which defendants Siping Fang, Ichi Shih, Zengbiao Yu, Peter Li, William Haus, and Binjie Fang signed.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Auditor Defendants gave clean opinions on the financial statements and its audit opinion was incorporated in to the Registration Statement and each of the three prospective supplements.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">\n<em>E. The Auditors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">As to the Auditor Defendants, plaintiffs allege false and misleading audit reports and opinions regarding China Valves\u2019 financial statements. They allege first that the audit report related to the 2007 and 2008 financial statements was false and misleading and that the report was incorporated into the Offering Documents.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Second, plaintiffs allege that the audit opinion included in China Valves\u2019 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009 was false and misleading because the financial statements to which it related failed to disclose certain related party transactions and overstated the Company\u2019s financial results.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">\n<em>F. The November 8-K and the Citron Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">Many of these alleged misstatements and omissions were publicized in China Valves\u2019 November 8-K and/or in a report by Citron Research (\u201cCitron Report\u201d).<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The November 8-K disclosed that China Valves purchased Changsha Valve from Watts Water, that Able Delight directly paid Watts Water $6.07 million while the remaining $8.93 million satisfied certain third-party obligations, that Qing Lu formed Able Delight in order to serve as a middle person in the transaction, and that Qing Lu received $50,000 in compensation.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> On November 19, 2010, China Valves\u2019 stock fell 15 percent ($1.61 per share).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On January 13, 2011, Citron Research issued its report on China Valves.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> It disclosed that Qing Lu is the wife of China Valves\u2019 34 percent shareholder, Bin Li, and that Changsha Valve was under investigation for FCPA violations.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> As to the Hanwei Valve transaction, it disclosed that, according to China Valves\u2019 SAIC filings, the Company owned Shanhai Hanhuang Valve, 50 percent owner of Hanwei Valve, before it purchased the remaining half of Hanwei Valve and that the transaction was an equity acquisition, not an asset purchase.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Finally, plaintiffs allege that the Citron Report called into question China Valves\u2019 financial results, claiming that the results are simply too good to be true. The words \u201ctoo good\u201d is [sic] not being used lightly here.,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> On On January 13, 2011, China Valves\u2019 stock fell 5.6 percent, from $8.72 per share to $7.15 per share.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> It fell further on January 14, closing at $6.87 per share.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">\n<em>I. Legal Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The Court accepts as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and \u201cdraw[s] all inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">In deciding a motion to dismiss, a court considers the complaint and \u201cany written instrument attached to the complaint, statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, legally required public disclosure documents filed with the SEC, and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff and upon which it relied in bringing the suit.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">\n<em>II. Exchange Act Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">\n<em>A. Elements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">To state a claim under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>a plaintiff must allege that \u201cthe defendant, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact, with <em>scienter, </em>and that the plaintiffs reliance on the defendant\u2019s action caused injury to the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Section 20(a) imposes liability on control persons for Exchange Act violations by those they control.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">A Section 10(b) claim must satisfy also the pleading standard under Rule 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d).<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Accordingly, it must \u201c(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> In pleading <em>scienter, </em>the PSLRA requires that the complaint \u201cwith respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> In order to satisfy the latter requirement, plaintiffs must allege facts which, if true, would demonstrate \u201ceither (1) that defendants had the motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or (2) strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Pleading motive requires allegations that defendants \u201cbenefitted in some concrete and personal way from the purported fraud,\u201d but \u201c[m]otives that are common to most corporate officers, such as the desire for the corporation to appear profitable and the desire to keep stock prices high to increase officer compensation, do not constitute \u2018motive\u2019 for purposes of this inquiry.\u201d <footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Allegations that \u201cdefendants (1) \u2018benefitted in a concrete and personal way from the purported fraud\u2019; (2) \u2018engaged in deliberately illegal behavior\u2019; (3) \u2018knew facts or had access to information suggesting that their public statements were not accurate\u2019; or (4) \u2018failed to check information they had a duty to monitor\u2019 \u201d may suffice to plead the motive aspect of <em>scienter. </em><footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings must allow \u201ca reasonable person [to] deem the inference of <em>scienter </em>cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> In reaching its conclusion, the Court \u201cmust consider plausible, nonculpable explanations for the defendant\u2019s conduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\n<em>B. Section 10(b) Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Azi\">\n<em>1. Alleged Related Party Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Plaintiffs allege Section 10(b) violations based on three alleged related party transactions. Central to these allegations are several accounting rules that govern the disclosure of related party transactions. Plaintiffs specifically point to Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 850-10-50-1, which requires that a company disclose certain material related party transactions in its financial statements. Rule 4-08(k)(l) under SEC Regulation SX also requires disclosure of related party transactions.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Item 404(a) instructs a company to disclose a related party transaction involving an amount over $120,000 and in which a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> The definition of \u201crelated party\u201d in Item 404(a) includes an immediate family member of a security holder who has a 5 percent interest or greater.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\n<em>a. The Changsha Valve Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>i. Materiality of Defendants\u2019 Failure to Disclose the Alleged Related Party Nature of the Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The Court previously dismissed Bristol\u2019s Changsha Valve related party claim because it \u201cfailed to allege that China Valves\u2019 omission regarding Qing Lu\u2019s relationship to Bin Li and Siping Fang was material or even required by Item 404 in the first instance.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> In other words, China Valves\u2019 November 8-K disclosed the alleged omissions and/or misstatements regarding the Changsha Valve transaction\u2014 with the exception of the relationship among Qing Lu, Bin Li, and Siping Fang. Because Bristol bought stock after the 8-K was released, it had not stated a claim. That remains the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Mr. Gibbons, the newly added plaintiff, allegedly bought stock on November 16, 2010, two days before China Valves released the November 8-K. The rationale of the earlier decision on this point therefore does not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">At the time that Gibbons purchased stock, China Valves\u2019 public statements and SEC filings had omitted the facts that Able Delight was formed in order to serve as a middle person in the transaction, that Qing Lu received $50,000 compensation for her role in the transaction, that Able Delight in fact was a shell company for Changsha Valve, which it had purchased from Watts Water, and that the $15 million consideration paid actually was $6.07 million in consideration to Watts Water, with the remaining $8.93 million applied towards Changsha Valve\u2019s outstanding third-party obligations.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The Court cannot say as a matter of law that these omissions \u201care so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance,\u201d particularly in light of the alleged related-party nature of the transaction under Item 404(a).<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">\n<em>ii. Scienter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants had motive and opportunity to omit or misstate certain details regarding the Changsha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Valve transaction because the transaction was \u201chighly suspicious and would raise the ire of analysts and investors\u201d and that Siping Fang, individually, stood to benefit financially as a result of certain performance based incentives.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege also that defendants knowingly or recklessly made material misstatements and omissions regarding this transaction based on the facts that: (1) Siping Fang signed the equity transfer agreement on Able Delight\u2019s behalf; (2) the Company disclosed in the November 8-K that it arranged for Qing Lu to form Able Delight; (3) China Valves disclosed to the SEC in a June 10, 2011 letter that Siping Fang solicited Qing Lu\u2019s assistance; (4) Siping Fang attempted to conceal the truth when he stated \u201c[w]e are extremely pleased with the progress we have made in our negotiations with Able Delight\u201d;<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> and (5) the Individual Defendants (excepting Bin Li) had a duty to monitor the transactions and financial statements.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\">Defendants in turn argue that the allegations regarding investor and analyst concern are too general and that Bin Li\u2014 the person obliged to contribute the stock that Fang would receive if the company met certain financial targets \u2014 has an interest in ensuring that Fang would receive the payout only if properly deserved. This, they contend, would serve as a counterweight to any motive possessed by Fang.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> As to knowledge and recklessness, defendants argue that plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that they knew that the failure to report was inappropriate or that the Changsha Valve transaction was material, and that generalized allegations of a duty to monitor are insufficient.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> They further attempt to rebut plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding Siping Fang\u2019s role in the transaction, asserting that his participation merely shows why he \u201chad no reason to believe that [it] ... was, in substance, a related-party transaction as opposed to a structured acquisition negotiated at arm\u2019s length.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motive and opportunity allegations cannot withstand the motions to dismiss. Allegations that a director or officer stands to benefit financially from a company\u2019s improved financial performance are insufficient,<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> as are generalized claims regarding investor concerns.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">The allegations regarding conscious misbehavior and recklessness are more com-</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>pelling. Defendants cite to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>ECA, </em>which held that the plaintiffs there failed sufficiently to allege <em>scienter </em>in the context of a related party 10b-5 claim because they \u201cfail[ed] to allege sufficient facts to support an .inference that JPMC knew that the failure to report Mahonia as a related party was inaccurate.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> But the Second Circuit went on to say that \u201c[i]n order to support this inference, Plaintiffs would have to allege facts showing that JPMC\u2019s transactions with Mahonia were \u2018material.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Although the Court is not convinced that pleading materiality \u2014 thereby triggering the SEC\u2019s disclosure requirements \u2014 is sufficient to support a finding of <em>scienter </em>rather than merely necessary,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Siping Fang\u2019s statement in the February 18, 2010 disclosure that China Valves was \u201cpleased with its progress\u201d in its \u201cnegotiations with Able Delight\u201d sufficiently bolsters plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Fang knew that he was making a material misstatement.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> This statement, which made no logical sense in light of China Valves\u2019 true relationship with Able Delight, of which Siping Fang was undoubtedly aware based on his role in establishing Able Delight, permits an inference that Siping Fang intentionally misled investors to create the illusion of an arms length transaction, as plaintiffs allege.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Finally, plaintiffs adequately have alleged loss causation based on the drop in China Valves\u2019 share price after it filed its November 8-K disclosing, among other things, that the Changsha Valve purchase was a related-party transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">\n<em>Hi. The FCPA Investigation into Changsha Valve</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The Court\u2019s previous dismissal of Bristol\u2019s FCPA-related claim was premised on its failure to allege adequately that the omission was material when Bristol purchased stock in January 2011.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have cured that deficiency, having added allegations that the FCPA violations may have led to inflated revenues, thereby \u201cmaking future earnings potential uncertain\u201d because earlier earnings may have resulted from corruption<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> and because a violation could have resulted \u201cin substantial penalties and liabilities\u201d to China Valves, which assumed successor liability from Watts Water.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Plaintiffs have failed, however, to allege facts sufficient to raise a strong inference of <em>scienter. </em>The CCAC does not allege that anyone at China Valves even knew about the FCPA investigation into Changsha Valve during the Relevant Period. Indeed, plaintiffs state only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201c[t]he fact that Watts Water disclosed the potential FCPA violations to authorities and in its reports filed with the SEC prior to China Valves\u2019 acquisition of Changsha Valve strongly suggests that Watts Water disclosed the investigation and possible violations to China Valves. Alternatively, any amount of due diligence would have uncovered their existence.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> While it is of course possible that Watts Water disclosed the investigation to China Valves and/or that China Valves read Watts Waters\u2019 10-Qs, it is equally possible that China Valves was entirely unaware of the FCPA investigation. Having failed even to allege facts showing that defendants knew about the investigation, plaintiffs have certainly failed to raise a strong inference of <em>scienter.</em><footnotemark><em>103</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\n<em>a. The Hanwei Valve Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">This Court previously dismissed Bristol\u2019s Section 10(b) claim regarding the Hanwei Valve transaction on materiality grounds, having found that \u201cthe related party nature of the Hanwei Valve acquisition boils down to an issue of timing.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have not bolstered their allegation that purchasing Hanwei Valve in two steps versus one step was material. Moreover, plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged why the fact that the transaction appears to have been finalized in October 2010 rather than April 2010 would have been material to either Bristol or Gibbons, both of whom purchased stock after the transfer had been completed. Finally, as is discussed in more detail below, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of material falsity based on discrepancies in China Valves\u2019 SEC and SAIC filings fall short. They argue that defendants incorrectly classified the transaction as a $21 million asset purchase in public statements and SEC filings, but China Valves\u2019 SAIC filings form the only basis for asserting that this was false.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\n<em>b. The Binjie Fang Receivable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">This Court previously dismissed Bristol\u2019s claim that defendants\u2019 failure to disclose ZD Valve\u2019s $322,725 loan to Binjie Fang was a material omission on the grounds that (1) it had not alleged \u201cwhether or when this receivable was collected or that it existed at the time that Bristol purchased stock,\u201d and (2) $322,725 is a negligible amount compared to China Valves\u2019 overall operations.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have not cured these deficiencies. Thus, plaintiffs have failed to allege with particularity facts sufficient to state a Section 10(b) claim as to the Binjie Fang receivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">\n<em>2. China Valves\u2019 2008 and 2009 Financial Results</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">Plaintiffs allege material misstatements in defendants\u2019 2008 and 2009 financial statements filed with the SEC. The Court\u2019s previous opinion dismissed this claim, reasoning that plaintiff failed to allege any plausible basis for believing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the discrepancies were due to anything other than different reporting standards in China and the United States or that the SEC numbers, as opposed to the SAIC numbers, were incorrect.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> The new factual allegations are insufficient to cure these defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 core allegation remains the same: that China Valves\u2019 2008 and 2009 financial results \u2014 specifically, its reported revenue, gross profit, and net income\u2014 must be false because they do not match the company\u2019s SAIC filings. The most significant difference alleged is between China Valves\u2019 2009 net income, which was reported to the SEC as $23,353,093 and to the SAIC as $5,647,195.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> In response to this Court\u2019s prior dismissal, plaintiffs add several new allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">First, they they now allege that the SEC filings are more likely false than the SAIC filings because \u201c[businesses that file false SAIC filings face a variety of penalties, including fines and revocation of the entity\u2019s business license.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> This is entirely unpersuasive. One who submits false SEC filings face the risk of equally if not more severe penalties, including possible imprisonment.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no indication as to whether, how, and to what extent the Chinese government enforces its own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">In addition, plaintiffs fail sufficiently to allege that the filing discrepancies were not due to differences in Chinese and U.S. accounting standards. The CCAC alleges that the Committee of European Securities Regulators (\u201cCESR\u201d) indicated that there were no \u201csignificant differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (\u2018IFRS\u2019) ____ [or] IFRS and Chinese GAAP on revenue recognition,\u201d <footnotemark>111</footnotemark> and that a law firm \u201chas likewise represented to the SEC in an October 27, 2010 letter that: \u2018The basic accounting principles and practice of Chinese GAAP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>are similar to U.S. GAAP.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> It goes on to cite to the revenue recognition rules for the sale of goods in China, alleging that these rules do not differ substantially from U.S. GAAP.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Auditor Defendants argue that plaintiffs misconstrue the CESR report, and the Court agrees.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> The CESR report explains that, as of December 2007, there was \u201ca tentative goal of achieving substantial elements of convergence [between U.S. GAAP and IFRS] by the end of 2008.\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> As to Chinese GAAP, the Committee stated that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201c[H]as only been able to undertake limited work in relation to Chinese GAAP as most of the information available to it has only come from two sources, namely the IASB and the Chinese Ministry of Finance. From this work, CESR concludes that China\u2019s standards (ASBEs) look substantially similar to IFRS mainly as a result of how they have been derived.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">This reveals only that, based on limited information, Chinese GAAP is similar to IFRS, and that U.S. GAAP may or may not have been similar to IFRS by 2008/2009. Plaintiffs\u2019 citation to a law firm\u2019s submission to the SEC on behalf of a client is equally unpersuasive. Thus, plaintiffs have failed to allege adequately a material misrepresentation.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">\n<em>S. China Valves\u2019 Statement of Intent to Change Auditors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">Plaintiffs allege that the Company falsely announced that it was negotiating with a Big Four audit firm to take over for the Auditor Defendants and that it \u201cmaintains \u2018the highest standards of financial transparency.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> As an initial matter, plaintiffs misquote China Valves\u2019 press release, which in fact states that the company is \u201ccommitted to establishing the highest standards of financial transparency.\u201d <footnotemark>119</footnotemark> More importantly, plaintiffs fail to allege any facts suggesting that these statement were false when made. The fact that the Company did not ultimately retain a Big Four audit firm does not permit an inference that it did not intend or attempt to do so at the time it stated that it was seeking such a relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">A <em>Claims Against the Auditor Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) claim against the Auditor Defendants is dismissed, as well. Plaintiffs allege that the Auditor Defendants are liable because their audit opinion regarding China Valves\u2019 financial state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ments included in its 2009 10-K and opinion regarding the Company\u2019s 2007 and 2008 financial statements contained material misstatements and/or omissions, failed to disclose related party transactions, and improperly certified compliance with GAAP and GAAS.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">First, plaintiffs do not state a claim as to the audit opinion regarding either the 2007 or 2008 financial statements. They make no specific allegations that the 2007 financial statements contained material misstatements or omissions. As to the 2008 financial statements, the Court\u2019s prior holding that plaintiffs had not plausibly pled a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves demands dismissal here. The Auditor Defendants\u2019 liability is in an important respect derivative of the Company\u2019s\u2014if plaintiffs have failed to allege a material misstatement or omission in the first place, they have failed to allege that the Auditor Defendants erred in not discovering and/or disclosing the phantom misstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Second, plaintiffs do not state a claim as to the audit opinion in China Valves\u2019 2009 10-K because it was stated as an opinion.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> Where auditors state an opinion, which is inherently subjective, a complaint must \u201callege facts that, if true, would permit a conclusion that [the auditors] either did not in fact hold that opinion or knew that they had no reasonable basis for it\u201d in order to plead a material misstatement or omission.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to suggest that the Auditor Defendants actually believed that the financial statements they certified were false or that their audits failed to comply with GAAP and/or GAAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">\n<em>C. Section 20(a) Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the Individual Defendants are liable as controlling persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">\u201cEvery person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter ... shall also be hable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person whom such controlled person is liable ... unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">To state a claim under Section 20(a), a plaintiff must allege both a primary violation and control over the primary violator, which \u201cmay be established by showing that the defendant possessed \u2018the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Plaintiffs have stated a primary violation with respect to the Changsha Valve transaction. They sufficiently allege Section 20(a) control person liability against Siping Fang, Jianbao Wang, Renrui Tang, Ichi Shih, and Binjie Fang, all of whom held senior management positions in the company. Plaintiffs also state a Section 20(a) claim against the audit committee defendants, Zengbiao Yu, Peter Li, and William Haus, all of whom signed China Valves\u2019 2009 10-K, which contains alleged material misstatements concerning the Changsha Valve transaction.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, however, fail to state a claim against Bin Li whose 34 percent ownership does not qualify him as a control person,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> or Gang Wei, who joined senior management after the alleged misstatements and omissions were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\n<em>III. Securities Act Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJp\">\n<em>A. Elements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">To state a claim under Section 11 of the Securities Act, a plaintiff must allege that: \u201c(1) she purchased a registered security ...; (2) the defendant participated in the offering in a manner sufficient to give rise to liability under section 11; and (3) the registration statement \u2018contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Section 12(a)(2) imposes liability in similar circumstances where \u201c(1) the defendant is a \u2018statutory seller\u2019; (2) the sale was effectuated \u2018by means of a prospectus or oral communication\u2019; and (3) the prospectus or oral communication \u2018includefd] an untrue statement of a material fact or omit[ted] to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> Section 15 imposes liability on persons that \u201ccontrol[] any person liable\u201d under Sections 11 or 12 of the Securities Act.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">\n<em>B. Applicable Pleading Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\"><em>Scienter, </em>reliance, and loss causation are not elements of claims under Sections 11 or 12.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Ordinarily, Rule 8 applies to such claims.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Section 11 and 12 claims that are based on averments of fraud, however, must be pled with particularity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> Rule 9(b) requires that such complaints \u201c(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u201d <footnotemark>133</footnotemark> Pleading fraud and negligence in the alternative is permitted where plaintiffs \u201cdraft a separable two-part complaint.\u201d <footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The Court previously dismissed Bristol\u2019s Section 11 and 12 claims, finding that they did not separate its allegations of fraud and negligence adequately. The CCAC, however, cures this defect, as it is structured in such a way that the fraud allegations are confined in one section, wholly separate and apart from the Section 11 and 12 allegations. Specifically, paragraphs 34 through 142 of the CCAC are devoted to alleging the basic facts of each challenged transaction and statement. This section applies to the entire complaint and is devoid of any allegations of fraud. Paragraphs 143 through 173 recite plaintiffs\u2019 Securities Act allegations, which also avoid any allegations of fraud. Then, in a separate section entitled \u201cDefendants\u2019 False and Misleading Statements Under the Exchange Act,\u201d at paragraphs 174 through 282, plaintiffs state their fraud claims under Section 10(b). This structure is sufficient to avoid triggering Rule 9(b)\u2019s application to the Securities Act claims. As a result, plaintiffs need not plead <em>scienter </em>or loss causation.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\n<em>C. Section 11 Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Plaintiffs allege Section 11 liability against China Valves, Siping Fang, Ichi Shih, Zengbiao Yu, Peter Li, William Haus, Binjie Fang, and the Auditor Defendants for alleged material misstatements in the December 14, 2009 Registration Statement and the related prospectuses filed December 29, 2009, January 4, 2010, and January 5, 2011. These Individual Defendants and China Valves primarily rely on their materiality arguments in seeking to dismiss these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Bristol allegedly purchased China yalves\u2019 stock on January 5, 2011 through the third offering under the December 2009 Registration Statement and thus is entitled to raise a Section 11 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Plaintiffs argue also that Bristol may raise a claim also based on alleged misstatements and omissions in the December 29, 2009 and January 4, 2010 prospectuses also under the Second Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>NECA-IBEW.</em><footnotemark><em>136</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This argument is premature. The question in these motions to dismiss is whether Bristol has stated a cause of action to sue on the various prospectuses. Having purchased stock pursuant to the last prospectus only, it has not stated a Section 11 claim based on the others. Whether it has standing under <em>NECA-IBEW </em>to represent shareholders who purchased pursuant to other prospectuses is a class certification question to be decided, if necessary, in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Because China Valves\u2019 November 8-K cured nearly all of the Company\u2019s previous misstatements regarding the Changsha Valve transaction, the sole remaining omissions that Bristol may allege are that (1) Qing Lu is married to Bin Li and (2) Changsha Valve was under investigation for FCPA violations. This Court already has held that China Valves\u2019 failure to disclose Qing Lu\u2019s relationship to Bin Li is not sufficient, standing alone, to satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the materiality requirement.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Thus, Bristol\u2019s only available Section 11 claim is that China Valves failed to disclose that Changsha Valve was under investigation for FCPA violations in its January 5, 2011 prospectus. These claims lie only against China Valves, Siping Fang, Zengbiao Yu, Peter Li, William Haus, Ichi Shih, and Binjie Fang.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Bristol\u2019s Section 11 claim against the Auditor Defendants is dismissed as well. The claim is premised on the argument that the Offering Documents incorporated the Auditor Defendants\u2019 audit report related to China Valves\u2019 2007 and 2008 financial statements.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, however, do not allege any specific misstatements or omissions in the 2007 financial statements, and the Court has already held that plaintiffs have failed to allege any material misstatements or omissions as to the 2008 financial statements. Accordingly, plaintiffs have not stated a claim against the Auditor Defendants based on their audit opinion.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\n<em>D. Section 12(a)(2) Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF5\">Defendants do not contest that China Valves was a \u201cstatutory seller\u201d under Section 12(a)(2) or that Bristol\u2019s January 5, 2011 purchase was pursuant to a prospectus. Thus, Bristol\u2019s Section 12(a)(2) claim survives to the extent that it relates to China Valves\u2019 failure to disclose Changsha Valve\u2019s potential FCPA liability in the January 5, 2011 prospectus.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\n<em>E. Section 15 Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">For the reasons stated above relating to control under Section 20(a), plaintiffs have adequately alleged control person claims as to all of the Individual Defendants except Bin Li.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the Auditor Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the CCAC [DI 85] is granted in all respects. The motion of China Valves and the Individual Defendants [DI 89] is granted to the extent that</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">1. Claim I is dismissed as to Jianbao Wang and, except insofar as it relates to China Valves\u2019 alleged failure to disclose the FCPA investigation into Changsha Valve, as to China Valves and all other Individual Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">2. Claim II is dismissed as to China Valves except insofar as it relates to China Valves\u2019 alleged failure to disclose the FCPA investigation into Changsha Valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">3. Claim III is dismissed as to Bin Li and, except insofar as it relates to China <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Valves\u2019 alleged failure to disclose the FCPA investigation into Changsha Valve, as to all other Individual Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">4. Claim IV is dismissed as to China Valves and the Individual Defendants, except insofar as it relates to the alleged failure to disclose the alleged related-party nature of the Changsha Valve transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">5.
