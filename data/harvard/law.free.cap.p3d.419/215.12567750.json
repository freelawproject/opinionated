The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision. On September 25, 2017, we denied the insurers' petitions for certiorari, and issued an order approving the COCA opinion for publication styled\n   <em>\n    JP Energy Mktg., L.L.C. v. Commerce and Indus. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , et al., Case No. 115285,\n   <em>\n    consolidated with\n   </em>\n   115,281 and 115293.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 JP Energy subsequently filed a motion seeking appeal related attorney's fees and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   JP Energy maintains it is the prevailing party in the underlying declaratory judgment action and relies on 36 O.S.2011 \u00a7 3629 as authority for such an award. JP Energy posits that it provided proof of loss when it requested insurers provided it with a defense and indemnity from any future losses associated with the Payne County fire. Section 3629 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-9\">\n   A. An insurer shall furnish, upon written request of any insured claiming to have a loss under an insurance contract issued by such insurer, forms of proof of loss for completion by such person, but such insurer shall not, by reason of the requirement so to furnish forms, have any responsibility for or with reference to the completion of such proof or the manner of any such completion or attempted completion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   B. It shall be the duty of the insurer, receiving a proof of loss, to submit a written offer of settlement or rejection of the claim to the insured within ninety (90) days of receipt of that proof of loss. Upon a judgment rendered to either party, costs and attorney fees shall be allowable to the prevailing party. For purposes of this section, the prevailing party is the insurer in those cases where judgment does not exceed written offer of settlement. In all other judgments the insured shall be the prevailing party. If the insured is the prevailing party, the court in rendering judgment shall add interest on the verdict at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per year from the date the loss was payable pursuant to the provisions of the contract to the date of the verdict. This provision shall not apply to uninsured motorist coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Although this Court has not yet rendered a decision on the aforementioned question, the federal courts have awarded attorney fees pursuant to 36 O.S.2011 \u00a7 3629. The Tenth Circuit first examined prevailing party attorney fees in\n   <em>\n    An-Son Corporation v. Holland-America Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348939\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/700/\">\n    767 F.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir.1985). The Circuit Court concluded this Court had historically given \u00a7 3629(B) a broad application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348939\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/700/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348939\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/700/\">\n    at 703-704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    An-Son\n   </em>\n   Court then concluded \u00a7 3629 was applicable to declaratory judgment actions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348939\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/700/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348939\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/700/\">\n    at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Circuit Court emphasized the importance of making an insured whole and rejected the insurer's argument that \u00a7 3629 only applied to \"first party actions where the insured has sustained a loss and the insurer rejects a claim made under the policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Subsequently, in\n   <em>\n    Stauth v.

By succeeding in the declaratory judgment action, Fleming was deemed the prevailing party under \u00a7 3629(B).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11171918\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1260/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11171918\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1260/\">\n    at 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atain Specialty Ins.
