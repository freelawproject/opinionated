We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Stacy Gonzalez rear-ended Anne Price. Price's declaration describes the exchange of information that occurred immediately after:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The driver who hit me was an emotional mess-she was crying, had labored breathing, and was shaking. I was very worried for her. I asked her if she was okay and she said no. She said she had just left her doctor's office\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and her heart was not good. That made me even more worried for her, so I asked again if she as okay. She said no, but that she was on her way to another doctor's appointment. I said that we should call the police or an ambulance but she insisted that we not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   I suggested we exchange information, so we both went to our cars to get that. I didn't have any paper handy, so my mother gave me a receipt that she had, so I could write on the back of it. I walked back to the other driver and she handed me her insurance card; her hand was shaking. I gave her my insurance card and we each wrote down the other's contact information. The other driver did not write down her name and information on a piece of paper and give it to me-she gave me her insurance card and I wrote down her contact info on my mom's slip of paper....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   At no time did the other driver tell me her name, otherwise I would have written it down. The only ID [ (identification) ] she gave me was her insurance card, she did not show me her driver's license. Based on the information the driver handed to me, I believed her name was Sara Gonzalez.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In fact, Sara Gonzalez was Stacy's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 On November 13, 2015, the last day before the statute of limitations expired, Price filed a summons and complaint for personal injuries against\n   <em>\n    Sara\n   </em>\n   Gonzalez. Sara's answer stated that Price had sued the wrong defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 The trial court granted Price leave of court to amend her complaint. On January 27, 2016, over two months after the statute of limitations had expired, Price amended her complaint to name Stacy as a defendant, in addition to Sara and Jose Gonzalez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 4, 2016, within 90 days of the filing of the original complaint, Sara's attorney accepted service on behalf of both Sara and Stacy. On September 2, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss. They argued that the amended complaint did not relate back to the original complaint, because Stacy, the proper defendant, did not receive notice within the statute of limitations period, as required by CR 15(c). The trial court granted this motion, because \"defendant Stacy Gonzalez did not\n   receive notice of the institution of the action mistakenly brought against her mother within the period of time provided by law for commencing the action against her which was three years from the date of the November 13, 2012 accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Price appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 Price makes two arguments. First, she argues that her amended complaint relates back to the original complaint under CR 15(c). Second, she alternatively argues that Washington courts should change their interpretation of CR 15(c) to conform to the federal rule that allows relation back of pleadings within 90 days of the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 The trial court granted summary judgment to Gonzalez, because it found that Stacy did not receive notice of the institution of the action within the statute of limitations, as required by CR 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court reviews de novo a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Lakey v.

Our Supreme Court has described the purpose CR 15(c) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs occasionally sue incorrect defendants by mistake and do not realize who the correct defendants are until after the statute of limitations period expires. We have a court rule that deals with that scenario: CR 15(c). If plaintiffs amend their complaint and meet the requirements of that rule, we treat their amended complaint as \"relat[ing] back to the date of the original pleading,\" and thus timely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Our Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean within the applicable statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20834\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12 Price presents three alternative arguments to satisfy this prong. First, she argues that there is a question of material fact as to whether Stacy had actual notice of the action within the statute of limitations. Second, she argues that knowledge of the action should be imputed from Sara to Stacy due to a \"community of interest.\" Third, she argues that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled under these facts, and, if so, Stacy would be deemed to have received notice within the appropriate limitation period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Actual Notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 13 Price first argues that there is a question of material fact regarding whether Stacy had actual notice of the complaint within the statute of limitations. Price did not serve Stacy within the statute of limitations period. However, she argues that Stacy's affidavit leaves open the question of whether Stacy received actual notice, on November 13, 2015, the date the statute of limitations expired. Price relies on the specific language of Stacy's affidavit: \"\n   <em>\n    Prior to\n   </em>\n   November 13, 2015, I was not aware a lawsuit had been filed against my mother.\" (Emphasis added.) And, Stacy's declaration states that she did not know about the lawsuit\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   November 13, 2015. Price asserts that this alleged ambiguity leaves open the possibility that Stacy received notice of the lawsuit\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   November 13, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 14 But, other portions of the declaration foreclose this interpretation, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Price. Stacy's declaration states that \"it was not until an attorney called my mother about the lawsuit that my mother told me she had been mistakenly sued regarding this accident. I do not recall specifically when this call occurred but\n   <em>\n    it was sometime after November 24, 2015\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Sara's declaration states that the first time she heard about the lawsuit was on a call from an attorney, and that that call occurred \"\n   <em>\n    [s]ubsequent to\n   </em>\n   \" November 13, 2015. (Emphasis added.) Thus, while Stacy did not know of the action\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   November 13, she also did not know of the action until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   November 24. Actual notice has not been established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Community of Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15 Price alternatively argues that knowledge should be imputed to Stacy under a \"community of interest\" between Stacy and Sara. Price cites four cases where courts have imputed knowledge to misnamed parties when a community of interest exists between the named party and the new party. In\n   <em>\n    Perrin\n   </em>\n   , this court found a community of interest between a deceased defendant and the defendant's estate.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004402\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/158/185/#p194\">\n    158 Wash.

These four cases all involve a legal alignment of interests such as that between an insurer and insured, or decedent and estate. But, Price cites no Washington authority where a court has found a community of interest based on a factual circumstance such as cohabitation or a familial relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is insufficient to create a community of interest for the purposes of CR 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Equitable Tolling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 16 Price alternatively argues that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.

Immediately after the accident, Price observed Stacy to be shaken up. Viewing the facts most favorably to Price, Stacy gave Price her insurance card, but not her driver's license, identification, or name. Nothing suggests that Stacy told Price that she was the person named on the insurance card. She merely gave her the card. Price then made an inference. These facts do not meet RCW 46.52.020(3)'s requirements\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   for information exchange following a collision. But, they do not establish bad faith, or any affirmative false assurances that Stacy was Sara. Nor do they suggest reasonable diligence from Price. In the three years following the collision, nothing in the record suggests that Price used the contact information, the insurance card, the vehicle information, or made any other efforts to verify the driver's true identity. Stacy was the registered owner of the vehicle she was driving, and a cursory records search therefore would have shown that Stacy was likely the driver. But, the only act Price took in identifying the driver was inferring the driver's identity from the insurance card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 21 Courts should apply equitable tolling only sparingly.

Under no circumstances shall the rendering of assistance or other compliance with the provisions of this subsection be evidence of the liability of any driver for such accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (4)(a) Any driver covered by the provisions of subsection (1) of this section failing to stop or comply with any of the requirements of subsection (3) of this section in the case of an accident resulting in death is guilty of a class B felony and, upon conviction, is punishable according to chapter 9A.20 RCW.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (b)\n   <strong>\n    Any driver covered by the provisions of subsection (1) of this section failing to stop or comply with any of the requirements of subsection (3) of this section in the case of an accident resulting in injury is guilty of a class C felony and, upon conviction, is punishable according to chapter 9A.20 RCW.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (c) Any driver covered by the provisions of subsection (1) of this section failing to stop or comply with any of the requirements of subsection (3) of this section in the case of an accident involving striking the body of a deceased person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (d) This subsection shall not apply to any person injured or incapacitated by such accident to the extent of being physically incapable of complying with this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (5)\n   <strong>\n    Any driver covered by the provisions of subsection (2) of this section failing to stop or to comply with any of the requirements of subsection (3) of this section under said circumstances shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor:\n   </strong>\n   PROVIDED, That this provision shall not apply to any person injured or incapacitated by such accident to the extent of being physically incapable of complying herewith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (6) The license or permit to drive or any nonresident privilege to drive of any person convicted under this section or any local ordinance consisting of substantially the same language as this section of failure to stop and give information or render aid following an accident with any vehicle driven or attended by any person shall be revoked by the department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (7) If none of the persons specified are in condition to receive the information to which they otherwise would be entitled under subsection (3) of this section, and no police officer is present, the driver of any vehicle involved in such accident after fulfilling all other requirements of subsections (1) and (3) of this section insofar as possible on his or her part to be performed, shall forthwith report such accident to the nearest office of the duly authorized police authority and submit thereto the information specified in subsection (3) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   RCW 46.52.020 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 34 Here, pursuant to RCW 46.52.020, Stacy was legally required to take the affirmative step of furnishing Anne with all of the information necessary to identify herself immediately following the collision. Stacy did not comply with the law. Rather, she provided Anne with the name and insurance information of another individual-her mother-thereby concealing her identity and violating the law. Stacy's refusal to provide her personal information at the scene of the collision was contrary to longstanding public policy and RCW 46.52.020. Her refusal establishes bad faith or false assurances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 35 Conversely, Anne complied with the requirements of RCW 46.52.020 and brought a claim against the individual named on the insurance card that was provided to her at the scene of the collision. Anne was under no legal duty to independently research or verify\n   that the information provided to her at the scene was true. To the contrary, the \"inference\" drawn by Anne in accepting that information as true was one protected by the force of law. No further action was required of Anne to establish that she acted diligently under these circumstances. Her compliance with applicable statutory requirements establishes her diligence, as determined by the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 36 It is untenable that Stacy's violation of the statute's requirements could result in criminal liability but be insufficient to establish bad faith or false assurances in the context of a civil action. Such a result does nothing to advance the purposes of either the statute of limitation or the hit and run statute. Today's decision, in fact, undercuts the legislature's goal in passing the hit and run statute. Rather than penalizing the noncompliant, the majority deems them worthy of windfalls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 37 I disagree that our legislature intends to allow criminals who successfully conceal their identities to escape civil liability for their tortious actions. Stacy's noncompliance with the requirements of RCW 46.52.020 establishes bad faith or false assurances. Anne's compliance with the statute, standing alone, is sufficient to establish that she acted with diligence. Accordingly, I would hold that the statutory limitation period was equitably tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 38 It is not just to incentivize criminality. It is not just to deny recompense to the victim of criminality. I would reverse the order of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The trial court's order was effectively a grant of summary judgment. Accordingly, all reasonable inferences are drawn in the light most favorable to Anne Price, the nonmoving party.\n    <em>\n     Lakey v.
