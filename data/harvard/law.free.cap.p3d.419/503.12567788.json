Crashley (the decedent), brought a wrongful death action against CRST Expedited, Inc. (CRST), a commercial trucking company, and two of its drivers. Ms. Wood alleged the drivers illegally and negligently parked a CRST semi tractor-trailer in an I-80 emergency lane and caused the decedent's death when the vehicle he was driving collided with the tractor-trailer. The district court found that parking the tractor-trailer in the emergency lane was not, based on the undisputed facts, a proximate cause of the accident, and entered summary judgment in favor of Appellees. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Ms. Wood presents a single issue on appeal, which we rephrase as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Were there disputed issues of material fact that precluded the district court's entry of summary judgment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] At around midnight on the night of February 10, 2014, Jared Chavez and Luis Fontanez-Bermudez, two CRST drivers, set out from Salt Lake City, Utah, driving a CRST tractor-trailer eastbound on I-80. Mr. Chavez took the first driving shift while Mr. Fontanez-Bermudez slept in the sleeper berth. At around 6:45 a.m., on February 11th, approximately one mile west of Rawlins, Mr. Chavez pulled over, parked the tractor-trailer in the emergency lane, turned on the tractor-trailer's hazard lights, and informed Mr. Fontanez-Bermudez that he felt drowsy and wanted to change drivers. Mr. Chavez parked the tractor-trailer such that portions of the rig were within ten inches of the eastbound lanes of I-80. The location where Mr. Chavez parked the tractor-trailer was 1.05 miles past an off ramp leading to a truck stop, and .85 miles from the next highway exit. Multiple signs leading up to the location where Mr. Chavez pulled over indicated that parking was not allowed except for \"emergency\" purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Within minutes after Mr. Chavez stopped the tractor-trailer, the decedent, driving a Mazda CX-9 at or near highway speeds, collided with the rear of the tractor-\n   trailer. The speed limit on that portion of the highway was 75 m.p.h. It appears to be undisputed that the tractor-trailer was parked completely within the emergency lane at the time of the collision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, the road was dry, and it was dawn, with the sun still below the horizon. There were no signs that the decedent braked or attempted to avoid the collision, and it is not known why the decedent failed to maintain his proper lane of travel. The decedent suffered immediately fatal injuries, and Mr. Chavez was cited for illegally parking in an emergency lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] On January 26, 2016, Ms. Wood filed a wrongful death complaint against CRST, Mr. Chavez, and Mr. Fontanez-Bermudez, followed by an amended complaint on February 4, 2016. Ms. Wood alleged that Mr. Chavez and Mr. Fontanez-Bermudez were negligent in their illegal parking of the CRST tractor-trailer in the I-80 emergency lane. She further alleged that CRST was negligent in its training and supervision of its drivers and was also vicariously liable for the drivers' negligence. Appellees filed timely answers to the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] On November 17, 2016, Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. Appellees asserted they were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because Mr. Chavez's act of parking in the emergency lane, even if illegal, was not the proximate cause of the decedent's accident. On January 11, 2017, Ms. Wood filed her opposition to Appellees' summary judgment motion. After a hearing, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment.

According to one respected commentator:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The central goal of the proximate cause requirement is to limit the defendant's liability to the kinds of harms he risked by his negligent conduct. Judicial decisions about proximate cause rules thus attempt\n   to discern whether, in the particular case before the court, the harm that resulted from the defendant's negligence is so clearly outside the risks he created that it would be unjust or at least impractical to impose liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The most general and pervasive approach to proximate cause holds that a negligent defendant is liable for all the general kinds of harms he foreseeably risked by his negligent conduct and to the class of persons he put at risk by that conduct. Conversely, he is not a proximate cause of, and not liable for injuries that were unforeseeable. This does not mean that the defendant must be the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. On the contrary, several wrongdoers are frequently proximate causes of harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dan B.

The parties offer differing perspectives on that issue. Appellant contends that the proper test of proximate cause involves an analysis of the relationship between the conduct of Mr. Chavez in illegally parking on the shoulder of the highway and the injuries suffered by the decedent. \"The focus of the analysis is whether 'reasonable minds' can reach different conclusions regarding the proximate cause of [the decedent's] death.\" Appellees contend that Appellant must establish that the act of parking on the shoulder caused the decedent to lose control of his vehicle. According to Appellees: \"[P]arking on the side of the road would not, in ordinary experience, be expected to cause someone to leave the lanes of travel. As such, parking on the side of the road cannot be a cause of this accident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court applied the standard proposed by Appellees and set forth the basis for its decision in the order granting summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant[s'] parking at that spot and time, whether or not it was legal, simply did not cause this accident. Nothing about parking in the emergency lane caused [the decedent] to drive into the back of the trailer. While it greatly aggravated the consequences of [the decedent's] conduct, Defendants' unlawful stop in the emergency lane did not cause [the decedent] to leave the lanes of travel in his vehicle and drive in the emergency lane.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For reasons that we explain below, we must conclude that the district court did not apply the proper standard. Appellant is not required to prove that parking on the shoulder of the highway caused the decedent to lose control of his vehicle. Rather, he must prove that parking on the shoulder of the road was a proximate cause of his injuries. \"[T]he ultimate test of proximate cause is foreseeability of\n   <strong>\n    injury.\n   </strong>\n   In order to qualify as a legal cause, the conduct must be a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff's\n   <strong>\n    injuries\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Lucero v.

Stated in terms of the allegations in this case, the questions that must be answered are: Did Mr. Chavez owe a duty to the decedent and others similarly situated? Did he breach that duty by parking his tractor-trailer rig on the shoulder of I-80? Did breach of that duty proximately cause injury to the decedent? Ostensibly, this appeal involves only the issue of proximate cause but, in this case, a proper proximate cause determination cannot be made without exploration of the duty owed to the decedent. Duty, like proximate cause, involves the question of foreseeability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The primacy of foreseeability in determining whether a duty exists has been echoed by numerous courts and commentators.

Generally a defendant owes a duty of care to all persons who are foreseeably endangered by his conduct with respect to all risks which make the conduct unreasonably dangerous.

Drivers are supposed to control their vehicles and keep them on the traveled roadway, but common experience shows they do not always do so. Freeway drivers may be intoxicated, distracted, blinded by the weather or sun, sleepy or sick, and for any of these reasons or others may drive off the roadway. Mechanical problems with their vehicles can also force motorists to suddenly leave the freeway. If they do so at freeway speeds and collide with another vehicle parked alongside the road, they are likely to be injured or injure other occupants of the vehicles, or both. This general foreseeability is reflected in the Official Reports, in that numerous decisions have involved collisions between vehicles leaving a highway and vehicles or other obstacles on the roadside.

Where they cannot be removed, relocated or redesigned to bend or break, they are to be protected with guardrails or similar devices. The Ralphs transportation manager in charge of driver training and discipline testified that when he learned Ralphs drivers were stopping on the freeway side for nonemergency reasons he instructed them not to do so. He regarded such stopping as a danger to the drivers themselves and to other motorists \"should they leave the roadway.\" The existence of guidelines seeking to keep the shoulder area free of massive obstacles supports a conclusion the possibility of vehicles leaving the freeway and colliding with obstacles is generally foreseeable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=572%20N.E.2d%201043\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20313\">\n    122 Cal.Rptr.3d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=248%20P.3d%201170\">\n    248 P.3d at 1177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b613] The court also rejected a defense claim that there was not a sufficiently close connection between the defendant's negligence and the collision.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Unlike the situations in\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   -and\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   -no third party negligence intervened between the Ralphs driver's negligent conduct and Adelelmo Cabral's injury.

Would the categorical exemption Ralphs seeks still apply if a tractor-trailer driver parked an inch from the traffic lanes, on the outside of a curve, leaving the rig there all night without lights? To ask these questions is to see why a categorical exemption is not appropriate.

The danger described in\n   <em>\n    Cabral\n   </em>\n   is reflected in the report of Appellant's expert. He noted that the posted speed limit was 75 m.p.h., and that the damage to the decedent's vehicle was \"consistent with an impact at freeway speeds.\" The tractor-trailer was stationary and \"during the collision [the decedent's vehicle] would have sustained a change in velocity of between 56 and 74 mph.\" Based upon his review of the accident scene and highway crash statistics, he opined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [i]t is unknown if the tractor-trailer had not been illegally parked, if [decedent's vehicle] would have continued to travel off of the paved shoulder and onto the grassy shoulder of the highway or if he would have remained on the shoulder and brought his vehicle to a safe stop.

Under our precedent, however, actors are responsible not only for the likely consequences of their acts or omissions, but also for the consequences that \"might reasonably be anticipated\" - that is, those consequences that are reasonably foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lemos v.

He brought suit against the seller of the fuel\n   seeking to recover the cost of his hay baler and additional damages. The case was tried before a judge sitting without a jury. The judge found in favor of the seller after determining that \"Defendants' delivery of the wrong fuel was not a proximate cause of the fire.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10418449\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/703/1089/#p1092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10418449\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/703/1089/#p1092\">\n    703 P.2d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under such a scheme, in theory at least, a defendant who is but one percent responsible still pays one percent of the plaintiff's damages, since liability is determined by degree of responsibility, whatever that degree is found to be. Despite the popularity of this idea among legal theorists, the wave of adoptions of pure comparative systems between 1973 and 1984-during which time a dozen states adopted such a system-proved short-lived, and no state has adopted a pure form since 1984.

Although the contributory negligence rule created inequity by placing too stringent a line on plaintiff's fault, pure comparative negligence posits no line at all.

At the time of the accident, the CRST vehicle was parked entirely within the emergency lane, with its tractor and trailer hazard lights flashing, and had been parked for about two minutes. The accident occurred entirely within the right shoulder of the highway, with Decedent colliding with the CRST vehicle at a near zero-degree angle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's expert reconstructed the accident as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   An analysis of the damage sustained by the Mazda during the impact shows that the forward plane of the Mazda struck the rear of the semi-trailer with the Mazda offset approximately one foot to the left of the trailer. During the collision the Mazda travelled far enough under the trailer that the front of the Mazda contacted the trailer axles, breaking them from their mountings and driving them forwards. The Mazda also traveled far enough under the trailer that the passenger side A and B pillars were sheered through and the C pillar was pushed rearward into the D pillar above the rear axle. The damage suggests the Mazda impacted the tractor-trailer at an angle relatively close to 0\u00b0&gt;; however, due to the slight offset, the Mazda rotated clockwise as its center of gravity attempted to move around the obstacle created by the semi-trailer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   An inspection of the crash site was performed on May 30, 2014. During this inspection a gouge mark was found on the right shoulder and was measured to be 2.0 feet from the center of the white road edge line. A fluid stain was found at the same location which was on the shoulder and 1.4 feet from the white edge line. This evidence supports the opinion that the collision occurred within the right shoulder of the highway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   [\u00b649] Plaintiff's expert opined that Decedent was traveling at highway speeds of between 56 and 74 mph when his vehicle collided with the CRST vehicle.

Civil twilight indicates the time at which terrestrial objects can be easily distinguished without the aid of artificial lighting. Due to the lighting conditions and flatness of the roadway approaching the parked tractor-trailer, [decedent] should have been able to see the tractor-trailer parked on the side of the roadway. Although he was traveling due east, the sun would have still been below the horizon and would not have caused problems with visibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   [\u00b650] Under these circumstances, reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of proximate cause. Decedent's driving at highway speeds in the emergency lane was not foreseeable as a natural and probable consequence of Mr. Chavez's illegal parking, and Mr. Chavez's conduct thus did not put into motion a \"natural and continuous sequence\" of events that led to Decedent's accident and injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amos\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841550\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/359/954/\">\n    359 P.3d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lucero\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982176\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/288/1228/\">\n    288 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1235 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   [\u00b651] Nor was Decedent's conduct a foreseeable intervening cause as defined by Wyoming law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amos\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841550\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/359/954/\">\n    359 P.3d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lucero\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982176\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/288/1228/\">\n    288 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1235 ) (an intervening cause \"is reasonably foreseeable if it is a probable consequence of the defendant's wrongful act or is a normal response to the stimulus of the situation created thereby\").

The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   The judgment must be reversed. The trial court evidently concluded that the driver might have stopped the truck elsewhere, where it could have been entirely off the roadway, and therefore held as a matter of law that the driver was negligent in parking contrary to sec. 85.19(1). Even if the parking of the truck was negligent as a matter of law, it did not cause this accident. That the driver of the car in which respondent was a guest was startled by the sudden coming of the following westbound car is beyond question. Had he held his course and refrained from turning toward the parked truck, no collision would have taken place. The evidence shows that ample room existed for both cars to pass the truck. Twenty-two feet of highway, seven feet more than that required by sec. 85.19(1) when parking on the roadway is allowed, was left open for the passage of other vehicles south of the parked truck. As suggested by appellant, \"The situation presented by the parked truck was one to which the plaintiff's host had completely and safely adjusted himself.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   The driver's sudden loss of control of his car was due to a cause disassociated from and in no way connected with the position of the standing truck or its lack of motion. If the truck had been moving at the time of the accident, if the driver, intending to park on the shoulder, for instance, had been in the act of steering the truck off the roadway, there would be no negligence on his part; then it would be clear that the position of the truck would not be the cause of an accident occurring as this one did.

The only justification the majority offers for this break from precedent is a concern that upholding the district court's summary judgment ruling would have the effect of creating a class of negligence, illegal parking, that has immunity from liability. I do not see the district court's ruling as having that effect, and in my view, the result of the majority opinion itself is to create its own special class of negligent acts. Rather than relying on our customary individualized analysis of causation to determine whether a question of fact exists on the facts before us, the majority announces a rule that if a defendant is illegally parked and is struck by another vehicle, no matter how inexplicable the other driver's conduct and no matter how tenuous the connection between the illegal parking and the accident, proximate cause will always be a jury question. I prefer to adhere to our precedent and practice and take each of these cases as they come and on their own individual circumstances. In that regard I agree with the observation by another Illinois appellate court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   Just because a person happens to be in a location where an accident occurs does not make him a proximate cause of the accident. ... We are by no means advocating an absolute rule that a parked vehicle can never be a proximate cause of an accident.
