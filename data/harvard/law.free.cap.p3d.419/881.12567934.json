Nevertheless, the district court allowed the State to reduce $18,733 to a civil judgment, which Ms. McEwan challenges.

Following Ms. McEwan's no-contest plea to one of the three charges, the district court fixed restitution at $18,733. Ms. McEwan filed a motion requesting that the district court find she was unable to pay the restitution. At a hearing on the motion, Ms. McEwan presented evidence that the Social Security Administration had declared her to be disabled, she lived on a fixed income, and she had recently been granted a discharge in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings. The prosecutor acknowledged that the State had no evidence to rebut Ms. McEwan's current inability to pay restitution. However, the prosecutor pointed out that Ms. McEwan may have the ability to pay restitution in the future:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ... certainly the State would ask that Ms. McEwan be required to pay [restitution] ... [and] if the Court determines that there is an inability to pay, at this time, certainly the State would ask that this be reduced to a judgment, that the victim could be given a right to any type of civil remedy at any later date, that would include whether it was garnishment or seizure of property, if that were to come available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] At the end of the hearing, the district court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I don't think it is probably unreasonable to [find Ms. McEwan unable to pay]; but likewise, I don't think the State's request is unreasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Situations change all the time and in the event that it does, I think the State should clearly have the right to come back civilly and attempt to collect that. So I am going to grant your request but I am also going to allow the State to reduce that to a civil judgment and leave it at that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] Six weeks later, the district court issued an \"Order on Sentencing and Reconsideration of Defendant's Inability to Pay Restitution.\" The order fixed the amount of Ms. McEwan's restitution at $18,733 but did not require her to pay it, finding that she lacked the ability to do so. Ms. McEwan appeals the district court's oral pronouncement allowing the State to reduce $18,733 to a civil judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b66] Ms. McEwan argues that the district court exceeded its statutory authority when it allowed the State to reduce $18,733 to a civil judgment. She contends that only an order to pay restitution may be executed as a civil judgment, and the district court did not issue one. Ms. McEwan thus urges us to strike the portion of the district court's oral ruling that allows the State to seek a civil judgment. The State argues that the district court was statutorily required to order restitution, and we should remand the case to the district court to enter an order for restitution. With an order in place, the State would\n   be permitted to execute it as a civil judgment against Ms. McEwan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b67] We generally confine our review of restitution orders to a search for procedural error or a clear abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Aldridge v.
