Scholes (\n   <strong>\n    Evelyn Scholes\n   </strong>\n   ) and Evelyn Wong (\n   <strong>\n    Wong\n   </strong>\n   ) as Co-Trustees of the Scholes Family Trust (collectively\n   <strong>\n    Scholes/Wong\n   </strong>\n   ) brought this action in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to eject Defendants-Appellants Kiyoshi Kawaguchi (Kiyoshi) and Sung Sook Kawaguchi (collectively the\n   <strong>\n    Kawaguchis\n   </strong>\n   ) from property located on Wanaka Street in Honolulu.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 15, 2015, the District Court entered a Judgment for Possession and a Writ of Possession in favor of Scholes/Wong and against the Kawaguchis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Kawaguchis appeal and contend that the District Court erred by: (1) concluding it had jurisdiction and thus denying the Kawaguchis' motion to dismiss or, alternatively, for a stay of the proceedings (hereafter motion to dismiss); (2) concluding that a certificate of title for the property conclusively established that title was held by the Scholes Family Trust, regardless of claims asserted by Kiyoshi in a separate action filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court); and (3) denying the Kawaguchis' motion for reconsideration and two motions to continue the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we conclude the Kawaguchis sufficiently demonstrated there was an issue of title regarding the property such that the District Court lacked jurisdiction. We thus vacate the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession, and remand to the District Court for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 6, 2015, Scholes/Wong filed a Complaint for Ejectment in the District Court against the Kawaguchis alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that: the Scholes Family Trust is the record title owner of the property; the property is registered property in Land Court with Transfer Certificate of Title No. 779,343; a Warranty Deed recorded on November 10, 2005, evidences the conveyance of the property to the Scholes Family Trust; Kiyoshi, son of Evelyn Scholes, has occupied the property since 1980 and the Kawaguchis currently occupy the property but do not pay rent; the Kawaguchis were advised that their occupancy was terminated by letter dated December 3, 2014; and the Kawaguchis have neglected, failed, and refused to vacate the property. Exhibits attached to the Complaint\n   for Ejectment include: a Short Form Trust, dated September 23, 2014, for the Scholes Family Trust (dated September 18, 2003) naming Evelyn Scholes as Settlor/Co-Trustee and Wong as Co-Trustee; a certificate of title issued on November 10, 2005, which identifies the registered owner of the property as Edward Scholes, Trustee and Evelyn Scholes, Trustee, Trustees of the Scholes Family Trust; and a Warranty Deed recorded on November 10, 2005, which conveyed Edward Scholes and Evelyn Scholes's interest in the property to the Scholes Family Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 21, 2015, the Kawaguchis filed the motion to dismiss, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (\n   <strong>\n    HRS\n   </strong>\n   ) \u00a7 604-5(d) (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Kawaguchis asserted that the District Court did not have jurisdiction in this case because title to the property was in question. Attached to the motion was Kiyoshi's affidavit, in which he attested in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I claim title to the [property] that is subject to this ejectment action. I was promised the property by my mother, Plaintiff Evelyn K. Scholes, and her husband Edward A. Scholes, and in reliance upon the agreement made improvements to the property, nearly tripling the size of the house on the property and generating a source of rental income. Exhibit \"A\" is a true and correct copy of a Verified Complaint, which is being filed in Circuit Court, setting forth the basis for my claim to title to the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The verified Circuit Court complaint (Circuit Court complaint)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   attached to Kiyoshi's affidavit asserted claims by him against Evelyn Scholes, Individually and as Co-Trustee of the restated Scholes Family Trust, and Wong, as Co-Trustee of the restated Scholes Family Trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kiyoshi's Circuit Court complaint alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that: sometime after 1980, Kiyoshi made improvements to the property at the request of Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes and in reliance on their promise that the property would be given to Kiyoshi in consideration for the improvements; the improvements made by Kiyoshi expanded the size of the home from approximately 900 square feet to nearly 3,000 square feet; Evelyn and Edward Scholes moved to Las Vegas and obtained a loan secured by the property to purchase their Las Vegas home; although Kiyoshi did not pay rent while residing at the property, he screened tenants, rented portions of the home, and remitted rental proceeds to Evelyn Scholes; Kiyoshi also paid for repairs and upkeep of the property, and would not have paid for and made improvements but for the promises that he would be given the property; in 1992, Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes transferred the property to Kiyoshi, Evelyn Scholes, and Edward Scholes to hold as joint tenants; in 2003, Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes wanted to refinance the debt secured by the property and obtain a mortgage loan solely in their name, and thus the property was transferred back to Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes by way of a Warranty Deed recorded on August 29, 2003 (2003 Warranty Deed); Kiyoshi did not intend to divest himself of his interest in the property and only intended to accommodate his mother and her husband so that they could refinance the home at a better interest rate; when the property was transferred back to Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes in 2003, Kiyoshi\n   did not receive any consideration for his interest in the property; and subsequently, in 2005, Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes transferred the property to the Scholes Family Trust by way of a deed recorded on November 10, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kiyoshi's Circuit Court complaint asserts claims for: breach of contract, equitable lien, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty/constructive trust. The Circuit Court complaint seeks,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   specific performance requiring conveyance of the property to Kiyoshi, as well as damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 9, 2015, the District Court filed an \"Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Complaint For Ejectment\" (\n   <strong>\n    Order Denying Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n   ) concluding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a) that title to the subject property is registered in the Land Court in Plaintiffs' name,\n   <em>\n    which is dispositive\n   </em>\n   ; b) that Defendants have failed to raise an issue of title sufficient to oust this court of jurisdiction over the ejectment claim; and c) that Defendants' filing of a Notice of Pendency of Action has no effect to either stay or dismiss the proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 19, 2015, the Kawaguchis filed a motion for reconsideration of the Order Denying Motion to Dismiss. The motion for reconsideration was denied without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Kawaguchis subsequently filed two motions to continue trial in the District Court. In the first motion, submitted on June 23, 2015, the Kawaguchis pointed to\n   <em>\n    Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n    107 Hawai'i 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n    110 P.3d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) and argued that the Hawai'i Supreme Court had recognized that a certificate of title could be challenged in cases of fraud to which the party holding title is a party. The Kawaguchis noted that in\n   <em>\n    Aames\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court discussed-three types of fraud: (1) fraud in the factum; (2) fraud in the inducement; and (3) constructive fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n    at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n    110 P.3d at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Kawaguchis further noted that\n   <em>\n    Aames\n   </em>\n   described \"constructive fraud\" as \"characterized by the breach of a fiduciary or confidential relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n    at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259714\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/95/\">\n    110 P.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Kawaguchis reasserted that Kiyoshi's Circuit Court complaint included a claim for breach of a confidential relationship between Kiyoshi, his mother, and her husband, and that Kiyoshi seeks specific performance requiring conveyance of title to him. This motion to continue trial was denied on June 24, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In their second motion to continue trial, submitted on June 29, 2015, the Kawaguchis relied upon declarations by their counsel, Ann C. Kemp (\n   <strong>\n    Kemp\n   </strong>\n   ). Kemp attested that through discovery in the Circuit Court action, Kiyoshi had learned that the notary book for the notary who purportedly notarized Kiyoshi's signature on the 2003 Warranty Deed, which transferred the property out of his name, did not actually contain an entry regarding the Warranty Deed. Kemp's declaration again cites to\n   <em>\n    Aames\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that fraud is a valid basis to challenge a certificate of title. Kemp further attested that, based on the recent discovery regarding the notary book, Kiyoshi would be seeking to amend the Circuit Court complaint to allege forgery and that this would be a further basis for the fraud-based claims he was pursuing in the Circuit Court. This second motion to continue trial was denied on June 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The case proceeded to bench trial and on July 15, 2015, the District Court entered the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession. The Kawaguchis timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As an initial matter, this court granted Scholes/Wong's motion to file supplemental briefs as to whether this appeal is moot. In their supplemental brief filed on March 8, 2017, Scholes/Wong argue this appeal is moot based on orders entered by the Circuit Court after this appeal was initiated, which dismiss most of Kiyoshi's claims against them in the Circuit Court action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scholes/Wong contend\n   that, given the Circuit Court orders, there are no remaining claims that place title to the property in question because the only claims remaining are for monetary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under the mootness doctrine:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   the suit must remain alive throughout the course of litigation to the moment of final appellate disposition. Its chief purpose is to assure that the adversary system, once set in operation, remains properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal-adverse interest and effective remedy-have been compromised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    119 Hawai'i 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    193 P.3d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 843 (2008) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Circuit Court orders that Scholes/Wong rely upon for their mootness argument are interlocutory orders and Scholes/Wong do not assert that a final judgment has been entered in the Circuit Court. Moreover, in opposing the mootness argument, the Kawaguchis assert that Kiyoshi intends to appeal once a final judgment is issued in the Circuit Court action. It is unclear at this time whether Kiyoshi will seek and obtain a stay of any judgment entered in the Circuit Court action pending an appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 62 of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Given these circumstances, Kiyoshi's claims in the Circuit Court related to a constructive trust, rescission of the 2003 Warranty Deed, and specific performance do not appear to be finally adjudicated such that there is an enforceable judgement as to title to the property. Therefore, this appeal is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Kawaguchis contend that the District Court erred by entering the Order Denying Motion to Dismiss, because the District Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to HRS \u00a7 604-5(d) after the Kawaguchis raised a question of title to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its Order Denying Motion to Dismiss, the District Court concluded,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"title to the subject property is registered in the Land Court in Plaintiffs' name, which is dispositive\" and \"[d]efendants have failed to raise an issue of title sufficient to oust this court of jurisdiction over the ejectment claim[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   HRS \u00a7 604-5(d) provides in pertinent part that \"[t]he district courts shall not have cognizance of real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate comes in question[.]\" Further, District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass or for the summary possession of land, or any other action, the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action, or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written motion, which shall not be received by the court unless accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by defendant to the land in question, and such further particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature of defendant's claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thus, \"[u]nder the plain language of Rule 12.1, an affidavit that raises a defense to the court's jurisdiction must set forth the source, nature, and extent of the title claimed by defendant and further particulars sufficient to fully apprise the court of the nature of\n   defendant's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.

Kiyoshi claims that he relied on this promise in making significant improvements\n   to the property, including increasing the size of the house from about 900 square feet to nearly 3,000 square feet. He claims his mother and her husband moved to Las Vegas and obtained a loan, secured by the property, to purchase their Las Vegas home.

Kemp attested in relevant part that, in the Circuit Court action, she had subpoenaed the notary book for the notary who purportedly had notarized Kiyoshi's signature on the 2003 Warranty Deed, which removed Kiyoshi from title to the property. Kemp attested that upon production of the relevant documents, there was no entry in the notary book related to the 2003 Warranty Deed. Additionally, Kemp attested there was no entry for a mortgage and finance statement purportedly signed by Wong in 2003 as attorney in fact for Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes. Kemp attested that Kiyoshi was seeking to amend his Circuit Court complaint to add claims based on forgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Kiyoshi's Circuit Court complaint asserted that he was on title to the property prior to the 2003 Warranty Deed. He further asserted that the 2003 Warranty Deed, which removed him from title, conveyed the property to Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes and he received no consideration for his interest in the property. Kiyoshi further asserts that in 2005, Evelyn Scholes and Edward Scholes conveyed the property to the Scholes Family Trust. HRS \u00a7 501-106(b) provides in part that a new certificate of title \"procured by the presentation of a forged deed or other instrument, shall be void.\" Kemp's declaration regarding potential forgery of Kiyoshi's signature on the 2003 Warranty Deed, along with the existing record in the case, raised another fraud-based claim that could challenge whether the certificate of title held by the Scholes Family Trust is valid. In short, Kiyoshi sufficiently set forth the source, nature and extent of title that he claimed and the particulars to fully apprise the District Court of the nature of his claim.\n   <em>\n    Peelua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312498\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/126/32/#p36\">\n    126 Hawai'i at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312498\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/126/32/#p36\">\n    265 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1132 ; DCRCP Rule 12.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We thus conclude that Kiyoshi's assertion of forgery related to the 2003 Warranty Deed, supported by Kemp's declarations and the existing record, provided an additional ground to establish that the District Court lacked jurisdiction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

This case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Honorable Michael K.

The Circuit Court complaint was later filed on April 21, 2015, the same day the Kawaguchis' motion to dismiss was filed in District Court. A filed copy of the Circuit Court complaint was thereafter attached to Scholes/Wong's opposition to the Kawaguchis' motion to dismiss.

Scholes.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Scholes/Wong submit with their supplemental brief a First Amended Complaint filed by Kiyoshi in the Circuit Court on October 20, 2015. In addition to the claims asserted in the original Circuit Court complaint (breach of contract, equitably lien, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty/constructive trust), the First Amended Complaint added allegations that Kiyoshi did not sign the 2003 Warranty Deed and that \"[u]pon information and belief, although the purported signature of [Kiyoshi] on the 2003 Warranty Deed was notarized, the book maintained by the notary who purportedly notarized his signature contains no record of [Kiyoshi's] signature being notarized.\" The First Amended Complaint asserts additional claims for: rescission of the 2003 Warranty Deed; declaratory relief; and injunctive relief. Like the original Circuit Court complaint, the First Amended Complaint requests specific performance and damages. Scholes/Wong also attach Circuit Court orders which dismiss the claims for breach of fiduciary duty/constructive trust, breach of contract, rescission, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The reference to \"section 5041\" in the quote is a reference to Revised Laws of Hawai'i (RLH) \u00a7 5041 (1935), which is a predecessor statute to HRS \u00a7 501-82 (2006 and 2016 Supp.).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Although\n    <em>\n     Aames\n    </em>\n    discusses the types of fraud recognized in the mortgage context, and this case does not involve a mortgage foreclosure, the discussion about fraud in\n    <em>\n     Aames\n    </em>\n    is nevertheless pertinent here.
