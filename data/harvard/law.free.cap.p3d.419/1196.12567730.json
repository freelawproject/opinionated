A jury found Colburn guilty on all charges. Colburn appealed and this Court reversed his convictions and remanded for a new trial based on the District Court's application of the \"rape shield\" law, \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA. Following remittitur, the District Court held a status hearing. The State expressed its intention to retry the case. Colburn's trial counsel stated he had not been served with remittitur and that this was the first indication he had that the State intended to retry the case. Appellate counsel had been served. The same judge who presided over Colburn's first jury trial and his separate trial for possession and attempted possession of child pornography charges, was set to preside over his second trial. Trial counsel expressed the desire to substitute the judge and acknowledged his failure to move for the substitution within the twenty-day time limit. The District Court allowed trial counsel to file a late written motion for substitution with an explanation for the delay. On May 27, 2016, the District Court denied the motion for substitution as untimely, without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Prior to the second trial, trial counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of Colburn's use of his computer to look for child pornography and evidence concerning his alleged possession of child pornography. The District Court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The second trial took place on October 3, 4, 5, and 7, 2016. During trial, a State Computer Crime Unit agent testified regarding his examination of Colburn's Internet search activity. The agent testified that the computer showed significant and repeated searches and visitation to websites that offer stories and material related to incest or sexual activities with children. The District Court precluded the actual content of the websites from being shown to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The jury found Colburn not guilty of incest, but guilty of the other three charges. The District Court sentenced Colburn to concurrent fifty-year terms of imprisonment for each conviction. Colburn appeals the denial of trial counsel's late motion to substitute the District Court judge and the denial of his motion to exclude evidence regarding the Internet search terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 District courts are vested with broad discretion in controlling the admission of evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    Seltzer v.

The District Court, in a six-page written order, determined the State was not seeking admission of the evidence to show propensity, inappropriate character evidence, or that because he searched for child pornography or incest that Colburn had the tendency to commit a particular kind of wrongdoing. The District Court determined that the evidence was relevant and admissible under Montana law. The District Court then conducted a M. R. Evid. 403 balancing test and determined the evidence was not unfairly inflammatory or unfairly prejudicial. Further, the District Court found that excluding the evidence would create an unfair or incomplete picture for the jury's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 On appeal, Colburn asserts that evidence of repeated Internet searches for the terms \"dad and daughter sex,\" \"mom and son sex,\" \"preteen tube,\" \"preteen pussy,\" and \"daughter and sister sex,\" does not reveal a motive to inflict hands-on abuse or that he abused the young girls by accident or mistake. The State argues the evidence was relevant, and was used for a non-propensity purpose to prove the identity of the perpetrator as Colburn, Colburn's intent and mental state, and lack of a mistake or accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Montana Rule of Evidence 404(b) prohibits the admission of prior crimes, wrongs or acts \"to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" However, M.

The District Court allowed Colburn to present this evidence on retrial, thereby putting Colburn's identity at issue. Colburn specifically and intentionally put into trial the question of the identity of the perpetrator of these crimes. Colburn's search history revealed over a hundred searches for this content conducted at all hours of the day, and sometimes in the presence of his daughter and other children, during the same period these children were sexually abused. Evidence of Colburn's pervasive and specific sexual interest in incest and sexual abuse-related child pornography was relevant and probative of his identity as the perpetrator of incest against his daughter. At the very least, the evidence was relevant and admissible under M. R.

The brief fails to cite a single case lending support to his position that appellate counsel's performance was deficient. The failure to provide notice of remittitur is not an error so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Colburn has failed to establish that appellate counsel's performance fell below \"an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances,\" nor has he overcome the \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitlow\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 26 Colburn bears the burden of establishing both prongs of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , and has failed to demonstrate that appellate counsel's performance was deficient.
