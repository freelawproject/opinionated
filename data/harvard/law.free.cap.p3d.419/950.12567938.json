Because we conclude the officer complied with the statutory requirements for obtaining a breath test, the respondent judge correctly reversed the city court's ruling, albeit for reasons other than those set forth below. We therefore deny relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Diaz was arrested for and subsequently charged with DUI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1381. After her arrest, the investigating officer read her the following admonition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Arizona law states that a person who operates a motor vehicle at any time in\n   this state gives consent to a test or tests of blood, breath, urine or other bodily substances for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content. The law enforcement officer is authorized to request more than one test and may choose the types of tests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   If the test results are not available, or indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or above ... then your Arizona driving privilege will be suspended for not less than 90 consecutive days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If you refuse, or do not expressly agree to submit to, or do not successfully complete the tests, your Arizona driving privilege will be suspended. The suspension will be requested for 12 months, or for two years if you've had a prior implied-consent refusal within the last 84 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Will you submit to the tests?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Diaz agreed and submitted to testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Diaz filed a motion to suppress the testing results, arguing her consent had not been voluntary under the Fourth Amendment and that \"the implied consent rules ... do not excuse the State from demonstrating that consent was voluntarily obtained.\" In response, the state argued that \"the search incident to arrest exception\" to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement \"applies to breath tests conducted after a lawful DUI arrest,\" so voluntary consent was not constitutionally required. It asserted that the admonition given to Diaz was different from that deemed coercive in\n   <em>\n    State v. Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), and was not coercive. And, relying on\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   , the state contended that even if the admonition had been coercive, the officer had acted in good faith. The city court asked for supplemental memoranda on the exclusionary rule and good faith and thereafter granted the motion to suppress, concluding that the admonition read to Diaz rendered any \"consent given ... coerced and therefore not voluntary\" and that the state had not established the officer had acted in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 The state appealed the city court's ruling to the superior court pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-124(A), 13-4032(6). The parties again addressed the questions of voluntariness, exclusion, and good faith presented to the city court. The respondent judge determined the city court had properly ruled Diaz's consent was involuntary, but disagreed as to the application of the good-faith exception, concluding that based on\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   , the exception applied. The respondent therefore reversed the city court's ruling on the motion to suppress and remanded the matter to that court. Diaz then filed the instant petition for special action in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Exercise of our special-action jurisdiction is appropriate when a party lacks \"an equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal.\" Ariz.

This court, following the United States Supreme Court, has determined the Fourth Amendment does not require suppression of breath-test results because, \"as\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v. North Dakota\n   </em>\n   ] held, a warrantless breath test is allowed as a search incident to a lawful [DUI] arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Diaz was administered the warrantless test after her arrest for DUI, the lawfulness of which she does not contest, and the test results were therefore admissible under the Fourth Amendment regardless of whether her consent was voluntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2184\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2184 ;\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    241 Ariz. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    382 P.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Furthermore, in light of\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   's broad holding, questions concerning the voluntariness of Diaz's consent to the test are settled from a Fourth Amendment perspective, because the test results squarely fall under the separate search-incident-to-arrest exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    241 Ariz. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    382 P.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Therefore, the Fourth Amendment did not require proof of voluntariness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Nor does article II, \u00a7 8 of the Arizona Constitution provide Diaz any greater protection from warrantless breath tests. We recently addressed an identical argument and observed that our supreme court has \"long recognized that a search incident to a lawful arrest does not require any warrant and that non-invasive breath tests for DUI arrestees fall within this exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    241 Ariz. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    382 P.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). We concluded that \"[t]hese precedents foreclose the argument that article II, \u00a7 8 of the Arizona Constitution provides greater privacy protection than the federal constitution with regard to DUI breath testing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The question that remains, however, is the one left open in\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   -whether suppression is required under Arizona's implied consent statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1321.\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    241 Ariz. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309850\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/19/\">\n    382 P.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.3. In her motion to suppress, Diaz asserted the admonition as given \"d[id] not accurately reflect the language contained in A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1321\" and argued \"Arizona proscribes a warrantless breath test in the absence of voluntary consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The implied consent statute provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. A person who operates a motor vehicle in this state gives consent ... to a test or tests of the person's blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content if the person is arrested for any offense arising out of acts alleged to have been committed in violation of this chapter or \u00a7 4-244, paragraph 34 while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. The test or tests chosen by the law enforcement agency shall be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle in this state ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ... [w]hile under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   B. After an arrest a violator shall be requested to submit to and successfully complete any test or tests prescribed ... and if the violator refuses the violator shall be informed that the violator's license or permit to drive will be suspended ... unless the violator expressly agrees to submit to and successfully completes the test or tests. A failure to expressly agree to the test or successfully complete the test is deemed a refusal....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The statute further provides that \"[i]f a person under arrest refuses to submit to a test,\" the test may not be given, except with a search warrant or pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1388(E), and the violator's license must be surrendered. \u00a7 28-1321(A), (B), (D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 As quoted above, the admonition the officer provided Diaz reflected this statutory language. However, it prefaced the statutory language with the phrase \"Arizona law states.\" It did not advise Diaz of any legal right to refuse. Diaz contended in her motion to suppress that eliminating the word \"require,\" but using this phrase in its place, communicated \"that the arrestee is compelled by lawful authority to submit to a search.\" Therefore, she argues, the new admonition remained coercive. And, she argued, citing \u00a7 28-1321 and A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1388, that \"Arizona law prohibits a warrantless breath test in the absence of voluntary consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12 Nothing in \u00a7 28-1388 requires that a violator must provide voluntary consent for breath testing before the state may administer the test. However, \u00a7 28-1321, as quoted above, requires that a violator \"expressly agree[ ]\" to testing before a warrantless test may be administered. If a violator does not \"expressly agree to the test or successfully complete the test\" he or she is deemed to have refused. \u00a7 28-1321(B). Our courts have generally construed this statutory scheme as providing drivers with the power, but not the legal right, to refuse testing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211228\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/106/542/#p549\">\n    106 Ariz. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211228\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/106/542/#p549\">\n    479 P.2d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692 (1971). If a violator refuses, he or she will then be subject\n   to the statutory penalties. Indeed, our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   acknowledged the scheme's validity for such purposes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 The question before us then is whether the violator's agreement must be voluntary to comply with state law. In addressing a former analogous version of our DUI statutes, this court concluded that \"implicit in ... these statutes is a voluntary, i.e., intelligent or knowing, refusal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, our supreme court has determined that agreement under this statute must be express; that is, a violator \"must unequivocally manifest assent to the testing by words or conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Carrillo v. Houser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n    224 Ariz. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n    232 P.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the word \"agree\" is defined as \"[t]o unite in thought; to concur in opinion or purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Agree\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). And the term \"consent,\" which our supreme court has indicated is relevant to the roadside decision, at least for Fourth Amendment purposes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is defined as \"voluntary yielding to what another proposes or desires; agreement, approval, or permission regarding some act or purpose, esp. given voluntarily by a competent person; legally effective assent.\"\n   <em>\n    Consent\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In short, there is little semantic difference between the words \"agree\" and \"consent\" in the context of the legal problem here: both events must logically be voluntary to fulfill their meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 In view of these authorities, we conclude that the required agreement to testing under \u00a7 28-1321 must be voluntary. If it is not, the officer has not secured a statutorily required pre-condition to conduct testing, and the officer has taken the sample unlawfully.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As condoned by the court in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   , he informed her of the consequences of refusal in keeping with the statute. Although he prefaced the admonition with the phrase \"Arizona law states,\" what followed accurately described the contents of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Given that we address here only a claim of a statutory violation, it follows that we must construe the statute's requirement of a violator's \"agreement\" to the breath test in the context of the statutory scheme of which the requirement is a part. Specifically, under the framework articulated in \u00a7\u00a7 28-1321 and 28-1388, a violator's agreement or refusal occurs in the context of a pre-existing statutory conclusion that the violator has already consented to testing as a matter of state law under penalty of administrative sanctions for nonetheless refusing to submit. For this reason, an officer who accurately advises a violator, by statute, that they have already consented, only informs the decision to agree or refuse: it cannot render that decision involuntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   , 155 Ariz. at 407,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1455226\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/155/403/#p407\">\n    747 P.2d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing voluntary as \"intelligent or knowing, refusal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 As noted above, our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   , in the context of a more coercive advisory that misleadingly suggested that Arizona law \"required\" violators to submit to a test, the court suggested two mechanisms that would reduce the risk that violators might erroneously believe they had no voluntary choice but to submit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1455226\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/155/403/#p407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, the officer's failure to use either of these mechanisms here-expressly advising Diaz that she possessed a power to refuse or delaying advice of consequences of refusal until a refusal has occurred-does not demonstrate that the instant advisory was coercive or misleading. Contrary to Diaz's suggestion at oral argument in this court,\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   did not mandate a procedure in which the officer must first ask and be refused, then advise the violator of the consequences of refusal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, it also endorsed a procedure like that used in South Dakota, in which an officer requests that a driver submit to a test, informing the driver that he or she may refuse and of the consequences of refusal. The officer here apparently chose another option: to accurately advise Diaz of state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the boundaries of a violator's implicit power to refuse the test must be understood in the context of the very statutory scheme that creates it, the advisory here, which correctly and comprehensively describes that scheme, cannot be deemed improper as a matter of state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 Diaz presents no other facts that would render her agreement to submit to the test involuntary beyond those inherent in any interaction with an officer upon detention for a suspected DUI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The officer neither told her that she was required to take the test, nor misled her as to the consequences of taking or refusing the test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore conclude her agreement was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20 Accordingly, the results were obtained in compliance with the statute and were admissible at trial. The city court erred in concluding otherwise, and although not for the reasons set forth above, the respondent\n   judge properly granted relief to the state. We therefore deny relief.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    At oral argument in this court, the state argued that the rule set forth in\n    <em>\n     Hays\n    </em>\n    , that refusal must be voluntary, is no longer the law. It contended that because the statute was amended after\n    <em>\n     Hays\n    </em>\n    to define refusal, our supreme court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Carrillo\n    </em>\n    , issued after the statutory change, controls.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carrillo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n     224 Ariz. 463\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 16-17,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n     232 P.3d 1245\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (outlining history of statute). And, according to the state, voluntary refusal is not required because the\n    <em>\n     Carrillo\n    </em>\n    court did not rely on\n    <em>\n     Hays\n    </em>\n    . It contends the\n    <em>\n     Carrillo\n    </em>\n    court defined express agreement with no requirement for a voluntary state of mind. But the court in\n    <em>\n     Carrillo\n    </em>\n    addressed whether officers were authorized to administer a test pursuant to \u00a7 28-1321 when an arrestee did not resist the test, but did not \"unequivocally manifest assent to the testing by words or conduct.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n     224 Ariz. 463\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 4, 19,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n     232 P.3d 1245\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, the decision centered on the words or conduct necessary to manifest agreement; whether or not that agreement was also required to be voluntary was not before the court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Although we do not expressly decide here whether the standard for voluntariness under the statute is coextensive with Fourth Amendment principles, in view of our supreme court's conclusions in\n    <em>\n     Valenzuela\n    </em>\n    , the standard under the statute is not a higher one.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Hereafter, we use the statute's own terminology for the violator's implicit power to decide whether to submit to testing as \"agreeing\" or refusing to \"agree\" to testing. We do so to avoid analytical confusion either with the separate statutory assumption that a driver has \"consented\" to testing or with a violator's federal constitutional right to refuse \"consent\" to a search. In so doing, we recognize the semantic similarity, as described above, of the words \"agree\" and \"consent.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    That the officer did not follow the court's suggestions in\n    <em>\n     Valenzuela\n    </em>\n    as to this affidavit is no surprise.

We do not address whether the instant affidavit, when used to secure a blood draw, might violate an arrestee's right under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution to refuse consent to a search of their body for evidence. In such an analysis, some correct statements as a matter of state law might conceivably be viewed as coercive or misleading in evaluating an arrestee's Fourth Amendment right to refuse consent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In its ruling on the motion to suppress, the city court found the officer had been \"in uniform and armed,\" but \"did not draw or otherwise bring attention to his weapon.\" It noted Diaz \"had been detained for about 25 minutes\" at the time she agreed to the test, she had been read the admonition, and \"no other elements of coercion [had been] present.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
