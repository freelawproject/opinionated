R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On March 27, 2006, Puryer obtained a $285,750 loan (the Loan) on real property located at 244 Wintercrest Drive in Kalispell, Montana. The Loan was secured by a Deed of Trust on the property from America's\n   Wholesale Lender. The Deed of Trust identified Puryer as the borrower, America's Wholesale Lender as the original lender, Charles J. Peterson as the Trustee, and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. as the \"nominee for Lender and Lender's successors and assigns ... a beneficiary under this Security Instrument.\" On December 3, 2009, the Deed of Trust was assigned to HSBC Bank USA as trustee for the holders of Ace Securities Corp. Home Equity Loan Trust, Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates, series 2006-CW1. On December 12, 2011, the Deed of Trust was assigned to Bank of America, N.A. On October 15, 2012, the Deed of Trust was assigned back to HSBC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Due to financial difficulties, Puryer contacted Bank of America for assistance to modify her monthly mortgage payments. Puryer alleged Bank of America told her to stop making her monthly mortgage payment to qualify her for the Home Affordable Modification Program\n   (HAMP).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Puryer alleged based on this advice she stopped making her monthly mortgage payments; however, Puryer never qualified for the HAMP. Her last mortgage payment was on October 1, 2007. Puryer has not made any payments on the Loan since October 1, 2007, and she admits she defaulted on the Loan on November 1, 2007. However, she continues to reside on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Since Puryer defaulted on the loan, she has received at least nine Notices of Sale. Puryer received the first Notice of Sale on July 10, 2008, and the last on July 5, 2016. The Notices of Sale contained similar language, which Puryer alleged accelerated all amounts due under the Loan and Deed of Trust. For example, the last Notice of Sale, issued on July 5, 2016, stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The beneficiary has declared a default in the terms of said Deed of Trust by failing to make the monthly payments due in the amount of $1,962.12, beginning November 1, 2007, and each month subsequent, which monthly installments would have been applied on the principal and interest due on said obligation and other charges against the property or loan. The total amount due on this obligation as of July 15, 2016 is $255,563.04 principal, interest at a rate of 8.35000% totaling $193,193.35, late charges in the amount of $2,164.80, escrow advances of $34,841.35, and other fees and expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Each Notice of Sale was later cancelled and no foreclosure sale took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Deed of Trust contained provisions requiring notice to Puryer prior to accelerating the Loan if default was not cured. The Deed of Trust provided the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Acceleration Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument ... The notice shall specify: (a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument and sale of the Property. The notice shall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a\n   default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration and sale. If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Deed of Trust then provided that if the lender invokes the power of sale, lender must notify the trustee and then the trustee or lender can record a notice of sale. It is undisputed that no notice was provided by Lenders to Puryer as required by the Deed of Trust. The Deed of Trust provided the maturity date as April 1, 2036.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Initially, Puryer, appearing pro se, filed a complaint on October 27, 2016. On March 3, 2017, Puryer filed an Amended Complaint. In the Amended Complaint, Puryer alleged six\n   causes of action against Lenders. These causes of action included: (1) declaratory judgment; (2) breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA); (4) violation of the Montana Consumer Protection Act (MCPA); (5) negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (6) lack of authority to foreclose. On March 20, 2017, Lenders moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 On May 25, 2017, the District Court granted Lenders' motion to dismiss. The District Court determined the following: (1) declaratory judgment is improper because the Notices of Sale did not accelerate the maturity date; therefore, the statute of limitations was not triggered by the first Notice of Sale; (2) securitization of the Loan does not invalidate the Deed of Trust; (3) Puryer did not suffer any actual damages from any breach of contract; (4) no special relationship existed to assert a breach of good faith and fair dealing with the named parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5) Lenders do not meet the definition of a debt collector under the FDCPA; (6) litigation costs are not sufficient to satisfy the ascertainable loss element under the MCPA; (7) no factual basis existed for a claim of negligent and/or intentional infliction of\n   emotional distress; and (8) lack of authority to foreclose is not a recognized claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Puryer timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 We review a district court's ruling on a motion to dismiss de novo, using the standards set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle her to relief. A district court's determination that a complaint has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Victory Ins. Co. v.

Declaratory Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 Puryer argues the District Court erred in granting Lenders' motion to dismiss. Specifically, Puryer asserts the Notices of Sale accelerated the amount due and constituted a maturity of the entire debt as provided by \u00a7 71-1-210, MCA, and thus Lenders had eight years from the first Notice of Sale to enforce the obligation to pay. Puryer maintains the eight-year statute of limitations began to run on July 10, 2008 when she received the first Notice of Sale. Lenders counter the District Court correctly granted their motion to dismiss. Lenders argue, based on the plain language of the Deed of Trust, the Loan was not accelerated and even if the Loan was accelerated the notice of cancellation revoked any acceleration. Thus, the Lenders contend the statute of limitations never began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provides a district court with the \"power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\" Section 27-8-201, MCA. Under Montana law, \"a mortgage of real property ... is good against all from the time it is recorded until 8 years after the maturity of the entire debt or obligation secured.\" Section 71-1-210, MCA. Thus, upon maturity of the entire debt a lender has eight years to enforce the mortgage unless the lender seeks to renew the period of mortgage. Although acceleration of a debt requiring payment of the entire debt may trigger the eight-year statute of limitation pursuant \u00a7 71-1-210, MCA, the plain language of the Deed of Trust provides that the Notices of Sale did not accelerate the entire debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 Acceleration of the debt due under the Deed of Trust was not self-executing. Upon default, the lender was required to give notice to the borrower. The notice must specify (1) the default, (2) the action required to cure the default, (3) a date by which default must be cured, and (4) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Deed of Trust. (Emphasis added.) The plain language of the Deed of Trust does not create a self-executing acceleration clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mont. Solid Waste Constrs. v. Mont. Dept. of Pub. Serv. Reg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143303\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/338/1/\">\n    2007 MT 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143303\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/338/1/\">\n    338 Mont. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143303\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/338/1/\">\n    161 P.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining self-executing as \"taking effect immediately without the need of any type of implementing action\"). Even after providing notice to the borrower, the lender may elect to accelerate the sums secured by invoking the power of sale. We conclude, based on the plain language of the Deed of Trust, that upon\n   default, an implementing action-providing notice-was required to accelerate Puryer's debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 Inter alia, the Notices of Sale did not accelerate the entire debt to trigger the eight-year statute of limitations pursuant to \u00a7 71-1-210, MCA. The Small Tract Financing Act of Montana, \u00a7\u00a7 71-1-301 to -321, MCA, allows the use of trust indentures to finance estates of real property that are smaller than 40 acres. Section 71-1-302, MCA. \"When a transfer in trust of an interest in real property is made to secure the performance of the obligation ... a power of sale is conferred upon the trustee to be exercised after a breach of the obligation for which the transfer is security.\" Section 71-1-304(2), MCA. The Act further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Whenever all or a portion of any obligation secured by a trust indenture has, prior to the maturity date fixed in the obligation, become due or been declared due by reason of a breach or default ... the grantor ... at any time prior to the time fixed by the trustee for the trustee's sale if the power of sale is to be exercised, may pay to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's successor in interest\n   <em>\n    the entire amount then due\n   </em>\n   under the terms of the trust indenture and the obligation secured by the indenture ...\n   <em>\n    other than the portion of the principal that would not then be due if a default had not occurred and cure the existing default.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 71-1-312(1), MCA (emphasis added). A Notice of Sale does not cause maturity of the entire debt owed if a borrower, at any\n   point, may cure the default by only paying the amount due at that time, rather than being required to pay the entire loan balance. We determine based on the language of the \u00a7 71-1-312(1), MCA, the Notices of Sale did not accelerate the entire debt due. As provided in \u00a7 71-1-312(1), MCA, payment of only the amount in arrears reinstates the trust indenture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midfirst Bank v.

Therefore, the maturity date remains April 1, 2036, because the Notices of Sale failed to accelerate the entire debt. Accordingly, we conclude the eight-year statute of limitations was not triggered and enforcement of the Deed of Trust is not time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Moreover, Puryer argued the District Court erred by not considering Puryer's motion for summary judgment on the statute of limitations. Having determined the enforcement of the Deed of Trust is not time-barred pursuant to \u00a7 71-1-201, MCA, we conclude the District Court did not err by refusing to consider Puryer's motion for\n   summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Contract and Breaches of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 Puryer argues the District Court erred in dismissing her breach of contract and breaches of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims. Specifically, Puryer contends she sufficiently pled damages in her breach of contract claim. Puryer also contends her breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was properly pled. Puryer lastly argues a \"special relationship\" existed to move forward with the tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 Lenders argue the District Court did not err in dismissing Puryer's breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims as a matter of law. Lenders maintain the breach of contract claim failed to adequately allege actual damages. Lenders further argue Puryer failed to allege a \"special relationship\" giving rise to a tortious breach of the implied covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 A breach of contract is an actionable wrong regardless of whether actual damages stemmed from the breach.\n   <em>\n    Kitchen Krafters v.

The District Court relied on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , the Jacobsons alleged several violations under the MCPA regarding the nonjudicial foreclosure of their home.\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 49. In particular, the Jacobsons alleged the loan servicer violated provisions of the Trust Indenture \u00a7 22(c) and \u00a7 71-1-306(2), MCA.\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 49. The Trust Indenture \u00a7 22 provided the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under Section 18 [transfer of property] unless Applicable law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify: (a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. This language is nearly identical to Puryer's Deed of Trust \u00a7 22. While we recognize the Jacobsons alleged several other MCPA violations, this Court stated the lender \"violated provisions of the Trust Indenture \u00a7 22(c) and \u00a7 71-1-306(2), MCA. These violations ... clearly constitute violations of Montana Law [under the MCPA] while also in violation of the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 49. Similarly, Puryer's Amended Complaint specifically alleged \"the Defendants' violations of the trust indenture provision, \u00a7 22 (C), and \u00a7 71-1-306(2), MCA, are also violations of the MCPA.\" Further, Lenders do not dispute notice was not provided to Puryer as provided in the Deed of Trust \u00a7 22. While\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable with regards to the gravity of MCPA violations alleged, it clearly indicates Puryer has sufficiently pled a claim for a MCPA violation. Therefore, we cannot conclude, as the District Court did, that Puryer's\n   factual allegations could not give rise to a violation under the MCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 36 Furthermore, the District Court dismissed Puryer's MCPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   claim because she failed to allege any ascertainable loss of money and property as a result of the Lenders' unfair practices. We have rejected Lenders' argument that under the MCPA \"ascertainable loss of money and property\" requires a showing of \"actual damages\" such as a foreclosure sale.\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 56. In\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , we determined that \"costs and fees, lost other opportunities to save her home, suffered a negative impact to her credit, [and] never received a [m]odification\" were sufficient to establish a pecuniary loss.\n   <em>\n    Jacobson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 57 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wigod v.

Puryer's MCPA claim alleged damages of cost and fees, attorney fees, and ascertainable loss of money and property by executing a legal proceeding to stop Lenders' improper foreclosure of her property. Therefore, Puryer sufficiently pled damages recognized by this Court, even if no foreclosure sale took place, to overcome a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Taking Puryer's allegations as true, we conclude she has sufficiently pled a violation under the MCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Negligent or Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 37 Puryer argues her infliction of emotional distress claim survives a motion to dismiss because it falls under the continuing tort doctrine. In response, Lenders argue Puryer's infliction of emotional distress claim was insufficiently pled. The District Court dismissed Puryer's claim for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress because Puryer failed to articulate any basis for an emotional distress claim and Lenders cannot be held liable for the conduct of others based on joint and several liability.

Puryer further alleged the emotional\n   distress stems from Lenders' attempts to foreclose upon her home by sending several Notices of Sale. We agree with the District Court that Puryer's Amended Complaint fails to allege any factual allegations sufficient to constitute \"serious or severe\" emotional distress that \"no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feller v.

We hold the District Court incorrectly determined Puryer's Amended Complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted under the standards of M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on her asserted breach of contract, contractual and tortious breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, FDCPA, and MCPA claims as set forth above. We further hold the District Court did not error in dismissing Puryer's negligent and/or intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because she failed to state sufficient facts to entitled her to relief on the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 41 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   DIRK M.

I would affirm the dismissal of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 43 As the Court notes, recent decisions have clarified that security holders are generally not \"debt collectors,\" and a mortgage is not a \"debt,\" for purposes of the Act. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dowers v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277708\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/964/#p969\">\n    852 F.3d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017) ). A narrow exception to this general rule permits claims against security holders under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(6), which prohibits taking or threatening to take nonjudicial action to effect dispossession of property if: (A) there is no present right to possession of the property through an enforceable security interest; (B) there is no present intention to take possession of the property; or (C) the property is exempt by law from such dispossession. Consequently, it is incumbent upon a plaintiff asserting a claim against a security holder to clearly allege a violation that falls within \u00a7 1692f(6), as all other claims sounding in the Act do not apply. I believe Puryer has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 44 First, the explicit claims made by Puryer under \u00a7 1692f(6) in her\n   Amended Complaint are that the Lenders \"failed to provide a date to cure the default, as required by the Note and Deed of Trust, and they failed to comply with the requirements for default procedures in the trust indenture, including but not limited to failing to properly notify Puryer regarding the timing of her right to cure.\" Puryer asserts these are \"false representations of Puryer's rights in violation of 15 USC \u00a7 1692e(10), and constitute unfair practices in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 USC \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)....\" However, these allegations do not fall within the parameters of the claims authorized under \u00a7 1692f(6). For purposes of these stated claims, which must find support in other sections of the Act, the Lenders are not debt collectors, and the claims must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 45 Beyond her explicit claims, Puryer generally alleges that her \"FDCPA and MCPA claims may be based on the same grounds,\" but her assertions in this regard are very vague, specifically referencing only that Lenders' actions violated the trust indenture. While the Court states that Puryer has stated a claim under \u00a7 1692f(6)\"based on Lenders conduct of threatening a non-judicial foreclosure by sending repeated Notices of Sale,\" Opinion, \u00b6 30, my reading of the Amended Complaint reveals no articulation of such a claim. Further, even if such language had been used, it would be insufficient alone to state a claim under \u00a7 1692f(6), which would also require an assertion that there was no present right to effect dispossession, no present indication to take possession, or that the property is exempt by law from such dispossession.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    HAMP is intended to help homeowners by modifying their monthly mortgage payments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The District Court recognized a special relationship may have existed between Bank of America and Puryer based on Bank of America's advice to stop making mortgage payments. However, as discussed below, the District Court applied the test for whether a fiduciary duty existed, and not the \"special relationship\" test for tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Nevertheless, the District Court recognized Puryer's Amended Complaint failed to name Bank of America as a defendant and found Bank of America was no longer a party to the action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Puryer does not appeal the dismissal of her Lack of Authority to Foreclose claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
