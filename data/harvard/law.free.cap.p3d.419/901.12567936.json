The investigation in the above-captioned matter was initiated by Bar Counsel following receipt of a report from the Honorable Joseph B. Bluemel, Third Judicial District Court Judge, that Respondent, the president of Wyoming Credit Association, a Wyoming corporation (\"WCA\"), a collection agency located in Evanston, Wyoming, may have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by representing WCA in a collection action in Judge Bluemel's court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2.

Following receipt of Bar Counsel's letter of inquiry, Respondent's counsel contacted Bar Counsel and advised that Respondent was willing to enter into a consent agreement as provided in Rule 5(f) of the Rules of Procedure Governing Unauthorized Practice of Law Proceedings (the \"UPL Rules\"), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (f) If, after conducting an investigation, Bar Counsel believes that the respondent has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, Bar Counsel may do one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) commence civil injunction proceedings as provided in Rule 6;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) commence civil contempt proceedings as provided in Rule 8;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) enter into a consent agreement with the respondent in which the respondent agrees to do one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (A) refrain from the conduct in question;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (B) refund any fees collected;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (C) make restitution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (D) pay a fine that may range from one hundred dollars ($100) to two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) per incident of unauthorized practice of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   4. Respondent concedes that she is not a member of the Wyoming State Bar and engaged in the unauthorized practice of law as reported by Judge Bluemel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   5.

Pursuant to UPL Rule 5(f)(3), Respondent has agreed that she will refrain from similar conduct in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   7.

Mr. Houghton has failed to adhere to the Rules of Appellate Procedure and has failed to offer appellate argument supported by cogent argument or pertinent legal authority. Summary affirmance is granted for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In 2005, Mr. Houghton purchased a townhome at 218 Cheyenne Drive, Evanston, Uinta County, Wyoming. Mr. Houghton acquired a second mortgage in 2007, supplemented with a Planned Unit Development Rider. Through the Planned Unit Development Rider, Mr. Houghton agreed to \"promptly pay, when due, all dues and assessments imposed pursuant to the Constituent Documents.\" (Pl./Appellee's Reply Br., Ex. 2.) Apparently, Mr. Houghton did not pay the assessments, which was the impetus for Appellee, Wyoming Credit Association, asserting a claim in the Uinta County Circuit Court. The circuit court case ended with a judgment against Mr. Houghton for $2,093.34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mr. Houghton claims Uinta Meadows Townhome Association did not exist at the time he acquired his mortgage and that Uinta Meadows Townhome Association is not a registered association with the Wyoming Secretary of State. He concludes, therefore, that Uinta Meadows Townhome Association had no authority to collect dues. He argues that he owes nothing to that entity, which had no authority to charge fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Although neither Party has set forth a statement of the issues in this case, the Court will consider the following as dispositive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   1. Did Mr. Houghton's appeal reasonably adhere to the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure (LexisNexis 2017)?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   2. Should Appellee be awarded sanctions pursuant to W.R.A.P. 10.05?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Mr. Houghton presents his appeal\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   The court generally grants to\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants a certain amount of leniency from the stringent standards expected in formal pleadings drafted by attorneys.\n   <em>\n    Byrnes v. Harper,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WY%2021\">\n    2018 WY 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565022\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/411/427/\">\n    411 P.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 2018). Nevertheless, the court expects the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant to offer \"a reasonable adherence to the procedural rules and requirements of the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants must \"handle this professional, technical work in compliance with Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure in the same way that trained lawyers are expected to perform.\"\n   <em>\n    In Interest of FT,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10377493\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/856/1128/#p1129\">\n    856 P.2d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1129 (Wyo. 1993) (citation &amp; quotations omitted). Appellate Rule 1.03 permits the Court to impose sanctions, including summary affirmance, on the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant who fails to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n   <em>\n    Byrnes,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565022\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/411/427/\">\n    411 P.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Rule of Appellate Procedure 1.03(b)(1) allows sanctions for a party's failure to include with the notice of appeal \"the appendix required by Rule 2.07(b) and (c).\" In civil cases the notice of appeal must have an appendix that includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (1) All pleadings that assert a claim for relief whether by complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim and all pleadings adding parties; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (2) All orders or judgments disposing of claims for relief and all orders or judgments disposing of all claims by or against any party; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (3) The judgment or final order and a copy of the trial court's decision letter if one was filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   W.R.A.P. 2.07(b). Mr. Houghton's Notice of Appeal includes none of these items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Mr. Houghton's brief does not conform to W.R.A.P. 7.01 in that it contains no proper statement of the issues presented for review; no statement of the facts relevant to the issue; \"and no coherent, intelligible argument with citations to the legal authorities and parts of the record relied on.\"\n   <em>\n    In Interest of FT,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10377493\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/856/1128/#p1129\">\n    856 P.2d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (Wyo. 1993). The longstanding rule in the appellate court is to summarily affirm cases in which a party has failed to present a brief with either\n   cogent argument or pertinent authority.\n   <em>\n    Byrnes,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565022\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/411/427/\">\n    411 P.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither Mr. Houghton's opening brief nor his reply brief offers persuasive argument or reference to pertinent authority supporting his challenges to the circuit court's order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565022\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/411/427/\">\n    411 P.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Though the appellate court is reluctant to impose sanctions for reasonable attorney's fees under W.R.A.P. 10.05(b), it will do so when \"an appeal lacks cogent argument [or] where there is an absence of pertinent authority to support the claims of error.\"\n   <em>\n    Byrnes,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565022\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/411/427/\">\n    411 P.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations &amp; quotations omitted). This Court will not impose the sanction of attorney's fees against Mr. Houghton; however, as Wyoming Credit Association has not been represented by an attorney. Wyoming Credit Association, Inc., a corporation, is represented by its owner, Josephine K. Walton. \"It is well established that a person who is not an attorney is not entitled to appear in court for a corporation regardless of his interest or association with the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    E.C. Cates Agency, Inc. v.

Norman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384641\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/780/283/#p287\">\n    780 P.2d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287 (Wyo. 1989); W.S. \u00a7 33-5-117. This Court will not reward Wyoming Credit Association, Inc. by imposing a sanction of attorney's fees against Mr. Houghton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   When there has been a failure to comply with the appellate rules, W.R.A.P. 1.03(a) gives the appellate court grounds to enter a summary affirmance.\n   <em>\n    Hodson v. Sturgeon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349292\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/1264/\">\n    2017 WY 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349292\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/1264/\">\n    406 P.3d 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1265 (Wyo. 2017). Mr. Houghton has not complied with the appellate rules. Summary affirmance is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The circuit court properly entered judgment against Mr. Houghton. Mr. Houghton has not adhered to appellate rules or relied upon pertinent authority to support his claims. The judgement by the Uinta County Circuit Court is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   DATED\n   <em>\n    27th\n   </em>\n   day of March 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   JOSEPH B.
