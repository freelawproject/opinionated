Defendant was sentenced to a term of forty years and six months. He appeals his conviction, alleging five separate assertions of error. First, Defendant claims the district court erred in failing to grant a mistrial following the State's comments during closing arguments about Defendant's demeanor during the testimony of Victim. Defendant next alleges that the district court failed to properly instruct the jury on the kidnapping charge by omitting the requirement that the State prove that Defendant's restraint of Victim was not incidental to the commission of another crime. Third, Defendant contends that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support his convictions for first degree CSP and kidnapping. Fourth, Defendant argues his convictions for both aggravated burglary and CSP or CSC violate double jeopardy. Finally, Defendant argues the district court abused its discretion in admitting expert testimony regarding DNA evidence. We conclude that Defendant's convictions for both aggravated burglary and CSP/CSC violate double jeopardy and vacate Defendant's aggravated burglary conviction. Further, because the jury was not properly instructed on kidnapping, we remand to the district court for a new trial on that count. We affirm Defendant's convictions on all other counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Victim, a seventy-three-year-old woman, awoke to an intruder, whom she identified at trial as Defendant, holding his gloved hand over her mouth and pointing a knife at her head. When she attempted to scream, Defendant threatened to kill her if she did not keep quiet. Defendant ordered her to get out of bed and take off her pajamas. Victim obeyed. Defendant asked where he could find Victim's purse, and she directed him to her closet where he retrieved the purse and took Victim's wallet. Victim informed Defendant that she needed to use the restroom, and she was permitted to walk to the restroom with Defendant following close behind. Once there, Defendant masturbated while Victim used the restroom. Defendant then directed Victim-still unclothed-to return to the bedroom and lie face down on the bed. Once Victim did so, Defendant penetrated her with his penis both vaginally and anally while she was lying on the bed. Victim also testified that Defendant fondled her breast and vaginally penetrated her with his fingers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Defendant left the bedroom after approximately an hour, and Victim made two attempts to get up from the bed. The first was unsuccessful, as Defendant was still in the living room and warned her to get back on the bed. Victim complied, and lay on the bed a while longer before again trying-this time successfully-to get off of the bed. When Victim entered the living room, she discovered her front door was standing open and her two cordless home phones, her wallet, and her rifle were gone. She locked the front door, put on a robe, and used her cell phone to call 911. Defendant never struck Victim, but she testified she felt as though she could not leave while he was in her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} The police arrived at Victim's home within a few minutes of her 911 call. Once there, the police discovered footprints in the mud outside Victim's window. They followed the footprints leading away from the house, ultimately arriving at another house in town approximately an hour and a half later where they found Defendant hiding in the back yard with socks on but without any shoes. The police found sneakers with tread matching the footprints outside Victim's home and a dark-colored, hooded sweatshirt at the house where Defendant was hiding. In a vehicle parked outside the home, the officers also found leather work gloves matching those described by Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {5} Later that morning, Victim underwent a sexual assault examination, during which the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) found no injuries during an external examination, but did discover that Victim had a\n   half-centimeter \"open area\" that was \"consistent with force.\" The SANE also collected various swabs from Victim and Defendant. These items were subjected to DNA testing, along with two sheets from Victim's bed and Defendant's boxer shorts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {6} During closing arguments, the State drew the jury's attention to Defendant's demeanor during Victim's testimony, stating, \"did you notice also, ladies and gentlemen, when she testified, that man wouldn't even look at her. He watched every other witness on the stand.\" At that point, defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial, arguing that the State was commenting on Defendant's silence and that there was no evidence in the record regarding what Defendant did or did not do while Victim was testifying. The court overruled Defendant's objection, but stated in open court that \"the jury will have to rely on their own memories as to what they observed.\" The State resumed its closing argument stating, \"Did you watch him in the courtroom when she took the stand? He wouldn't even look at her. He looked at every other witness in the eye, but he wouldn't look at her. And why wouldn't he look at her? Because he knew what he'd done. He knew what he did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Prosecutor's Closing Argument Comments About Defendant's Demeanor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {7} We review the denial of Defendant's motion for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant argues that the prosecutor's action of calling the jury's attention to Defendant's demeanor during Victim's testimony was equivalent to commenting on facts not in evidence. Further, Defendant contends that because he chose not to testify, it was reversible error for the State, during closing argument, to attribute a testimonial value to Defendant's demeanor during Victim's testimony, thereby suggesting Defendant's demeanor was testimonial or somehow relevant to the issue of guilt or innocence. The propriety of a prosecutor's comments on the courtroom demeanor of a defendant who elects not to testify is an issue of first impression in New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {8} Although no New Mexico appellate court has addressed this issue, state and federal courts throughout the country have ruled on the propriety of commenting on a non-testifying defendant's courtroom demeanor. A majority of jurisdictions disallow such comments, though their reasons for doing so vary. Some courts reason that such comments are not probative of the issue of guilt or innocence, some equate them to argument of facts not in evidence, some rely on a combination of both those reasons, and some simply characterize them as improper without any additional analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {9} Several states take a broad view when disallowing comment on a non-testifying defendant's demeanor by reasoning that it is not probative of the issue of guilt or innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

Such an inference is particularly troubling where we perceive no impropriety in the demeanor that was the subject of the comments. The prosecutor suggested the jury draw just such an inference in this case by stating, \"He wouldn't look at her. And why wouldn't he look at her? Because he knew what he'd done. He knew what he did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {15} In light of our conclusion that comments on the demeanor of a non-testifying defendant are not probative of innocence or guilt and requirement that a prosecutor's argument be based on the evidence, we hold that prosecutors are prohibited from commenting on a non-testifying defendant's courtroom demeanor where, as here, it is not evidence in the record. We therefore conclude that it was improper for the State to argue that Defendant's alleged failure to make eye contact with Victim during her testimony was evidence of Defendant's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {16} Having concluded that the State erred, we next examine whether that error warrants reversal. When reviewing statements made during closing arguments for reversible error, we begin by considering three factors. First, we consider whether the comments made during closing argument invade \"some distinct constitutional protection\" such as a defendant's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence or a defendant's exercise of his Fourth Amendment rights in refusing to consent to a warrantless search.\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245720\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/147/351/\">\n    2009-NMSC-056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 26-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245720\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/147/351/\">\n    147 N.M. 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245720\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/147/351/\">\n    223 P.3d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, we evaluate whether the statement made \"is isolated and brief, or repeated and pervasive[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Generally, \"an isolated comment made during closing argument is not sufficient to warrant reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2548696\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/138/700/\">\n    2006-NMSC-001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2548696\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/138/700/\">\n    138 N.M. 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2548696\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/138/700/\">\n    126 P.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Instead, the misconduct complained of is reversible error where it is so \"pronounced and persistent\" that it carries \"a probable cumulative effect upon the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 (internal quotation\n   marks and citations omitted). Third, we consider \"whether the statement is invited by the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Courts are unlikely to find error \"where the defense has opened the door to the prosecutor's comments by its own argument or reference to facts not in evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {17} \"[T]he common thread running through the cases finding reversible error is that the prosecutors' comments materially altered the trial or likely confused the jury by distorting the evidence, and thereby deprived the accused of a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. When analyzing whether an error warrants reversal, \"context is paramount[,]\" and the three factors listed above are only \"useful guides.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Our courts also consider whether the evidence of guilt is overwhelming, whether the improper statement is corrected by counsel or limited by the court, or whether the fact manipulated by the statement is determinative to the outcome of the case.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {18} Here, the State's comments did not invade a \"distinct constitutional protection.\" While they may have run afoul of the presumption of innocence, we note that the presumption of innocence is not constitutionally mandated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

During jail phone conversations, Defendant admitted that he committed the property crimes, though he denied committing the sexual offenses. When police apprehended Defendant on the night of the incident, however, Defendant spontaneously stated, \"it doesn't [expletive] matter-none of it does-what you guys are investigating. I will be locked up for the rest of my life,\" suggesting he was aware that police were investigating something more than a burglary. Regarding the prosecutor's statements specifically, we note that the court clarified, \"the jury will have to rely on their own memories as to what they observed,\" despite having overruled Defendant's objection. Though the court did not directly address the jury, it made the statement in open court with the jury present. In doing so, the court implicitly recognized a potential for prejudice to Defendant that warranted advising the jury that its consideration of Defendant's courtroom demeanor should be limited to its own observations. \"The jury is presumed to follow the court's [curative] instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury was instructed during Defendant's trial in 2014 that, to find Defendant guilty of kidnapping, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant \"restrained or confined [Victim] by force or intimidation\" and that Defendant \"intended to inflict a sexual offense on [Victim.]\" This instruction was modeled after the language of the Uniform Jury Instruction (UJI) in place at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UJI 14-403 NMRA (1997). In August 2012, this Court decided\n   <em>\n    State v.

The instruction given to the jury required proof that Defendant \"intended to inflict\" a sexual offense, while the UJI required proof that Defendant \"intended to hold\" Victim to inflict a sexual offense. Defendant also argues that the district court committed fundamental error by failing to instruct the jury regarding\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   's rejection of \"incidental restraint\" as a basis for kidnapping. We address the latter argument first, and finding it dispositive, decline to address Defendant's intent argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {23} In\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   , this Court looked at whether the Legislature intended to punish the defendant's \"momentary restraint of [the v]ictim in the course of a fight as kidnapping[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188545\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2012/112/4188545/\">\n    2012-NMCA-112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=289%20P.3d%20238\">\n    289 P.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After consulting our state's kidnapping jurisprudence, as well as that of other jurisdictions, this Court adopted a view used in a majority of other jurisdictions, that \"kidnapping statutes do not apply to unlawful confinements or movements incidental to the commission of other felonies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Though we did not adopt any particular test to be used in determining whether a restraint is \"incidental,\" we acknowledged that the basic inquiry is \"whether the restraint or movement increases the culpability of the defendant over and above his culpability for the other crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In answering that question, we considered whether the restraint was longer or greater than necessary to commit the other crime, whether the restraint subjected the victim to a substantially greater risk of harm, and whether the restraint increased the length or severity of the attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Although we ruled as a matter of law that the Legislature did not intend for the defendant's conduct to constitute kidnapping, we also acknowledged that \"[a] more complicated factual scenario would present a jury question-submitted under\n   appropriate instructions-as to whether the restraint involved was merely incidental to the other crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {24} This is just such a case. It involves a more complicated factual scenario than\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   that undoubtedly presents a jury question. However, it was not submitted to the jury with appropriate instructions. The instructions submitted to the jury here omitted any and all reference to the potentially incidental nature of the restraint. Our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   qualified a jury's consideration of restraint, confinement, or transportation, as it is used in the UJI, to include only that restraint, which is not merely incidental to the commission of another crime. Indeed, that limitation has been incorporated into the 2015 version of the kidnapping UJI, which limits consideration of restraint to only that which is \"not slight, inconsequential, or merely incidental to the commission of another crime[.]\" UJI 14-403 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {25} According to Victim's testimony, she was restrained both before and after the sexual offense occurred: first by threat with a knife, and second by menacing instruction from another room. It is for the jury to determine whether either or both of these restraints were slight, inconsequential, or incidental to the commission of the sexual offense. Indeed, that determination is an essential inquiry under\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. There can be little doubt that the incidental restraint requirement of\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   was established well before Defendant's trial. The jury instruction used at trial in 2014, patterned on the 1997 version of UJI 14-403, failed to adequately instruct the jury on restraint as interpreted in\n   <em>\n    Trujillo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nothing in the record suggests she planned to make this move prior to the incident. Victim testified that she experienced \"constant flashbacks,\" but she did not receive medication or counseling as a result of the incident. Victim also testified that as a result of the daily flashbacks, she had trouble concentrating and was unable to drive for a period of time. Seven months after the incident, Victim began living by herself again, but as of the date of trial, she had not returned to her home in Clovis where the incident took place. An officer testified that almost immediately after the incident, Victim behaved as though she was in shock, traumatized, mad, and upset. Victim told the officer that she did not want to be alone, and while the officer was with Victim, she alternated between crying and expressing anger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {29} Defendant suggests that the evidence of Victim's post-incident symptoms are similar to or less extreme than those discussed in\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the time, she was over seventy years of age, uprooted her life, and moved across the country. She went from being self-sufficient enough to live on her own to having to move in with her daughter and being unable to drive. Victim's day-to-day lifestyle changed drastically, and she suffered daily flashbacks and exhibited mood swings immediately after the incident.

We addressed Defendant's argument regarding incidental restraint above, and because we review for sufficiency based on the flawed instruction given, which did not include incidental restraint, we do not address it. Regarding intent, however, Defendant asserts that there was no proof that he restrained Victim with the intent to inflict a sexual offense because the \"primary evidence of kidnapping\" occurred after the sexual offense. Defendant refers to Victim's failed attempt to get off the bed following the sexual offense as the \"primary evidence of kidnapping.\" We are unpersuaded by Defendant's argument, however, because nothing in the record indicates that the jury found Defendant guilty based on this evidence. Indeed, the evidence presented at trial also established that prior to the sexual offense, Defendant threatened Victim with a knife, only allowed her to travel from one room of the house to another while he followed her closely, and ultimately ordered her to return to the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {33} Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the evidence regarding the threat, following Victim, and ordering her from one room of the house to another was sufficient to support Defendant's conviction for kidnapping under the flawed instructions given. A jury could reasonably conclude Defendant restricted or confined Victim using intimidation when he threatened her life using a knife. The jury could then infer from Defendant's actions of ordering Victim to take off her pajamas and masturbating while she used the restroom that Defendant restrained Victim while intending to inflict a sexual offense on her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

There are two types of multiple punishment cases: (1) unit of prosecution cases, in which an individual is convicted of multiple violations of the same criminal statute; and (2) double-description cases, in which a single act results in multiple convictions under different statutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.

According to the State, that conduct was factually distinguishable from the conduct that gave rise to the CSC/CSP convictions. However, the record does not indicate which of the three alternatives above the jury relied upon in reaching its general verdict finding Defendant guilty on the charge of aggravated burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {39} We begin with whether the conduct here was unitary. In contrast to Defendant's position, the State contends that the conduct required for aggravated burglary in this case is not unitary because in addition to touching Victim during the sexual assaults, Defendant unlawfully touched Victim when he covered her mouth with his hand. The State's argument relies on the assumption that, when the evidence provides alternative facts to support a finding of battery and there is no indication of which facts the jury relied on in reaching its verdict, we may affirm the conviction without violating double jeopardy principles.

In\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that his convictions for aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery violated his constitutional right to be free from double jeopardy because the conduct required for those crimes was subsumed by his first degree felony murder conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. The defendant and the state relied on different facts to support their theory of each conviction and, on that basis, claimed that the conduct was or was not unitary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26. According to the state, the conduct was not unitary because the jury instructions provided alternative bases for a conviction notwithstanding that there was \"no indication of which alternative the jury relied upon in reaching a general verdict[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Thus, the state asserted, there could be no double jeopardy violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Our Supreme Court rejected the state's argument noting that it \"must presume that a conviction under a general verdict requires reversal if the jury is instructed on an alternative basis for the conviction that\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   result in double jeopardy, and the record does not disclose whether the jury relied on this legally inadequate alternative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28 (emphasis added).

Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , we further presume the jury used the touching giving rise to the CSP/CSC conviction as grounds for the battery alternative in Defendant's aggravated burglary conviction. Finally, because there is no evidence of any intervening events, a significant separation in time or physical distance, or a change in Defendant's mental state between the touching giving rise to the battery and the CSP/CSC, we conclude that the conduct was unitary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, it protects a wide variety of structures, including \"any vehicle, watercraft, aircraft, dwelling or other structure movable or immovable.\" Section 30-16-4. The battery alternative, the focus of our analysis here, is likewise defined in broad terms to include \"the unlawful, intentional touching or application of force[,]\" done in \"a rude, insolent, or angry manner.\" Section 30-3-4. Both statutes provide numerous ways in which a violation may occur and a conviction be attained. We therefore must look \"beyond facial statutory language to the actual legal theory in the particular case by considering such resources as the evidence, the charging documents, and the jury instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335299\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmsc/2013/020/4335299/\">\n    2013-NMSC-020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 49,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20P.3d%20426\">\n    306 P.3d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {45} Our review of the record reveals that the State never communicated any theory to the jury nor did it argue any specific facts to support the aggravated burglary charge. Even the charging documents and jury instruction for aggravated burglary contained broad, boilerplate language straight from the statute, providing no insight into the State's theory of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250449\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/415/\">\n    2011-NMCA-074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250449\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/415/\">\n    150 N.M. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250449\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/415/\">\n    259 P.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that the state can avoid double jeopardy violations by identifying specific, non-unitary conduct in jury instructions). Because the State failed to provide any legal theory of the crime, and we have found none in the record, we conclude that Defendant's aggravated burglary conviction is subsumed by the CSP/CSC convictions, and Defendant was therefore subjected to two convictions for the same offense in violation of double jeopardy. We must now decide which conviction to vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {46} Defendant asks that we vacate either the CSC or aggravated burglary conviction, but he does not provide any additional explanation, argument or citation to authority as to the basis for his request. The State's analysis of the double jeopardy issue ends with its argument that the underlying\n   conduct was not unitary. We remind the parties that it is their responsibility to fully develop arguments on appeal and lament their failure to do so on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {47} That Defendant's conviction for one of the offenses must be reversed is clear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Olguin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995-NMSC-077\">\n    1995-NMSC-077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558835\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/120/740/\">\n    120 N.M. 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558835\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/120/740/\">\n    906 P.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] general verdict must be reversed if one of the alternative bases of conviction is legally inadequate[.]\"). What is not clear, however, is which offense we must vacate. When one of two otherwise valid convictions must be vacated to remedy a double jeopardy violation, we vacate the conviction carrying the shorter sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335299\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmsc/2013/020/4335299/\">\n    2013-NMSC-020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20P.3d%20426\">\n    306 P.3d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the district court imposed a nineteen-year sentence for the CSP conviction, a two-and-one-half-year sentence for the CSC conviction, and a ten-year sentence for aggravated burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {48} Vacating the conviction with the shortest sentence does not remedy the double jeopardy violation in this case. Although the CSC conviction clearly carries the shortest sentence, vacating that conviction continues to allow for two convictions for the same crime resulting in multiple punishments for the same conduct. The jury could have found that Defendant's actions that gave rise to the CSP conviction were the same as those that gave rise to the aggravated burglary conviction, yet both those convictions would remain. When ambiguity in the record leaves two convictions equally likely to violate double jeopardy when combined with a third, and the rule that we vacate the shortest sentence is rendered impractical due to the potential for a continued violation following remand, we conclude that it is appropriate to vacate the conviction that, though not imposing the shortest sentence, remedies the double jeopardy violations. Accordingly, we vacate Defendant's aggravated burglary conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Admission of DNA Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {49} Hours after the incident occurred, Victim underwent a sexual assault examination. The SANE who examined Victim found no injuries when conducting an external examination. The SANE did, however, note that Victim had a half-centimeter \"open area\" that was \"consistent with force.\" The SANE collected a pubic hair comb, oral swabs, vaginal swabs, cervical swabs, anal swabs, thigh swabs, and a blood sample from Victim. A SANE also collected oral swabs, penal swabs, pubic hair combing, swabbing of facial hair, and a swabbing of lower abdomen hair from Defendant. These items were subjected to DNA testing, along with two sheets from Victim's bed and Defendant's boxer shorts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {50} No semen was found on any of the items or on any of the swabs taken. There was no human male DNA on Victim's vaginal, cervical, or anal swabs, nor was there any in her pubic hair combing. Human male DNA was detected on one of the thigh swabs, but in insufficient amounts to allow for any further DNA testing. Defendant's expert witness characterized the amount of DNA from this swab as unreliable. Samples taken from underneath Defendant's fingernails contained Victim's DNA. DNA testing eliminated Victim as a contributor to the DNA found on Defendant's boxer shorts. The swabs taken from Defendant's lower abdomen revealed the presence of DNA from two or more individuals, and Victim could not be eliminated as a possible contributor to that DNA mixture. Defendant's expert testified, however, that there was a \"degree of inaccuracy\" to the abdomen swab results by emphasizing that there was more male DNA on the abdomen swab than total DNA, indicating female DNA was minimal or nonexistent. Both the State's expert and Defendant's expert testified regarding the transfer of DNA and the ways in which someone's DNA could appear on another person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {51} Defendant argues the district court erred in admitting testimony regarding the DNA results of the thigh swab taken from Victim and the lower abdomen swab taken from Defendant. Defendant argues that the existence of male DNA on the thigh swab was irrelevant because it could not be tied to a particular male and that the information was unhelpful to the jury and prejudicial. Defendant similarly argues that informing the jury that Victim could not be ruled out as a contributor of DNA was unhelpful to the jury but highly prejudicial. Defendant's argument that the DNA evidence was \"unhelpful\n   ... but ... also highly prejudicial\" is akin to a Rule 11-403 NMRA challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20P.3d%20426\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (allowing for the exclusion of evidence where its \"probative value is substantially outweighed\" by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {52} Admission of expert testimony and scientific evidence is a matter \"within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent a showing of abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

A court may exclude relevant evidence if \"its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice [or] misleading the jury[.]\" Rule 11-403. Defendant's challenge limits our inquiry to whether the evidence was helpful to the jury under Rule 11-702 and whether it was so unfairly prejudicial as to warrant exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {53} The evidence of the thigh and abdomen swabs is probative because it could assist the jury in choosing between the different theories presented regarding the events of that night. This evidence is unique in that it could be used to support either the State's or Defendant's theory, depending on what testimony the jury found credible or persuasive. If the jury were to find the DNA evidence persuasive, it may find the State's theory that Defendant committed sexual offenses against Victim to be more probable. The absence of quantifiable DNA, however, weighs in favor of Defendant's theory that although he was in the home, he did not commit the sexual offenses. In challenging whether the evidence would be helpful to the jury, Defendant challenges the weight that the evidence should be given. We leave that question to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994-NMSC-089\">\n    1994-NMSC-089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563428\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/284/\">\n    118 N.M. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563428\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/284/\">\n    881 P.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"questions about the accuracy of [DNA] results goes to the weight of the evidence and is properly left to the jury\"). We conclude that the evidence challenged by Defendant-the DNA results of thigh and abdomen swabs-was helpful to the jury in understanding the limits of the DNA found and determining facts at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 11-702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {54} We therefore turn to an assessment of whether the evidence in question was so prejudicial that the district court abused its discretion by failing to exclude it. The State presented the testimony regarding the thigh and abdominal swabs in a very narrow context and with careful limitation. The State's witness explained that the results rendered from the thigh swab were \"weak\" because of the low quantity of DNA found. She also acknowledged that there was no connection between the thigh swab results and Defendant. In addition, defense counsel vigorously cross-examined the State's expert regarding the statistical likelihood that Victim contributed to the abdomen swab's DNA mixture. Defendant also presented his own expert to attack the conclusion that Victim could not be eliminated as a contributor to the lower abdomen DNA mixture by testifying that a \"degree of inaccuracy\" existed in the abdomen swab results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {55} We acknowledge Defendant's argument that DNA evidence has the potential to be particularly persuasive to a jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994-NMSC-089\">\n    1994-NMSC-089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 63,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563428\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/284/\">\n    118 N.M. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563428\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/284/\">\n    881 P.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he aura of infallibility surrounding DNA evidence does present the possibility of a decision based on the perceived infallibility of the evidence[.]\").
