Among the relief it requested was a ruling that Substitute House Bill 1899 (SHB 1899), enacted in May 2011, applied retroactively to the penalty phase of the PRA proceeding. The 2011 legislation removed what had formerly been a $5 floor on per-day penalties. LAWS OF 2011, ch. 273, \u00a7 1 (effective July 22, 2011) amending RCW 42.56.550(4). A new trial court to whom the matter was assigned following remand ruled that SHB 1899, being remedial, applied retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Zinks then filed a motion for assessment of penalties, attorney fees, and costs against the city, supported by extensive documentation. The parties agreed that since this court had resolved the number of penalty days in\n   <em>\n    Zink\n   </em>\n   III, all that remained was for the trial court to set penalty amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 The trial court held a three-day hearing in which it used individual worksheets to assess the\n   <em>\n    Yousoufian\n   </em>\n   factors for each violation, indicating, with respect to each factor, whether it was \"strongly present,\" \"moderately present,\" \"not present,\" or \" NA [not applicable].\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 2437-69 (some capitalization omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 A few weeks thereafter, the trial court convened a hearing to deliver an oral ruling. It provided the parties with copies of its 33 penalty worksheets. The preliminary penalties identified as appropriate ranged from $1 per day on the low end to $100 per day on the high end. Some of the penalties were adjusted for four periods falling between the start dates established in\n   <em>\n    Zink\n   </em>\n   III and November 7, 2008, the date that findings, conclusions and an order for the second show cause hearing were entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 After identifying a calculation error, it was determined that the total penalty based on the 33 worksheet amounts and the four calculation periods was $352,955. The trial court told the parties it was \"a little unsettled\" by the $352,955 figure and would reserve a final ruling until the presentment of proposed findings and conclusions. Report of Proceedings (RP) (May 10, 2016) at 55. It rejected a party's reference to the court as having \"aimed\" for a different range, explaining, \"I have not aimed at any number, any gross number. I anticipated a methodology where I would just apply the factors as objectively as I could and let the chips fall where they may.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55. The court added, \"I also told you that my intentions were to then look at that number to see if I was uncomfortable with it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. The court told the parties it was going to give thought to the legal question of whether it had authority to \"go back and do a wholesale adjustment to the total. And I don't know the answer to that question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57.

Comparing Mesa with another city in Franklin County, the city explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   If Pasco had treated Ms. Zink the way Mesa treated Ms. Zink, the Court's preliminary penalty award of $352,955 might be warranted. But a penalty of that size would \"only\" amount to $5 per resident for Pasco, whereas that same penalty will cost each resident of Mesa $718. If Pasco was penalized at $718-per-resident, the total penalty would top $49 million. The City of Mesa suggests that no one would support giving away $49 million of tax payer dollars based on the statutory violations of a handful of government employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CP at 2899-2900 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 At the hearing on entry of the final order, the trial court told the parties it had concluded that a $175,000.00 penalty was \"sufficient to deter future conduct .... It is such an amount that would avoid this windfall to the plaintiffs. It will certainly sting the city but will not, in my judgment, cripple them.\" RP (June 29, 2016) at 59. Its written findings and conclusions state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   After reaching the preliminary total of $352,954, the Court has considered whether that amount was appropriate, taking into account Mesa's small size, limited resources, and the deterrent purposes of PRA penalties.
