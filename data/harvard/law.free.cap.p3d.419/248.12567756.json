Oklahoma Bar Association (Complainant) has presented this Court with an application to approve the resignation of James Lloyd Menzer (Respondent) from membership in the Oklahoma Bar Association. Respondent seeks to resign pending disciplinary proceedings and investigation into alleged misconduct, as provided in Rule 8.1, Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    5 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ch. 1, App. 1-A. Upon consideration of the Complainant's application and Respondent's affidavit in support of resignation, we find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"decisiondate\" id=\"p-7\">\n   1. Respondent executed his resignation on February 9, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   2. Respondent acted freely and voluntarily in tendering his resignation; he was not subject to coercion or duress, and was fully aware of the consequences of submitting his resignation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-9\">\n   3. Respondent acknowledged that the Office of the General Counsel of the Oklahoma Bar Association had received and was investigating the following grievances: DC 16-92 by Florence Kellam; DC 16-140 by Sherry Blazi; DC 16-193 by Jason Sullivan; DC 16-198 by Dawn Jackson; DC 16-249 by Truman Stiner; DC 17-26 by Arthur Oxford; DC 17-215 by Kimberly Haworth; and DC 17-222 by Teddy Tannehill. The gravamen of each of these grievances is that Respondent failed to fulfill arrangements he had made to perform legal services for the named aggrieved party. Respondent has waived the right to contest the allegations set forth in these grievances and in doing so relieves the Complainant from proving his failure to perform the agreed legal services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   4. Respondent is aware that the allegations concerning the conduct specified in paragraph three above, if proven, would constitute violations of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16(d), 5.3, and 8.4(a), (b) and (d) of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    5 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ch. 1, App. 3-A. Said conduct would also violate Rule 1.3, Oklahoma Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    5 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ch. 1, App. 1-A, and his oath as an attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n   5. Respondent further acknowledges that as a result of his conduct the Client Security Fund may receive claims from his former clients. He agrees that should the Oklahoma Bar Association approve and pay such Client Security Fund claims, he will reimburse the fund the principal amount and the applicable statutory interest prior to filing any application for reinstatement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   6. Respondent recognizes and agrees he may not make application for reinstatement to membership in the Oklahoma Bar Association prior to the expiration of five years from the effective date of this Court's approval of his resignation; he acknowledges he may be reinstated to practice law only upon compliance with the conditions and procedures prescribed by Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    5 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ch. 1, App. 1-A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n    7.
