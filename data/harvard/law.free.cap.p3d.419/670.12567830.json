Reger moved to dismiss the State's case arguing there was insufficient probable cause for his arrest. At a hearing, the Justice Court orally granted Reger's motion to dismiss and issued a written order fourteen days thereafter. Following the Justice Court's oral order dismissing the State's case, but prior to its issuance of the written order, the State appealed to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County. Reger filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing the State's appeal was premature. The District Court concluded the State's appeal was not premature; that it had subject matter jurisdiction; and that there was sufficient probable cause to arrest Reger. A jury convicted Reger of DUI. Reger appeals from the District Court's order denying his motion to dismiss in which he argued the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Reger presents the following issue for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err in concluding the State's appeal was not premature and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the proceeding?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In September 2015, a Gallatin County Sheriff's Deputy initiated a traffic stop after seeing Reger driving his vehicle at approximately seventy-three miles-per-hour in an area with a speed limit of forty-five miles-per-hour. The Deputy smelled alcohol emanating from Reger's vehicle, saw that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and heard him slur his words. Reger admitted he consumed alcohol prior to driving. The Deputy arrested Reger. Reger provided a breath sample on an Intoxilyzer 8000 that registered an alcohol content of 0.109. The State charged Reger with DUI in Gallatin County Justice Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Reger filed a motion to dismiss the Justice Court proceeding, arguing the Deputy lacked probable cause to arrest Reger. At a hearing on May 6, 2016, the Justice Court granted Reger's motion orally from the bench, concluding the Deputy lacked probable cause to arrest him. Five days later, on May 11, 2016, the State filed a notice of appeal to\n   District Court, appealing the \"order granting dismissal of the State's case entered in this action on the 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of May, 2016.\" On May 20, 2016, nine days after the State filed its notice of appeal, the Justice Court entered its written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order memorializing its May 6 oral order in which it granted Reger's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The District Court assumed jurisdiction. Reger filed a motion to dismiss the District Court proceeding, arguing the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the State filed its notice of appeal prematurely or before the Justice Court entered its written findings, conclusions, and order. The State responded, arguing that its appeal was timely because it can appeal from an order dismissing a case once it is issued orally from the bench. The District Court denied Reger's motion to dismiss the District Court proceeding, concluding the State's appeal was timely. A jury convicted Reger of DUI. Reger appeals the District Court's denial of his motion to dismiss in which he argued the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 If a party appeals from a justice court that is not a court of record, the district court's review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, Reger argues the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and erred by not granting his motion to dismiss. The State responds by arguing that it timely filed its notice of appeal within ten days after the Justice Court orally dismissed its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Statutes govern the procedure for appealing from a justice court to a district court. The statutes differentiate the procedure depending on whether the defendant is appealing from a conviction or the State is appealing from an order. A defendant may appeal from a justice court to a district court by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days after \"judgment is rendered\" or a motion to withdraw a plea is denied. Section 46-17-311(2), MCA. The State's ability to appeal is\n   narrowed by \u00a7 46-20-103, MCA. Generally, \"the state may not appeal in a criminal case.\" Section 46-20-103(1), MCA. Section 46-20-103(2), MCA, sets forth eight exceptions to the general rule and allows the State to appeal from \"any court order or judgment the substantive effect of which results in ... dismissing a case.\" Section 46-20-103(2)(a), MCA. If one or more of the exceptions apply, the State may appeal from a justice court to a district court by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days after \"the date that the order complained of is given.\" Section 46-17-311(2), MCA. Read together, \u00a7\u00a7 46-17-311(2) and 46-20-103(2)(a), MCA, allow the State to appeal from a justice court's dismissal of a case by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days after \"the date that the order complained of is given.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 At issue here is whether there is a distinction between the way in which a defendant perfects an appeal-by filing written notice within ten days after \"judgment is rendered\" or a motion to withdraw a plea is denied-and the way in which the State perfects an appeal-by filing written notice within ten days after \"the date that the order complained of is given.\" Our caselaw and \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, confirms that there is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Reger relies on\n   <em>\n    State v.

In 1991, the Legislature added a subsection, \u00a7 46-13-104(3), MCA, stating, \"The court's final determination of any pretrial motion must state, either in writing or on the record, the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20Mont.%20Laws%203083\">\n    1991 Mont.

The commission comments explain that the purpose of the \"new requirement that the determination of any pretrial motion either be written or stated on the record [is] so as to be available for review.\" Commissioners' Comment to \u00a7 46-13-104(3), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Section 46-13-104(3), MCA, does not alter the State's appellate timeframe under \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA. The statutes apply to different parties and serve patently different purposes. Under \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA,\n   <em>\n    the State\n   </em>\n   is allowed ten days after \"the date that the order complained of is given\" to appeal. Under \u00a7 46-13-104(3), MCA,\n   <em>\n    a court\n   </em>\n   must memorialize its final determination of a pretrial motion in order to facilitate an appellate court's review. Further, Reger cites \u00a7 46-18-116, MCA, which addresses a situation, unlike here, where an oral judgment conflicts with a written judgment and sets forth the requirements of a written judgment. Reger's reliance on \u00a7\u00a7 46-13-104(3) and 46-18-116, MCA, to support his claim that the District Court was without jurisdiction is thus misplaced. Neither statute addresses the subject matter jurisdiction of courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 Sections 46-17-311(2) and 46-20-103(2)(a), MCA, allow the State to appeal from a justice court's dismissal of a case by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days after \"the date that the order complained of is given.\" The State's appeal, filed after the Justice Court orally dismissed its\n   case, was not premature and the District Court did not err by denying Reger's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   DIRK M.
