We review such a determination by the trial court for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In this matter, a law enforcement officer anonymously published an advertisement on an online classifieds platform reserved for those over the age of 18 and indicated that she was \"a young female\" seeking an individual interested in a casual sexual encounter. Joshua Solomon responded to the advertisement. Thereafter, the police officer assumed the guise of a fictional 14-year-old girl and sent Solomon nearly 100 messages laden with graphic, sexualized language and innuendo and persistently solicited him to engage in a sexual encounter with the fictional minor, notwithstanding that he had rejected her solicitations seven times over the course of four days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 The trial court herein found that, in the totality, the actions of the law enforcement officer constituted outrageous misconduct in violation of Solomon's right to due process and dismissed the charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 The trial court did not abuse its discretion by so ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On September 10, 2014, Detective Theresa Luvera of the Skagit County Sheriff's Office anonymously published an advertisement on Craigslist, an online classifieds platform, in a section of the website in which individuals 18 years of age or older could solicit casual sexual encounters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The detective's advertisement was part of an undercover law enforcement operation designed to locate and prosecute individuals desiring to engage in unlawful sexual conduct with minors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The detective's advertisement set forth that the individual seeking a casual sexual encounter was \"a young female looking for sex with either a man or woman.\" It did not set forth the individual's name or age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 On September 12, 29-year-old Solomon responded to the advertisement, inquiring whether the individual who posted the advertisement was \"Only interested in woman.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nearly four hours later, Solomon added, \"Must be I won't bug anymore.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Four days later, Detective Luvera replied to Solomon's message. She identified herself as Taylor. Under the guise of Taylor, Detective Luvera indicated that she was still interested in having a sexual encounter. Solomon responded and they began to exchange messages. They also exchanged photographs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Forty-five minutes after Detective Luvera initially responded to Solomon's inquiry, she sent him a message discussing her age for the first time. She indicated that she was \"almost 15 but waaay advanced.\" Her message also reiterated that, notwithstanding her young age, she remained very interested in having a sexual encounter with Solomon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 In response, Solomon sent two messages, each of which expressly rejected Detective Luvera's proposition on the basis that she was a minor. The detective nonetheless replied, \"Cum on daddy? Age is only a number.\" Solomon rejected her proposition for a third time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 Over the next two hours, the detective continued sending him explicit messages expressing her eagerness to have a sexual encounter with him. In response, Solomon sent two messages in which he began to indicate a willingness to have intercourse with \"Taylor,\" asking for pictures of her naked or in her underwear. He then suddenly renewed his rejection, stating, \"I take everything back not interested at all this is a setup by cops or a website good luck to you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 Detective Luvera nevertheless persisted, replying, \"yeah, I bet u a bj that u would jack off after seeing me in a my bra and thong ...... lol ur too hot!\" Solomon yet again declined her advances, messaging, \"Hahahahahahahahahah what a set up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 Despite Solomon's rejections, the detective continued communicating with him and encouraging him to have sex with her (\"I'm very descrete Josh and my privacy means everything to me too., I just think u are hot and wouldn't mind fucking u, but if ur not into what I got, my loss.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 In response to another of the detective's messages nearly 30 minutes later, Solomon requested proof that \"Taylor\" was not a police officer, including requesting that Taylor \"friend\" him on Facebook,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   asking her what school she graduated from, and where her cell phone number was from. In response, Detective Luvera responded to his questions calling him \"handsome\" and \"babe\" and replying, \"Do u quiz all ur dates before u fuck em?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 The next day, September 17, Detective Luvera renewed the conversation and continued to proposition Solomon. In response to the detective's prompting, Solomon e-mailed the detective a photograph of his penis. Solomon then requested that \"Taylor\" call him on his cellular telephone. Detective Luvera agreed and they spoke over the telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 On September 18, Detective Luvera sent messages to Solomon both via e-mail and via the messaging interface on Facebook. In her messages, she asked, \"Can you cum see me later?\" and sent Solomon a photograph with the message, \"I have more....like whatya see so far? Lol\" and \"hang on, I get ya a better one, just 4 u?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 On September 19, Solomon renewed the conversation and he and Detective Luvera continued messaging one another until Solomon agreed to visit \"Taylor\" at her home later that night. Shortly thereafter, Detective Luvera messaged Solomon and asked him to purchase lingerie-\"U gonna buy me something to sexy to wear at VS?\"-and alcohol-\"Gonna bring me a little something sweet to drink baby? Like a wine cooler than I can lick off u? lol I go crazy over strawberry wine coolers ... lol.\" She also demanded that Solomon pay her in exchange for a nude photograph or in anticipation of their planned sexual encounter-\"Money .... I mean either U pay for the pics or U pay to fuck my sweet pussy ..... I know u want both.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19 The messaging continued throughout the day with Detective Luvera sending Solomon sexually suggestive and explicit messages, including \"Ur really r going to cum?,\" \"U can take all u want of me after I get a piece of ur ass lol,\" \"I'll meet u at the tennis crt bench with no panties on....wearing my tennis skirt,\" \"now I'm wet....Don't even think ur cumming over here and teasing me,\" \"U know how long it takes me to blow dry my hair? U can't cum in it either,\" \"I'll have enough of u to drink up anyway,\" and \"tell me baby what u want my mouth to do 2 u.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20 That evening, Solomon arrived in the neighborhood near the address that Detective Luvera had given him and was approached by law enforcement officers alerted to the detective's operation. Solomon was arrested shortly thereafter. In a search of his person and his pick-up truck, law enforcement officers uncovered a sealed condom wrapper, $60 in cash,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a store receipt from earlier that day itemizing the purchase of a sex toy and lingerie, and a plastic bag containing the purchases itemized in the receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21 Solomon was charged with one count of communication with a minor for immoral purposes, one count of commercial sex abuse of a minor, and one count of attempted rape of a child in the third degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22 Before trial, Solomon moved to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that the State had engaged in outrageous governmental misconduct in violation of his due process right to fundamental fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 23 The trial court granted Solomon's motion and ordered the charges against him dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 In evaluating a trial court's determination that the State engaged in outrageous misconduct in violation of a defendant's due process right to fundamental fairness, we initially turn to our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

I've known Detective Luvera for years and she's been the lead detective on a number of the largest cases we've had here in Skagit County. Detective Luvera is an extremely capable and competent and confident detective. But I think she went over the top on this one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Anyway, she instigated the thing, got it started, got the ball rolling by placing an ad on Craigslist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   And I understand on Craigslist you can buy furniture, automobiles, musical instruments, and partners if you hit the right keystroke. So an ad was placed on the Craigslist-what was that called again, Mr. Freeman?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   MR.

One is, okay, I can spend my time looking for someone who really took the hook and ran with it and spend my time going after those people and cut-and cut this one right here because this individual, whoever this Mr. Solomon is, decided he doesn't want to bug me anymore, and end it. Or the detective can take the other prong, which is, well, you know, I've got nothing else to do, maybe I can set the hook on this Mr. Solomon and we'll see if we can reel him in a little bit.

I'm totally descreet ... like my dads friends ... r u up for me ... cum on, Josh.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   So Josh then replies, \"wow, 15,\" probably \"not the best idea sorry I'm not willing to get in trouble ... maybe hit me up in 3 years if your still around girl,\" period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Now, once again, Detective's got two forks in the road. One is, okay, this guy twice now has told me he's not-he's refused to take the bait because I'm 15, end this operation right now, spend my time going after somebody who's going to actually be impressed by the fact that I'm a minor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Or the other prong in the road, can I-should I continue to let the line out a little bit and see if I can hook this guy in a little deeper. Detective takes that prong again.The next comment is from Mr. Solomon. \"Wow 15,\" probably \"not the best idea sorry I'm not willing to get in trouble ... maybe hit me up in 3 years if your still around girl. Your dad's friends got balls.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Another fork in the road. Detective chooses the one to see if she can let the line out a little more, and Mr. Solomon, stupid enough at the time to keep taking the line. And they go through this little drill for a while.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Mr. Solomon again says, \"As tempting as it is I'm gonna have to say ... something doesn't add up ... you ... really don't want to get a rape charge that would be no good for me.\" The detective keeps going and they chat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   1:00 in the afternoon, they're back again. Mr. Solomon says, \"I take everything back.\" I'm \"not interested at all this is a setup by the cops ... good luck to you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Mr. Solomon, 2:18, says, \"prove it ... girl what school did you go to where is your cell number.\" And then they start talking about some Facebook exchanges and-in an attempt by Mr. Solomon-it's pretty obvious from the textual content that he's looking for some proof about age\n   wanting a Facebook site or something, pictures, a name, a school, et cetera. So this goes on all afternoon back and forth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Then on Wednesday, the next day, September 17, 9:46 in the morning, the detective instigates it again. First text sent, \"Hey whazzzzzzzz up hottie? Lol I'm bored,\" and they discuss again, keep talking. The detective then-and on it goes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   So as you say, Mr. Freeman, about seven times there was an innuendo or an indication by Mr. Solomon that he wanted out and would end it, and all seven times, those forks in the road, the detective chose to take the one letting the line out to see if she could keep reeling him in. And as you said, about 60 percent or so, three in five of the texts were instigated by the detective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   So I think that fits the bill for whether the defendant's reluctance to commit the crime was overcome by persistent solicitation. It was persistent. You can't read this and not say it wasn't-if Detective Luvera is one thing, she is persistent in everything she does.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 59 The trial court thus found that Solomon's reluctance to commit the crime was manifested by his repeated-seven times-attempts to discontinue the conversation. The trial court further found that the State had engaged in persistent solicitation of Solomon, given that the detective continued to solicit him each of the seven times that he sought to withdraw and, in addition, sent the majority of the over 200 messages exchanged between the two parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 60 The trial court also found that the State had controlled the criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   The government controlled this. They started it, they initiated it. The first three days-on Thursday, the next day, the third day in the situation, 8:46 in the morning, first text, Detective, \"Hey, sorry babe, I just got home. My dad showed up ... and made me go to his house ... I will friend you right now. Do u hate me?\" And they talk again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 61 The trial court thus found that Detective Luvera controlled the criminal conduct both by initiating the interaction between her and Solomon and by stringing him along over the course of the four days of exchanges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 62 The trial court next found that the conduct by law enforcement was repugnant to a sense of justice.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   I can't believe the detective would want to go to trial on this and subject this language to citizens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   I'm just going to give you a little tidbit. At 3:17 on Wednesday, September 17th, the detective says, \"OMG U R so f'ing hung baby!!! WTF ... I'm so amped up after seeing this. I have wait for my sister to leave and I am gonna video tape me finger banging me to ur pic! Can't u cum and see me now!!!\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Yeah, that's repugnant. I don't care how you cut that pie. You can be a seasoned old sailor or whatever, but that is repugnant. That's a detective letting line out very fast on a free spool trying to get Mr. Solomon back in the game. And there is no other way to-there is no other way to describe it. It's outrageous. That is repugnant. It's egregious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   I'm not saying that the facts in this case are as egregious as\n   <em>\n    Lively\n   </em>\n   where they go and solicit a lady who's tried to commit suicide in the AA meeting, but the facts in this are egregious enough to meet the standards in\n   <em>\n    Lively\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   And we'll see-I hope this goes to the Court of Appeals because, as I said, we have an impasse. It's three prosecutors versus three judges, three judges who have all looked at this. Interesting to see what the Court of Appeals thinks, or the Supreme Court, as to whether or not this is.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Because I think we really do-I'm not the genius on this. My word shouldn't be the final say. I think we do need-because it's been a long time since\n   <em>\n    Lively\n   </em>\n   , This is-this\n   happens all the time. The sex trade on the internet is a horrendous problem. The detectives and law enforcement have to do something to do that, they need to do stings, but we need to have a line about how far is too far, and I think this is a good one to do that on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   So more power to appellate courts and the Court of Appeals on this, and they can take a look at it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   But to this judge's way of thinking, who is-who did spend five years in the service, three of them overseas and have seen a few monkeys and footballs, I find it outrageous and over-the-top.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In this way, the court determined that the detective's use of graphic and highly sexualized language amounted to a manipulation of Solomon that was repugnant to a sense of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 63 Ultimately, the trial court concluded that, considering the totality of the circumstances, law enforcement engaged in outrageous conduct that deprived Solomon of the right to due process. The trial court then dismissed the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 64 In ruling to dismiss the charges, the trial court did not adopt a view that no reasonable judge would take. Given the court's finding that law enforcement had initiated and controlled the criminal activity, persistently solicited Solomon to commit the crimes so initiated, and acted in a manner (through the use of language and otherwise) repugnant to the trial judge's view of the community's sense of justice, the trial court's determination was tenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 65 Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering that the charges against Solomon be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 66 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Mann, A.C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Leach, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    In order to publish or respond to such an advertisement, the website's terms and conditions required that a participating individual acknowledge that they are eighteen years of age or older.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    We reference the parties' electronic communications using the original punctuation, syntax, and spelling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    In the supplemental narrative to her incident report, Detective Luvera indicated that \"[t]he photos I used were known people to law enforcement and had agreed to allow us to use their photos for this investigation and signed a release agreement.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Facebook is an online social media platform.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Of the roughly 200 messages exchanged between Solomon and Detective Luvera, Detective Luvera sent nearly 60 percent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Earlier that day, Solomon had messaged Detective Luvera, \"I hae 60 in my pocket.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    In concurring, Justice Alexander also granted deference to the trial court.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n    Reasonable minds may differ regarding the trial court's and the majority's conclusion that the ruse employed here was not repugnant to a \"sense of justice.\" Majority at 378.
