We here decide whether a policy exclusion for personal liability \"under any contract or agreement\" relieves an insurer of defending its insured, an alleged builder-vendor, against a claim for negligent excavation brought by the home buyer. We hold that the exclusion does not apply to relieve the insurer of its duty to defend because the negligence claim arises from the common law duty to construct the home as a reasonable builder would.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Dennis Teufel hired Carmel Homes Design Group to build a mountainside home on a vacant lot in Paradise Valley (the \"Longlook Property\"). He had previously \"dabbled in real estate\" and \"invested money from time to time in a loose partnership [with Carmel Homes Design Group].\" Teufel intended to reside at the Longlook Property, and at the start of construction he purchased a homeowner's policy from American Family Mutual Insurance Company (\"American Family\"), which insured against personal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Teufel changed his mind about living at the Longlook Property. Thus, in May 2011, after construction was completed, he sold that property to Cetotor, Inc. (\"Cetotor\"), and the homeowner's policy coverage ended. The real estate purchase contract governing this sale is not in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Teufel purchased a home in Scottsdale (the \"82nd Place Property\"), moved in, and bought a new homeowner's policy from American Family. This policy also provided personal liability coverage and obligated\n   American Family to defend Teufel against claims seeking \"compensatory damages for which any insured is legally liable\" because of \"bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence.\" The policy defined \"occurrence\" as \"an accident ... which results during the policy period, in ... bodily injury ... or ... property damage.\" The policy was effective from January 2012 through January 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Rockslides occurred on the Longlook Property in November 2011 and August 2012, allegedly as the result of improper excavation during construction, which damaged the property. In November 2012, Cetotor sued Teufel, alleging he was a builder-vendor and asserting breach of contract, negligence, and fraud-based claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Teufel tendered defense of Cetotor's complaint to American Family under the Longlook Property and the 82nd Place Property policies. American Family declined the tender of defense on the grounds there was no coverage under either policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Teufel sued American Family and its agent, seeking damages and declaratory relief. The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of American Family. The court found that Cetotor's property damage occurred outside the Longlook Property policy period so no \"occurrence\" triggered coverage under that policy. Although the court found that the property damage from the August 2012 rockslide was an \"occurrence\" during the 82nd Place Property policy period, and the policy's \"business pursuits\" exclusion did not apply, it ruled there was no coverage per the policy's \"contractual liability\" exclusion. As a result, American Family had no duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment with respect to the Longlook Property policy but reversed with respect to the 82nd Place Property policy.\n   <em>\n    Teufel v.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The contractual liability exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 American Family concedes that an \"occurrence\" of \"property damage\" happened during the 82nd Place Property policy term, and it must therefore defend Teufel against Cetotor's complaint unless a policy exclusion applies. Accordingly, the only issue here is whether, as a matter of law, the contractual liability exclusion relieves American Family of the duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The contractual liability exclusion to personal liability coverage in the 82nd Place Property policy provides: \"Contractual Liability. We will not cover personal liability under any contract or agreement.\" The dispute here concerns the meaning of \"under any contract or agreement\" and whether it includes personal liability based on Cetotor's negligence claim. The policy does not define \"under.\" And because fifteen other policy exclusions for personal liability use the term \"arising out of,\" it is unclear whether \"under\" carries a different meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The superior court saw no meaningful distinction between \"under\" and \"arising out of.\" It reasoned that using either definition, Teufel's potential liability to Cetotor for negligence is \"necessarily 'under a contract' \" because liability would not exist \"absent the underlying real estate purchase contract.\" The court of appeals rejected that reasoning, concluding that Cetotor's negligence claim was \"entirely independent\" of the contract between Cetotor and Teufel, which only \"placed the parties within tortious striking range of one another, but ... was otherwise unrelated to liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Teufel\n   </em>\n   , 1 CA-CV 15-0736,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201882330\">\n    2017 WL 1882330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 American Family urges us to adopt the superior court's interpretation of the contractual liability exclusion. It points out that nothing limits the exclusion's application to liability based solely on a breach of contract. According to American Family, \"under\" should be broadly interpreted to mean that the exclusion applies to liability that could not exist \"but for\" a contract, \"irrespective of whether the liability is related to or independent of the contract.\" It then concludes that Cetotor's negligence claim falls within the exclusion because \"without entering into the real estate contract with Teufel, Cetotor would not have been exposed to the effects of the alleged defective excavation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Teufel, unsurprisingly, favors the court of appeals' construction. He argues that because the exclusion does not mention tort liability, \"under\" should be construed narrowly as referring to liability governed solely by a contract. He concludes that the exclusion \"eliminates coverage for contractual liability and only contractual liability\" and does not apply to tort liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 The parties' conflicting interpretations are each reasonable, and the exclusion is therefore ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539368\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/162/251/#p258\">\n    162 Ariz. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539368\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/162/251/#p258\">\n    782 P.2d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We resolve the ambiguity by examining the transaction as a whole, including the policy language and the insured's reasonable expectations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Action Acquisitions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425243\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/394/\">\n    218 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   397 \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425243\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/394/\">\n    187 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1110 ;\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539368\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/162/251/#p258\">\n    162 Ariz. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539368\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/162/251/#p258\">\n    782 P.2d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 We start with the policy's language. Whether or not \"under\" and \"arising out of\" carry different meanings, neither supports the \"but for\" construction. Webster's defines \"under\" in the contractual context as \"required by,\" \"in accordance with,\" and \"bound by.\"\n   <em>\n    Under\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2487 (2002). \"Arise\" means \"to originate from a specified source\" or \"to come into being.\"\n   <em>\n    Arise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1117. Applying these definitions, the contractual liability exclusion applies to personal liability required by or originating from a contract; it is not triggered simply because a contract brought the injured party and the insured together. As American Family acknowledged during oral argument, the exclusion would not apply, for example, if an insured under this policy contracted with a business to replace his car's windshield but negligently failed to warn the business that a vicious dog was in the car, resulting in the insured's personal liability for a bitten worker's injuries. The worker's negligence claim would \"stand alone\" from the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 An insured's reasonable expectations under this policy also suggest that the contractual liability exclusion does not apply to liability based on a stand-alone tort claim that is viable apart from any contract between the injured party and the insured. Nothing in the exclusion suggests such a restriction. Indeed, the exclusion is titled \"Contractual Liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darner Motor Sales, Inc. v.

In its discussion, the Court acknowledged that a builder has a \"common law duty of care\" and concluded that both tort and contract claims can exist when a home is negligently constructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [W]e agree with those jurisdictions that have held that injury incurred due to negligent construction of a residence may give rise to an action for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike performance and habitability and an action for breach of the contractor's common law duty of care. ... We see no reason to preclude a purchaser from claiming damages in contract and in tort. The purchaser of a home can seek to recover in contract for defects in the structure itself as such defects render the home less than the purchaser bargained for. ... The purchaser can also seek to recover in tort for injuries sustained due to the contractor's failure to construct the home as a reasonable contractor would. For example, if a fireplace collapses, the purchaser can sue in contract for the cost of remedying the structural defects and sue in tort for damage to personal property or personal injury caused by the collapse.
