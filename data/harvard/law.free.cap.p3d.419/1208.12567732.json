UM Campus Police Officer Shannon Parsons was on uniformed foot patrol at the game with the specific duty assignment of patrolling and issuing citations for underage drinking in violation of \u00a7 45-5-624, MCA (minor in possession of intoxicating substance (MIP)). On the main stadium concourse (second level), Officer Parsons encountered Kroschel and Kaitlynn O'Connell walking toward the restroom. Parsons testified that she first noticed the two young women because she saw them walking arm-in-arm, unsteady on their feet, with O'Connell physically assisting Kroschel to the restroom. Suspecting that the two had been drinking underage and concerned about Kroschel's apparent level of intoxication, Parsons approached and asked if they were okay. When they responded that they were, Officer Parsons noticed an alcoholic odor emanating from them and asked for proof of identification. O'Connell produced identification showing that she was 21 years old. When Kroschel stated that she did not have identification because it was in her coat back at her stadium seat, Parsons asked Kroschel for her UM student ID number. Kroschel answered that she was no longer a UM student and could not remember her former ID number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Officer Parsons then asked Kroschel for her name and date of birth. Kroschel gave a misspelled name (\"Marcie Krochel\") and a false date of birth indicating that she was 21. Parsons ran radio dispatch checks through the UM and CJIN\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   databases which returned no record on the name and date of birth given by Kroschel. Officer Parsons later testified that, in her experience in dealing with young adults on the UM campus, the absence of a record on those databases often indicates a false name. At the Municipal Court suppression hearing, Parsons testified that she asked Kroschel for her true name\n   and date of birth at least twice with the same result. Getting no satisfactory response, Parsons asked Kroschel to accompany her \"to the station\" for the purpose of ascertaining her identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Kroschel became highly emotional and uncooperative, refused to accompany Parsons to the station, and asserted that Parsons was interfering with her desire to go home. Officer Parsons then warned Kroschel that she was obstructing Parsons' investigation and warned further that, unlike the offense of MIP, the offense of obstructing a peace officer is a jailable offense. In her subsequent testimony, Parsons explained that her purpose in so warning Kroschel was not to threaten or coerce her but, rather, \"to give her information so that she could make the decision to tell me her correct name and date of birth.\" When Kroschel attempted to walk away, Officer Parsons physically grabbed her by the elbow, told her that they were \"going to the station,\" and then physically \"guided\" her to and down the stairway. On the way down, Kroschel began to walk compliantly and Parsons released her grip. Parsons did not formally arrest Kroschel but later testified that Kroschel was not free to go until Parsons could verify her true identity. Kroschel testified that she was crying, scared, and repeatedly told the officer that she did not want to go with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At the bottom of the stairway, as they approached a ground floor stadium gate, Parsons and Kroschel encountered another UM police officer on underage drinking patrol, Detective Chris Croft. Detective Croft then subjected Kroschel to a second round of questioning as to her true name and date of birth. As Croft questioned Kroschel, Officer Parsons ordered Kroschel's friend away, leaving Kroschel alone with the officers. Unable to confirm Kroschel's identity and age, and unsatisfied with her responses, the two police officers walked Kroschel to a secluded room in an adjoining concessions building connected to the stadium where they sat her down in a closed room for a third round of questioning about her true identity and date of birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Alone with two police officers behind a closed door in a secluded room, Kroschel continued to give the same misspelled name and false date of birth in response to Detective Croft's repeated questioning. Kroschel later testified that it was clear that she was not free to leave. Kroschel eventually relented and gave the officers her true name and date of birth. Another UM database check confirmed that she was in fact a 20-year-old UM student. After issuing Kroschel a notice to appear before the Missoula Municipal Court on the misdemeanor offenses of MIP and obstructing a police officer, Officer Parsons released Kroschel without further incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Kroschel appeared before the Municipal Court and later moved for suppression of the State's evidence of her age, date of birth, and the fact that she gave false information to police, on the asserted ground that the police unreasonably prolonged the initial investigative stop in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution, and \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. Kroschel further asserted that police subjected her to a custodial interrogation without a rights advisory in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. In denying the motion, the Municipal Court first ruled that Officer Parsons validly stopped and briefly questioned Kroschel on the main stadium concourse based on particularized suspicion of criminal activity as permissible under the Fourth Amendment. The Court ruled further that, though the stop ripened into a custodial interrogation which generally requires a constitutional rights advisory under the Fifth Amendment, no rights advisory was necessary in this case because the information sought by police (name, age, and date of birth) was merely non-incriminating, \"basic biographical data.\" At a subsequent non-jury trial, the Municipal Court found Kroschel guilty of being a minor in possession of alcohol but not guilty of obstructing a peace officer. Kroschel timely appealed the Municipal Court's suppression ruling to the District Court. The District Court affirmed\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Kroschel now timely appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On appeal from a municipal court of record, district courts function as intermediate courts of appeal with the scope of review \"confined to review of the record and questions of law.\" Sections 3-5-303 and 3-6-110(1), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

As a procedural component of these protections, government searches and seizures must generally occur pursuant to a judicial warrant issued on probable cause. U.S. Const. amend. IV (\"no Warrants\" for search or seizure \"shall issue, but upon probable cause\") and Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 11 (\"No warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue ... without probable cause\"). A constitutional seizure of a person occurs when a government officer \"in some way\" restrains a person's liberty by means of physical force or show of authority that, under the totality of the circumstances, would cause an objectively reasonable person to believe that the person is not free to leave the presence of the officer.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Though police certainly dealt with Kroschel in a firm and authoritative manner, the officers did not initially treat her in a manner or to a degree significantly different than in a typical investigative stop where a suspect is not free to leave and police must use a modicum of physical restraint to prevent an uncooperative person from leaving. However, though Officer Parsons had continuing particularized suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to prolong her investigative stop of Kroschel under the Fourth Amendment, the encounter began to progressively escalate in coercive nature beyond a typical temporary investigative stop when the officer threatened her with prosecution on a jailable offense, told her they were going \"to the station,\" and forcefully \"guided her\" to and down the stadium stairs with the stated and apparent intent to take her there. The coercive nature of the encounter escalated a second time when another police officer joined in and subjected Kroschel to a second round of questioning in a more remote location (downstairs near the stadium exit) while the first officer ordered Kroschel's friend away, thereby isolating her in the custody of the police. The coercive nature of the encounter escalated yet again when, after expressly or implicitly threatening her with arrest and prosecution on a jailable offense and making it clear that she would not be free to go until she told them what they wanted to hear, police took Kroschel to an even more secluded and confined area for a third-round of\n   indefinite questioning, this time in a closed room alone with two uniformed officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b628 The State asserts that Kroschel was not in Fifth Amendment custody because her detention was \"no more severe\" than the temporary detentions that did not constitute custody in\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , several Billings police officers were in the process of executing a search warrant in a motel room in connection with illegal transactions involving drugs, stolen property, and bad checks.\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. In response to knocking on the motel room door, an officer opened the door to an unidentified man who walked into the open doorway and asked for the suspect in the investigation by name.\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 and 19. In response, the officer told the man that he intended to perform an officer-safety pat-down search and asked if the man had any weapons, drugs, or needles on his person.\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. After the man replied that he had \"some smoke\" in his coat pocket, the officer physically turned him around, directed him to put his hands on the wall, and conducted a brief pat-down search that led to his arrest for possession of methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia.\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 28-33. As pertinent here, the District Court rejected the defendant's subsequent assertion that the officer violated his right to be free from self-incrimination by questioning him without a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   advisory incident to a Fourth Amendment stop and frisk.\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 28-33. Noting that the temporary stop, related questioning, and frisk took place on particularized suspicion of criminal activity, lasted only 2-3 minutes, and did not involve significant physical restraint, we held that the stop did not ripen into a Fifth Amendment custodial interrogation under the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b629 In\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , a citizen observer riding with a patrolling police officer reported what appeared to be another driver smoking a marijuana pipe behind the wheel of a vehicle at a Billings intersection. After stopping the vehicle, ordering the driver back into his vehicle, smelling a marijuana odor, observing signs of marijuana intoxication, observing the driver reach down between the seats of his vehicle, and then ordering the driver to exit and put his hands on the vehicle, the police officer conducted a pat-down search.\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-9. The officer next presumptively asked the man what happened to the marijuana pipe and whether there was marijuana in the vehicle. When the man answered that the marijuana was behind the driver's seat, the officer immediately looked in that location and found a small canister containing marijuana and drug paraphernalia.\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. Following his arrest, the man moved for suppression of the evidence on the asserted ground,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the officer unlawfully questioned him without a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning and waiver.\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Citing\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   , we held that, despite their potentially incriminating nature, the officer's questions were well within the scope of the predicate particularized suspicion for the stop.\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32. Further noting that the officer did not handcuff the man prior to arrest, the questioning occurred in a public place, the brief duration of the stop, and that the officer gave no indication that the duration of the stop would be indefinite, we held that the stop and related questioning did not ripen into a Fifth Amendment custodial interrogation under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b630 In contrast to the brief detentions and related questioning at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , the duration of the police detention and questioning of Kroschel was much longer than a few minutes. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , police questioned the suspects in the public and semi-public places in which they stopped them and then asked only a limited number of questions (no more than 2-3 each).\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5-7 and 19 ;\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-9. Here, police twice moved Kroschel against her will to increasingly secluded areas for questioning-first away from the main stadium concourse down to a stadium exit while the game was in progress and then out of the stadium into a totally secluded adjoining room where they subjected her to closed-door questioning alone in the presence of two uniformed police officers. By the time police were questioning Kroschel in the secluded concession room, they had subjected her to repeated questioning about the same matter in three distinct rounds of questioning. Further, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   , the officers repeatedly questioned Kroschel under a not-too-subtle\n   threat of arrest and prosecution on a jailable offense, all the while making it clear that she could gain her release only by giving them the incriminating information they clearly sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b631 At the point that Officer Parsons physically \"guided\" Kroschel down the main concourse stairs to take her \"to the station\" against her will under a clear threat of arrest and incarceration on a jailable offense, this was no longer the brief and only moderately-coercive situation contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Terry,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Elison\n   </em>\n   where, incident to a valid investigative stop, police briefly detained a suspect in the field and asked for the person's name, age, and account of the person's presence or conduct to confirm or dispel the initial particularized suspicion for the stop. Nor was this the situation contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Hulse\n   </em>\n   where, during the lawful course of an initial temporary investigatory stop, police developed additional particularized suspicion warranting further investigation, including limited related questioning regarding the original or newly suspected criminal activity. Both of those permissible Fourth Amendment scenarios had already transpired as early as the point when Officer Parsons physically \"guided\" Kroschel downstairs to go \"to the station\" against her will, and certainly at the point that the officers subsequently took her into another building for a third round of questioning, this time alone in a secluded closed room dominated by two uniformed police officers. This was a situation where, after the exhaustion and failure of initial interrogative efforts incident to a valid temporary investigative stop, police significantly upped the ante, i.e., the level of coercion, similar in coercive degree to a formal, post-arrest incommunicado interrogation. The Municipal Court clearly recognized as much in concluding that the circumstances could have \"constitute[d] probable cause for arrest\" and then analogized the isolated concession room questioning to a\n   <em>\n    post-arrest\n   </em>\n   or pre-citation\n   <em>\n    custodial\n   </em>\n   inquiry regarding \"the basic biographical data necessary\" to complete booking or issue a \"citation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b632 Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

The majority's attempt to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   is, at best, strained. In\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , Driscoll was in a bar, holding an alcoholic beverage. Based on Driscoll's youthful appearance, officers approached him and asked his age. When he reported he was twenty-two years old, officers then requested proof of identification verifying his age. He declined to provide such.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. The officers then requested Driscoll step outside and provide his name and date of birth.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Driscoll gave them a false name and date of birth. The name and date of birth returned no record in the CJIN database. The officers immediately arrested Driscoll and charged him with MIP and obstructing a peace officer.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b641 Here, the salient facts are nearly identical to\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   . Kroschel and her friend were walking arm-in-arm in an unsteady manner. Officer Parsons approached the two women and testified she smelled alcohol on them. Officer Parsons requested proof of identification verifying their age. Kroschel declined to provide identification because it was back in her coat pocket. Officer Parsons requested Kroschel's name and date of birth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kroschel gave Officer Parsons her name, albeit misspelled, and a false date of birth. Kroschel's name and date of birth returned no record in the UM and CJIN databases. Officer Parsons then asked Kroschel to accompany her \"to the station.\" Here, Officer Parsons had nearly identical information regarding Kroschel as the officers had regarding Driscoll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b642 Despite the similar facts, the majority distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   because \"Officer Parsons articulated additional facts supporting her continuing suspicion.\" Opinion, \u00b6 18. The majority asserts, in addition to the articulated observations (similar to those articulated in\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   ), Officer Parsons had knowledge, based on experience, \"that negative returns on UM and CJIN database name checks on young people present on the UM campus usually indicate a false name or date of birth.\" Opinion, \u00b6 18. However, the majority fails to recognize the officers in\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   clearly possessed the same knowledge, because the officers arrested Driscoll when the CJIN check returned no record of the name and date of birth he provided.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b643 The majority also distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   because \"the negative returns on the UM and CJIN database checks gave rise to\n   <em>\n    additional particularized suspicion\n   </em>\n   , as articulated by the officer based on her particular experience in similar circumstances, that Kroschel had then also committed\n   <em>\n    the additional offense\n   </em>\n   of obstructing a peace officer.\" Opinion, \u00b6 20. However, Driscoll was also charged with both MIP and obstructing a peace officer after he provided a false name and date of birth.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. In\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , we stated that \"the officers failed to articulate any reason in their report for continuing their questioning of Driscoll after he responded that he was 22.\"\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. Therefore, without more facts, the investigatory stop in\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   should have stopped when Driscoll stated he was twenty-two years old (prior to running his name and date of birth through any database).\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. The majority's reasoning that the databases search constitutes additional articulated facts to extend the investigatory stop fails to recognize that, based on\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , when Kroschel gave Officer Parsons her name and date of birth-stating she was over the drinking age-the investigatory stop\n   should have ended. Furthermore, Kroschel repeatedly stated the same name and date of birth to Officer Parsons. Opinion, \u00b6 3. Based on\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , the investigatory stop should have ended after Kroschel provide a name and date of birth, because at that point Officer Parsons had no articulable facts that Kroschel was underage other than Officer Parsons's assumption that college students lie. At a minimum, the investigatory stop should have ended when the databases returned nothing on the name and date of birth given by Kroschel because the negative return failed to give rise to any additional articulable facts that Kroschel was underage. Nevertheless, the majority's assumption that the negative result in the databases gave Officer Parsons cause to extend the scope of the investigatory stop is contrary to our holding in\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b644 The record of the Municipal Court proceeding reflects that Officer Parsons observed Kroschel's companion, not Kroschel, to be unsteady on her feet. Neither student was carrying a drink. Officer Parsons testified that she could smell alcohol. The focus appears to have shifted to Kroschel based on her recalcitrance and refusal to answer questions, rather than articulable suspicions she had committed a crime. The testimony reflects that Kroschel was then subjected to questioning outside the scope of the statute, and was not permitted to leave. Consistent with our holding in\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   , I would conclude Officer Parsons did not have sufficient particularized suspicion of criminal activity to continue to detain Kroschel for further investigation after the UM and CJIN database checks returned no record on the name and date of birth provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b645 Not only did Officer Parsons lack a basis for the stop under the Fourth Amendment, the Montana Constitution more expansively protects citizens' rights from unreasonable searches and seizures and invasions of their privacy. Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11. This Court has previously held it is unreasonable for a police officer to arrest and detain a person for a non-jailable offense when there are no circumstances to justify an immediate arrest.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the absence of special circumstances such as a concern for the safety of the offender or the public, a person stopped for a non-jailable offense such as a MIP \"should not be subjected to the indignity of an arrest and police station detention when a simple, non-intrusive notice to appear pursuant to \u00a7 46-6-310(1), MCA, will serve the interests of law enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b646 The holding in\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   is consistent with the legislative history of \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. H.B. 40, 58th Leg. (2003). Representative Brad Newman carried the bill for the Montana Department of Justice. Hearing on Mont. H.B. 40, 58th Leg., before the S. Comm. on Judiciary at 11 (March 11, 2003). The original bill draft provided that an officer could \"demand\" a name and address from a citizen even if she is not operating a motor vehicle. Mont. H.B. 40.01, 58th Leg. (2003). The Legislature rejected the verb \"demand\" in favor of a mere \"request\" for a name and address. Mont. H.B. 40.03, 58th Leg. (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b647 Officer Parsons's extended investigatory stop detaining Kroschel was unconstitutional because MIP is a non-jailable offense and no special circumstances were present to justify detention. In fact, Officer Parsons specifically dispelled any special circumstances by asking Kroschel if she was okay, to which she replied affirmatively. In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, Officer Parsons's investigatory stop for a MIP should have ended by citing Kroschel for MIP at the site of the initial stop or letting her go without citation. The majority's opinion fails to set a clear line as to how long an investigatory stop can extend when no special circumstances or probable cause exists for immediate arrest. Therefore, Officer Parsons's repeated demands for Kroschel's name and date of birth exceeded the scope of the statute and unlawfully detained Kroschel for a non-jailable offense because there were no circumstances to justify immediate arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b648 I concur with the majority's conclusion that the stop ripened into a custodial interrogation without a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   advisory in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution such\n   that Kroschel's motion to suppress evidence was erroneously denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Judge Elizabeth Best joins in the specially concurring Opinion of Justice Gustafson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Justice James Jeremiah Shea, specially concurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b649 I join Justice Gustafson's Concurrence and Dissent because it crafts a bright line for what constitutes reasonably necessary detention and investigation when an individual is suspected of committing a non-jailable offense. Beyond that, however, I write separately because it bears noting that, as the majority acknowledges, this case is ultimately being resolved on Fifth Amendment grounds. Opinion, \u00b6 20, n.8. Thus, the ostensible holding of Issue One is effectively an advisory opinion, if not outright dicta. The majority states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Since we ultimately resolve this case on Fifth Amendment grounds, we need not address Kroschel's additional Fourth Amendment and related statutory contention that, even if police permissibly prolonged the initial stop after the UM and CJIN database checks returned no record contradicting the information given by Kroschel, her continued detention and questioning soon evolved into an unreasonably prolonged constitutional seizure and statutory detention after the second round of questioning near the stadium exit developed no new facts supporting a continuing particularized suspicion that Kroschel was underage or provided false information to police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Opinion, \u00b6 20, n.8. In fact, since we ultimately resolve this case on Fifth Amendment grounds, we need not address\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of Kroschel's Fourth Amendment and related statutory contentions. Since the Court is unanimous in its conclusion that the police violated Kroschel's Fifth Amendment rights and the evidence should be suppressed on that basis, I view an advisory opinion on the scope of any Fourth Amendment violations as both unnecessary and imprudent. If the Court is determined to wade into that end of the pool, however, I think it is incumbent upon us to get both feet wet and not simply ignore Kroschel's contention that \"her continued detention and questioning soon evolved into an unreasonably prolonged constitutional seizure and statutory detention ....\" Opinion, \u00b6 20, n.8. Otherwise, it's not clear to me what advice the advisory part of the majority's opinion is offering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b650 The majority concludes \"Officer Parsons had sufficient particularized suspicion of criminal activity ... to continue to detain Kroschel for further investigation after the UM and CJIN database checks returned no record on the name and date of birth provided.\" Opinion, \u00b6 20. But as the majority notes, \"the duration and scope of a stop may not exceed what is reasonably necessary to confirm or dispel the predicate suspicion for the stop.\" Opinion, \u00b6 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Royer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p500\">\n    460 U.S. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p500\">\n    103 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1325-26 ;\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p16\">\n    392 U.S. at 17-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 S.Ct. at 1878-79 ). In this case, the predicate suspicion was that Kroschel was a MIP, a non-jailable offense. This necessarily begs the question: What further investigation is reasonably necessary and appropriate when the predicate suspicion is a non-jailable offense? As Justice Gustafson correctly notes in her Concurrence and Dissent, we have already answered that question in\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   . Gustafson Concurrence and Dissent, \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b651 In\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   , we held that it is unreasonable for a police officer to arrest and detain a person for a non-jailable offense when there are no circumstances to justify an immediate arrest.\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33.

As Justice Gustafson notes, there were no such special circumstances present here. Gustafson Concurrence and Dissent, \u00b6 9. Thus, there was no basis for Kroschel's continued detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b652 Officer Parsons was on uniformed foot patrol at the football game \"with the specific duty assignment of patrolling and\n   <em>\n    issuing citations\n   </em>\n   for underage drinking in violation of \u00a7 45-5-624, MCA....\" Opinion, \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). If Officer Parsons thought she had a valid basis to cite Kroschel for MIP, she could have issued her a citation on the spot, consistent with her specific duty assignment. Yet, as the majority Opinion aptly describes, this situation escalated into three\n   rounds of questioning, culminating in a custodial interrogation by two officers in a secluded room-all to investigate a non-jailable offense.
