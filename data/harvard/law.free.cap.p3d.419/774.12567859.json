Petitioner was a registered nurse and nurse practitioner who had worked in the field for 31 years. She worked at a hospital and also maintained a private practice providing Botox injections to clients. In conjunction with her private practice, petitioner wrote prescriptions, using prescription pads from her current employer and former employer without authorization. She also periodically\n   wrote prescriptions for friends and family without performing the necessary medical assessments, keeping records, or engaging in follow-up care. Most significantly, she prescribed repeated courses of narcotic pain medication with multiple refills to a fellow nurse, K. When K was later arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants, possession of a controlled substance, and reckless driving, petitioner became very upset and was involved in a physical altercation with K. The board received a complaint related to that altercation, which led it to conduct an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After investigation, the board instituted revocation proceedings based on the foregoing facts. In those proceedings, petitioner argued that the board had to prove any allegations of fraud or deceit by clear and convincing evidence. In support of that position, she relied on\n   <em>\n    Bernard v.

We now decide what we have previously suggested:\n   <em>\n    Bernard\n   </em>\n   does not accurately state the applicable standard of proof in license revocation proceedings governed by the Oregon APA. ORS 183.450(5) sets the standard of proof for agency proceedings, and, although it does not use the traditional terminology of our established burdens of proof, we have already concluded that it is synonymous with the preponderance of the evidence standard.\n   <em>\n    Gallant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"856355\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/159/175/#p177\">\n    159 Or.

Thus, by statute, as interpreted by this court, the standard of proof that generally applies in agency proceedings, including license-related proceedings, is the preponderance standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Sobel\n   </em>\n   , license revocation is a grave matter. The grant of a license gives a person the right to practice a profession, and the revocation of that license \"risks disgrace and loss of livelihood.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2357292\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/130/374/#p381\">\n    130 Or.

At the same time, we have said repeatedly, including in\n   <em>\n    Sobel\n   </em>\n   , that the standard of proof in an administrative proceeding \"is by a preponderance of the evidence in the absence of some\n   <em>\n    legislative\n   </em>\n   adoption of a different standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 379,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4452347,2357292\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/882/606/\">\n    882 P.2d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OSCI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4409158\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/98/548/#p555\">\n    98 Or.

In other words, short of a constitutional limitation, imposing a higher standard of proof in a particular type of agency proceeding than that provided in ORS 183.450(5) is a matter for the legislature, not the court. Petitioner has identified no legislative adoption of a higher standard of proof for license revocation proceedings or for State Board of Nursing proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We must not, and do not, lightly overrule prior decisions of this court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Petitioner did not make that argument before the board, so it is unpreserved.
