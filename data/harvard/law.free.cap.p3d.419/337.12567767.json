This case arose from a contract dispute concerning the purchase of oil and gas interests previously owned by some of the Agrawal defendants and the transfer of operations for the producing wells on those leases. After this appeal was filed, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Oklahoma granted a petition for involuntary bankruptcy naming Kris Agrawal as the debtor and stayed further proceedings in this appeal. On April 24, 2017, that court granted Agrawal's request for relief from the automatic stay, permitting this appeal to proceed. The Agrawal defendants have failed to preserve certain issues for appellate review and shown no error by the district court with respect to all but two of the issues preserved for review. The award of actual damages on CO&amp;G's tortious interference claim is modified by this Court to $13,500 and the award of punitive damages on CO&amp;G's two tort claims is vacated. In all other respects, the December 5, 2013 Final Journal Entry of Judgment is affirmed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion regarding the punitive damages issue. The district court's May 14, 2014 order denying the Agrawal defendants' motion for new trial is affirmed in part and reversed in part consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 This dispute concerns an August 21, 2007 Contract for Sale of Lease Rights and Appointment of Operator in what the parties refer to as the Hill Top Redfork Sands Units 1, 2 and 3 located in Tulsa County, Oklahoma. At that time, Online was the operator of the wells in the Hill Top Units and Realty Developers owned oil and gas leases in those units. Online and Realty Developers are companies owned and operated by Kris Agrawal. The contract was signed by Jerry Parent on behalf of CO&amp;G and by Gregory Williams on behalf of Realty Developers. The contract states that the operation of the Hill Top\n   Units wells was transferred to CO&amp;G and that CO&amp;G was purchasing the Hill Top Units oil and gas leases previously owned by Realty Developers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 After CO&amp;G assumed operations of the Hill Top Units, Realty Developers and Online filed suit challenging the sale of the Hill Top Units leases alleging that the person who signed the contract on behalf of Realty Developers did not have authority to do so. CO&amp;G filed a counterclaim and third-party claim joining the remaining Agrawal defendants in the litigation. CO&amp;G sued to establish and foreclose its operator's lien on the interest in the Hill Top Units owned by the Agrawal defendants, and for fraud, tortious interference, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, quiet title, reformation and declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Pursuant to an order filed May 25, 2011, the district court granted CO&amp;G's motion for partial summary judgment on its lien foreclosure claim and request for declaratory relief. In summary, the district court found that the Agrawal defendants had been \"duly served\" with the motion for partial summary judgment, that CO&amp;G was the operator of the Hill Top Units, and that CO&amp;G had a statutory and contractual lien in the amount of $3,282,218.37 for unpaid operating expenses against any interest owned by any of the Agrawal defendants in the Hill Top Units. The May 2011 order also authorized the sheriff to \"levy upon and sell/auction any interest that the Agrawal defendants may now have or may ever acquire in the mineral leasehold underlying the Hilltop [sic] Units....\" The findings, conclusions and partial judgment in favor of CO&amp;G on its lien theory contained in this order were incorporated into the district court's December 5, 2013 Final Journal Entry of Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The December 2013 judgment also granted judgment against Online and Realty Developers as to all claims asserted by those plaintiffs against CO&amp;G. In addition, judgment was granted in favor of CO&amp;G and against the Agrawal defendants on CO&amp;G's remaining theories for fraud, intentional interference, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, quiet title, reformation and declaratory relief. This aspect of the judgment was imposed as a sanction for failing to participate in the discovery process and for failing to comply with the court's discovery and pretrial conference orders. The judgment recites the Agrawal defendants' \"repeated history\" of \"failing to cooperate in the discovery process, abusing the discovery process and violating this Court's orders which warranted sanctions by this Court pursuant to 12 O.S. \u00a7 3237(B)(2).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The matter was then set for hearing on the amount of damages. At the conclusion of that hearing, the district court found that CO&amp;G's damages for unpaid operating expenses on its lien theory had increased to $5,508,689.89 and reformed its previous judgment to reflect that amount. The district court entered judgment for this amount of actual damages on CO&amp;G's breach of contract, fraudulent inducement and tortious interference claims. The court also found that CO&amp;G was entitled to punitive damages on CO&amp;G's two tort theories in the amount of $5,508,689.89 and included that amount in its December 2013 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Within ten days, the Agrawal defendants filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the December 5, 2013 judgment. That motion was denied by order filed May 14, 2014. The Agrawal defendants appeal both the December 2013 Judgment and the May 2014 order denying their motion for reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 \"A motion seeking reconsideration, re-examination, rehearing or vacation of\n   a judgment ... which is filed within 10 days of the day such decision was rendered, may be regarded as the functional equivalent of a new trial motion, no matter what its title.\"\n   <em>\n    Horizons, Inc. v.

The Motion for New Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Although Kris Agrawal appears pro se in this appeal, the motion for new trial was filed in the district court on his behalf and on behalf of all of the Agrawal defendants by their counsel at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That motion argued\n   four propositions: (1) the \"harsh sanction\" of default judgment was improper because only Online and Realty were served with discovery requests, and the Agrawal defendants' conduct was not malicious because the material not produced was privileged; (2) default judgment was unjust because of the defendants' \"meritorious claims and defenses;\" (3) the award of punitive damages was unsupported by the law or the facts; and (4) irregularity in the proceedings and the excessive amount of damages warrant a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 It is important to examine these arguments in detail. \"If a motion for a new trial be filed and a new trial be denied, the movant may not, on the appeal, raise allegations of error that were available to him at the time of the filing of his motion for a new trial but were not therein asserted.\" 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 991(b).

Judgment Imposed as a Sanction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The foundation of the discovery dispute concerns CO&amp;G's 2009 request for production of documents and the redacted copies of emails to and from Kris Agrawal produced in response to that request. CO&amp;G's discovery requests were served on Online and Realty Developers on January 16, 2009. Only ninety pages of documents have been produced, even though Kris Agrawal testified that he had a \"room full\" of documents relating to those companies and the Hill Top Units. The ninety pages of documents were produced by Kris Agrawal as the designated representative of Online in response to a 2009 notice to take deposition. Included in those documents are copies of emails to or from Kris Agrawal with material appearing in the margins that had been redacted. Kris Agrawal's original counsel stated that the redacted material contained notes made by Kris Agrawal and comments on the substance of the emails. She stated she redacted this material because she believed the notes were subject to the attorney/client privilege. That action eventually resulted in two sanctions orders, a November 13, 2012 order sanctioning Online and Realty Developers, and an August 26, 2013 order sanctioning the remaining Agrawal defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 As stated in CO&amp;G's first motion to compel, counsel for Online and Realty Developers agreed in an August 31, 2012 conversation that he would produce unredacted copies of those emails. Online and Realty Developers did not file a response to CO&amp;G's first motion to compel. On October 29, 2012, the district court granted CO&amp;G's motion and ordered Online and Realty Developers to produce the requested documents within ten days, including unredacted copies of the emails. Neither Online nor Realty Developers produced any documents. On November 13, 2012, the district court granted CO&amp;G's motion for sanctions finding Online and Realty Developers had failed to comply with the court's October 29, 2012 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Citing section 3234 of the Oklahoma Discovery Code ( 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7\u00a7 3224 to 3237 ), the Agrawal defendants point out that any party is authorized to serve a request for the production of documents on any other\n   party. However, the Agrawal defendants argue that no discovery requests were ever served by CO&amp;G on any party other than the plaintiffs, Online and Realty Developers. From this, they conclude that the third-party defendants could not have failed to produce documents because no request for the production of documents was served on them. Therefore, they maintain that the third-party defendants cannot be sanctioned pursuant to section 3237 for failure to comply with a discovery request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 First, this argument concedes the propriety of sanctioning Online and Realty Developers for failing to comply with the district court's October 29, 2012 order. Second, this argument ignores undisputed facts that are dispositive of the other Agrawal defendants' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Even though discovery requests were not served on all of the Agrawal defendants, the district court \"has inherent authority to impose sanctions for abuse of the discovery process. That is, the trial court has the power to sanction for abusive litigation practices or for abuse of judicial process, even if an order compelling discovery has not been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnett v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8184453\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/197/12/\">\n    2008 OK 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8184453\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/197/12/\">\n    197 P.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, although the district court found that the other Agrawal defendants had a repeated history of abusing the discovery process, reliance on the court's inherent authority is not necessary in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 The pretrial conference order was filed May 29, 2013. That order states: \"Third Party Defendants are ordered to produce unredacted, emails requested by CO&amp;G, by July 1, 2013.\" When no documents were produced, CO&amp;G filed its second motion for sanctions, this time against Kris Agrawal, Coal Gas USA, Coal Gas Mart and Realty Management on July 26, 2013. These parties also failed to file a response to CO&amp;G's motion for sanctions, and the district court granted that motion on August 26, 2013. The fact that these parties were not served with discovery requests is, therefore, immaterial. The district court \"is empowered by Oklahoma's discovery code to sanction parties or attorneys who violate discovery orders.

These defendants do not claim that the district court lacked the power to order them to produce those documents. These parties' failure to comply with the pretrial order is clearly sanctionable. Okla. Dist. Ct. R. 5(J), 12 O.S.2011, ch. 2, app.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Kris Agrawal also argues that he did not willfully refuse to comply with the district court's discovery orders because: \"Kris Agrawal never knew of the Court's Orders compelling ... production [of the unredacted emails].\" The only evidentiary support in the motion for new trial for this statement comes from Kris Agrawal's previous counsel, Larry Stewart. Attached to the motion for new trial is Stewart's affidavit in which he states that his \"clients were unaware of the specific Orders from the Court regarding such [discovery] issues.\" What \"specific Orders\" Stewart is referring to is not made clear in his affidavit. What is clear is that Stewart attended the pretrial conference during which the district court ordered Kris Agrawal, among others, to produce the unredacted emails by July 1, 2013. In his affidavit, Stewart denies being timely served with CO&amp;G's motions to compel but he does not deny receiving a copy of the pretrial order. In fact, in his affidavit, Stewart states that at the end of June and the beginning of July 2013, he \"worked with [his] clients to resolve all outstanding [discovery] issues,\" including the production of documents \"required by the Court's Pretrial Conference Order.\" Nonetheless, the unredacted copies of the emails were not produced by July 1, 2013, as ordered by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622 In fact, the unredacted emails were not produced until December of 2013, and then only to the district court, under seal, pursuant to a claim of attorney-client privilege that the Agrawal defendants raised for the first time in their motion for new trial. We find this argument disingenuous, at\n   best, and ultimately unpersuasive. As the district court found, on July 2, 2013, the day after the district court ordered that the emails be produced, the Agrawal defendants asserted that the unredacted copies of the emails had been \"lost.\" Later they claimed that the emails had been \"destroyed.\" Only after judgment had been entered against them were they able to find the unredacted emails and offer them to the district court under a claim of privilege. The Agrawal defendants were a day late and a dollar short with their discovery response.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hayes v. Central States Orthopedic Specialists, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11417047\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/51/562/\">\n    2002 OK 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11417047\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/51/562/\">\n    51 P.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (delay in asserting a privilege may result in waiver of the privilege). We hold that by failing to assert their claim of attorney/client privilege, at least by the time of the pretrial conference, the Agrawal defendants waived their right to later assert that claim. The district court did not err in granting judgment against the Agrawal defendants as a sanction on CO&amp;G's breach of contract, fraudulent inducement and tortious interference theories of liability and that aspect of the December 2013 judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B. The Agrawal Defendants' Claim of \"Meritorious\" Defenses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 In their second proposition of error, the Agrawal defendants rely on the general principle that default judgments are disfavored and that a trial on the merits is preferred. That law is not disputed. The Agrawal defendants then argue that the default judgment should be set aside because they have meritorious defenses worthy of a trial. Specifically, they argue that Gregory Williams, the person signing the August 2007 contract on behalf of Realty Developers to sell its oil and gas leases to CO&amp;G, did not have authority to do so. Attached to their motion for new trial are documents supporting this contention. However, determining the materiality of that \"defense\" requires context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 First, the Agrawal defendants' argument addresses only the ownership of the oil and gas leases in the Hill Top Units. On February 28, 2007, Kris Agrawal executed Corporation Commission forms transferring operation of the Hill Top Units to CO&amp;G, and the district court found and entered a judgment declaring that CO&amp;G was the operator of the Hill Top Units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 Second, CO&amp;G's motion for partial summary judgment sought only three rulings: (1) a declaration that it was the operator of the Hill Top Units; (2) a determination that it had a valid and enforceable operator's lien for the expenses it had incurred while operating the wells in the Hill Top Units; and (3) a ruling that CO&amp;G was entitled to enforce its lien against any interest in the Hill Top Units owned by the Agrawal defendants. Ownership of the Hill Top Units leases by virtue of the August 2007 contract was not at issue in the partial summary judgment proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Third, the three facts CO&amp;G sought to establish in the partial summary judgment proceeding are conclusively established by the May 2011 partial judgment and confirmed by the December 2013 final judgment. As a result, the $5,508,689.89 judgment in favor of CO&amp;G is not attributable to the district court's sanctions orders but is based solely on the expenses CO&amp;G incurred while operating the wells in the Hill Top Units. That judgment is enforceable regardless of who owns the leases in the Hill Top Units. Consequently, even if the Agrawal defendants were to prevail on their claim of ownership of the Hill Top Units leases, they would still be subject to CO&amp;G's lien. In its May 2011 partial summary judgment, the district court foreclosed CO&amp;G's operator's lien, thereby transferring ownership of the Hill Top Units to CO&amp;G independent of any interest it did or did not acquire pursuant to the August 2007 contract. Therefore, the argument that Gregory Williams did not have authority to sign the August 2007 contract fails to raise an issue of fact precluding the partial summary judgment in favor of CO&amp;G on its lien foreclosure claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b627 The only other challenge the Agrawal defendants raise addressing the merits of the judgment in favor of CO&amp;G is contained in footnote 6 to their motion for new trial, in which they purport to incorporate \"the specific evidence previously submitted in Plaintiffs' filing of February 7, 2011, as the basis\n   for error in the Journal Entry of Judgment filed May 25, 2011 in this case.\" The February 7, 2011 objection to CO&amp;G's motion for partial summary judgment was filed by Kris Agrawal at a time when he and the other Agrawal defendants were represented by counsel. When CO&amp;G moved to strike that filing because Kris Agrawal was not permitted to represent the other Agrawal defendants, counsel for all of the Agrawal defendants, including Kris, filed a notice with the district court on March 14, 2011, withdrawing the February 7, 2011 filing. Subsequently, Kris Agrawal's February 7, 2011 filing was stricken by the district court. Consequently, footnote 6 to the Agrawal defendants' motion for new trial incorporates nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b628 In their effort to demonstrate the alleged need for a trial on the merits of their defense to CO&amp;G's claim, the Agrawal defendants have failed to show that any facts material to CO&amp;G's lien foreclosure claim are in dispute. That aspect of the district court's December 2013 judgment was not granted as a sanction because the Agrawal defendants refused to comply with the district court's discovery and pretrial conference orders. That judgment was based on the undisputable fact that CO&amp;G is the operator of the wells in the Hill Top Units and the unchallengeable law that CO&amp;G has and is entitled to enforce its operator's lien against any interest in the Hill Top Units leases owned by any of the Agrawal defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b629 Consequently, the Agrawal defendants' motion for new trial does not preserve for appellate review any issue regarding the judgment in favor of CO&amp;G on its lien foreclosure claim. The liability imposed as a sanction regarding CO&amp;G's other claims only duplicates, in essence, the liability imposed by the foreclosure judgment. As a result, the Agrawal defendants have not shown that the district court erred in granting judgment in favor of CO&amp;G for actual damages on CO&amp;G's lien foreclosure, breach of contract, fraudulent inducement and tortious interference claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III. Punitive Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b630 The Agrawal defendants argue that the award of punitive damages is not supported by law or fact. In addition, they contend that the punitive damage award is \"shockingly excessive and flagrantly outrageous.\" CO&amp;G presented two theories of liability on which the district court granted punitive damages: (1) it was fraudulently induced to sign the August 2007 contract; and (2) after the sale, the Agrawal defendants tortiously interfered with CO&amp;G's business operations. Liability on both theories was imposed as a sanction based on the Agrawal defendants' willful and bad faith refusal to comply with the court's discovery and pretrial conference orders. After the September 26, 2013 hearing on damages, the district court awarded actual damages in the amount of $5,508,689.89 on CO&amp;G's lien foreclosure, breach of contract, fraudulent inducement and intentional interference with business relations theories of liability. In addition, the district court awarded punitive damages on each of CO&amp;G's two tort theories in an amount equal to the amount of actual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Notice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b631 The Agrawal defendants first complain that they were not served with notice of the September 26, 2013 hearing on damages during which punitive damages were awarded. Nonetheless, the Agrawal defendants' counsel appeared at the hearing and requested a continuance claiming he had just found out about the hearing by accident because CO&amp;G's motion was mailed to the wrong address. The district court conducted a hearing on that motion before proceeding with the damage issue. The court found that although the Agrawal defendants' counsel had apparently changed his address, CO&amp;G\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   had mailed the notice of hearing to the address listed on his entry of appearance. The district court recited into the record various recent occasions on which the Agrawal defendants' counsel had appeared on various matters after receiving notice mailed to the same address. The court also noted that the September hearing had been set for six weeks. We find no error in the district court's denial of the motion for continuance and its finding that the Agrawal defendants had adequate notice of the September hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B. Procedure\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b632 The Agrawal defendants next argue that the September 26 hearing did not provide the meaningful review of the damages issue required by\n   <em>\n    Payne v. Dewitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11459312,11612466\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ok/1999/93/\">\n    1999 OK 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11459312\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/995/1088/\">\n    995 P.2d 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the district court must conduct a meaningful inquiry into the amount of actual and punitive damages, allowing the party in default to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence). At the hearing on damages, CO&amp;G introduced evidence supporting the actual damages it incurred as operator of the wells in the Hill Top Units. Ron Walker testified on behalf of CO&amp;G that the operating expenses of $3,282,218.37 previously awarded had increased to $5,508,689.89 since the partial summary judgment was granted. Walker testified that amount included most but not all of the operating expenses it had incurred. He testified that he did not have time before the hearing to properly identify and support another $50,000 he estimated CO&amp;G had incurred. The Agrawal defendants' counsel was given the opportunity to cross-examine Walker and did so. The Agrawal defendants' counsel was given the opportunity to offer any evidence during the hearing, but did not do so. Nonetheless, at the conclusion of the hearing the district court gave the parties until October 11, 2013, to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. On that date, CO&amp;G filed its proposed findings and conclusions, but the Agrawal defendants requested an additional ten days to file their proposed findings and conclusions. On October 24, 2013, when no findings and conclusions had been filed by the Agrawal defendants, the district court adopted the findings and conclusions filed by CO&amp;G and later incorporated those findings and conclusions into its December 2013 judgment. We find no procedural or due process error in the manner in which the district court conducted the September 26, 2013 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C. The Tortious Interference Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b633 The district court also granted judgment in favor of CO&amp;G on its tortious interference with business theory of liability for both actual and punitive damages. This is a separate cause of action and arose after execution of the August 2007 contract. In support of this claim, the district court found that the Agrawal defendants \"recorded various legal instruments which purport to convey or burden [CO&amp;G's] leasehold interests in the Hilltop [sic] Units,\" that those actions \"were designed to undermine CO&amp;G's ownership of oil and gas leasehold interest in the Hilltop [sic] Units,\" and that the Agrawal defendants made \"false representations to Scissortail Energy which caused Scissortail Energy to cease doing business with CO&amp;G.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Presently, Oklahoma recognizes a tortious interference claim with a contractual or business relationship if the plaintiff can prove (1) the interference was with an existing contractual or business right; (2) such interference was malicious and wrongful; (3) the interference was neither justified, privileged nor excusable; and (4) the interference proximately caused damage.\n   <em>\n    Wilspec Techs., Inc. v. DunAn Holding Group Co., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7331260\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/204/69/\">\n    2009 OK 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7331260\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/204/69/\">\n    204 P.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though the district court imposed liability on this claim as a sanction, the evidence in this record fully supports CO&amp;G's claim that the Agrawal defendants tortiously interfered with CO&amp;G's business operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b634 The district court awarded CO&amp;G actual damages on this claim in the amount of its operating expenses, $5,508,689.89. This was error. At the September 2013 hearing on damages, Ron Walker testified that as a result of Kris Agrawal's misrepresentations to Scissortail Energy, that company stopped purchasing oil and gas from CO&amp;G However, the only damage Walker attributed to Agrawal's wrongful interference with CO&amp;G's business was the expense of hiring a lawyer\n   to \"address [Agrawal's] misrepresentations\" to Scissortail Energy. The exhibit introduced by CO&amp;G at the hearing shows those legal fees to be $13,500 and that this amount was excluded from the $5,508,689.89. The December 5, 2013 judgment is modified to award actual damages to CO&amp;G on its tortious interference with business theory in the amount of $13,500, which is in addition to the $5,508,689.89 in actual damages awarded on CO&amp;G's other theories of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   D. Punitive Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b635 Finally, the Agrawal defendants argue that the punitive damages award was excessive and that there is insufficient evidence to support what they refer to as a \"default judgment\" of punitive damages. Although the judgment in this case did not result from the entry of a default, the problem is that liability for punitive damages was imposed as a sanction for violating the district court's discovery and pretrial orders. Although punitive damages may be awarded as a sanction, section 9.1 specifies the factors on which a finder-of-fact must base an award of punitive damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   1. The seriousness of the hazard to the public arising from the defendant's misconduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   2. The profitability of the misconduct to the defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   3. The duration of the misconduct and any concealment of it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   4. The degree of the defendant's awareness of the hazard and of its excessiveness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   5. The attitude and conduct of the defendant upon discovery of the misconduct or hazard;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   6. In the case of a defendant which is a corporation or other entity, the number and level of employees involved in causing or concealing the misconduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   7. The financial condition of the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   23 O.S.2011 \u00a7 9.1(A).

That is essentially the same conduct that the court found resulted in the Agrawal defendants' breach of the August 2007 contract. The findings of the district court clearly support the award of actual damages on CO&amp;G's breach of contract theory of liability even if liability\n   on that theory had not been imposed as a sanction.
