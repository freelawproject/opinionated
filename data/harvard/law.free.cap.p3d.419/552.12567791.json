In those contracts, the Hospitals agreed to accept payment from AHCCCS at rates below their customary charges and not to bill members for the balance. The plaintiffs in this case are a class of AHCCCS members (\"the Patients\") who received settlements or damage awards from third-party tortfeasors for the injuries that required medical treatment. The Patients sued to enjoin the Hospitals from enforcing liens on their tort recoveries for the balance between what AHCCCS paid and the Hospitals' customary charges. We hold that the Hospitals' contracts with AHCCCS incorporated federal law, which bars the Hospitals from enforcing the liens. Accordingly, we affirm the injunction the superior court entered and direct entry of judgment in favor of the Patients on their third-party claim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Hospitals recorded their liens pursuant to two statutes, Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 33-931 (2018) and 36-2903.01(G)(4) (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The former is a general statute allowing a health-care provider to file a lien for its customary charges against a patient's tort recovery. The latter specifically applies when a hospital has served an AHCCCS member and allows that hospital to \"collect any unpaid portion of its bill from other third-party payors or in situations\" in which the general medical-lien statute applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Patients alleged federal Medicaid law preempts the Arizona lien statutes in cases such as theirs, and sought an injunction barring the Hospitals from recording liens on their tort recoveries. The Patients argued the liens constitute impermissible \"balance billing,\" a term describing a health-care provider's effort to collect from a patient \"the difference in the amount paid by Medicaid, or a state plan like AHCCCS, and the amount\" the provider typically charges.\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

Those plaintiffs appealed, arguing their settlements lacked consideration because the Hospitals' liens were preempted by federal law. We accepted that argument,\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

The court then enjoined the Hospitals from \"filing or asserting any lien or claim against a patient's personal injury recovery, after having received\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   payment from AHCCCS for the same patient's care.\" The court granted summary judgment to the Hospitals, however, on the Patients' third-party-beneficiary claim, which alleged the Hospitals breached their contracts with AHCCCS by imposing the liens. Finally, the superior court awarded attorney's fees to the Patients under the private attorney general doctrine and denied both sides' motions for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Hospitals appealed the preemption ruling and injunction, and the Patients cross-appealed the judgment against them on their contract claim.

In addressing that claim, we conclude that (1) federal law preempts the Hospitals' rights under Arizona law to impose liens on the Patients' tort recoveries to recover the balance between what AHCCCS paid the Hospitals and the Hospitals' customary rates, (2) the Patients are third-party beneficiaries of the contracts the Hospitals entered with AHCCCS, and (3) those contracts require the Hospitals to comply with the preemptive federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But the Hospitals cite nothing in the record, the AHCCCS plan or the law to support the premise that in approving Arizona's plan, CMS had the authority to review-or actually did review-any state statute that might bear in some way on the state's Medicaid program. Contrary to the Hospitals' contention, CMS determines only whether the\n   <em>\n    plan\n   </em>\n   a state submits conforms with the Medicaid Act and related federal regulations; Congress has not granted the agency the authority to determine the validity of state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20430.14\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20430.10\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But nothing in the Arizona plan addresses, let alone endorses, the right of a hospital to accept payment from AHCCCS, then impose a lien on a patient's tort recovery for the balance between the AHCCCS payment and the hospital's customary rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 For their contention that the Arizona plan authorizes such liens, the Hospitals rely on a brief portion of \"Attachment 4.19-A,\" a 66-page section of the AHCCCS plan titled \"Methods and Standards for Establishing Payment Rates [for] Inpatient Hospital Care.\" In the definitions section, Attachment 4.19-A provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Prospective rates are inpatient hospital rates defined in advance of a payment period and represent payment in full for covered services excluding any quick-pay discounts, slow pay penalties, and third party payments regardless of billed charges or individual hospital costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Hospitals contend this language means that even after a hospital has accepted \"payment in full\" from AHCCCS for treating a patient, the Arizona plan allows it to impose a lien on the patient's tort recovery as a permissible \"third party payment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 The brief reference in Attachment 4.19 to \"third party payments,\" which does not mention the word \"lien\" and which is found in a section of the plan setting out rates AHCCCS will pay hospitals, does not constitute an endorsement of the right of a hospital to accept payment from AHCCCS, then balance bill by imposing a lien on the patient's tort recovery. As set out in \u00b6 12,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , because AHCCCS is the \"payor of last resort,\" a hospital must determine whether a third party may be liable for the cost of treatment before the hospital bills AHCCCS; if it ascertains that a third party is liable, the hospital may bill AHCCCS only for the difference between what it has recovered from the third party and the AHCCCS scheduled rate. Given that, we understand the reference to \"third party payment\" in Attachment 4.19-A to refer to a payment made\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the hospital accepts payment from AHCCCS, not after.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 The Hospitals also point to A.A.C. R9-22-1007 as support for their contention that CMS approved balance billing when it approved Arizona's AHCCCS plan. The cited regulation is titled \"Notification for Perfection, Recording, and Assignment of AHCCCS Liens.\" It requires that when a hospital has treated an AHCCCS member for an injury \"reflecting the probable liability of a first-or third-party,\" the hospital must, within 30 days of discharging the patient, notify AHCCCS \"under R9-22-1008\" or mail the agency \"a copy of the lien the hospital proposes to record or has recorded under A.R.S. \u00a7 33-932.\" A.A.C. R9-22-1007. The Hospitals argue the regulation effectively acknowledges a hospital's right to record a lien against a patient's tort recovery after accepting payment from AHCCCS. But read in context with A.A.C. R9-22-1008, which requires providers to notify AHCCCS of the \"[a]mount estimated to be due for care of member,\" it is clear that the former regulation concerns a lien that would be recorded\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   AHCCCS determines what to pay the hospital, not after.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 The Hospitals' argument also disregards the mandate in A.A.C. R9-22-702(B) that a provider \"must accept payment from [AHCCCS] or a contractor as payment in full.\" Beyond repeating the requirement prescribed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.15\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Arizona regulation goes on to specify limited circumstances under which a provider may demand payment from a patient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R9-22-702(C), (D). As relevant here, the regulation allows a provider to pursue a patient only (1) to collect a copayment and (2) to collect \"that portion of a payment made [to the patient] by a third party\" that is subject to the patient's \"statutory assignment of rights to AHCCCS.\" A.A.C. R9-22-702(D) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-2946(A) (patient's assignment of medical benefits), 36-2915(A) (AHCCCS lien on patient's tort claim). In other words, the only specified circumstance in which a hospital may demand that a patient turn over the proceeds of a tort recovery is when those proceeds are subject to an\n   assignment or lien in favor\n   <em>\n    of AHCCCS\n   </em>\n   . There is no corresponding provision in the regulation allowing a hospital to demand that a patient relinquish a tort recovery to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    hospital's\n   </em>\n   lien rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 In the context of these provisions and those discussed \u00b6\u00b6 12-13\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the provisions in the AHCCCS plan that the Hospitals cite are part and parcel of a provider's duty under the plan to \"cost avoid\" before it bills AHCCCS, not a license to accept payment from AHCCCS, then impose a lien against the patient's tort recovery for the balance between that payment and the provider's customary rates. Accordingly, when CMS approved the AHCCCS plan, it did not authorize the Hospitals to accept payment from AHCCCS, then enforce liens against patients' recoveries from tortfeasors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 In sum, and in accord with every other judicial decision we have located on the issue, we conclude that federal law, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.15\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , preempts Arizona's lien statutes to the extent they allow a provider to accept payment from AHCCCS, then impose a lien on the patient's tort recovery for the balance between what AHCCCS paid it and the provider's customary rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
