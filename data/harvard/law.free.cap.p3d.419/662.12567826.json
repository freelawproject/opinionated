Reinert discharged nine bullets, with at least six bullets striking Jessica in the upper chest and head. Earlier that evening Jessica went to Reinert's home to meet up with her friend, Danielle, Reinert's wife. The three began drinking alcohol and then attended the Billings rodeo, where they continued to drink. After the rodeo, they continued to drink at a\n   local bar. Surveillance recordings of that night showed Reinert outside the bar, slipping on the ice, and at one point laying in the road requiring assistance. Jessica drove them all home around 11:00 p.m. Before they arrived home, Reinert jumped out of Jessica's vehicle, injuring himself, and then reluctantly returned to the vehicle. At the Reinert residence, Reinert and Danielle engaged in a violent verbal and physical domestic dispute. At some point Jessica went into the home to help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Danielle and Reinert testified that Reinert had made himself a drink and used a bread knife to slice a lime. Reinert was walking\n   around with the knife, he and Jessica fought over it, and eventually Danielle took the knife from Reinert, slicing her palm in the process. She was afraid of Reinert's conduct that evening, so she began hiding their home defense guns. Danielle testified that Reinert and Jessica got into a physical fight where they were both on the floor and kicking, punching, hair pulling, and screaming at each other. Danielle testified that Reinert retrieved a revolver. Danielle managed to take the revolver and went into the bathroom to hide it. Reinert then retreated to the master bedroom. While in the bathroom Danielle heard the gun shots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Reinert testified that when he retreated to the master bedroom, he obtained a pistol from his bed. Jessica then came into or was already in the master bedroom, moving quickly towards him, with something in her hand. When surprised, Reinert shot nine bullets and killed Jessica. Immediately prior to her death, Jessica had been on the phone with 911 for approximately one and a half minutes, reporting the domestic dispute. The call to 911 recorded Jessica prior to the shooting, the shooting itself, and the aftermath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The 911 recording reveals that, immediately after the shooting Danielle started screaming. Reinert shouted at her \"you made me f**king shoot her,\" \"you made me f**king do this because of you,\" \"you made me do this,\" and \"you are the one that made me kill her.\" The couple's domestic dispute continued. The police arrived shortly thereafter and found Reinert struggling with Danielle. He was on top of her in the hallway outside of the master bedroom. The revolver was found underneath Danielle. Jessica was pronounced dead at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Reinert and Danielle were transported to the Billing Police Department. In jail, when informed by police that he could not see his wife because they were investigating, Reinert asked \"investigating what?\" During the police interview that day Reinert admitted to shooting Jessica and causing her death, yet told police \"I've done nothing wrong\" because he was scared for his life and justified in his use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 At trial, the State presented testimony of Dr. Thomas Bennett, the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy on Jessica. Dr. Bennett testified regarding his findings, described where Jessica was standing when she was shot, and how many bullets struck her. The jury heard the 911 call placed by Jessica just a minute before her death. They listened to a crying woman report a domestic dispute, that her friend's husband was so drunk he was pointing a gun at his own head, and the sudden firing of nine shots. The jurors heard Danielle screaming and Reinert saying he killed Jessica because of Danielle. Physical evidence\n   showed that Jessica was standing about three feet away from Reinert and was on the phone when he shot her. The lead detective testified that Reinert's assertion that he acted in self-defense was not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Reinert testified on his own behalf. Reinert testified he believed Jessica was coming at him with something in her hand. He shot her because of his fear of serious bodily injury or death. Pursuant to his justifiable use of force theory, Reinert testified he was a peaceful man and introduced evidence that he was trustworthy and truthful. He testified to a specific instance where another man wanted to fight him and instead of fighting, Reinert filed for a restraining order. Reinert testified that he was not someone who was quick to get into physical confrontations with others and that he had never been violent towards his wife. A previous instance of him punching through their bathroom door was an attempt to protect his wife who had fallen in the locked bathroom. Reinert reiterated\n   that he told the police he had \"done nothing wrong,\" because when he shot his gun he believed he was in danger of serious bodily injury or death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The State was allowed to introduce, on cross-examination, a 2011 police report that Reinert filed after a night of drinking. The State argued the police report was false and went directly to Reinert's assertion of his truthfulness and that he was trustworthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 On March 6, 2015, after five days of trial and four hours of deliberation, the jury found Reinert guilty of deliberate homicide, and in the commission of that crime he used a deadly weapon. On April 2, 2015, Reinert filed a motion for a new trial asserting the State withheld favorable impeachment evidence regarding Dr. Bennett. The District Court denied the motion. Reinert appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Following a verdict or finding of guilty, the court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice.

Reinert contends that the District Court abused its discretion by not granting his motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 It is fundamental that the State must disclose any evidence that is material to a defendant's guilt or punishment.\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

The letter was written by the State Medical Examiner, Dr. Gary Dale, who questioned Dr. Bennett's credentials, expertise, and conduct in previous autopsies. In his affidavit, attached to the Defense's motion for a new trial, Dr. Dale asserted Dr. Bennett testified falsely under oath and previously misdiagnosed trauma in infants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 Reinert argues Dr. Bennett's testimony was an integral part of the prosecution as it was used to bolster the State and lead detective's theory of the crime, validate the crime scene photos, and undermine Reinert's theory of the events. Therefore, if Reinert had been in possession of the letter, he could have impeached Dr. Bennett's findings, particularly his opinion as to how far away Jessica was from Reinert when he shot her, and Dr. Bennett's changed opinion regarding the number of bullets which struck Jessica, and thus the State's theory of the case. Reinert asserts this is sufficient to show a reasonable probability existed that with the letter the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Dr. Bennett testified that he initially believed seven bullets caused eight bullet paths, but later concluded that it could have been six. Admitting he did not change the autopsy report, Dr. Bennett testified, during cross-examination, that what he initially thought was two different bullet paths, he now believed were caused by the same bullet; the bullet first going through Jessica's wrist and then continued into her head or chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 After a review of the transcripts, we agree with the District Court. We fail to see how the letter, if provided to the defense, would have changed the outcome of the proceeding. Dr. Bennett testified about the autopsy he performed on Jessica, described where she was standing when she was shot, and how many bullets struck her. Dr. Bennett's changed opinion regarding the number of bullets Jessica was shot with does not undermine the confidence of the trial. The defense had ample opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Bennett on that issue. Nor would the evidence of where Jessica was standing be undermined by use of the letter. No one, including Reinert, disputes the fact that he shot Jessica\n   and that was the cause of her death. The totality of the evidence was overwhelming; Reinert shot and killed Jessica.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b623 Reinert alleges a second\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, the State's introduction of his recorded jailhouse calls at sentencing. On appeal, Reinert fails to assert any of the requirements necessary to prove a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, and thus fails to substantively argue the issue on appeal. A general claim that the State violated a defendant's right to due process by interfering with his attempt to prepare a defense cannot support a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation claim.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State argued Reinert opened the door to evidence of his character and truthfulness, and sought to elicit testimonial evidence to rebut his assertion. During the in-chambers conference, defense counsel agreed that by having Reinert testify \"we do open him up to the consequences ... and a full and complete cross examination as to the probative elements of his testimony,\" yet argued the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b629 After a lengthy discussion in chambers, the District Court ruled it would allow the State to cross-examine Reinert on the police report.

The defense specifically and repeatedly encouraged the District Court to find this specific instance of conduct was more prejudicial than probative, which the District Court declined to do. The Court conducted a long session in chambers on this question. The District Court's determination that evidence of this specific instance of conduct was admissible, under M. R.
