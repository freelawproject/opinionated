After the jury was dismissed, it became apparent that the parties disagreed as to what exactly the jury had been asked and what its answers meant. The trial judge, based on his understanding of what he had asked the jury to decide, entered a significant judgment in favor of plaintiff Gosney. However, applying judicial estoppel, the judge declined to enter judgment on the jury's verdicts in favor of plaintiffs Vose and Pizza Time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Defendant Fireman's Fund appeals from the judgment entered against it and in favor of Gosney. Vose and Pizza Time cross-appeal from the trial court's denial of relief. For good measure, all parties seek relief from various other trial court rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 We reverse the trial court's judicial estoppel rulings. In all other respects, we affirm the various decisions of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 John Vose is the owner and sole shareholder of Pizza Time, Inc. and Pizza Time Holdings of Washington, Inc. (collectively PT). Vose owns and operates several corporate PT stores and also acts as a franchisor with 30 to 35 franchisees. As the franchisor, Vose personally prepared operational manuals for his franchises that were then incorporated into the franchise agreement by reference. These operational manuals purported to give Vose control over various aspects of franchisee employment procedures, including the right to terminate franchisee employees for any reason at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Ethan Shaefer owned and operated a PT franchise store prior to and following Vose's acquisition of the PT franchise. Unbeknownst to Vose, one of Shaefer's pizza delivery drivers-Angela Heller-had a poor driving record and a criminal background. On September 1, 2005, Heller, who had been drinking on the job, drove her car across the center line while making a delivery. Heller caused a head-on collision and killed the driver of the other car, Jerry Welch. Vose visited Shaefer shortly after receiving word of the collision. Shaefer told Vose that he had called his attorneys and that he had insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 In September 2006, Jerry Welch's widow filed suit against PT in Thurston County. Sarah Gosney-Welch's daughter-was later substituted as the personal representative and plaintiff in the underlying action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vose's attorney informed him that, pursuant to the franchise agreement, Shaefer would have to indemnify and defend PT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 PT has had insurance through Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (Fireman's) since 2005. PT's insurance policy required Fireman's to indemnify it for up to $1.5 million pursuant to a \"non-owned auto policy\" and an additional $1 million pursuant to a \"general liability policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Vose first informed Fireman's of the automobile collision and ongoing litigation on January 31, 2008. Gosney had extended an offer to PT and Shaefer to settle for policy limits. Trial was scheduled for April 21, 2008. Fireman's began investigating coverage and liability on February 8, 2008. On February 21, 2008, Gosney's counsel, David Beninger, wrote to Robert Novasky, counsel for both Vose and Shaefer, to notify Novasky that Gosney's offer to settle would remain open for only seven more days. Novasky forwarded this letter to Paul Badaracco, Fireman's primary claims handler assigned to the matter, for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 On February 22, 2008, Badaracco wrote to Vose to acknowledge receipt of his claim. Badaracco noted that \"[a]lthough this incident occurred on Sept. 1, 2005 and the lawsuit was filed on Sept. 14, 2006, Fireman's Fund's first notice of this claim and ongoing\n   litigation was ... on Feb. 8, 2008, some two and a half years after the accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Novasky wrote to Badaracco again on February 28, 2008. Novasky stated that \"[a]ll other defendants have tendered their policy limits, but plaintiff is demanding a 'global' settlement that requires the tender of all available policy limits.\" Novasky requested that Fireman's contact Beninger to confirm Fireman's position with regard to the demand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Fireman's appointed counsel John Matthews of Jackson &amp; Wallace, LLP to defend PT. Matthews contacted Novasky to discuss the case and review court documents. Matthews then contacted Vose and received his approval to request a continuance of the trial date. Trial was rescheduled for December 29, 2008. Gosney withdrew the global settlement offer as a result of the continuance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 On March 27, 2008, Badaracco wrote to Vose to inform him that PT's coverage for nonowned business automobile exposure covered up to $1.5 million\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in losses and that the current claim \"could result in damages in excess of ... policy limits.\" Badaracco advised Vose to retain counsel to advise him \"with respect to any potential excess exposure above the referenced limits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Patricia Anderson, an attorney representing Gosney, later contacted Fireman's to request a copy of the PT insurance policy. On July 17, 2008, counsel for Fireman's sent Anderson a copy of the policy and confirmed that Fireman's \"continues to reserve any and all rights and defenses that may now exist or that may arise in the future.\" Anderson then contacted Howard Bundy, corporate counsel for PT. Anderson told Bundy that Gosney was interested in reaching a settlement and was willing to discuss a settlement \"involving an agreement or covenant not to execute against personal assets, in exchange for an assignment of the claims against the insurance company and a stipulated judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Bundy, who had not represented Vose or PT on any matter related to the Gosney litigation, advised Vose to retain independent counsel. Vose then forwarded the settlement offer to attorney Matthews. Matthews asked Bundy to \"please forward these emails and offers to the counsel that [PT] and/or John Vose hires to represent him personally on this coverage issue, as we cannot advise our client on coverage matters.\" Bundy then agreed to represent Vose in the Gosney litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Settlement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Gosney and Vose reached a settlement on September 2, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The settlement offer required Vose and PT to assign to Gosney \"all rights, privileges, claims, causes or chose of actions that they may have against their insurer,\" including any arising out of the \"handling of the claims or suit related thereto, as well as arising out of the insurance contract, obligations, investigation, evaluation, negotiation, defense, settlement, indemnification ... bad faith, negligence, malpractice, breach of contract, fiduciary\n   breach, Consumer Protection Act[\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CPA) ], Insurance Fair Conduct Act[\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (IFCA) ], punitive damages and/or otherwise.\" The settlement offer reserved to Vose and PT all elements of damages \"for their personal emotional distress, personal attorneys' fees, personal damages to credit or reputation and other non-economic damages\" arising from the assigned causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The settlement offer did not specify a dollar amount. Rather, it provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants do hereby stipulate and agree to having partial judgment entered against them for the full insurance limits to avoid any delay in executing, garnishing or collecting those offered assets. Plaintiffs agree to withhold formal entry of this partial judgment for fifteen (15) days to allow the insurers to pay all insurance proceeds to the Luvera Trust Account, in trust for the Welchs. Defendants are entitled to a credit, offset and partial satisfaction of any judgment for the amounts paid by their insurers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, the parties agree to have the full amount of the damages and/or judgments determined by stipulation approved as reasonable by the Court, or arbitration. The parties agree to use good faith efforts to reach a stipulated covenant judgment, contingent upon a reasonableness finding by the court. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 The settlement offer further provided for a 12 percent interest rate accruing and compounding annually on the unpaid damages from the date of signing. Finally, the settlement offer contained a covenant not to execute or enforce the judgment against Vose or PT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 Gosney and Vose-on behalf of himself and on behalf of PT-signed the settlement agreement. Bundy then sent a copy of the settlement agreement to Fireman's along with a letter demanding the payment of policy limits and notice under the IFCA. Fireman's never responded to Bundy and never agreed to the settlement offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 On December 19, 2008, Thurston County superior court Judge Gary Tabor entered judgment against Vose and PT for $2.5 million with interest accruing at 12 percent per annum from September 2, 2008. Judge Tabor also issued an order approving the settlement as reasonable as to Welch's minor children. Jackson &amp; Wallace filed a notice of intent to withdraw effective January 29, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 On September 1, 2009, Gosney filed suit against Fireman's and named PT and Vose as codefendants. The complaint alleged negligence, breach of the CPA, breach of the IFCA, breach of contract, and breach of the specific unfair claims and settlement practices regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its answer, Fireman's asserted the affirmative defenses of waiver and estoppel, contributory fault, and fraud or collusion in the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Arbitration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 On November 1, 2010, Fireman's moved to stay the action \"until Plaintiffs and Defendant [PT] conduct and conclude their arbitration to determine the final value of the settlement in their underlying litigation.\" Fireman's argued that a stay was necessary because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Fireman's] cannot effectively defend itself in this lawsuit without resolution of the underlying settlement amount, which, if proven reasonable, will form the \"presumptive measure of damages\" in this lawsuit. [PT] claims it cannot provide [Fireman's] written discovery responses ... without jeopardizing its position in the eventual arbitration of the settlement amount. This leaves [Fireman's] in a litigation quandary, precluding [Fireman's] ability to prepare for and receive a fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 King County Superior Court Judge Laura Inveen granted Fireman's motion to stay on November 30, 2010. The stay was granted pending the final determination of damages by either \"stipulated amount approved as reasonable by the court,\" or \"final arbitration decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Gosney and Vose decided to enter arbitration. On September 17, 2012, Beninger notified John Bennett, outside counsel representing Fireman's, of the date and time of the arbitration. Arbitration was scheduled for November 1, 2012 before former King County Superior Court Judge Charles Burdell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 Beninger described the scope of the arbitration as \"all remaining issues.\" Bennett responded to the notice asking what the \"remaining issues\" included. On October 4, 2012, Bennett again wrote to Beninger asking \"what issues the parties intend to arbitrate.\" Bennett stated that \"[t]ime is of the essence if Fireman's Fund is to make an informed decision whether to participate in the arbitration and to prepare to participate,\" and demanded that Beninger respond by the following day. Beninger responded simply that \"[t]he issues subject to arbitration are broad.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 Bennett wrote to Beninger on October 9, 2012, declining to participate in the arbitration. Bennett explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   As I am sure you understand, Fireman's Fund cannot reasonably participate in an arbitration when it does not know what will be arbitrated. Your response that the issues to be arbitrated are \"broad\" does not provide the information Fireman's Fund needs to be able to participate in the arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Also, Fireman's Fund is concerned that defendants have shared with plaintiff all confidential information relating to matters at issue in the arbitration, which would preclude any potential for a fair hearing of the matters in dispute. Your response ignores that concern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 Bennett extended an offer to pay for a transcription of the arbitration. Beninger replied, \"It seems like you are trying to generate reasons to avoid the arbitration, rather than participate in good faith. Please keep in mind that you moved the court and compelled the arbitration of all remaining issues.\" Beninger rejected the offer to pay for transcription of the arbitration. In response, Bennett asserted that Fireman's had no good faith duty to participate in the arbitration as Fireman's was not a defendant and the arbitration was not a reasonableness hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Following the arbitration, Judge Burdell valued Gosney's claim at $10,800,289. Judge Burdell found that PT and Vose were jointly liable for the damages, that there was no bad faith, collusion, or fraud between the settling parties, and that the damages award was a reasonable covenant judgment amount. Judge Burdell further found that Fireman's had \"notice and opportunity to participate, submit evidence and be heard.\" The award caption included Fireman's as a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 The arbitration proceeding was unusual and is one of the most contentious subjects in this proceeding. King County Superior Court Judge Sean O'Donnell summarized some of the arbitration oddities:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Vose admitted personal liability (pursuant to the settlement agreement) when he was not named in the lawsuit brought by Mr. Welch's estate. Prior to reaching an amount for damages and prior to the arbitration, Mr. Bundy ... turned over the confidential Jackson Wallace attorney file to Mr. Benninger [sic] (at Mr. Benninger's [sic] insistence). Mr. Bundy and Plaintiffs' counsel discussed the issues to be arbitrated well in advance of the hearing, and Mr. Bundy even provided Mr. Benninger [sic] with favorable case law prior to appearing before Judge Burdell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   At the arbitration hearing itself, Mr. Bundy failed to submit his own trial brief, he failed to call a single witness to testify, he failed to offer his own exhibits, he failed to call an expert in franchisor liability, and he agreed that Ms. Heller (the driver who killed Mr. Welch) was an employee of Pizza Time (the franchisor) when, in fact, Ms. Heller only worked for the franchisee. He also was silent to the fact that Fireman's Fund was listed in the caption of the arbitration brief (and other pleadings) as a\n   party, when Fireman's Fund was not. Neither he nor Mr. Benninger [sic] made any effort to correct this error before Judge Burdell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Bundy failed to contest the difference between the damages award and the reasonableness finding/amount entered by Judge Burdell. The corollary to that concession is that Mr. Bundy agreed that Fireman's was liable for the total damage amount, with no discount afforded to Mr. Vose/Pizza Time for issues related to franchisor liability. Finally, the hearing was truncated, lasting only a matter of hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 29 On November 16, 2012, Thurston County Superior Court Judge Thomas McPhee determined that the arbitration award was reasonable and entered judgment against Vose and PT for $10,800,289 (hereinafter \"underlying judgment\"). The judgment included pre- and postjudgment interest accruing at the rate of 12 percent compounded annually from September 2, 2008 until paid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 12, 2013, Judge Tabor granted Fireman's motion to remove its name from the caption of the arbitration award. Judge Tabor granted the requested relief but wrote on the order, \"Court makes clear this does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   affect the award or goes to any of the merits or repercussions of the award.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 30 On August 23, 2013, Fireman's moved for partial summary judgment in this action, asserting that \"(1) as a matter of law Fireman's Fund is not bound by the arbitration award and judgment obtained against [Vose and PT] and that, therefore; (2) Plaintiffs' claim against Fireman's Fund for the amount of the arbitration award should be dismissed.\" King County Superior Court Judge Timothy Bradshaw denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 31 On November 26, 2013, Judge Bradshaw entered an order preventing Fireman's from deposing Beninger. On January 27, 2014, Judge Bradshaw entered an order \"to preclude attempts to relitigate the underlying Thurston County wrongful death action, issues and judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 32 Judge O'Donnell presided over a five-week jury trial in April and May 2015. At the close of Plaintiffs'\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   case, Fireman's moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to CR 50(a). Fireman's argued that the covenant judgment was the result of fraud and collusion, that Fireman's had not harmed Vose, and that Vose was judicially estopped from recovering damages because of his failure to disclose his claim during a prior bankruptcy proceeding. The trial court denied Fireman's motion but reserved ruling on the issue of judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 33 The jury was asked to resolve five claims: negligence, breach of contract, breach of the CPA, breach of the IFCA, and breach of the duty of good faith. The jury was instructed on Fireman's affirmative defenses of fraud, collusion, excuse of performance by estoppel, and excuse of performance by waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 34 At trial, Plaintiffs argued various violations of the duty of good faith. The jury was instructed that an insurer \"that refuses to defend in good faith voluntarily forfeits its ability to protect itself against a settlement in excess of policy limits unless the settlement or arbitration is the product of fraud or collusion.\" Instruction 22. The jury was further instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   An insurance company will be bound by the findings, conclusions and judgment entered against their insured when it has adequate notice and an opportunity to intervene in the underlying action. The insurer is bound to what might, or should, have been litigated as well as to what was actually litigated. An insurer is not entitled to litigate factual questions that were resolved in the liability case by judgment or arm's length settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   This instruction applies only in the absence of fraud or collusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Instruction 38.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   If you find that Fireman's failed to act in good faith by breaching its duty to defend and/or settle, then the law presumes that Plaintiffs Pizza Time and Mr. Vose were injured and that the failure to act in good faith was the proximate cause of this injury. You are bound by that presumption unless you find that Fireman's failure to act in good faith did not injure Plaintiffs Pizza Time and Mr. Vose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Fireman's bears the burden of proof that any failure to act in good faith did not injure Plaintiffs Pizza Time and Mr. Vose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving the amount of damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   For all other claims that Fireman's failed to act in good faith, Plaintiffs have the burden of proving each of the following propositions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (1) That Fireman's failed to act in good faith;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (2) That Plaintiff Pizza Time or Mr. Vose was damaged; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (3) That Fireman's failure to act in good faith was a proximate cause of Plaintiff Pizza Time's or Mr. Vose's damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   If you find from your consideration of all of the evidence that each of these propositions has not been proved, your verdict on the claim of failure to act in good faith should be for Fireman's.

The defense may be of greater benefit to the insured than the indemnity. The defense must be prompt and timely. An insurer refusing to defend exposes its insured to business failure and bankruptcy. An insurer faced with claims exceeding its policy limits should not be permitted to do nothing in the hope that the insured will go out of business and the claims simply go away. To limit an insurer's liability to its indemnity limits would only reward the insurer for failing to act in good faith toward its insured.

We conclude that, by its plain terms, it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 50 We begin our analysis with Question 4 of the special verdict form-damages. Question 4a asked the jury, \"Based on the jury instructions, what amount of damages, if any, do you find were incurred by Plaintiffs John Vose and Pizza Time?\" The jury was further instructed not to duplicate damages across multiple claims and not to reduce the damages for contributory negligence. The jury awarded Vose and PT $100,000 for negligence, $20,000 for breach of contract, $300,000 for breach of the duty of good faith, $20,000 for breach of the CPA, and $20,000 for breach of the IFCA. The jury was then asked to designate the amount of damages incurred by Vose, as opposed to those incurred by PT. The jury found that Vose incurred $240,000 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 51 Question 4 plainly does not provide the jury with an opportunity to award damages to Gosney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Question 4 is unique among the questions presented to the jury in that it is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   question that-instead of referencing the \"Plaintiffs\"-asks specifically about Vose and PT while not mentioning Gosney. The other questions presented to the jury ask about \"Plaintiffs\" generally-a term that included Vose, PT, and Gosney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 52 But the jury would have understood that Gosney stood to recover damages in this suit. Beninger informed the jury on the first day of trial that Gosney was \"what's called an assignee.... [S]he is here standing, basically standing in Pizza Time's shoes to pursue the claims, if any, that Pizza Time has against\n   Fireman's.\" Fireman's argued to the jury that Bundy and Beninger had colluded to commit fraud-a claim that existed only because of the assignment. The jury heard extensive testimony from Bundy concerning the assignment and the preclusive effect the assignment had on Vose's ability to file a claim against Fireman's. The jury heard testimony concerning the assignment from Vose. The jury heard opinion testimony concerning this particular assignment, and assignments generally, from multiple expert witnesses. The jury was reminded of the assignment again during closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 53 The parties' presentation of evidence and the jury instructions confirmed that Gosney was a \"Plaintiff\" as contemplated by other questions on the special verdict form. Instruction 30 identified Vose and PT as the first party claimants. Instruction 31 identified Gosney as the assignee of rights, claims, and causes of action of Vose and PT. The jury was instructed that, as an assignee, Gosney \"steps into the shoes of assignor and has the rights of the assignor.\" Instruction 54 told the jury that, if it found breach of the duty of good faith to defend or settle and did not find fraud or collusion, its award for the Plaintiffs \"must include the amount of the judgment on the arbitration award.\" From the testimony, argument, and instructions of the court, the jury would have understood that it was Gosney who would recover on the underlying judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 54 Moreover, because the underlying judgment represented only the presumptive measure of damages-theoretically allowing Gosney to seek damages\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   the amount of the underlying judgment-the instructions collectively signaled to the jury that it could be asked to determine damages due to Vose, PT, and Gosney.\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024601\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/175/756/#p764\">\n    175 Wash.2d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20P.3d%20551\">\n    287 P.3d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite this, no question on the special verdict form gave the jury an opportunity to award damages to Gosney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 55 Notwithstanding all of this, given the manner in which the case was argued in closing argument by Gosney's counsel, the instructions and the special verdict form were not inconsistent. Rather, the language instructing the jury that its verdict \"must include\" the underlying judgment was surplusage. This is so because, when an assignee is seeking only an amount equal to the amount of a covenant judgment, no factual question on the amount of damages is presented to the jury. If the assignee establishes an entitlement to relief, the amount of the covenant judgment is due as a matter of law. Here, because Gosney did\n   <em>\n    not,\n   </em>\n   in closing argument, seek an award greater than the amount of the underlying judgment, there was no requirement-constitutional or otherwise-that the jury be asked to set out the amount of damages due to Gosney. Gosney's omission from Question 4 of the special verdict form was proper. The answers to Question 4 do not signal that the jury rejected Gosney's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 56 The trial court did not err by so ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 57 Our next inquiry is whether the jury found that Plaintiffs had established every element of the tort of bad faith failure to defend or settle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court ruled that it had. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 58 Question 1a asked the jury, \"Have the Plaintiffs proven all elements of any or all of their claims as to the Defendants?\" The jury answered \"Yes\" for breach of the duty of good faith. Question 1b asked the jury, \"If you answered 'yes' to Question 1a as to Breach of Duty of Good Faith, did you find a breach of the duty to defend or settle?\" The jury answered \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 59 We begin by noting that the jury was not asked two separate and distinct questions but, rather, two interrelated questions. This understanding is supported by the trial court's decision to designate the questions as Question 1a and Question 1b, rather than Question 1 and Question 2. Question 1a unequivocally asked the jury to find whether Plaintiffs had proved \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   elements\" of any or all of their claims. (Emphasis added.) The most natural way to understand Question 1b, therefore, is that it asked the jury to answer whether Plaintiffs had proved \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   elements\" of the tort of bad faith failure to defend or settle. The trial court's ruling is consistent with this understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 60 We therefore conclude that the jury's affirmative answer to Question 1b necessarily includes a finding of harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 61 Fireman's argues to the contrary, asserting that Question 1b was designed to ask the jury only whether it had found a breach of the duty to defend or settle, not whether it had found all elements of the corresponding tort proved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Fireman's offers no explanation as to why the trial court would so inquire. Determining that the jury found breach alone proved would not have assisted the court. Such a finding would serve no purpose. On the other hand, a purpose was served by asking, in Question 1b, specifically about the tort of breach of duty to defend or settle, as opposed to the breach of the duty of good faith generally. As Instructions 53 and 54 make clear, different evidence was required to prove these different versions of the tort of breach of the duty of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 62 Indeed, for the trial judge to have accepted Fireman's interpretation of Question 1b, the judge would have had to believe that, after a five-week trial during which the primary cause of action at issue was the claim that Fireman's committed the tort of bad faith breach of its duty to defend or settle, he nowhere asked the jury to declare whether it found that cause of action to have been proved. That is not a reasonable reading of the court's instructions and verdict form and it is unsurprising that the judge refused to adopt it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 63 Our understanding of Question 1a and 1b is further supported by other instructions to the jury. As discussed herein, harm is an essential element of the tort of bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372124\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/118/383/#p389\">\n    118 Wash.2d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=823%20P.2d%20499\">\n    823 P.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the jury was not provided with an elements instruction pertaining to the tort of breach of the duty to defend or settle, the jury was appraised of the role that harm plays in proving the tort. Instruction 53 identified the element of harm as it pertains to both bad faith generally and bad faith failure to defend or settle. Harm was also identified as an essential element in the instructions pertaining to Plaintiffs' CPA and IFCA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 64 The jury found that Plaintiffs had proved all elements of the tort. This finding necessarily included a finding of harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 65 Our next inquiry is whether the decision to award the underlying judgment amount was within the province of the jury. We answer in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 66 The jury was properly instructed that Fireman's was liable for the entire amount of the underlying judgment if it breached its duty of good faith to defend or settle and failed to prove fraud or collusion in the settlement. As discussed herein, the jury found that Plaintiffs had proved all elements of the tort of bad faith failure to defend or settle-a finding that necessarily includes the element of harm. The jury further found that Fireman's had failed to prove its affirmative defenses of fraud and collusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 67 These factual findings are the necessary predicates to holding Fireman's liable for the underlying judgment. Whether the covenant judgment itself was reasonable was not a decision within the province of the jury.\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024601\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/175/756/#p764\">\n    175 Wash.2d at 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20P.3d%20551\">\n    287 P.3d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing RCW 4.22.060(1) ). Because Gosney did not request the jury to\n   award damages in addition to the underlying judgment, the total amount of damages incurred by Gosney was likewise not a decision within the province of the jury. There were no other factual questions put to the jury pertaining to the underlying judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 68 Accordingly, the decision to award the amount of the underlying judgment was not within the province of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 69 The jury here was tasked with finding whether Plaintiffs had proved that Fireman's breached its duty of good faith to defend or settle and whether Fireman's had proved its affirmative defenses of fraud or collusion. After the jury made its findings, the trial court gave legal effect to the verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 70 Having concluded that the trial court did not err by entering judgment in favor of Gosney in the principal amount of the underlying judgment, we turn to Fireman's remaining contentions. Fireman's assigns error to two of the jury instructions. Fireman's also contends that the trial court erred by restricting its presentation of evidence and by refusing to excuse a juror. Finally, Fireman's contends that the trial court erred by ruling that it was collaterally estopped from contesting the underlying judgment.

The trial court instructed the jury to ignore those parts of Tilden's testimony addressing the manufacturing of Vose's personal liability.

Vose could not initiate a lawsuit against Fireman's himself and he could not compel Gosney to file such a suit. As a corollary, Vose could not prevent Gosney from filing suit against Fireman's nor could he control any of the claims that Gosney might decide to bring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   \u00b6 137 In addition, Fireman's presented no evidence whatsoever-and the trial court made no findings-as to the precise nature and value of Vose's interest.

A debtor's recovery for an act that occurs\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the \"commencement of a case\" is not at issue. As the proponent of the judicial estoppel defense, Fireman's bore the burden of proving that, at the time that Vose filed for bankruptcy, he possessed some cognizable and valuable interest. But Fireman's offered no such proof. Rather, the record indicates that all of Vose's claimed personal damages originated\n   <em>\n    postbankruptcy,\n   </em>\n   when Fireman's refused to settle and refused to engage in arbitration. Indeed, had Fireman's agreed to the terms of the settlement agreement and paid the policy limits, Gosney would have released all claims against Fireman's (with or without Vose's assent), leaving Vose with no damages to recover and no claim or cause of action to assert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   \u00b6 138 Finally, Fireman's presented no evidence that disclosure would have changed the outcome of the bankruptcy. Fireman's offered no evidence to prove that any creditor would have requested a plan amendment if Vose had disclosed his potential interest in a lawsuit. Fireman's offered no evidence that the bankruptcy court would have changed the relief that it imposed had Vose disclosed the potential interest.

While no special verdict question asked the jury whether Fireman's Fund Insurance Company proved that its breach of its duty to defend did not harm the plaintiffs, the jury's answers to the special verdict questions answer this question and show that the jury found this breach caused no harm to plaintiffs. For this reason, the trial court improperly added $10.8 million to the jury's damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   \u00b6 153 The following review of the jury instructions and the jury's answers to the special verdict form questions show that the jury followed the court's instructions and did not intend to award this amount because it affirmatively found that Fireman's breach of its duty to defend and/or settle did not harm plaintiffs Pizza Time Inc. and Pizza Time Holdings of Washington (collectively Pizza Time) or John Vose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   \u00b6 154 Plaintiffs presented evidence supporting several theories of Fireman's failure to act in good faith.

Instruction 52, about waiver, provided in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-284\">\n   In this case, Fireman's duty to provide a defense to Plaintiffs Pizza Time and Mr.\n   Vose was excused if Fireman's has proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Plaintiffs Pizza Time and Mr. Vose waived their right to that performance under the contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   \u00b6 161 Special verdict question 3\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   asked the jury whether the defendants had proved all elements of any or all of their defenses. The jury answered yes for the defense of waiver and no for all other defenses, including fraud and collusion. This means that the jury found that Pizza Time and Vose waived Fireman's duty to provide a defense. Instructions 17 and 53 defined the elements of the breach of good faith claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These instructions distinguished the failure to defend and/or settle from the other breach of good faith claims. The court told the jury it must presume that Fireman's breach of the duty to defend and/or settle harmed Pizza Time and Vose unless Fireman's proved this breach did not injure Pizza Time and Vose. For the other breach of good faith claims, the plaintiffs had to prove \"[t]hat Plaintiff Pizza Time or Mr. Vose was damaged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   \u00b6 162 Because the jury found that Fireman's had proved that Pizza Time and Vose had waived Fireman's duty to defend and/or settle, the jury necessarily also found that Fireman's had proved that its breach of this duty did not harm Pizza Time or Vose. As a result, plaintiffs had not proved a breach of good faith claim based on a breach of the duty to defend and/or settle. The trial court and the majority both fail to account for the jury's waiver decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   \u00b6 163 Instruction 54 required the jury to include the judgment amount in its verdict if it found for the plaintiffs \"on their claim that Fireman's Fund/American Insurance Company failed to act in good faith as to duty to defend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   \u00b6 164 Special verdict question 4a asked the jury what amount of damages it found that plaintiffs Vose and Pizza Time incurred. The jury answered,\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-289\"><strong>Damages:</strong> Negligence: <em>$100,000.00</em> Breach of Contract: <em>$ 20,000.00</em> Breach of Duty of Good Faith: <em>$300,000.00</em> Breach of Consumer Protection Act: <em>$ 20,000.00</em> Breach of Insurance Fair Conduct Act: <em>$ 20,000.00</em></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   \u00b6 165 Special verdict question 4b asked the jury whether these damage amounts included the $10 million judgment. The jury answered no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   \u00b6 166 No special verdict question asked the jury whether Fireman's proved that its breach of its duty to defend and/or settle did not harm the plaintiffs. But the jury's answers to questions 1b, 3, 4a, and 4b, when viewed in the context of the instructions as a whole, answer this question. The jury found that Fireman's breached its duty to defend and/or settle (answer to 1b) but that Pizza Time and Vose waived performance of this duty (answer to 3). If the jury followed instructions 17 and 53, as we must presume they did, its decision not to include the judgment in its damage award for the breach of the duty of good faith means two things. First, that the jury found this breach did not\n   injure Pizza Time or Vose. And second, that some other breach of this duty did injure them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   \u00b6 167 The jury's answers to the special verdict questions are consistent with each other and demonstrate that the jury followed the court's instructions. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not have the authority to add $10.8 million to the jury's damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   \u00b6 168 The majority premises its contrary conclusion on a conflation of the jury's answer to special verdict question 1b. The majority relies in part on the structure of questions 1a and 1b for its analysis (answers included):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n   <strong>\n    QUESTION 1a: Plaintiffs Claims\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-295\">\n   Have the Plaintiffs proven all elements of any or all of their claims as to the Defendants? (The elements of these claims are described in the accompanying Jury Instructions.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-296\">\n   ANSWER: (Check \"yes\" or \"no\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-297\">ANSWER: (Check \"yes\" or \"no\") <strong>Negligence</strong> <em>X</em> <strong>Yes ___ No</strong> <strong>Breach of Contract</strong> <em>X</em> <strong>Yes ___ No</strong> <strong>Breach of Consumer Protection Act</strong> <em>X</em> <strong>Yes ___ No</strong> <strong>Breach of the Insurance Fair Conduct Act</strong> <em>X</em> <strong>Yes ___ No</strong> <strong>Breach of Duty of Good Faith</strong> <em>X</em> <strong>Yes ___ No</strong></pre>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-298\">\n   <strong>\n    Question 1b\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-299\">\n   If you answered \"yes\" to Question 1a as to Breach of Duty of Good Faith, did you find a breach of the duty to defend or settle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-300\"><strong><em>X</em></strong> <strong>Yes ____ No</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   \u00b6 169 The majority incorrectly concludes that the jury's answer to question 1 b means that the jury found that Fireman's breach of the duty to defend or settle harmed Pizza Time and Vose. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   \u00b6 170 The majority equates a finding of breach of a duty with a finding of all elements required to prove a claim of breach of Fireman's failure to act in good faith as to its duty to defend and/or settle, including the element of harm. To support its decision to ignore the plain language of question 1b, the majority offers a structural analysis: the two questions are designated 1a and 1b instead of 1 and 2. According to the majority, this means that they are \"interrelated questions\" rather than \"separate and distinct questions\" and question 1b thus really asks whether plaintiffs have proved all elements of a breach of the duty to defend and/or settle claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   \u00b6 171 This analysis has at least two flaws. First, it ignores the well settled rule that the use of different words generally reflects an intent to have a different meaning. The court's use of the words \"all elements\" in question 1a and \"breach\" in question 1b would generally be understood to reflect different meanings. Notably, the trial court, in its memorandum opinion, did not say that it intended the meaning attributed to it by the majority. Second, it ignores the history of the special verdict form's drafting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   \u00b6 172 The court drafted the form given to the jury using the defendants' proposed verdict form. Questions 1, 2, and 3 of the defendants' proposed form mirrored questions 1a, 2, and 3 of the court's form. The court chose to insert a question between 1 and 2, so it renumbered question 1 as 1a and inserted a question 1b. It did the same thing when it inserted question 4b, renumbering 4 as 4a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   This allowed the court to avoid renumbering the other questions and permitted the parties to discuss issues about these questions using the same number for the proposed verdict and the court's form. Unfortunately, the court's conferences with the parties about instructions were held after hours and off the record. So we have no additional information about the verdict form's history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   \u00b6 173 The majority also contends that it would not make sense for the court to ask whether it had found a breach of the duty to defend rather than whether it had found all elements of the corresponding tort proved. But the record provides multiple explanations. The parties contested whether the presumed injury rule described in instructions 17 and 53 and the presumed damage rule described in instruction 54 applied to all breaches of an insurance company's duty of good faith or just to a breach based on a failure to defend and/or settle. To preserve this issue for appeal, the court needed to make a record about which duty of good faith was breached and whether the jury's damage award included the amount of the judgement. This explains questions 1b and 4b, both inserted by the court into the defendants' proposed verdict form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   \u00b6 174 I agree with the majority's resolution of the remaining issues that it resolves.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-360\">\n    Special verdict question 2 asked about contributory negligence. The jury found that the defendants had not proved the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-361\">\n    These instructions are identical. Fireman's objected to the court giving the same instruction twice. The record does not disclose the trial court's reason for doing so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-362\">\n    The court also modified defendants' proposed question 4 and omitted their proposed question 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
