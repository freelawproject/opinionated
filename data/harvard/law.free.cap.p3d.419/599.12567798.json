Davisson, of Wichita. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in the state of Kansas on September 12, 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 15, 2017, the Disciplinary Administrator's office filed a formal complaint against respondent alleging violations of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC). Respondent failed to file an answer to the formal complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys held a hearing on November 16, 2017. Respondent failed to appear. The hearing panel determined he violated KRPC 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); KRPC 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (client communication); KRPC 8.4(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (conduct prejudicial to administration of justice); Kansas Supreme Court Rule 207(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 246) (cooperation with disciplinary investigation); and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 211(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251) (timely answer to formal disciplinary complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a disciplinary recommendation. Respondent took no exceptions to the hearing panel's report. Before this court, the Disciplinary Administrator's office endorses the panel's findings and recommends disbarment. Respondent did not appear. We quote the report's pertinent parts below.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    DA12617\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"7.

On February 22, 2012, L.B. and M.B. paid the respondent $900 under the representation agreement.

At the April 23, 2012, meeting, the respondent and L.B. reviewed a basic petition and discussed what a Chapter 13 plan would look like. Because a creditor was threatening to repossess the vehicle, on June 15, 2012, the respondent filed a Chapter 13 petition on behalf of L.B. and M.B. with only basic information. The respondent anticipated adding additional details later. After the bankruptcy petition was filed, L.B. and M.B. began receiving collection phone calls from several creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"11. L.B. and M.B. attempted to contact the respondent by phone several times to inquire about the list of creditors, but were unsuccessful in reaching him.

L.B. and M.B. continued to attempt to contact the respondent without success. The respondent's failure to communicate caused L.B. and M.B. unnecessary stress.

On September 7, 2016, Mr. McIntyre entered his appearance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"17. On September 1, 2016, L.B. and M.B. filed a complaint with the disciplinary administrator regarding the respondent's conduct.

The attorney investigator followed the telephone call with a letter to the respondent on November 17, 2016, again directing the respondent to provide a written response to the complaint. That same day, the respondent called the attorney investigator and confirmed that he would be providing a written response to the complaint.

He got to keep the truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   There was a long, drawn out process in the bankruptcy, but eventually in April 2013, his Chapter 13 case was confirmed, and under the Chapter 13 plan, he made payments for a period of time. And from-as I recall, the-from that day-he started making payments when we filed the bankruptcy, but from the date of confirmation, he had another 38 months to go to complete that Chapter 13 plan.

Because the respondent knowingly failed to provide a timely written response to L.B. and M.B.'s complaint and because the respondent failed to provide a written response to the complaints filed by S.G. and N.W., the hearing panel concludes that the respondent repeatedly violated Kan.

The respondent has been previously disciplined on three occasions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   1) In 1987, the respondent was informally admonished following a formal hearing in W3918 for neglecting a matter entrusted to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   2) In 1988, the Kansas Supreme Court censured the respondent for neglecting a matter entrusted to him, in violation of DR 1-102(A)(1), DR 6-101(A)(2), and DR 6-101(A)(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   3) In 1998, the Kansas Supreme Court placed the respondent on two years probation for having violated MRPC 1.3 (diligence) and MRPC 1.4 (communication).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    A Pattern of Misconduct\n   </em>\n   .

The respondent committed multiple rule violations. The respondent violated KRPC 1.3, KRPC 1.4, KRPC 8.4, Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 207, and Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 211. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent committed multiple offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Bad Faith Obstruction of the Disciplinary Proceeding by Intentionally Failing to Comply with Rules or Orders of the Disciplinary Process\n   </em>\n   . The respondent failed to provide written responses to two of the complaints in this case. The respondent was repeatedly instructed to provide written responses. Additionally, the respondent failed to file an answer to the formal complaint. Finally, the respondent failed to attend the hearing on the formal complaint. The respondent's neglect of the disciplinary case amounts to bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules and orders of the disciplinary process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Refusal to Acknowledge Wrongful Nature of Conduct\n   </em>\n   .

Further, the respondent knowingly caused actual serious harm to his clients. Finally, the respondent's misconduct is aggravated by his total failure to participate in the disciplinary investigation and prosecution. Accordingly, based upon the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the Standards listed above, the hearing panel unanimously recommends that the respondent be disbarred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \"59.
