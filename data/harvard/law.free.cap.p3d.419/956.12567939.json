They appealed, and in an opinion filed on May 17, 2016, we concluded the Rasors' proffered expert witness was unqualified to give standard-of-care testimony; however, we reversed the trial court's denial of the Rasors' request for additional time to secure a new expert and vacated its summary judgment order.\n   <em>\n    Rasor v.

The underlying facts describing Karyn's critical care hospitalization at Northwest are detailed in\n   <em>\n    Rasor I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310821\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/546/\">\n    239 Ariz. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2-4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310821\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/546/\">\n    373 P.3d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For present purposes, we note that in July 2011, Karyn underwent open-heart surgery at Northwest, after which she received an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) threaded through her femoral artery and requiring the immobilization of her leg. Following surgery, Karyn spent several days in the intensive care unit (ICU), where the nurses eventually discovered a pressure ulcer on her coccyx that ultimately reached \"stage IV\" and required thirty-one debridement procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Based on Karyn's allegedly permanent pain and other symptoms, the Rasors brought a medical malpractice action against Northwest in July 2013, alleging the hospital had \"breached its professional duties ..., proximately causing the development of a decubitus ulcer\" by failing to \"appropriately off-load\" Karyn and \"negligently fail[ing] to timely discover\" the ulcer during her intensive care. In support of their claim, the Rasors\n   retained a single expert, a board-certified wound-care nurse, Julie Ho, R.N. In Ho's opinion, Northwest had not adequately repositioned Karyn during recovery, causing the development of a pressure ulcer, which worsened because of the hospital's failure to respond appropriately after discovering it. The Rasors filed a motion to qualify Ho as an expert on the standard of care, causation, and prognosis, or, in the alternative, to be permitted to identify a new expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Northwest subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that Nurse Ho \"d[id] not qualify under Arizona Rule of Evidence, Rule 702, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2603, and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2604\" to render opinions in this matter such that the Rasors \"[we]re unable to establish that [the hospital] breached the applicable standard of care and [the] Complaint should be dismissed.\" At the hearing on the Rasors' motion, the trial court found that Ho could testify to the standard of care and stated, \"I'm going to let you go with a wound care witness rather than an ICU nurse. You can take that to the bank, okay?\" However, the court also said, \"[W]hat I'm concerned about is whether or not she could testify as to causation,\" ultimately concluding that the Rasors could introduce her expert opinion \"regarding wound care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 At the oral argument on Northwest's summary judgment motion, the Rasors again asked that they be permitted to find a new expert witness if the trial court determined that Nurse Ho was unqualified. The court, however, denied that request and granted summary judgment without explanation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Rasors appealed, and as noted above, we concluded that Ho was unqualified as a standard-of-care expert. Our supreme court agreed, but remanded the case for this court to determine whether Ho might nevertheless be qualified to provide expert testimony on causation, or whether this case does not require a causation expert as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rasor II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20160\">\n    243 Ariz. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8, 29, 32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20572\">\n    403 P.3d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In their opening brief before this court, the Rasors asserted \"the nature of the risk from the failure to relieve pressure over Ms. Rasor's tailbone and the ensuing injury there provides the kind of evidence of causal relationship that is readily apparent to a jury, even without expert testimony.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The Rasors' generalized contention is undercut by another section of their opening brief that quoted an explanation of \"the mechanism of injury\" from the hospital's disclosure statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Pressure over a bony prominence causes tissue ischemia in the skin, muscle, and the fascia between the skin surface and bone. The pressure compresses small vessels and prevents both supply of oxygen and nutrients at the capillary interface as well as venous return of metabolic wastes. Metabolic wastes accumulate and cause local vasodilatation, which contributes to edema, which further compresses small vessels and increases edema and ischemia. Local tissue death then occurs, resulting in a pressure ulcer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The record also includes testimony from the hospital's expert regarding numerous factors contributing to development of a pressure ulcer, which he stated in Karyn's case went beyond her being \"critically ill in the ICU, on vasopressors, with decreased circulation\" and \"the intubation with mechanical ventilation\n   and an intra-aortic balloon pump\" making her \"difficult to mobilize in bed.\" He went on to identify as \"additional risk factors\" that Karyn was \"hypoalbuminemic,\" \"mildly anemic,\" \"a smoker,\" and had \"two collagen vascular disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus,\" both of which were \"pro-inflammatory conditions\" that would contribute to other risk factors for development of pressure ulcers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 We cannot conclude a jury would find the process of developing a pressure ulcer and attendant contributing factors, particularly in Karyn's case, as well as the resulting existence or lack of a causal relationship \"readily apparent.\" Accordingly, this case requires expert testimony regarding causation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frausto v.

Specifically, Northwest asserts, \"Given the complex pre-existing conditions that Ms. Rasor had, along with her complex medical problems, surgery and post-surgical complications, conditions and interventions, it is beyond the scope of a nurse to render a medical causation opinion,\" particularly \"in this case where Ms. Ho admitted that the development of a pressure ulcer is multifactorial and depends on the patient's co-morbidities and conditions-areas which she did not even consider.\" In the hospital's supplemental brief, it requests that we \"state a bright line rule that a nurse cannot offer causation opinions in a medical malpractice action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 Section 12-2603(A), A.R.S., governs expert testimony in medical malpractice cases and requires the filing of an affidavit stating \"whether or not expert opinion testimony is necessary to prove the health care professional's standard of care or liability for the claim.\" If such affidavit asserts the need for expert testimony, claimants must then file a \"preliminary expert opinion affidavit\" including \"[t]he expert's qualifications to express an opinion on the health care professional's standard of care or liability for the claim.\" \u00a7 12-2603(B)(1).

During Ho's deposition, she stated that her role at that hospital included \"admission assessments,\" \"weekly re-assessments,\" and \"care planning,\" and she \"provided treatments and collaborat[ed] with physicians[ and others] for the plan and care for the patients.\" Additionally, although she was then working in a long-term, acute-care hospital, she had spent the first nine years of her career in a coronary care unit of an acute-care hospital like Northwest, was cross-trained for the ICU,\n   and had gained experience working with patients recovering from open-heart surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 According to the Rasors' disclosure, Nurse Ho had reviewed Karyn's medical records, the hospital's policies for preventing pressure ulcers, and information from the nurses regarding their interaction with Karyn. The Rasors proffered that Ho would testify Northwest \"should have relieved the pressure created over Ms. Rasor's coccyx by repositioning her correctly and utilizing a specialty pressure relieving surface\" and \"[h]ad Northwest Hospital properly provided these standard interventions, the deep tissue injury should have been avoided.\" Ho would also testify that after one of the nurses observed \"bruising over the coccyx,\" she should have \"[a]t a minimum\" \"attempt[ed] to remove all pressure which caused the deep tissue injury\" and the \"failure to intervene likely le[ ]d to a worsening of the injury, which ultimately ended in a stage IV decubitus ulcer open to the coccyx bone.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 During Nurse Ho's deposition, the hospital elicited her testimony that she did not \"intend to give an opinion with regard to any predisposing or premorbid conditions that Ms. Rasor had with respect to the development of the pressure ulcer\" and had not been given access to Karyn's entire medical chart for the time she was at Northwest. Additionally, although Ho stated that her opinion was \"to a reasonable degree of medical probability,\" \"relying on best practice[s] and research,\" she also stated she was not making a medical diagnosis as to causation but rather \"an assessment\" because \"[a] pressure ulcer is not a medical diagnosis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 On appeal, Northwest points to these portions of Nurse Ho's testimony and argues \"her opinions are not based on sufficient facts or data, the product of reliable principles and methods, and principles and methods reliably applied to the facts of this case\" and \"she disqualif[ied] herself based on her testimony.\" Initially, we disagree with the hospital's conclusion that Ho disqualified herself by stating she was making \"an assessment\" of causation rather than a medical diagnosis of causation. Northwest has identified no authority, nor are we aware of any, for the proposition that testimony on the causation of injuries must be a \"medical diagnosis\" as opposed to \"an assessment.\" As we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Lohmeier v. Hammer\n   </em>\n   , \"under Arizona law, it is not necessary that an expert witness be a medical doctor in order to offer testimony regarding the causation of physical injuries so long as ... the expert has specialized knowledge that will assist the jury in its resolution of that issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999392\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/57/\">\n    214 Ariz. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999392\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/57/\">\n    148 P.3d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24 As for the hospital's argument that Nurse Ho's opinion is not sufficiently well-founded, we note that in both its answering and its supplemental brief, Northwest falls back on its assertion that a nurse is not qualified to give causation expert testimony, a premise we have already rejected. Additionally, although the hospital may question the foundation and strength of Ho's opinion given that she did not review Karyn's complete medical records, that issue goes to the weight of her testimony and is not sufficient to render the opinion so unreliable as to preclude it altogether.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328709\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/226/\">\n    237 Ariz. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328709\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/226/\">\n    349 P.3d 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Whether errors in application [of methodology] render evidence unreliable will not always be clear.
