To carry out this plan, the two drove to the golf course in Mr. Jordin's car, arriving at approximately 3:15 a.m. Mr. Reed kicked in the back door of the clubhouse and began removing items from the pro shop. He entered the pro shop three times, grabbing any items he could including cash registers, golf clubs, alcohol, and potato chips. Mr. Jordin remained in his car, acting as a lookout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The golf course's manager, Brian Creager, who lived in a home on the golf course, saw the taillights of Mr. Jordin's vehicle entering the property. Mr. Creager drove to the clubhouse and encountered Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed looking under the raised hood of Mr. Jordin's car. Mr. Creager rolled down his window and asked the men if there was a problem. The men said they were having car troubles and were checking the antifreeze and oil. Mr. Creager then went to the clubhouse, entering through the pro shop. After a few minutes, Mr. Creager left the clubhouse, locked the door, and went to the office building. He observed Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed still working on the car. Mr. Creager was in the office for a short time and then returned to the pro shop. While in the pro shop the second time, Mr. Creager noticed the cash register and his computer were missing. He went into the kitchen and observed the cooler door was open, the door frame into the building was broken, and the door was open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Mr. Creager then confronted Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed at their car, telling them he needed to look inside the vehicle. At this point, Mr. Reed shined a military grade flashlight in strobe mode into Mr. Creager's face. Mr. Creager saw Mr. Jordin quickly moving towards him. He grabbed the flashlight from Mr. Reed and struck Mr. Jordin in the head with it. Mr. Jordin staggered away from Mr. Creager as his head was bleeding and his glasses fell from his face. Mr. Creager saw Mr. Reed reach through an open window into the car and attempt to start it using a screwdriver. Mr. Creager looked away for a moment to find something to use to disable the vehicle, and when he looked back he could no longer see Mr. Reed. Mr. Creager then heard someone say, \"He split my head open,\" followed by, \"Shoot him, shoot him.\" Seconds later, someone fired a gun and Mr. Creager observed a muzzle flash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Mr. Creager ran into the clubhouse and called 911. During the call, he noticed the men leaving in their car, and he decided to pursue them. He chased the men and forced them off the road, resulting in both Mr. Jordin's and Mr. Creager's vehicles rolling over. Mr. Creager got out of his vehicle and saw Mr. Reed begin to run away. He yelled at Mr. Reed to stop or he would kill him and Mr. Reed responded, \"You already killed my friend,\" and continued to run away. Not seeing or hearing Mr. Jordin, Mr. Creager began to walk back towards the golf course until he was met by a law enforcement officer. Mr. Jordin was arrested two days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The State charged Mr. Jordin with conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206-1-303\">\n    Wyo.

Mr. Jordin argues the State failed to carry its burden of proof of this element. A close look at his argument, however, demonstrates that his challenge to the sufficiency of the State's evidence at trial is two-fold. His primary focus is on the fact that the State presented three different theories about what was used as a deadly weapon during the confrontation-the army grade flashlight, the gun, and a baseball bat that was found in the area where Mr. Jordin parked his vehicle at the golf course. Mr. Jordin argues that because the State did not choose which of the \"deadly weapons\" it was relying on for each of the charges, our precedent\n   in\n   <em>\n    Tanner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9308554\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1242/\">\n    2002 WY 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9308554\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1242/\">\n    57 P.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 2002), requires the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed conspired to use all three weapons during the burglary and confrontation with Mr. Creager. This leads to the second part of Mr. Jordin's argument, which is the State failed to prove Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed agreed to use any weapon at all. We will consider each of these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Applicability of Tanner v. State\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 10] At trial, the State argued that the flashlight, the gun, or the baseball bat would satisfy the \"deadly weapon\" element found in each of the charged crimes. Mr. Jordin argues that, because the State did not choose only one of those theories at trial, the State must point to facts in the record that show beyond a reasonable doubt Mr. Jordin conspired with Mr. Reed to use each of the weapons. In support of this argument, Mr. Jordin relies on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 11] In\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   , this Court reaffirmed the requirement that, if a crime contains alternative elements and the jury is instructed regarding both alternatives because the State does not elect a single alternative as the basis for the charge, this Court must find sufficient evidence of each alternative element to uphold the conviction on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9308554\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1242/\">\n    57 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1246 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Woyak\n   </em>\n   , the State had charged the appellant with two separate counts of the same statute, so further description of the appellant's alleged criminal conduct may have been necessary to distinguish between the two counts. Mr. Jordin was charged with multiple crimes, but each charge was based on a different statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Mr. Jordin's situation is squarely addressed by\n   <em>\n    Daves\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   , and the rule from\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   simply does not apply. The jury was not required to deliberate regarding alternative elements. Instead, the jury simply had to determine if Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed agreed to use a deadly weapon during the commission of each crime. While the State suggested there were several facts that could meet the \"deadly weapon\" element of the charged crimes, the \"deadly weapon\" element remained the same regardless of the type of deadly weapon used. Therefore, so long as there was evidence Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed agreed to use a deadly weapon during the commission of the crimes, we must affirm Mr. Jordin's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Mr. Jordin argues the State presented insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed agreed to use the flashlight, the gun, or the baseball bat during the incident at the golf course. As discussed above, we need not determine whether the State presented proof beyond a reasonable doubt that they agreed to use each of the deadly weapons. We conclude the State presented sufficient evidence demonstrating they agreed to use the gun and, therefore, we will not consider the evidence regarding the flashlight or the baseball bat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 18] Mr. Jordin's assertion that the State presented insufficient evidence he and Mr. Reed agreed to use the gun is based solely on the facts that Mr. Reed testified he was not aware Mr. Jordin had a weapon, Mr. Reed denied saying \"Shoot him, shoot him,\" and Mr. Creager testified he did not know which man yelled \"Shoot him, shoot him.\" This argument, however, ignores our standard of review when considering the sufficiency of the evidence. We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, including every favorable inference that can be drawn from that evidence, and ignore any evidence favorable to Mr. Jordin that conflicts with the State's evidence.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410438\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/408/756/\">\n    408 P.3d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, there is ample evidence in the record that would allow the jury to nonetheless conclude that through their conduct the two men had a tacit agreement and understanding the gun may be used. Mr. Creager testified that after he hit Mr. Jordin in the head with the flashlight, Mr. Jordin turned and ran away. He testified he then heard two phrases: \"He split my head open.\" \"Shoot him, shoot him.\" Seconds later, Mr. Creager heard a gunshot and saw a muzzle flash. He explained he did not know who said, \"Shoot him, shoot him.\" However, because he knew he had struck Mr. Jordin in the head with the flashlight, he deduced Mr. Jordin was the one who exclaimed, \"He split my head open.\" Mr. Creager testified he perceived these comments as a communication between Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed to shoot Mr. Creager. Mr. Jordin testified he retrieved his gun from his vehicle after Mr. Creager struck him, and he did, in fact, fire the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 21] Based upon this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that, after Mr. Jordin said, \"He split my head open,\" Mr. Reed told Mr. Jordin to shoot at Mr. Creager (\"Shoot him, shoot him.\"). It is also reasonable for the jury to infer Mr. Reed would have said this only if he knew Mr. Jordin had a gun in his possession. Further, a witness named Samantha Sanchez, who is friends with Mr. Jordin, testified that Mr. Jordin always carried his gun with him and that fact was well known within his circle of friends. Therefore, the jury could reasonably conclude that Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed engaged in their criminal conduct with a tacit agreement that Mr. Jordin would be armed and one of them could use the gun if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 22] The State's argument that either the flashlight, the gun, or the baseball bat could meet the element of \"deadly weapon\" found in each of the crimes did not amount to the jury being presented with alternative elements and, therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   rule does not apply. Further, the record demonstrates the State presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude Mr. Jordin and Mr. Reed agreed to use the gun during the burglary and subsequent events at the golf course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 23] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The statutes regarding the crimes being appealed are as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     \u00a7 6-1-303.
