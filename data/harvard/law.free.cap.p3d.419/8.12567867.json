Bennett and Shelby Montgomery brought these consolidated negligence actions against Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Patrick R. Saleh and the State of Kansas\n   for the injuries and damages they sustained as a result of a collision with a vehicle being driven by fleeing suspect Robert Horton who was being pursued by Trooper Saleh. The district court's entry of summary judgment\n   in favor of Trooper Saleh and the State of Kansas brings the matter to us for our de novo review. The defendants cross-appeal on a number of issues raised in the district court. Because we consider the defendants' summary judgment motion de novo, we need not concern ourselves with the holding of the district court and will address the issues in the cross-appeal in ruling de novo on the defendants' summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based upon our review of the record and being ever mindful of our fundamental policy of preserving for resolution by the jury disputed issues of fact, we conclude that there remain genuine issues of material fact regarding the claims of fault against Trooper Saleh, and vicariously against the State, which must await trial. Summary judgment is not appropriate on these claims. But with respect to the separate claims of direct negligence against the State, it is apparent that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the plaintiffs have abandoned them. Accordingly, the State is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs commenced separate actions against Trooper Saleh and the State of Kansas. They claim that Trooper Saleh initiated and continued a high-speed chase in reckless disregard for the safety of others, without a valid and legal reason for initiating and continuing pursuit, and in violation of the Kansas Highway Patrol's pursuit policy and procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their separate action against the State of Kansas, the plaintiffs claim the State is vicariously liable for Trooper Saleh's actions and that the Kansas Highway Patrol and Troop K of the Kansas Highway Patrol/Capitol Police negligently failed to establish and enforce appropriate pursuit policies and procedures. In addition, they assert that the Kansas Highway Patrol was negligent in its hiring, retention, supervision, education, training, and instruction of Trooper Saleh. These separate suits were consolidated for discovery purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After discovery was complete, the defendants moved for summary judgment. They claim (1) the plaintiffs fail to establish a prima facie case; (2) the defendants are entitled to immunity under the Kansas Tort Claims Act (KTCA); (3) the defendants fail to state a claim that the State negligently failed to establish and enforce appropriate pursuit policies and procedures; and (4) as a matter of law the State was not negligent in its hiring, retention, supervision, education, training, and instruction of Trooper Saleh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Uncontroverted Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The uncontroverted facts disclose that on the evening of August 23, 2010, Kansas Highway Patrol Sergeant Tim Tillman was stopped at a red light at the intersection of Topeka Boulevard and 32nd Terrace in Topeka. He stopped next to a red Toyota also travelling northbound on Topeka Boulevard. He observed the front passenger holding a knife and speaking to the Toyota's driver. He could not hear their conversation. When the light turned green and the Toyota began to drive away, Sergeant Tillman saw the Toyota passenger swing the knife toward the driver, but he did not know whether the Toyota passenger was being physically aggressive or merely fooling around. (After the crash, no knife was found in the vehicle.) Sergeant Tillman reported the Toyota's license plate to dispatch and was informed that the plate number belonged to a 1992 Oldsmobile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because he was in plain clothes and driving an unmarked vehicle, Sergeant Tillman requested that Trooper Terry Fields and Trooper Saleh, who were in the area of 10th Avenue and Topeka Boulevard, stop the Toyota. Troopers Saleh and Fields spotted the Toyota near the intersection of Topeka Boulevard and 21st Street. Trooper Saleh took the lead. He activated his red lights, siren, and dashboard video camera which recorded the pursuit. The pursuit lasted approximately 1 minute and 32 seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Trooper Saleh activated his emergency equipment, the driver of the Toyota turned right onto 20th Street, rapidly accelerated as he headed east, and ran a stop sign as he was turning right onto Kansas Avenue,\n   where he proceeded south. Trooper Saleh\n   continued pursuing the vehicle as it crossed the yellow line on Kansas Avenue and weaved across the southbound lanes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Trooper Saleh accelerated to 80 to 90 miles per hour, but he estimated that the Toyota was travelling in excess of 100 miles per hour. He decided to terminate pursuit \" '[s]omewhere around the Wonder Bread outlet store' \" which was located between 27th Street and 29th Street on Kansas Avenue. But he did not actually terminate his pursuit at any point before the Toyota sped through a red traffic light at the intersection of Kansas Avenue and 29th Street and collided with the Chevy pickup truck occupied by plaintiffs Bennett and Montgomery. At the time of the collision, Trooper Saleh was about two and a half blocks behind the Toyota. The impact caused the Chevy pickup truck to spin into several other vehicles. The driver of the Toyota was later confirmed to be Horton, and his passenger was a minor female who had been reported as a runaway by her foster mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Throughout the course of these events, Trooper Saleh was acting within the scope and course of his employment with the State of Kansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants' expert, Special Agent Kenneth R. Wallentine, a Utah law enforcement officer, opined that Trooper Saleh's pursuit was reasonable and consistent with generally accepted policies, practices, and training. He concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Though plaintiff's expert speculates that termination of the pursuit fractions of a moment sooner might conceivably prompted Horton to cease his unlawful flight, experience and reason suggests otherwise. Police officers deal in facts known or reasonably believed. They don't have the luxury of acting on academic guesses of what might happen if an offender acts true to one theory of behavior.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Contentions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendants contend:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Duty and breach\n   </em>\n   : Plaintiffs cannot establish the duty and breach elements of their claims because Trooper Saleh's duty to \" 'maintain public order or make arrests for crimes' \" superseded his duty to operate his emergency vehicle with due regard for the safety of all persons under K.S.A. 8-1506. Further, the plaintiffs cannot provide sufficient evidence to\n   support their claim that Trooper Saleh acted with a conscious and unjustifiable disregard of the danger the pursuit caused for other motorists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Proximate cause\n   </em>\n   : The fleeing suspect was the only proximate cause of plaintiffs' injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    KTCA Immunity\n   </em>\n   : The defendants are entitled to immunity under various provisions of the KTCA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Futhermore, the defendants allege that the plaintiffs did not present evidence supporting their claim that the State of Kansas negligently failed to establish and enforce appropriate pursuit policies and procedures and in its hiring, retention, supervision, education, training, and instruction of Trooper Saleh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Contentions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response to the defendants' summary judgment motion, the plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of expert criminologist Geoffrey Alpert, Ph.D., who opined that Trooper Saleh's pursuit became futile once the Toyota ran the stop sign on 20th Street because it was more likely than not that the driver would continue to flee as long as he was being chased. In his opinion, \"the pursuit should have been terminated between 20th and 21st street and no later than when [Horton] ran the red light at 21st street in an attempt to elude the police.\" According to Alpert, \"[h]ad the police terminated their active attempt to apprehend [Horton], it is more likely than not that he would not have crashed into the pick-up driven by [Bennett] at 29th.\" Alpert concluded that Trooper Saleh's continued pursuit of Horton was a proximate cause of the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiffs argued that \"had Trooper Saleh terminated his pursuit once he became aware that it was unjustified in light of the dangers presented, the Toyota would not have crashed into Plaintiffs' vehicle and caused Plaintiffs' injuries.\" In support, the plaintiffs note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 The Toyota had been traveling 100 miles per hour for several blocks during the police chase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 The Toyota would have slowed down enough to avoid the\n   collision if Trooper Saleh had properly terminated the chase once it became futile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 It was evident that the chase was futile because rather than stopping, the Toyota ran through a stop sign, weaved across lanes, accelerated through a red stop light, and reached speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiffs assert that a reasonable jury could have found that Horton would have slowed through the intersection at 29th Street and Kansas Avenue if Trooper Saleh had terminated pursuit. Likewise, they assert a reasonable jury could find Horton's collision with plaintiffs' vehicle was foreseeable to Trooper Saleh because he had watched a near-miss when Horton sped through the stoplight at 21st Street and Kansas Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiffs noted that K.S.A. 8-1506(a) - (c) grants drivers of an authorized emergency vehicle privileges that excuse them from following traffic laws under certain conditions. But subsection (d) provides: \"The foregoing provisions shall not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of reckless disregard for the safety of others.\" K.S.A. 8-1506(d). They also presented evidence of the Kansas Highway Patrol's policy regarding when to initiate and reevaluate a pursuit. The policy, known as OPS-16, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Officers are expected to make a diligent and reasonable effort to stop all suspected or actual violators. The decision to initiate pursuit must be based on the pursuing officer's conclusion that the immediate danger to the officer and the public created by the pursuit is less than the immediate or potential danger to the public should the suspect remain at large.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   OPS-16 identifies the following factors to take into consideration when deciding to initiate a pursuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"a. nature and seriousness of violation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"b. road, weather and environmental conditions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"c. population density and presence of vehicular/pedestrian traffic;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"d. officer's familiarity with area;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"e. patrol vehicle condition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"f. alternative methods of apprehension;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"g. likelihood of successful apprehension;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"h. mutual aid agreements with city and county authorities.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   OPS-16 further provides: \"The primary pursuing unit shall continually re-evaluate and assess the pursuit situation including all of the initiating factors and terminate the pursuit whenever he or she reasonably believes the risks associated with continued pursuit are greater than the public safety benefit of making an immediate apprehension.\" The only provisions mandating termination of pursuit are (1) when there is an equipment failure or (2) when the pursuing officer knows or is reasonably certain that the fleeing vehicle is operated by a juvenile and the underlying offense is not a serious felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Review Standards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In an appeal from the district court's ruling on a summary judgment motion, we consider the motion de novo and apply the same standards which the district court applied.\n   <em>\n    Osterhaus v.

Summary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 60-256(c)(2). Any court considering the motion must resolve all facts and inferences which may reasonably be drawn from the evidence in favor of the party against whom the summary judgment motion is sought. When opposing a motion for summary judgment, an adverse party must come forward with evidence to establish a dispute as to a material fact. In order to preclude summary judgment, the facts subject\n   to the dispute must be material to the conclusive issues in the case. The court must deny a motion for summary judgment if reasonable minds could differ as to the conclusions drawn from the evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   overruled its prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Thornton v. Shore\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   , the Wichita police department received a 911 call that Drechsler was causing a domestic\n   disturbance. When the officer was en route to the home, Drechsler broke through the door of the home with an ax and began chasing his wife with the ax. Drechsler pinned his wife on a bed and held the ax over her head before letting her go and returning to the garage where he broke the windows of her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   While the officer was approaching the house, Drechsler got in his truck and left. Officer Woodward began pursuing Drechsler with his lights and sirens activated. The officer continued pursuit even after Drechsler ran a red light. Eventually, Drechsler broadsided a car driven by Robbins, who died as a result. Robbins' husband filed a wrongful death action, alleging negligence in the pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   court established the reckless disregard standard of care for determining whether the officer breached his duty in a police pursuit. Reckless disregard in this context consists of \"driving a vehicle under circumstances that show a realization of the imminence of danger to another person or the property of another where there is a conscious and unjustifiable disregard of that danger.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668736\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/285/455/#p470\">\n    285 Kan. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668736\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/285/455/#p470\">\n    172 P.3d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In applying this standard the court determined that the officer's duty to \"drive with due regard for the safety of all others\" included the officer's manner of operating his own vehicle, the decision to initiate the pursuit, and the decision to continue to pursue the suspect.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668736\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/285/455/#p470\">\n    285 Kan. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668736\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/285/455/#p470\">\n    172 P.3d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But similarly dire circumstances did not confront Trooper Saleh when he took up the pursuit of the Toyota in our present case. Trooper Saleh's conduct under the facts of our present case cannot be characterized as a matter of law as satisfying the standard of care stated in\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   . While the\n   appropriate standard of care is an issue of law for the court, whether that standard has been breached, particularly in the context of tort litigation,\n   generally should be left to the fact-finder at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The first consideration under Kansas Highway Patrol Pursuit Policy OPS-16 in deciding to initiate a pursuit is the nature and seriousness of the perceived violation. OPS-16 requires that initiating a pursuit \"must be based on the pursuing officer's conclusion that the immediate danger to the officer and the public created by the pursuit is less than the immediate or potential danger to the public should the suspect remain at large.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, Horton was not observed before the chase engaging in any conduct that would cause Trooper Saleh to reasonably conclude that the immediate danger to the public created by the pursuit would be less than the immediate or potential danger to the public should Horton remain at large. Trooper Saleh's chase was not precipitated by reckless driving which, if unchecked, would create the possibility-much less the probability-that the suspect's conduct would end in serious injury or death to others on the roadway. There was no suspicion that the driver was intoxicated, thereby putting other motorists at risk. A jury could conclude that the nature of Horton's perceived violation, driving an automobile with an improper tag, was not so serious as to override the potential danger to the public resulting from the chase. There is no indication that Horton caused a risk to society such as described by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   , in which the court observed that \"the officers were confronted with a drunken, violent, ax-wielding, fleeing offender whose very presence put whomever he encountered at serious risk of bodily injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668736\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/285/455/#p470\">\n    285 Kan. at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668736\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/285/455/#p470\">\n    172 P.3d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it was reported to Trooper Saleh that the passenger in Horton's car was waving a knife, Trooper Saleh did not know if the driver was dangerous or posed an immediate threat to others. The officer who observed the knife did not know whether the passenger was threatening the driver or just fooling around.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Further, OPS-16 requires the officer to terminate pursuit when the officer reasonably believes the risks associated with continued pursuit are greater than the public safety benefit of making an immediate apprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Here, there is evidence from which a jury could conclude that Trooper Saleh realized the imminence of danger during the chase. He recognized that Horton ignored the stop sign on 20th Street, and he verbalized on his dashboard video that he anticipated that Horton would run the red light at 21st Street. Before Horton reached the light, Trooper Saleh saw him cross the yellow line and switch lanes multiple times without signaling. As Horton went through the red light at 21st Street, two vehicles were approaching the intersection, one eastbound and one westbound. Both of those vehicles had a green light to enter the intersection. At this moment, it can be inferred that Trooper Saleh understood the imminent danger to other drivers in Horton's path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Despite Trooper Saleh's realization of the imminent danger, there is evidence from which a jury could find that he showed a conscious and unjustifiable disregard of the danger when he chose to continue the pursuit through the streets of Topeka. Kansas Highway Patrol Policy OPS-16 requires termination of the pursuit when the risks associated with the continuing pursuit outweigh the public safety benefit of immediately apprehending the fleeing vehicle. The weighing of competing risks is a matter we traditionally leave for the fact-finder at trial to resolve. After Horton ran the red light, Trooper Saleh believed Horton's speed was in excess of 100 miles per hour, yet he continued active pursuit at speeds of 80 to 90 miles per hour. Trooper Saleh admitted that he did not believe that his attempt to stop the Toyota was going to be productive. Horton continued to cross the yellow line and weave in and out of traffic, but Trooper Saleh did not terminate his pursuit. The plaintiffs assert this continued pursuit showed a conscious disregard of the danger to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Trooper Saleh had no reason to believe there was any immediate danger that would require him to continue to chase the Toyota. Balancing the fact that Horton was driving a vehicle with an improper license plate against the risk of harm from Horton's reckless speeding through the streets of Topeka once\n   the chase began, a jury could reasonably conclude that Trooper Saleh breached the standard of care in not breaking off his pursuit. Resolving all facts\n   and inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, a reasonable jury could find a breach of the reckless disregard standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The next issue is whether there is evidence that Trooper Saleh's conduct, if proven to have fallen short of the applicable standard of care, caused or contributed to cause the plaintiffs' injuries and damages.

St. Francois County Sheriff Dept.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6901663\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/415/#p418\">\n    449 S.W.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418 (Mo. Ct. App. 2014), reversed the circuit court's summary judgment for the defendant in a police pursuit case, finding the jury could infer causation if the facts support it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The plaintiffs' expert, criminologist Geoffrey Alpert, Ph.D., stated in an affidavit that Trooper Saleh's pursuit became futile once the Toyota ran the stop sign on 20th Street because it was more likely than not that the driver would continue to flee as long as he was being chased. He stated that \"the pursuit should have been terminated between 20th and 21st street and no later than when [Horton] ran the red light at 21st street in an attempt to elude\n   the police.\" Alpert stated that if \"the police [had] terminated their active attempt to apprehend [Horton], it is more likely than not that he would not have crashed into the pick-up driven by [plaintiff Bennett] at 29th.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The defendants assert Alpert's testimony is based on pure speculation, but much of their criticism is based on the weight of the evidence, which is to be considered and resolved by the fact-finder, not us. In order to avoid summary judgment, the opposing party must merely provide evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact, not dispel every other possible scenario that could be drawn from the facts. The dissent would resolve those facts against the nonmoving party at the summary judgment stage. Here, plaintiffs point to evidence creating a genuine issue of material of fact for the jury on the issue of causation. Moreover, the issues regarding Alpert's opinions are a bit of a red herring. Even without Alpert's expert opinion, which may or may not be helpful to the jury in applying its own common sense to the facts, there still remains an issue of fact on the issue of causation for the jury to resolve at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   According to Trooper Saleh's dashboard video camera, about 46 seconds passed from the time Alpert said Trooper Saleh should have terminated pursuit and the time of the crash. Alpert concluded that Trooper Saleh's\n   continued pursuit of Horton was a proximate cause of the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Had this been a case in which the suspect was already driving in a reckless manner or at a high rate of speed when the officer initiated the pursuit, we could hardly infer that such a suspect would mend his ways simply because the pursuing officer ended the chase. But here, Horton was not engaged in any reckless conduct before Trooper Saleh's pursuit began. It was the trooper's pursuit that prompted Horton to accelerate to such a dangerous speed and to ignore traffic signals and a stop sign. Had the pursuit ended before the scene of the crash, Horton would have had no incentive to continue at such a break-neck speed and in such a reckless manner, risking his own life in the process. Whether, in fact, he would have is not for us to say. Our task is to view the evidence in the light favoring the plaintiffs to determine if one could reasonably infer that\n   once the chase ended Horton would have changed his behavior accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The defendants point to the plaintiffs' lack of direct evidence of what Horton saw of the pursuing officer as he sped down Kansas Avenue. But the plaintiffs' claims are not fatally deficient because they lack direct evidence of what Horton saw of the pursuing officer before the accident. They can rely on circumstantial evidence. The defendants would have us view that evidence in the light that supports a conclusion that Horton would not have stopped even if Trooper Saleh broke off his pursuit. But at this stage in the proceedings we view the available circumstantial evidence in the light favoring the plaintiffs, which supports the reasonable inference-yet to be tested at trial-that had Trooper Saleh ended the chase, Horton probably would have slowed down and not collided with the plaintiffs' pickup truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Causation, like any other fact question, may be shown by circumstantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    American Family Mutual Ins.

It is possible, for example, that the Kansas Supreme Court would rule differently on the proximate cause issue if there was evidence that the police acted with recklessness or intent, such as an egregious case where an officer ignored clear danger by deliberately initiating pursuit through a parade, a school crossing zone, or a densely populated area during rush hour. Reckless acts are qualitatively different from negligent or grossly negligent acts (which are merely an extreme variant of carelessness), because reckless acts require an element of deliberateness-'a conscious acceptance of a known, serious risk.'

The video shows how quickly the events transpired, how far behind Horton the trooper quickly became, and how Horton could not have seen the trooper for a significant period of time during the pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that it is reasonable to infer that when Horton's car can be seen on the trooper's video, Horton could also have seen the trooper's car. But that contention assumes that Horton was looking behind him the entire time that he was speeding away. That is an unreasonable inference, given the undisputed facts that Horton was actively fleeing from a law enforcement officer, accelerated and drove approximately 100 mph, sped through a red light, passed another southbound vehicle, and then managed to negotiate turns on a significantly curved street. Those events required Horton to give some attention to the road ahead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The video confirms the district court's findings that immediately after Horton ran the red light at 21st Street, the trooper was such a distance behind Horton that it is questionable whether Horton, who was driving recklessly, could have seen the trooper. The video shows that if the trooper had stopped at 21st Street, Horton, who was blocks ahead of the trooper, could not have known it because of the lay of the land and his distance from the trooper. Although some Kansas roads may be straight and flat, Kansas Avenue between 20th and 29th streets is not, as the district court emphasized in carefully detailing how the distance between Horton and the trooper, the hill at 25th Street and the curvature of the road south of 25th Street would have obscured Horton's view of the trooper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   And nothing in the video suggests that Horton more likely than not would have slowed down by 29th Street even if Horton had known the trooper had stopped his pursuit at 21st Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    The expert report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Dr. Alpert's expert report provides the only possible evidence of causation in this case.

Nothing in the record provides the necessary connection between Dr. Alpert's experience and his conclusions or shows that his testimony otherwise meets the reliability requirements of K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 60-456(b). Thus, if Dr. Alpert's testimony is based on experience, it is unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   A review of Dr. Alpert's report also confirms its unreliability in at least two respects: his stated premise does not support his conclusion, and his report is based on assumptions rather than on facts. First, Dr. Alpert opines that the trooper should have terminated his pursuit \"between 20th and 21st Street and no later than when [Horton] ran the red light at 21st Street\"; had the trooper done so \"it is more likely than not that [Horton] would not have crashed into the pick-up driven by Mr. Bennett at 29th.\" This latter conclusion rests solely on the premise that \"it is more likely than not that\n   drivers of fleeing vehicles will continue to flee as long as they are being chased.\" But that premise does not compel the conclusion Dr. Alpert attributes to it-that premise could just as easily support a conclusion that the trooper should not have stopped his pursuit at all but should have pursued Horton more aggressively, causing Horton to drive faster and thus avoid the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The inverse of the stated premise is the necessary one here, since plaintiffs' theory of causation is that had the trooper stopped his pursuit by 21st Street, Horton would have slowed down and not crashed into plaintiffs' vehicle. To support that conclusion, Dr. Alpert needed to show it is more likely than not that fleeing drivers in Horton's circumstances\n   <em>\n    will slow down\n   </em>\n   once they realize they are no longer being pursued. But that expert opinion was not offered. The premise that fleeing drivers will continue to flee as long as they are being pursued does not logically entail that proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Secondly, Dr. Alpert's report offers no factual basis for its conclusion that \"[h]ad the police terminated their active attempt to apprehend Mr. Horton, it is more likely than not that he would not have crashed into the pick-up driven by Mr. Bennett at 29th.\" Instead, this conclusion rests on two assumptions: that Horton would have immediately known if the trooper had stopped his pursuit by 21st Street, and that because of such knowledge Horton would have slowed down by 29th Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Dr. Alpert's conclusion incorrectly assumes that Horton had an unobstructed view of the trooper during the entire pursuit, opining\n   that the trooper \"inappropriately turned on his spotlight and directed it at the fleeing vehicle,\n   <em>\n    distracting the driver and impeding the driver's ability to see in his mirrors\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Sagely, plaintiffs do not rely on that theory, yet they rely on a theory which assumes the very facts that the district court properly found lacking-that Horton could have seen or heard what the trooper did at all times before the collision, as if the trooper had been immediately behind and fully visible to him the entire time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   To the erroneous assumption that Horton would have somehow known that the trooper had stopped his pursuit, the report adds another unsupported assumption-that Horton would have slowed down by 29th Street. This is nothing more than inference stacking\n   which is insufficient to prove a requisite fact. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Kan.%20854\">\n    306 Kan. 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 859-60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=397%20P.3d%201195\">\n    397 P.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Dr. Alpert's report lacks the type of factual basis normally found in expert reports. It does not, for example, state why, or in what time frame, or in what distance, or under what circumstances fleeing criminals generally slow down after they realize a police pursuit has ended. Nothing in Dr. Alpert's report shows why he thinks Horton would likely have slowed down by 29th Street if he had somehow known that the trooper discontinued his pursuit at 21st Street. Nor does Dr. Alpert attempt to apply his theory to the facts of this case-he fails to explain why a reasonable person in Horton's position, having a suspended license, driving a car with a tag not assigned to it, fleeing from a law enforcement officer, and whose passenger was a runaway minor, would likely have slowed down at any point after the pursuit began. In such cases, causation is merely speculative, as the district court found. See\n   <em>\n    Drouhard-Nordhus\n   </em>\n   , 301 Kan. at 624-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417877\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/618/#p618\">\n    345 P.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding generalized references to be speculative and inadequate to meet plaintiff's causation burden).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    Kansas Highway Patrol Lieutenant's testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiffs allege on appeal that Kansas Highway Patrol Lieutenant Scott Martin's testimony helps establish causation. Martin agreed that \"[o]ne of the reasons for terminating a pursuit is the hope that the vehicle being pursued will then slow down and not create a hazard to vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The district court cannot be faulted for not mentioning this evidence because plaintiffs did not argue it before the district court. Although plaintiffs' brief included part of Martin's deposition in its statement of undisputed facts, their brief did not make any argument referring to or based on this testimony. It is not the district court's duty to make arguments for the parties. \"Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dunkel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1797261\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/927/955/#p956\">\n    927 F.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956 (7th Cir. 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   But including this testimony in the causation analysis makes no difference. Martin's testimony relates only to generalities, was not given in reference to any facts of this case, and conveys solely Martin's \"hope.\" In other words, it expresses mere wishful thinking\n   which adds nothing to the causation analysis. As plaintiffs' expert report acknowledges, Martin \"approved the pursuit as appropriate and within policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    Good old common sense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiffs also appeal to common sense and experience in claiming that Horton would have slowed down had he known that the trooper discontinued his pursuit. But common sense and experience would also suggest that Horton would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have slowed down regardless of what the trooper did because Horton also knew he was driving on a suspended license, in a stolen car (or a car with a stolen tag), with a minor runaway, and had just committed the additional crime of fleeing and eluding. Horton had every incentive to put as much space as possible between him and the law and had no incentive to slow down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <em>\n    Missouri cases demonstrate the lack of causation in typical police pursuit cases\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Several cases from Missouri, which use the same legal framework of proximate cause as we do in Kansas, demonstrate the propriety of granting summary judgment based on lack of causation in typical police pursuit cases such as this one.

Thus, the only conceivable causal link between the officer's alleged negligence and the collision is the conjectural effect of his pursuit on the pursued vehicle.

There is nothing other than speculation to reach a conclusion that the officer's conduct was a 'cause' of the collision.

It found the \" 'only conceivable causal link between [the trooper's] alleged negligence and the collision is the conjectural effect of [the trooper's] pursuit on the pursued vehicle.'
