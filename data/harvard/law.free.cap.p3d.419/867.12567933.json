Barr guilty of two class A felonies. Over 25 years later, in 2016, the juvenile court entered an order sealing Barr's juvenile records of the two felony adjudications. Barr then applied for a concealed pistol license (CPL) through the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office (Sheriff). The Sheriff denied Barr's application based on these felony adjudications. Barr petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandamus to compel the Sheriff to issue him a CPL, and the superior court denied his petition. Because under the juvenile sealing statute sealed adjudications are to be \"treated as if they never occurred,\" Barr is not prohibited from obtaining a CPL and the superior court erroneously denied Barr's writ of mandamus. We, therefore, reverse and remand with instructions to the superior court to issue the writ. We also grant Barr's request for attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 This case requires us to analyze the juvenile sealing statute. In the 19th century, Washington established a separate court division dedicated to juvenile issues with the intention of protecting the interests of juveniles, rather than prosecuting juveniles in the same manner as adult defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 1905, ch. 18, \u00a7 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout the years, the legislature has expanded the juvenile court system reflecting national changes regarding the treatment of juvenile offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Though the JJA affirmed that juvenile proceeding records and court files were public records, the legislature also created a mechanism for juvenile offenders to have their records sealed or destroyed.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sess., ch. 155, \u00a7 9(11); (16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   By establishing a method to seal juvenile records, the legislature reiterated its desire to treat juvenile records more confidentially than other court records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.J.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792920\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/408/#p422\">\n    183 Wash.2d at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20P.3d%20749\">\n    352 P.3d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The juvenile sealing and destruction provisions underwent more changes in 1997. At that time, the legislature amended the sealing and destruction statutes and made the sealing and expungement process more difficult by imposing additional requirements and conditions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

LAWS OF 2014, ch. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislature mandated that the juvenile courts, instead of juveniles, must initiate the sealing of juvenile court records after a certain amount of time and after the juvenile offender met certain conditions. LAWS OF 2014, ch. 175, \u00a7 4. The legislature also clearly stated its intent regarding the protection of juvenile records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It is the policy of the state of Washington that the interest in juvenile rehabilitation and reintegration constitutes compelling circumstances that outweigh the public interest in continued availability of juvenile court records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   LAWS OF 2014, ch. 175, \u00a7 1.

LAWS OF 2014, ch. 175, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 More recently, the Supreme Court commented on the court's role in applying the juvenile sealing statutes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The legislature has always treated juvenile court records as distinctive and as deserving of more confidentiality than other types of records[,] and [Washington] court[s] ha[ve] always given effect to the legislature's judgment in the unique setting of juvenile court records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    S.J.C\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792920\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/408/#p422\">\n    183 Wash.2d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20P.3d%20749\">\n    352 P.3d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. BARR'S RECORD SEALING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b68 In 1992, the King County Juvenile Court adjudicated Barr guilty of two class A felonies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2016, Barr petitioned the juvenile court to seal his two juvenile class A felony adjudications. Barr had not committed a crime during the 16 years prior to requesting his records be sealed, and he had maintained law abiding behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b69 Determining that Barr met all the statutory prerequisites, the juvenile court granted his petition and entered orders sealing Barr's adjudications under RCW 13.50.260, the juvenile records sealing statute. The orders sealed Barr's official juvenile court record, social file, and related agency records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The orders cited RCW 13.50.260 which stated that \"the proceedings in the case shall be treated as if they never occurred, and the subject of the records may reply accordingly to any inquiry about the events, the records of which are sealed.\" The orders also notified Barr that any charging of an adult felony would nullify the sealing order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 Soon after it entered Barr's orders sealing his records, the court entered an order stating that under RCW 9.41.040(4)(a)(ii), Barr qualified for the restoration of his firearm rights because Barr complied with the terms of his sentences, spent five years in the community without being convicted of a crime, and because Barr \"had no prior felony convictions.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 In 2017, Barr applied for a CPL through the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff denied Barr's application listing his two juvenile class A felony adjudications as the basis for the denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 Barr then filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court seeking a writ of mandamus under RCW 9.41.0975.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Barr requested the court to grant his writ and to direct the Sheriff to issue him a CPL. Barr argued that the Sheriff had an affirmative duty to issue a CPL to every applicant unless the applicant was ineligible to possess a firearm under state law or federal law. Specifically, Barr argued that his sealed juvenile adjudications did not exist because under RCW 13.50.260(6)(a), sealed adjudications \"shall be treated as if they never occurred,\" and, therefore, he was not prohibited from possession of a firearm under RCW 9.41.040(4), Washington's possession of a firearm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Barr further argued that he was likewise not prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law. He asserted that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ((20), the federal firearm statute, federal law looks to the jurisdiction of conviction to determine whether an offense is a \"conviction\" for purposes of federal firearm law. CP at 33. Barr claimed that because his Washington adjudications were sealed, he did not have a prohibitory conviction under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 The superior court denied Barr's petition for a writ of mandamus. Barr appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I. WRIT OF MANDAMUS IMPROPERLY DENIED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Barr argues that the superior court improperly denied his petition for a writ of mandamus. Barr claims that the Sheriff breached its duty to issue him a CPL because his sealed adjudications are treated as if they never occurred under the juvenile sealing statute and do not prohibit him from possessing a firearm. The Sheriff argues that sealing does not \"restore\" Barr's firearm rights because he is ineligible to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040 and that state and federal cases to the contrary are mistaken. We agree with Barr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Principles: Writs of Mandamus, Juvenile Records, CPLs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Writs of Mandamus\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 A court may issue a writ of mandamus, \"to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person, to compel the performance of an act which the law especially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station.\" RCW 7.16.160. Additionally, RCW 9.41.0975(2)(a) specifically authorizes a petition for a writ of mandamus requesting that the court direct \"an issuing agency to issue a concealed pistol license or alien firearm license wrongfully refused.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 An applicant must satisfy three elements before a writ will issue: (1) the party subject to the writ is under a clear duty to act; (2) the applicant has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; and (3) the applicant is beneficially interested.\n   <em>\n    Eugster v.

This dispute involves only the first element-\n   whether the Sheriff had a clear duty to issue Barr a CPL. To determine whether the Sheriff had a clear duty to act, we must look to the statutes governing sealing juvenile records and issuance of CPLs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Sealing Juvenile Records\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b618 The juvenile record sealing statute provides that once a convicted person meets certain criteria,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   a person can petition the court to \"order the sealing of the official juvenile court record, the social file, and records of the court and of any other agency in the case.\" RCW 13.50.260(3).

This is a distinction without a difference. The\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   decision did not turn on the felony class, and the sealing statute does not differentiate between felony classes. The dispositive component of the sealing statute here is the phrase \"the proceedings in the case shall be treated as if they never occurred.\" The court in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   based its decision on this language and explained, \"If the proceedings never occurred, logically the end result-a conviction-never occurred either.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1422737\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/120/470/#p480\">\n    120 Wash.

The Sheriff is correct that the legislature has amended the sealing statute since\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   . In fact, the legislature has amended the RCW 13.50.260 eight times since\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also true that some of the amendments allow greater access to the sealed information by law enforcement, juvenile justice agencies, and the courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 2014, ch. 175, \u00a7 3; RCW 13.50.260(8)(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 2015 ch. 265, \u00a7 3; RCW 13.50.260(8)(d).

For example, the legislature took action after\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    R.P.H.\n   </em>\n   held that, the termination of a juvenile offender's obligation to register as a sex offender entitled him to receive a certificate of rehabilitation, which allowed the offender to have his firearm rights restored.\n   <em>\n    R.P.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4020281\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/173/199/\">\n    173 Wash.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=265%20P.3d%20890\">\n    265 P.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to the court's decision, the legislature explicitly added a provision to the juvenile sex offender statute stating that \"[i]f a person is relieved of the duty to register [...] the relief of registration does not constitute a certificate of rehabilitation, or the equivalent of a certificate of rehabilitation, for the purposes of restoration of firearm possession under RCW 9.41.040.\" LAWS OF 2015 ch. 261, \u00a7 9(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b635 Unlike\n   <em>\n    R.P.H\n   </em>\n   ., there has been no legislative amendment after\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   regarding the treatment of a prior juvenile's sealed felony adjudications for purposes of firearm possession. The amendments allowing greater access to sealed records do not evince an intent to modify the language of\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the legislature has clearly acquiesced to the court's interpretation of the sealing statute's mandate that sealed felony adjudications are \"treated as if they never occurred\" and are not prohibitions to possessing a firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b636 The Sheriff asserts that in 2014 and 2015, the legislature amended former RCW 13.50.260(8) (2011) to allow criminal justice agencies expanded access to sealed juvenile information. The Sheriff further claims that because the sealed records appear in a Washington State Patrol database, the records cannot be treated as if they never occurred. The Sheriff asserts that this expanded access therefore means that sealed convictions are nonexistent for certain purposes but not all. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b637 Although the legislature amended RCW 13.50.260(8) to provide some agencies and law enforcement access to sealed juveniles records, the amended statute does not specifically allow those agencies to use the records to prohibit a person from obtaining a firearm. The relevant portions of RCW 13.50.260(8) state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (8)(a) Any adjudication of a juvenile offense or a crime subsequent to sealing has the effect of nullifying a sealing order; however, the court may order the juvenile court record resealed upon disposition of the subsequent matter if the case meets the sealing criteria under this section and\n   the court record has not previously been resealed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (b) Any charging of an adult felony subsequent to the sealing has the effect of nullifying the sealing order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (c) The administrative office of the courts shall ensure that the superior court judicial information system provides prosecutors access to information on the existence of sealed juvenile records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (d) The Washington state patrol shall ensure that the Washington state identification system provides criminal justice agencies access to sealed juvenile records information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b638 The Washington State Patrol must guarantee access to sealed records to criminal justice agencies, and the courts must ensure prosecutors have access to the information. However, these statutes do not authorize criminal justice agencies to treat these adjudications in a manner contrary to 13.50.260(6)(a), which requires them to treat the adjudications \"as if they never occurred.\" The Sheriff does not cite to any authority showing that the Sheriff or other agencies can do anything more with the records besides access them. It does not follow that simply having access to records allows an agency to use those records to deny a CPL application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b639 The Sheriff essentially argues that because it has access to the sealed records, RCW 13.50.260 allows sealed records to be treated as if they never occurred for\n   <em>\n    certain\n   </em>\n   purposes, but not all purposes, such as for seeking a CPL. However, the statute simply states that once sealed, the proceedings shall be treated as if they never occurred. The Sheriff's reading impermissibly adds words and concepts to the statute that simply are not there. Because of the legislature's acquiescence and without clear indication from the legislature demanding otherwise, we will continue to follow\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   and the language of the sealing statute. Accordingly, sealed juvenile records shall be treated as if they never occurred, regardless of any agency access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Our Interpretation Does Not Conflict with Statutory Language or Construction Tenets\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b640 The Sheriff argues that the plain language of RCW 9.41.040 and RCW 13.50.260 compels the conclusion that Barr is unable to restore his firearm rights. The Sheriff also argues that Barr's reading of the statutes violates the \"general-specific rule\" of statutory construction.

Here, the Sheriff correctly points out that if an individual who has a sealed juvenile adjudication is ever adjudicated as a juvenile or charged with a new felony, the sealed file is automatically unsealed under RCW 13.50.260(8). The Sheriff argues that this requirement complicates the process of revoking and restoring firearm rights and creates a problem of who must provide notice of revocation of firearm rights to people whose adjudications become unsealed. However, RCW 9.41.047(1)(a) requires that a defendant be notified of his or her ineligibility to possess\n   a firearm only upon certain conditions, none of which are present here. Barr has already been notified of his ineligibility to possess firearms based on the adjudications that were sealed. Moreover, the order sealing his juvenile records notified him that the order would be nullified if he were charged with a felony. It would not be absurd or unfair if the unsealing of these adjudications again rendered him ineligible to possess a firearm or a CPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    RCW 9.41.040's Restoration Provision Does Not Control\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b651 The Sheriff argues that sealing does not restore firearm rights because RCW 9.41.040 provides the exclusive mechanism for restoring firearm rights.

Barr received orders sealing his class A juvenile adjudications and, therefore, has no conviction that prohibits him from possessing a firearm under RCW 9.41.040. He is likewise not prohibited from receiving a CPL under state law. Because we consider Barr as having no conviction, his rights are not \"restored\" nor do they need restoring. Accordingly, RCW 9.41.040's restoration provision does not control here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b653 For the above reasons, the Sheriff's arguments in support of the court's denial of Barr's writ of mandamus and the Sheriff's ultimate denial of Barr's CPL license fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Possession allowed under Federal law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b654 Finally, Barr argues that because he is not prohibited from possessing a firearm under Washington law, he is also not prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law.

It would be unnecessary in this case to address whether sealing in Washington equates to a set aside or expungement.

But a careful review of these cases reveals that the courts analyzed each on a case-by-case basis, examining how the law of each state affects federal firearm rights. Moreover, both of these cases are distinguishable because they involve plaintiffs who sought firearm rights after being convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and because the rights of individuals who were previously convicted of domestic violence convictions are examined under a different statute than the one examined in\n   <em>\n    Siperek\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b660 Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   court held that a state law purporting to expunge a person's conviction did not remove all effects of the conviction and therefore the person could not obtain a firearm under federal law.\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066487\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/894/#p900\">\n    511 F.3d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because of this affirmative disclosure obligation, the court held that the state statute did not expunge or eliminate the conviction, and therefore, the convicted person was prohibited from possessing firearms under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(9).\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066487\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/894/#p900\">\n    511 F.3d at 899, 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b661 Here, even under\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the Washington sealing statute would allow Barr access to firearms under federal law.

Unlike the state statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the sealing statute here relieves the person receiving the sealing order from the obligation to disclose the adjudication in response to \"any inquiry.\" Unlike the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , Washington's sealing statute treats the adjudication as not existing, and therefore, no affirmative duty to disclose the adjudication in response to a question exists. Therefore, the Sheriff's argument that the cited federal court cases apply to ban Barr's ability to possess a firearm under federal law, fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b662 Because Barr received orders sealing his class A felony juvenile adjudications under Washington law and because Washington law requires that his adjudications be treated as if they never occurred, Barr is not prohibited from possessing firearms under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b663 As noted above, the only writ of mandamus element at issue here is whether the Sheriff had a clear duty to act.
