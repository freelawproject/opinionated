Elliott, District Judge, sentenced Appellant in accordance with the jury's verdicts and ordered the sentences for Counts 2 and 5 to run concurrently and the sentence for Count 6 to run consecutively to the sentences on Counts 2 and 5 and consecutive to Appellant's sentences in Case Nos. CF-2009-7147, CF-2010-4451 and CF-2012-7211. Judge Elliott ordered credit for time served and also ordered post-imprisonment supervision of not less than nine (9) months, nor more than one (1) year. Lamar now appeals, raising nine propositions of error. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 On October 24, 2012, Appellant, Britnie Wiggins and Donnie Parton\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   were driving around south Oklahoma City looking for a way to come up with some fast cash. Wiggins was particularly desperate for cash. Her rent was due and, by her own admission, she \"was\n   tired and ... didn't want to go work.\" Wiggins and the others were also high on methamphetamine. To score some cash, Wiggins suggested the trio \"hit a lick\" meaning they \"go rob somebody\". After some deliberation, Parton suggested they rob his grandmother, Debbie Parton. Within five minutes, Appellant drove the trio to Debbie's\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   south Oklahoma City residence where they parked and kicked-in the front door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Debbie lived in her home with Chase Parton, her son, and Chase's girlfriend, Chelsea Alexander. Around 11 p.m. on October 24th, Debbie was falling asleep on the couch in the den when she heard three loud bangs followed by the appearance in her home of a man wearing sunglasses and several bandanas covering his neck and face. This man walked to the back of the house towards Chase's bedroom. When Debbie got up to investigate, she found her front door kicked in. She also discovered two other intruders-Appellant and Wiggins-standing inside her home. Appellant had a handgun with a red laser sight and was smoking a Black and Mild cigar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Chase was walking towards the front door when the intruders kicked it open and came inside. Wiggins forced Chase into the bathroom and unsuccessfully attempted to handcuff him. In the back bedroom, Donnie Parton told Chelsea Alexander-Chase's girlfriend-to get down on the ground. A few minutes later, Debbie, Chase and Chelsea were seated around the dining room table by their attackers and held at gunpoint by Appellant. Parton and Wiggins ransacked the entire house and stole the victims' valuables. This included two televisions, Debbie and Chelsea's purses, Debbie's jewelry, the house phone, food from the kitchen and Chase's game console.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Appellant chatted with his hostages as their home was ransacked. Appellant sarcastically asked the victims how their day was going and mentioned he was a gang member. At one point, Appellant pointed the gun at Chase and forced him to help move a television. Appellant also forced Debbie to hand over the keys to her 93 Ford Mustang which was parked in the garage. When Debbie tried to remove her house key from the key ring, Wiggins slapped her in the ear causing it to bleed. Appellant told his captives that he wanted drugs and money; Debbie replied that they did not have any drugs or money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 After searching the house, Appellant told the victims not to call the police or he would come back and \"get us\". Appellant and his two accomplices then left not only with the victims' property from inside the house but also Debbie's Ford Mustang. Despite Appellant's threat, Debbie walked across the street to a neighbor's house and called 911. The police arrived soon thereafter and Debbie, Chase and Chelsea gave statements about what happened. A crime scene investigator recovered a partially smoked cigar tip found near the front door and submitted it for forensic examination. Police also found a pair of handcuffs on the dining room table. Several days later, police showed the victims a photo lineup during which Chase and Chelsea identified Appellant, who was pictured in one of the photographs, as the black robber with the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 On November 1, 2012, Wiggins gave a statement to police in which she implicated herself, Appellant and Donnie Parton in the robbery at Debbie Parton's house. That same day, police executed a search warrant at a south Oklahoma City apartment Wiggins shared with Appellant. The police found inside the apartment,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a Discover credit card in Chelsea Alexander's name. Chelsea's credit card was inside the purse stolen from her during the October 24th robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Detective Eddie Dyer later obtained a search warrant authorizing the collection of Appellant's DNA using buccal swabs of the inside of Appellant's cheek. Campbell Ruddick, the DNA manager for the OCPD Forensic Laboratory, conducted DNA testing of both the cigar tip recovered from the crime scene and Appellant's known biological sample on the buccal swabs. Ruddick developed DNA profiles from both items. Ruddick's\n   comparison of these profiles revealed that the DNA found on the cigar tip matched Appellant's known DNA profile. The probability of selecting an unrelated person at random from the population having this same genetic profile was one in 67.16 quintillion Caucasians, one in 13.9 quintillion African Americans and one in 2.3286 sextillion Southwest Hispanics. A quintillion has 21 zeroes behind it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 In his first proposition of error, Appellant complains that he was denied the right to represent himself at trial. The record shows that on March 19, 2014, Appellant filed with the trial court a one-page handwritten motion requesting to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in the case. Appellant requested six (6) months in which to prepare for trial along with production of full discovery for his case. Appellant acknowledged he would be held to the same responsibilities as counsel but believed this was the only way to \"assure that there is not a miscarriage of justice of [sic] this matter.\" Appellant concluded his motion with a request for a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Judge Donald L. Deason was originally assigned to this case and held three separate pre-trial hearings on Appellant's motion. At the first hearing, Appellant stated that he wanted to go\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   because the appointed public defender was ineffective, \"not doing his job\" and \"not really trying to help me, I feel.\" Appellant explained that defense counsel waited eighteen (18) or twenty (20) months before talking to him about the case. Appellant stated that he believed he could do a better job than counsel in handling the case. Judge Deason denied Appellant's motion after asking Appellant basic questions about trial procedure which Appellant could not answer. Appellant offered, however, that his ignorance of the law was the reason he asked for six months in which to prepare for trial. Judge Deason found that Appellant \"[did not] have even the most basic knowledge to represent [himself]\" and that Appellant was \"in way over your head on this.\" A trial date was set for August 25, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 On August 22, 2014, a call docket was held during which the prosecutor expressed his understanding that Appellant was withdrawing his previous request to go\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and instead wished to proceed to trial with his appointed counsel. When Judge Deason asked Appellant if this was correct, Appellant stated that he previously raised the issue and it had been ruled on by the Court. When asked by Judge Deason whether Appellant wished to proceed to trial with his attorney, Appellant responded \"Yeah. Due to the fact that I was denied, yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 The prosecutor expressed his view that additional questioning was necessary to address this issue and \"if he wants to proceed with his appointed attorney ... he needs to make that without any conditions of any previous ruling.\" The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: I did that earlier, the first time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: I've addressed that earlier, and I found that though he, like anybody else, has a right to represent himself, Mr. Lamar does not have even the most basic legal knowledge that would help him get through a jury trial. He doesn't even know how to start it, what to do during a trial. With what he's looking at on these charges, I, in good conscience-And I've made my ruling on that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   So, Mr. Lamar, just a straight-up question: Do you desire to proceed with your counsel at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: (No answer).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: Yes or no?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: (No answer).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: It's not a trick question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: Well, I think your ruling that I was denied, and you're standing by that, then I guess I'll proceed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: I'd like for you to answer my question. Do you desire to proceed with your counsel, yes or no?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: I'm not going to answer that question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: I can't hear you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: I'm not going to answer that question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (8/22/2014 Tr. 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 14 Appellant persisted in this manner despite Judge Deason urging him to reconsider and answer the question. Defense counsel stated, in response to the court's subsequent questions, that Appellant had been cooperative with him and had been participating in preparing a defense. Judge Deason stated that Appellant's refusal to answer the court's questions was yet another reason, in addition to his lack of legal knowledge, why Appellant should not be representing himself at trial. The prosecutor asked for leave to present additional research on the issue which the trial court agreed to hear and then moved on to other matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 15 The prosecutor and defense counsel also engaged Appellant and attempted to get a straight answer concerning his wishes to proceed to trial\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   but to no avail; Appellant would not answer the question. Defense counsel inquired of Judge Deason whether the court would grant a continuance should Appellant choose to represent himself. This prompted the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: If Mr. Lamar told me clearly and unequivocally that he wants to represent himself, if I give him the appropriate warnings as to what the pit falls of that are and knowing those pitfalls and understanding that he still wished to represent himself, I would certainly entertain a motion for continuance to prepare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: I'm pretty sure you would, now. Since this situation came up, I'm pretty sure I can. I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be a problem as of now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don't understand your response, Mr. Lamar. Are you saying you do want to represent yourself, with that in mind, or what are you saying?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   DEFENDANT LAMAR: I'm saying that if you're ready to go to trial, I'm ready to go to trial. Trial's set for Monday. There's nothing else. Your clarification is not going to be granted on my end, if that's what you're asking. Not now, not tomorrow, not ever. So whatever you guys are going to do go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (8/22/2014 Tr. 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 16 Judge Deason stated that he would not proceed to trial with the case as scheduled unless Appellant \"affirmatively state[d] on the record that he's willing to accept the assistance of counsel\" and that if Appellant kept giving equivocal answers, the case would not go to trial on Monday. Appellant again refused to answer. Instead, Appellant said he was \"ready for trial Monday, sir\" and he \"can't answer that question.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 17 On September 5, 2014, another hearing was held on the matter. Judge Deason began the hearing by noting he had signed an order vacating his previous order denying Appellant's motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Judge Deason told Appellant he \"now ... can represent yourself if you want, or if you're willing to accept, of your own free will, appointed counsel, then we'll be ready to proceed.\" When Judge Deason asked what Appellant's decision was, Appellant stated he \"[s]till haven't [sic] changed. I'm not speaking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 18 Judge Deason clarified for defense counsel that he considered Appellant's original motion to go\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \"to still be pending\" in light of the court's latest order. Appellant refused to answer the trial court's questions, instead falling back to his familiar refrain that the motion had already been denied and he, Appellant, wasn't saying anymore. At one point, Appellant stated that the trial court's handling of the matter\n   <strong>\n    \"will just have to be in one of my propositions, wouldn't it?\"\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added). Appellant then stated he was not going to say anything more. Judge Deason, in turn, granted Appellant's motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Judge Deason at that time also appointed the assigned public defender as standby counsel to \"provide assistance to [Appellant] if he needs it, if he needs legal research done, and to just be in the courtroom.\" Judge Deason clarified that the public defender was to sit at counsel table with Appellant during the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 19 On October 3, 2014, Appellant's case was reassigned to Judge Ray Elliott after Judge Deason signed a transfer order. During an October 15, 2014, pre-trial conference, defense counsel stated that Judge Deason\n   had recused from the case based on a motion filed by Appellant claiming Judge Deason \"forced\" Appellant to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . During that hearing, Appellant told Judge Elliott that he \"wished to proceed with counsel\" and requested a continuance of the trial setting so he and defense counsel could \"get to being on the same page.\" Judge Elliott granted the continuance after confirming a second time that Appellant wanted to proceed with counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 20 Judge Elliott granted defense counsel's request to set the case for pre-trial conference so counsel and Appellant \"had time to discuss his cases\" and to thereafter set a trial date. Judge Elliott stated he would probably end up setting the case for trial sometime in January or February 2015. Over the next seventeen (17) months, Appellant's case remained in pre-trial status. During this period, defense counsel signed and filed various pre-trial motions and pleadings on Appellant's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 21 On March 18, 2016, Appellant's case was called for jury trial. According to the docket entry for this hearing (there is no transcript), Appellant appeared with defense counsel and announced ready for trial. The State also announced ready for trial. Judge Elliott ordered both parties to return on March 21st at 9 a.m. to commence jury selection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 22 The parties returned as ordered to commence trial with both defense counsel and the prosecutor announcing ready for trial. Appellant, however, took a different approach, immediately asking to represent himself at trial under\n   <em>\n    Faretta v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    422 U.S. 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    45 L.Ed. 2d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). Appellant explained that he decided the night before to go\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and that he wanted a continuance-\"a brief time\" as he put it-in order \"to get all of my motions and hire my private investigator.\" Judge Elliott responded this was the sixth jury trial setting in the case. Judge Elliott observed too that it was \"a little interesting\" that Appellant, \"literally the evening before the matter is set for trial in which both sides were notified that they were first up in this courtroom, that [Appellant] now has made this request of the Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 23 Judge Elliot asked Appellant why he decided the night before to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Appellant stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Well, your Honor, it's been a couple of, I think, errors that have been made that haven't been addressed appropriately. And throughout the three years, this is the first time that I had a confident decisions [sic] that my attorney has been making. And at the last, I think it was in your courtroom where we addressed it, and I thought that me and [defense counsel] was on the same page, but apparently it seems otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Anything else?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Not that I can think of at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Tr. I 4-5). The prosecutor told Judge Elliott that Appellant was serving a 30 year sentence in one case and a 10 year sentence in another. Defense counsel declined to add anything to the conversation. Judge Elliott then made the following ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: * * * * We can't continue matters forever because of the multiple cases that Mr. Lamar has pending and apparently is continuing to pick up new cases in the county jail during his time that he's waiting in the county jail to dispose of these matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   And in light of the fact that he is a Department of Corrections inmate, and in light of the fact that he's waited until literally the evening before by his own statements, that being March the 20th, to decide to make this decision, it appears to the Court this is a maneuver done to delay the process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   These matters need to be resolved. [Defense counsel] is a very good lawyer, very knowledgeable lawyer. He's appeared in front of this Court numerous times through the years. I have found him continually to be prepared and have the ability to present the relevant issues that need to be presented to the Court each and every time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   So in light of the fact that this decision was made last evening and just conveyed to this Court, literally at 9:30 on the morning of trial-the matter is set for trial, coupled with the fact that [defense counsel] has\n   announced ready for trial, the defendant's request will be denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   I have a jury out in the hallway ready to proceed. And at some point these decisions, I believe, have to be made before 9:30 on trial morning. Otherwise, it certainly appears to be nothing more than a delaying tactic, which this Court will make the decision to move forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (Tr. I 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 24 After hearing two pre-trial motions filed by defense counsel, Judge Elliott briefly returned to the issue of Appellant's request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Judge Elliott asked whether Appellant was ready for trial if the motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   was granted. Appellant responded that he was not ready for trial and would be asking for a continuance due to his unpreparedness. In response, Judge Elliott announced that he had reconsidered his initial ruling and would allow Appellant to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . However, there would be no continuances and \"[i]f you're not ready to go today and you don't want to go\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   today, then [defense counsel] is your lawyer.\" Appellant then resorted to a familiar refrain, one he used previously with Judge Deason, namely, to challenge Judge Elliott's authority to reconsider his previous ruling. Judge Elliott explained that he was reconsidering his previous ruling and would grant the motion to go\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   so long as Appellant understood that \"the trial is today.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 25 Judge Elliott pressed Appellant numerous times to answer whether he wanted to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   or proceed with counsel for trial that day. Appellant responded simply that he had nothing else to say, that he \"already answered that question\" and that Judge Elliott had already denied the motion. Judge Elliott repeatedly instructed Appellant to stand when he addressed the Court but Appellant persisted in refusing to comply even with this request. Judge Elliott told Appellant that the trial was proceeding and that if he, Appellant, did not answer the court's question, it would be the functional equivalent of withdrawing his motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Judge Elliott then asked Appellant if he wanted to be tried in absentia in light of his failure to cooperate with the court. When Appellant refused to answer, Judge Elliott gave defense counsel an opportunity to consult with his client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 26 After a pause in the proceedings, defense counsel reported to Judge Elliott that he advised Appellant it was not in his best interest to be tried in abstentia and that Appellant should do his best to answer the court's questions. Defense counsel also stated that Appellant had expressed his desire to return upstairs to the lockup. The prosecutor confirmed that he also heard Appellant say \"I'm ready to go upstairs.\" Judge Elliott stressed again that the trial was going to proceed as scheduled, that Appellant could proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   or with defense counsel who was fully prepared and ready for trial. Judge Elliott again asked Appellant what he wanted to do and gave Appellant a moment to think about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 27 After a nine-and-a-half (9.5) minute pause in the proceedings, the following record ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Since you asked Mr. Lamar the question and I have tried to speak to Mr. Lamar and again advised him, that it's not in his best interest to have this case tried in absentia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   I tried to explain what was going on today, that you have reconsidered your motion. That at least in our legal opinion, that any error that might have been created has been corrected and that Mr. Lamar has been given the opportunity to represent himself today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   After speaking with Mr. Lamar, he's told us that he is done with the conversation. He no longer wishes to speak to us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE COURT: No longer wishes to speak to you, too?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. All right. Mr. Lamar, it's now been 12 minutes. I will ask you one last time, do you wish to proceed at this time\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   or proceed at this time with an attorney?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   All right. He's refusing again to answer. He'll proceed with an attorney. Bring the jury in. We're going to proceed right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (Tr. I 20-21). At this point, the prospective jurors were summoned to the courtroom and\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 28 On appeal, Appellant complains that he had a right to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and, in representing himself, had \"the right to be prepared.\" Aplt. Br. at 16. Citing\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1980%20OK%20CR%2075\">\n    1980 OK CR 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10445242\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/617/243/\">\n    617 P.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Appellant says his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   was not untimely and thus he was entitled to a continuance to facilitate his preparation for trial.
