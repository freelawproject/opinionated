We reverse and remand, addressing the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err by refusing to give lesser-included offense instructions for DUI and DUI per se?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In the evening of August 1, 2015, Deputy Joyce of the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff's Office was patrolling in the area of Canyon Ferry Lake. While at Chinaman's Campground, Deputy Joyce observed Freiburg, driving a green minivan, spinning his tires while accelerating out of a parking spot. Joyce then observed Freiburg drive through the campground, stop, and then accelerate quickly again. Joyce initiated a traffic stop of the van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 During the stop, Deputy Joyce smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Freiburg's breath, and observed that Freiburg's eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Joyce had Freiburg undertake field sobriety tests, which indicated that Freiburg was impaired, though Freiburg stated he had poor balance. Freiburg agreed to take a preliminary breath test, which indicated a .230 blood-alcohol content. During the stop, Freiburg admitted to drinking three or four \"tall boy\" beers. Freiburg initially agreed to provide a blood sample, but once at the hospital, refused. Because Freiburg had a prior DUI conviction, Joyce obtained a search warrant to obtain a blood sample, which indicated a .199 blood-alcohol content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In Freiburg's vehicle were his three children, all under the age of 14, Nichol Goodman, an adult woman, and Goodman's five-year-old daughter. Freiburg's thirteen-year-old son appeared to be intoxicated and became so upset during the stop that officers had to restrain him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The State initially charged Freiburg with Child Endangerment by DUI, a felony under \u00a7 45-5-628(1)(e), MCA (2013), and driving while suspended and failure to have proof of insurance, misdemeanors. The State later moved to dismiss the misdemeanor charges and to add an alternative count of felony Child Endangerment by driving a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more (\"DUI\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   \"). The State also filed a notice of Persistent Felony Offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 At trial, Freiburg challenged the DUI charges, arguing that the field sobriety tests were flawed, and that the blood test did not accurately capture his blood-alcohol content at the time he was driving, because it was administered many hours later. Freiburg's defense also challenged the Child Endangerment charge, positing that there was no danger to the children in the car, based upon testimony from Officer Joyce that Freiburg was cooperative and did not exhibit any signs of unsafe driving other than his accelerated starts on the gravel, and Goodman's testimony that there was nothing about Freiburg's driving that indicated he was impaired or that gave her any fear for the safety of the children in the vehicle. Freiburg argued in both opening and closing that he did not cause substantial risk to the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 While setting jury instructions, Freiburg requested instructions on DUI and DUI\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   as lesser-included offenses of the respective Child Endangerment charges, prompting an extensive debate between the parties and an extensive analysis by the District Court. The State argued that lesser-included instructions were improper because the defendant's theory-which attacked both the underlying DUI charges and the risk of serious bodily injury under the greater endangerment charge-would, if believed by\n   the jury, require an outright acquittal, not a conviction for the lesser-included offense. Freiburg responded that while he attacked the DUI, he also presented evidence that he had not caused substantial risk to the children in the car, and thus the jury could convict him of DUI or DUI\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   while acquitting him of Child Endangerment. The District Court ultimately declined to give the lesser-included offense instructions, reasoning that because Freiburg challenged the underlying DUI, his defense would result in an acquittal on both the greater and included charges, though noting, \"[i]t may be that we're going to have some case at some point that's going to be State versus Freiburg that will clear up some of these elements, but that's my conclusion on the case law that's been presented to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The jury found Freiburg guilty of Child Endangerment by DUI. Citing Freiburg's Persistent Felony Offender status, the District Court expressed an intention to sentence Freiburg to fifteen years with five years suspended, but at Freiburg's request, the District Court sentenced him to fifteen years with no time suspended. Freiburg filed a motion for a new trial, again challenging the District Court's failure to give lesser-included offense instructions, which the District Court denied, reasoning that \"at least one of Freiburg's defenses, if accepted by the jury, would lead to an acquittal and therefore Freiburg was not entitled to instructions on lesser-included offenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Freiburg appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 We review a district court's refusal to give a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This position fails to account for the requisite mental states and renders the crime an absolute liability offense upon proof of a DUI offense and the presence of children under 14 years of age in the vehicle. To the contrary, the language of the statute requires that a person \"purposely, knowingly, or negligently cause[ ] substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\" to such children, which are additional elements that must be proven. The State observes that it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a person could drive impaired without creating a substantial risk of harm to child passengers, and this may well be true as a practical matter, but the language of the statute accommodates such a possibility, and thus permits a defendant to defend on that ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perhaps most illustrative of this point, DUI\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   is an absolute liability offense that criminalizes the driving of a vehicle with a blood-alcohol content of 0.08 or more, but requires no proof that the person was actually operating the vehicle with a diminished capacity, or in an otherwise unsafe manner. The Child Endangerment statute additionally requires proof of a mental state and the causing of substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to a child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 The State also argues under the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   test that Freiburg's theory, if believed, would have resulted in acquittal. The State notes that, because Freiburg attacked the validity of the underlying DUI and DUI\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   charges, had the jury accepted his theory, they would have acquitted him of both the greater and lesser-included offenses. Thus, pursuant to the oft-cited principle that \"a lesser included offense instruction is not supported by the evidence where the defendant's evidence or theory, if believed, would require an acquittal,\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5381512\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/291/306/\">\n    1998 MT 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5381512\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/291/306/\">\n    291 Mont. 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5381512\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/291/306/\">\n    968 P.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted), the State argues Freiburg was not entitled to lesser-included instructions. The District Court adopted this reasoning in its denial of Freiburg's motion for new trial, concluding that \"at least one of Freiburg's defenses, if accepted by the jury, would lead to [complete] acquittal and therefore Freiburg was not entitled to instruction on lesser included offenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 After the trial was conducted in this case, we decided\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , wherein we held the District Court erred by denying the Defendant's request for a lesser-included instruction where he had offered alternative theories, supported by evidence, one of which would warrant a finding that he was guilty of the lesser offense, but not guilty of the greater offense.\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. There, the charges of felony aggravated burglary and misdemeanor criminal mischief, arising out of a fight that started on a house porch and continued into the house when the participants fell through the front door, were tried to the jury. On the felony, the Defendant requested a lesser-included offense instruction for misdemeanor assault, which was the \"other offense\" the State had alleged was the predicate for the aggravated burglary charge. The Defendant argued that, for purposes of the assault allegation, he was not the aggressor in the fight, but had acted in self defense. Then, for purposes of the burglary allegation, Defendant argued he had not knowingly entered the premises.\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. We reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Daniels's proposed [lesser-included] instruction on assault would have given the jury an alternative to convicting him of aggravated burglary if it did not believe that Daniels justifiably used force against Loney but if it did believe that he inadvertently fell through Loney's apartment door.\n   <em>\n    His claim of self-defense did not bar him from proposing this instruction on assault, and he did not adopt an \"all-or-nothing\" approach\n   </em>\n   ....\n   <em>\n    Instead, he offered alternative theories as to why the jury should acquit him of aggravated burglary\n   </em>\n   -that he did not knowingly enter Loney's apartment and that he fought with Loney in self-defense. The evidence could have supported the jury in finding that Daniels knocked on Loney's apartment door, that Loney exited the apartment, and that the two fell through the apartment door while they were fighting-i.e., that Daniels did not \"knowingly\" enter or remain unlawfully in Loney's apartment. Section 45-6-204(2), MCA. At the same time, the jury also could have chosen not to believe Daniels's testimony that Loney instigated the fight by \"swinging\" at him, and could have concluded instead that Daniels \"purposely or knowingly cause[d] bodily injury\" to Loney. Section 45-5-201(1)(a), MCA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16 (emphasis added). We thus concluded that \"[t]he evidence could have supported Daniels's argument that he did not knowingly enter or remain in Loney's apartment even if Loney was not the aggressor in their fight. Daniels therefore was entitled to the lesser-included assault instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 Likewise, Freiburg presented alternative theories supported by the evidence, and did not adopt an \"all or nothing\" approach. Similar to Daniels' attack upon the predicate assault allegation, Freiburg attacked the underlying DUI offenses by challenging the element of diminished capacity and the blood test results. The jury could have believed he was not DUI, leading to an acquittal of the greater Child Endangerment charge. Alternatively,\n   Freiburg's evidence regarding the lack of impairment or any unsafe driving-while relevant to his DUI defense-was also separately relevant to his defense to the greater charge of \"purposely, knowingly, or negligently caus[ing] substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to a child under 14 years of age ....\" Section 45-5-628(1), MCA. As in\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , Freiburg separately attacked the greater charge with sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find him not guilty of that offense, while also permitting a finding that he was nonetheless guilty of a DUI offense. As he argued in closing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   But [ ] the one thing, the one thing throughout hours and hours of testimony that you have not heard, not one word about this, is anything, not one ounce of evidence presented by the prosecutor in this case of the crucial thing, and that is that [ ] driving, this driving by Jacob Freiburg, in any way caused a substantial risk of anyone dying or a substantial risk of anyone seriously injured, serious bodily injury .... No one was put at risk, substantial risk of death or substantial risk of serious bodily injury ...
