Tunstall Taylor in Baltimore; that on February 2, 1928, she consulted Dr. Taylor, who immediately sent her to a ho'spital in Baltimore, where he operated on her leg the next day; that when she recovered from the anesthetic she had on a heavy cast extending from her toes to her hip, while the one the defendant put on after his operation extended from the toes to the top of the knee; that she could bend her knee slightly in Dr. White\u2019s cast, but not at aE in Dr. Taylor\u2019s; about six weeks after his operation Dr. Taylor removed the bone clamp, and the heavy cast, and put on another east, which he removed after three or four weeks; and that plaintiff then walked out of his office and had no further trouble of any kind with her leg thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">At the time of the trial Dr. Taylor was dead, and the only medical testimony of importance here came from Dr. Huff, whose examination had caused him to send the plaintiff to Dr. Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">Dr. Huff, as an expert, was asked a hypothetical question containing a narration of the facts of plaintiff\u2019s case, including a consideration of the X-ray photographs in evidence, and calling for his opinion as to whether the physician who performed the operation on February 26,1927, had exercised such ordinary skiE and abiEty as was usually exercised by professional men in such cases; and he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">There* followed much cross-examination by counsel, with some interrogation by the court, but Dr. .Huff\u2019s opinion remained in the ease at the time the verdict was directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-17\">Whole no presumption of want of skill or care ordinarily arises from the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>professional treatment is unsuccessful, in this case there was more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">For the undisputed evidence shows that the plaintiff was 18 years old at the time of her injury; in good health; had speedily recovered from a fractured collar bone several years before; was operated upon in February, 1927, by the defendant, when both bones in her lower leg were fractured and set; that from time to time thereafter she consulted defendant; that she followed instructions; that almost a year after the operation the leg was not healed; that another surgeon then operated upon the leg, and in three months it was healed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">There was also medical testimony tending to show that shortly before the second operation there was nonunion of the large bone of the leg, which should have healed in eight weeks at most after the first operation, and that the failure of union might he due to poor fixation of the bones in the operation, which is a frequent cause of such a condition, or it might be due to conditions of ill health in the patient, which is a less frequent cause; while both the plaintiff and her mother had testified that the health of the plaintiff was good. There was also in evidence a number of X-ray photographs taken at different times and explained as showing nonunion of the bones.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">From February, 1927, when the defendant operated, until the latter part of 1927, the plaintiff relied entirely upon the defendant in the matter, while at the time of the operation she was, of course, under an ansosthetie, so that her case is inherently difficult of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">And, while the failure of the operation alone creates no presumption of lack of skill or care, it is a circumstance entitled to some consideration, when coupled with the other testimony. As we said in Sweeney v. Erving:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">\u201cThere are exceptional eases where the result of an operation performed, if unexplained, may warrant an inference of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">\u201cThus, evidence showing that after a broken ankle was reset, the ankle was crooked and the ankle joint stiff, tends to prove negligence on the part of the physician in setting the ankle, which evidence should be submitted to the jury.\u201d 35 App. D. C. 62, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Whether the result of the operation in the present case, without other evidence, would have brought it within tins exception we are not called upon to say, because there was other evidence tending to the same eonelusion, and we are of opinion that the order directing the verdict for the defendant was erroneous, and that the judgment thereupon entered must be reversed.
