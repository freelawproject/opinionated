The difficulty with counsel\u2019s position is that this record does not disclose that counsel either requested such an instruction or excepted to the failure of the court to so instruct.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-28\">Counsel for the Investment Company further contend that the judgment should have been without prejudice to the right of the Investment Company to file a claim as a creditor for its debt. If a creditor, who has received a preference, surrenders it to the trustee, even after litigation and in response to a judgment that the trustee recover the preference, such creditor is then entitled to file a claim for his debt against the bankrupt\u2019s estate. Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, 197 U. S. 356, 25 S. Ct. 443, 49 L. Ed. 790; Wilkinson v. Livingston (C. C. A. 8) 45 F.(2d) 465. Without the judgment so providing, the Investment Company may, on restoring to the trustee the amount of the preferential payment in accordance with the judgment, file and prove a claim for its debt and assert its rights, if any it has, to the collateral surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-29\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
