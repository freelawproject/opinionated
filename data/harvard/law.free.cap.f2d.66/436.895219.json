What the facts were on which the District Court made its orders, and whether the petitioners were thereby aggrieved, this court cannot determine from the petition and assignment of errors alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">A petition for leave to appeal under section 24b, which right must be exercised in the manner and form of an appeal, should set forth sufficient facts under oath to make it appear that the petitioners may have been aggrieved by the rulings of the District Court, and if the petitioners propose to ask this court to determine the issue on appeal at the same time it hears the petition, in ease an appeal is allowed, the petition should be accompanied by a transcript of the record in the District Court duly authenticated, and the record forwarded to this court be made as full as though the case came up on appeal under section 24a or section 25, 11 USCA- \u00a7 47 (a) or \u00a7 48, and due notice given to the opposite party of the petitioner\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">A regular course of proceeding in such case should be established. While this court has adopted no rule covering the proceedings in such eases, a petitioner should either state sufficient facts in his petition under oath, together with the ruling of the court, accompanied by an assignment of errors, or, if desirous of an immediate hearing on the appeal, if allowed, should accompany Mis petition by a transcript of the record in the District Court duly authenticated. Brown\u2019s Guide, \u00a7 740. The petitioners in this ease have done neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-17\">But while the petition and \u201cStatement c\u00a3 the Case\u201d do not comply with what we think should be the practice under section 24b of the Bankruptcy Act, since the petitioners may not have sufficient time to file a new petition under section 24b after the filing of this opinion, Broders v. Lage (C. C. A.) 25 F.(2d) 288, and since an order continuing ihe hearing on the petition in bankruptcy and the respondents\u2019 answers to an indefinite date more than three months beyond the completion of the pleadings, may be in violation of section 18d, 11 USCA \u00a7 41(d) of the act, which requires the issues raised by the petition and answers to be determined \u201cas soon as may be,\u201d see Adams v. Foster, 5 Cush. (Mass.) 156; Bentley v. Ward, 116 Mass. 333; Silverstein v. Daniel Russell Boiler Works, 254 Mass. 137, 140, 149 N. E. 705, and the petitioners may he aggrieved thereby, and as counsel have, we think, so- far agreed upon certain facts sufficient to warrant this court in its discretion to allow an appeal, the appeal is allowed; but before passing upon the issues raised by the \u201e assignment of errors, a transcript of the record in the District Court, as in case of an appeal under section 24a, and. section 25, must he transmitted to this court. Hyman v. Meifert (C. C. A.) 57 F.(2d) 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-18\">Inasmuch as both parties at the hearing on the petition stated orally and fully the facts out of which these proceedings arose, and as to the material facts there was no sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>stantial disagreement, and counsel on both sides then presented their respective contentions by oral argument, and respondents\u2019 counsel was granted further time to file a brief on the single question of law involved, viz., whether a postponement of a hearing on the issues raised by a petition in bankruptcy and the answer thereto for more than three months and without fixing a definite date thereafter for such hearing, is a violation of section 18d of the act; now when the record is completed and filed in this court, the ease may be treated as submitted on the oral arguments heretofore presented and the briefs already filed. Permission, however, is granted to both parties to file further briefs within ten days after the record is filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">An appeal is allowed as prayed for.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b462-5\">MORTON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2g\">(dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">I disagree with the last paragraph of the foregoing opinion. The appellee has never had a ehanee to argue the ease orally on the merits, and it is entitled to one if it desires it (Rule 25). The discussion at the time when the application for leave to appeal was presented cannot fairly be regarded as an \u201cargument,\u201d as that word is used in legal proceedings. No discussion of the merits was open or was called for, on the papers then before the court. There was nothing to argue on\u2014 no record of the proceedings in the lower court, and no statement of facts except an ex parte statement not under oath made by the appellant. The appellee had no notice that the merits were to be discussed, no opportunity for preparation, and no reason to believe that the merits would be gone into. Its counsel remonstrated against being forced into a discussion of them. On the equities of the matter, as far as I can gather them, I see no occasion for extraordinary disregard of settled rules of procedure in the interest of the appellant. In my opinion the matter should stand for hearing in due course.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
