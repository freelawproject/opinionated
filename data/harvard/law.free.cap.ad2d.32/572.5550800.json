Our alternative holding is deleted since it now appears for the first time .that an order permitting submission of the infant\u2019s claim to arbitration was obtained albeit not until after service of the demand for arbitration. We do not pass upon the question whether the service of the demand for arbitration under these circumstances was proper.
