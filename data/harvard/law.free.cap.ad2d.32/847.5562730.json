Indicted for incest, rape in the second degree and subornation of perjury in the first degree, defendant in 1965 entered a plea of guilty to rape in the second degree in satisfaction of the entire indictment, thereafter receiving an indeterminate sentence of from 5 to 10 years at a State prison. In 1968 defendant instituted this <em>coram nobis </em>application, alleging that the plea was induced by promises of the District Attorney, County Judge and Sheriff, with the concurrence of his own counsel, that the charge to which he would plead would be a misdemeanor and that he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>sentenced to County Jail for six months or placed on probation. This claim was countered by the District Attorney\u2019s affidavit stating that no such promise was ever made to defendant or his attorney, it being urged also that the transcript of proceedings prior to and at the time of sentencing clearly indicates that defendant understood the nature and consequences of his plea and that the contentions raised here were not presented on appeal nor until three and a half years following judgment. The sole question presented is whether defendant was entitled to a hearing. The People argue in effect that \u201c [b] are allegations not confirmed by the recorded facts and contrary to the conduct of the defendant and his attorney, are insufficient in law to warrant the granting of a hearing \u201d and that \u201c [d]ue process does not require a court to accept every sworn allegation as true \u201d, especially when the District Attorney traverses the applicant\u2019s factual allegations, citing eases such as <em>People </em>v. <em>Lake </em>(14 N Y 2d 790), <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(10 N Y 2d 380) and <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(309 N. Y. 636, 640-641). Defendant, on the other hand, presses that \u201c [i]t is only when the record conclusively demonstrates the falsity of the allegations and there is no reasonable probability at all that defendant\u2019s averments are true that a hearing will be denied \u201d, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Picciotti </em>(4 N Y 2d 340, 345), <em>People </em>v. <em>Lain </em>(309 N. Y. 291), <em>People </em>v. <em>Langan </em>(303 N. Y. 474), <em>People </em>v. <em>Guariglia </em>(303 N. Y. 338) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Richetti </em>(302 N. Y. 290). While these principles advanced by each party may be generally true, it is settled that the mere categorical denial of defendant\u2019s allegations by the District Attorney is not alone sufficient to deny a hearing <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>12 N Y 2d 978; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richetti, </em>302 N. Y. 290, 295, <em>supra; People </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>28 A D 2d 910; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanton, </em>24 A D 2d 876) and, insofar as the record does not contain an explicit statement by defendant (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Granello, </em>18 N Y 2d 823) or other conclusive demonstration that no promises had been made to him, nor any showing that defendant had a clear opportunity to object to his sentence, neither can it be said here that the transcript is adequate to obviate a hearing (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lofland, </em>21 N Y 2d 746; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vellucci, </em>13 N Y 2d 665). The lapse between sentence and commencement of this proceeding was not so inordinate as to contribute to a hearing denial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weldon, </em>17 N Y 2d 814) and the present ground for relief is different from the issues raised on appeal from the judgment of conviction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watford, </em>28 A D 2d 858; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>25 A D 2d 914), <em>coram nobis </em>being the appropriate remedy <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>300 N. Y. 107, 110). Appellant\u2019s allegations, even if considered unlikely or improbable, are neither so incredible as a matter of law nor so clearly refuted by the record that he is not entitled to a hearing <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>23 N Y 2d 814; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Chait, </em>7 A D 2d 399, 401, affd. 6 N Y 2d 855). The situation here is different from that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(10 N Y 2d 380, 381, <em>supra), </em>where the petition alleged \u201cthat his attorney told him that if he pleaded guilty he would receive a maximum sentence of 5 years \u201d and where the \u201c allegedly 'broken promise had been made to his attorney by the Judge or District Attorney \u201d, The instant petition at one point alleges that Wright \u201cwas made certain promises\u201d by the District Attorney, Sheriff and County Judge \u201c and in full agreement with assigned Counselor\u201d. A later paragraph asserts that he \u201cwas induced by members of the court and by assigned counselor Mr. Barbano, Esq., to plead guilty\u2014 and to what I had been informed, was in direct accordance with pre-promises made to me, and as informed by my assigned counselor, Mr. Barbano, Esq., that said 1 pre-promises \u2019 by the District Attorney, and the Hon. Judge and the late Sheriff all of Madison County\u201d; another, that \u201cthe promises by the District Attorney and the Hon. Judge * * * were only made to induce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the plea.\u201d Here, it is not clear that the alleged \u201c promises \u201d were conveyed to Wright solely by his attorney, as was the ease of the \u201c promise \u201d in <em>Scott </em>(cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Elfe, </em>18 N Y 2d 601). Order reversed, on the law, and matter remitted to the County Court of Madison County for a hearing. Reynolds, Aulisi and Cooke, JJ., concur in memorandum by Cooke, J.; Herlihy, J. P. and Greenblott, J., dissent and vote to affirm in a memorandum by Greenblott, J. Greenblott, J. (dissenting). In this <em>coram nobis </em>proceeding, the defendant charges that promises were made to him by the District Attorney, the Sheriff and the court \u201cin full agreement with assigned counselor Mr. Joseph Barbano, Esq.,\u201d and that these promises were made \u201cas informed by my assigned counselor \u201d, that he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor and would receive either a sentence of six months in Madison County Jail or probation. In a similar ease, the Court of Appeals has held that \u201cIt was not error to have insisted that petitioner obtain an affidavit from this lawyer who is living and available, as a minimum earnest of good faith to justify the granting of a hearing \u201d. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>10 N Y 2d 380, 381.) In my opinion, the same principle applies to this ease. This is particularly so in view of the appellant\u2019s expressed satisfaction with the disposition of his case, indicated both at the time of sentence and in letters to the sentencing court over a period of four years following his incarceration. The order denying appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
