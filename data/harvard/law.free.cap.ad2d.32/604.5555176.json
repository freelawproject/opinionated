We affirm the award made to the tenant for the value of certain trade fixtures which it had the right to remove and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>had so intended upon termination of the lease and for which compensation was properly fixed. <em>(City of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>16 N Y 2d 88). Since other fixtures were not intended to be removed, their value was properly included in the award to the owner. The tenant\u2019s leasehold was terminated by operation of the lease and no additional compensation therefor was justified. In arriving at a value for the building, it was proper ,to use the income capitalization method <em>(Marjal Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>23 A D 2d 941) but we are unable to agree with the value arrived at by the court wherein reliance was given to the testimony of .the city\u2019s appraiser who considered only the actual rental without giving consideration to the property\u2019s depressed rental value caused by the impending condemnation announced several years earlier by the plaintiff. (See <em>Matter of City of New York [Lincoln Sq. Slum Clearance Project], </em>15 A D 2d 153, affd. 16 N Y 2d 497; <em>City of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Irish Paper Co., </em>31 A D 2d 470.) The owner\u2019s award should be modified by increasing it to $146,300, a value which is based on a proper income capitalization method and which finds support in the record. (Appeals from final decree of Erie Special Term; in condemnation proceeding.) Present\u2014 Goldman, P. J., Witmer, Gabrielli, Moule and Henry, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
