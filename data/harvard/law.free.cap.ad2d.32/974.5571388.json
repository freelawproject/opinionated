We need not pass on all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>grounds that might be urged for affirmance, as <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(270 App. Div. 859) is alone dispositive of this appeal. The gravamen of the Federal conviction includes the concealing of the stolen automobile, restricted, however, to interstate transportation. Such concealment of property is clearly a crime in this State (see former Penal Law, \u00a7 1308). Order affirmed. Gibson, P. J., Herlihy, Reynolds, Staley, Jr., and Greenblott, JJ., concur in memorandum by Greenblott, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
