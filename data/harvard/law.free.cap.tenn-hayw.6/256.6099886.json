Therefore the prisoner must be discharged from this judgment, and we cannot order him to be retained in custody to be tried again, because we have no original jurisdiction. As to the point whether under our construction he can be tried again, we do * not say anything at this time, it not' being necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Judgment accordingly, that he. be discharged from this judgment.'</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">See <em>Croxdale </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Head, 139; <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>State, </em>8 Hum. 93; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>State, </em>8 Hum. 118; <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>State, </em>9 Yer. 392; <em>Snell </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Hum. 347; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Yer. 76; King\u2019s Digest, 4399-4403.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
