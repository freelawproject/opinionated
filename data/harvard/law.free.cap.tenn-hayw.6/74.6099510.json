And whether that be a good <em>sci. fa. </em>is not yet settled in this State by any judicial determination of the Supreme Court. It ought not to be settled when coming before the court in a * collateral way. It is enough at present to perceive that it is a disputable and an unsettled question.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Thirdly, in case of rescinding the bargain by a decree of the court, it will be ordered that the moneys paid to the vendor shall be a lien on the estate sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">A decree was made in conformity with the above principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">See, as to <em>rescission, Seawell </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Hay. 280; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>North, </em>6 Hum. 309; <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>5 Sneed, 70; <em>Norment </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>6 Hum. 310; <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Atwell, </em>8 Hum. 516; <em>Pipkin </em>v. <em>James, </em>1 Hum. 325; <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>11 Hum. 116; <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Elam, </em>6 Yer. 108; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Woolfolk, 3 </em>Hay. 195; and cases cited in King\u2019s Digest, 2743 <em>et seq. </em>As to <em>sci. fa. naming </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>heirs, Roberts </em>v. <em>Busby, </em>3 Hay. 195, and note <em>sub fin. </em>As to <em>lien of purchase money, Johnson v.
