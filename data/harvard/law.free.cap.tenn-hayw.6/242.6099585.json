The defendants demurred to this bill; and, upon argument before the court, they insisted that the complainant had not paid <em>at their request, </em>and therefore could not have any demand against them. He could not have been compelled, said they, beyond his assets ; and his voluntary payments to a greater amount ought not to turn him into a creditor against the real estate of the deceased; and if he had any demand, he might as well proceed at law as in this court.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A7i\">* Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AJQ\">Had not the complainant paid these surplus debts, the defendants would now be liable for them; and there is no injustice in saying he shall stand in the place of the creditors, and resort to that property for satisfaction which they would have resorted to; and, being debts justly due from the intestate, his lands were liable to the satisfaction of them. He need not have stated the debts more particularly, for, should the answer deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>them, he will be called upon to state and prove them severally to the satisfaction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Demurrer overruled, and the defendants ordered to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">See <em>Pea </em>v. <em>Waggoner, </em>5 Hay. 1, and note <em>sub fin.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
