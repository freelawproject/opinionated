And then it follows that Garrison\u2019s entry and survey are both for the same land, and that the bounds thereof include the greater part of the lands of Thompson, the caveator. And we think we are at \u25a0 liberty to make this implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Secondly, this northeast corner is found to have been notoriously called Christmas\u2019s corner, before Thompson\u2019s entiles were made, though it was not so called when Garrison\u2019s entry was made. That called for Christmas\u2019s northeast corner, and a point 80 poles south thereof for a beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\"We are of opinion that Garrison\u2019s entry was therefore rendered special before that of Thompson\u2019s was made, and of course was sufficiently special when Thompson\u2019s was made. He cannot say that he was misled by the entry of Garrison, and its uncertainty. It is good in law against Thompson\u2019s entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">See <em>Simm </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>Cooke, 140; <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Trimble, </em>Cooke, 282; <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Gleaves, </em>3 Hay. 213; Talbot <em>v.
