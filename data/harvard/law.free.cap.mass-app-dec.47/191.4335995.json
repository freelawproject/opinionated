J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5b\">This is an action of tort which arises out of a motor vehicle collision on October 30, 1968. The action was instituted by a common writ, issued by the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, dated <em>October 23, 1970, </em>returnable <em>April 19, 1971 </em>and served on the defendants <em>April 3, 1971.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">On <em>April 27, 1971 </em>the defendants appeared specially, without submitting themselves generally to the jurisdiction of the court and filed motions:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">(1) For leave to file motion late, and</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">(2) That the action be dismissed for the reason that the writ dated <em>October 23,1970 </em>and returnable <em>April 19, 1971 </em>was in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>G.L.c.223, \u00a7 23, which provides that . . . \u201can original writ issued by a district court shall be returnable not more than sixty days after date thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">It is apparent that the writ is returnable more than sixty days after the date of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The court, after hearing, on <em>May 12, 1971 </em>allowed the motion for leave to file motion late and allowed the motion to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The significant part of the statute to be considered is \u201cshall be returnable not more than sixty days after date thereof.\u201d \u201cShall\u201d in the statute is commonly a word of command. It imports a positive, imperative and unescapable obligation. It is inconsistent with the idea of discretion. <em>Rea </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>217 Mass. 427. <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth, </em>244 Mass. 93, 94. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>275 Mass. 91, 93. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>300 Mass. 591, 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The plaintiffs failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of the statute. The court did not acquire jurisdiction over the defendants. <em>Farber </em>v. <em>Lubin, </em>327 Mass. 128. <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Nardella, </em>344 Mass. 258-259.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Where it appears on the record that the court has no jurisdiction, nothing which the parties may do or omit to do will give it jurisdiction. <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>21 Pick. 535-537.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">In order to clear the record the court was justified in allowing the motion to dismiss the action.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b200-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>James P. McLaughlin for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b200-7\">Leonard M. Augello for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">There being no prejudicial error the report is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
