TANQUE, LILLIAN R. TANQUE and MANUEL A. SOL v. BOARD OF HEALTH OF FAIRHAVEN</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b75-9\">Argued: Jan. 12, 1971</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWj\">Decided: Nov. 11, 1971</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Aaz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>Present: </em>Murphy, P.J.; Rider, Sullivan, JJ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Ack\">Case tried to <em>Tlorrocks, J. </em>in the Third District Court of Bristol</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"Azb\">No. 2886/69.</docketnumber>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b76-7\">Sullivan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABE\">This is a petition for review brought under G.L.c.111, \u00a7125A which provides for a review in the District Court of an order of a Board of Health that adjudges the operation of a farm to be a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The petitioners were keeping and raising twenty-three pigs on their property in Fair-haven. The respondents, as the Board of Health of Fairhaven, notified the petitioners by letter that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">\u201cas a result of an investigation\u2014 it is determined that the operation of a piggery on said property constitutes a nuisance. \u2014 you are ordered to remove all pigs \u2014 within ten days \u2014.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The Board contends that the petitioners are not entitled to a review because \u00a7125A pertains to the operation of a \u201cfarm\u201d whereas its order pertains to the operation of a \u201cpiggery\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">This issue, as to whether or not the petitioners are entitled to a review, was argued before the reporting justice who ruled that \u201cthis is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>a farm within the meaning of the statute\u201d and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b77-10\">Donald R. Perry for the Petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b77-11\">William H. Carey for the Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">This ruling was erroneous and petitioners are entitled to have the type of review afforded by \u00a7125A.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Prior case law held that \u201cthe maintenance of a piggery is use of land different from that of ordinary farming\u201d. However, in 1966, Section 1 of Chapter 111 of the General Laws was amended by adding the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cFarming\u201d .. . shall include . . . the keeping and raising of . . . swine ... a farmer ... is hereby defined as one engaged in farming ... as herein defined...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">This definition eliminates any distinction between a <em>piggery </em>and a <em>farm </em>for the purposes of \u00a7125A.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The finding is ordered vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further hearing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
