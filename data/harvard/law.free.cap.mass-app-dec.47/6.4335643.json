J., Rider, Sullivan, JJ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Ao\">Case tried before <em>White, J. </em>in the First District Court of Barnstable</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b13-10\">Sullivan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">This is an action of contract for use and occupation of premises. The answer was a general denial and payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-11\">The trial judge made a general finding for the plaintiff in the full amount of her declaration. ($1215.68) No special 'finding of facts was made. No action was taken on defendant\u2019s requests for rulings. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b13-12\">Defendant contends' error in the failure to act upon or grant his requests, and that the finding is against the weight of the.evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-13\">We consider first the contention that the finding was against the weight of the evidence. The defendant may. not avail himself of this contention because: of the form of- the report. The report contains what appears to be merely, fragmentary, portions of the evidence. There is no statement that \u201cThis report contains all the. evidence material to the questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>reported\u201d, as required by Rule 28, Draft Report Model, of the District Court Rules. In this respect, the report is fatally defective. See <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Bonjorno, </em>327 Mass. 516, 518. It should have been dismissed or corrected by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">As to the failure of the trial judge to act upon or grant the requests for rulings, we find no prejudicial error. Non-action on the requests was an implied denial of them. <em>Bankoff </em>v. <em>Coleman Brothers, Inc., </em>302 Mass. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">Error would be assigned only if the rulings requested were the governing principles of law. They were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">The requests for rulings were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">1. That rent due under a written Lease cannot be recovered on a common count for rent and/or use and occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-9\">2. The plaintiff, in an action for rent, has the burden of proving that he owned the premises during the period for which rent is sought or that she had a better right to possession during this period than the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-10\">3. Under a common count for rent and/or use and occupation the landlord is entitled to recover only for the specific time that the premises were actually occupied and/or used by the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-11\">4. In a suit under a common count for rent, the landlord is entitled to recover from the tenant only the reasonable value , of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the use and occupation during which the tenant actually occupied the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">5. In an action on a common count for rent, the landlord has the burden of proving that the tenant actually occupied the premises for which rent is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">6. The defendant did not occupy the premises at 269 Sea Street, Hyannis, Massachusetts, during the period from February, 1967, to 'September, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">7. The plaintiff, Anne D. Hall, did not own and was not entitled to possession of 269 Sea Street, Hyannis, Massachusetts, during the period of February, 1967 through September 4,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">Request No. 1 properly recites the common law. This common law principle, however, has since been changed by statute so that rent due under a lease can now be recovered on a common count. G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 147 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b15-9\">Bequest No. 2 alludes to privity of estates as being essential in a landlord-tenant relationship. This is not the law. An action for use and occupation depends not on privity of estate but on contract, express or implied. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Coy, </em>164 Mass. 391, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-10\">Bequests No. 3, 4, and 5 do not properly state the law. Becovery for use and occupation is not limited to periods when the tenant \u201cactually\u201d occupied. The occupation may be either actual or constructive, <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b15-11\">Requests No. 6 and 7 are characterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>in defendant\u2019s brief as requests for findings of fact.. A District Court judge is not required to make findings of fact. <em>Maglio </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>268 Mass. 135.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b16-6\">Joseph J. Reardon of Hyannis for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b16-7\">Marshall M. Dranetz of Hyannis for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">There being no prejudicial error, and because of the failure to follow the rule in reference to the form of the report, it is. ordered: Report Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
