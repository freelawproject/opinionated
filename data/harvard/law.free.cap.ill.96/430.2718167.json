Whitson, was appointed administrator of his estate, and as such administrator came into and took possession of all the personal effects of their father, and among other things, took possession of and secured the deed mentioned above, and took actual possession thereof, and expressed it as his intention to file the same with the \u00a1Recorder of Jackson county, Illinois, and have the same duly recorded; and that afterwards he suppressed the deed, and he, or some of his confederates in fraud and oppression towards complainants, burned or otherwise destroyed it, believing and hoping that complainants would never be able to inquire into the legality of such conduct, and that thereby the other heirs of said Thomas Whitson, including the said Berry B. Whitson, who destroyed the deed, would come in and share in the said lands of complainants.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\" pgmap=\"432(153) 433(162)\">The bill further charges that in pursuance of said fraudulent conduct on the part of Berry B. Whitson, and his confederates in fraud, all the other heirs of Thomas Whitson, deceased, set up a claim to said land, and claimed to be tenants in common with said complainants, claiming that the land had descended to them and complainants in common, according to the statute of descents; that in pursuance of this false and unjust claim, Ezra Biers, pretending to own one undivided 44th part of the land in question, as a grandchild of the said Thomas Whitson, deceased, at the May term of that court in 1865, filed a bill for partition of this land, together with 127 acres more of cheap and worthless land, upon which the said Thomas Whitson at the time of his death held some kind of claim; that in that suit the several heirs of Thomas Whitson, deceased, including the surviving children and grand children, and great-grandchildren, were made parties, (giving the names of the parties), and among them the complainants, who were minors, were made parties; that such proceedings were had that, at the May term of 1866, a decree of partition was made by the court, being entered by default, and commissioners were appointed to make the partition ; they reported the property incapable of division, and thereupon the court decreed that the lands should be sold, and they were sold on the first of October, 1866, and the appellant corporation (the name of which at that time was The Mount Carbon Coal and Railroad Company) became the purchaser of the land claimed here by complainants; that report of the sale was made to the court, and the same was approved by the court, and the distribution of the proceeds was ordered among the respective parties in interest as set forth in the decree.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\" pgmap=\"433\">The bill charges that the land at that time sold, really and in law and equity belonged to the complainants in common, and that the appellant corporation, long before the pretended sale under the partition proceedings, had taken actual and exclusive possession of the land and buildings, and have continued to occupy and claim the exclusive right of possession thereto, and now remain in the actual possession thereof, to the exclusion of the legal rights of complainants.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\" pgmap=\"433\">The bill charges that this corporation was warned and notified, through its agents and attorneys, of the rights of complainants long before it acquired any pretended interest in these lands, and was also notified of the fraud of Berry B. Whitson, and his confederates, in purloining and then destroying the title deed of complainants; that the corporation disregarded this warning, and by its agents entered into a combination and confederation with those who were endeavoring to defraud complainants by depriving them of the benefits of this conveyance from their father.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-4\" pgmap=\"434\">The bill charges that their deed to this land, so made by their father in his lifetime, was fraudulently surreptitiously and unlawfully abstracted from the papers of their father, by Berry B. Whitson, or some of his confederates in fraud and injustice towards the complainants; that the deed has since been secretly destroyed or concealed, for the sole purpose of defrauding complainants out of their just rights in and to the land, and of enabling the elder brothers and sisters to come in and enjoy the land and estate and property of complainants.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\" pgmap=\"434\">And that the entire proceeding for the partition of this land was procured by the parties who conducted the suit, with the full knowledge of the rights of complainants, and for the purpose of depriving them of their rights in this regard.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\" pgmap=\"434\">The prayer of the bill is for a decree adjudging that complainants are seized in fee, as tenants in common, of the land in question, and asking that the decree for partition and proceedings thereunder be declared void in relation to complainants ; and that conveyances made in pursuance thereof be set aside, and that Berry B. Whitson be required to surrender to complainants their deed, if in his possession and control, and all title papers relating to said land which may be in his possession, and that the defendants be enjoined and restrained from setting up any right or claim to the land in question; and that complainant may be placed in possession of the land.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\" pgmap=\"434\">To this bill the appellant corporation filed a demurrer, which was overruled. Berry B. Whitson answered the bill, denying the making and delivery of the deed by Thomas Whitson, as claimed in the bill, and denying that he had ever seen it, and positively denying the destruction of it by him, and all allegations of fraud.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\" pgmap=\"434(39) 435(35)\">Replication was filed, proofs taken and a decree was entered by the circuit court, declaring the complainants to be the true owners of the property in question\u2014directing that they be put in possession thereof\u2014and that the master make to them a deed, to take the place of that made to complainants by their father, and directing that the appellant corporation pay the costs.

The deed must take effect, by delivery, within the lifetime of the grantor, or it will be held inoperative to pass the title. Wiggins v. Lusk, 12 Ill. 135; Bryan et al. v.

Lomax v. Dore et al. 45 Ill. 331; Fahs et al. v. Roberts et al. 54 id. 194.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\" pgmap=\"436\">The bill shows that the company is in the actual adverse possession of the lands in question, and the averment is that the company\u2019s asserted title is absolutely void. The complainants furthermore aver that they are invested with the legal title. What is thus stated in the bill is binding on the complainants. They can not avoid the effect of their own admissions. Dan. Ch. Pr. vol. 2 p. 834; 2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases, 687; Prescott v. Fisher et al. 22 Ill. 392.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\" pgmap=\"436\">The allegation in the bill that the complainants\u2019 deed was \u2022lost constitutes no such equity as to give chancery jurisdiction.

Spring, 43 Ill. 280.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\" pgmap=\"436\">The indefinite charge of fraud and notice contained in the bill does not give warrant to this suit against the company. To sustain a charge of fraud and notice thereof, facts must be distinctly stated in the bill. A general, or an indefinite averment, as in this case, is not sufficient. Newell et al. v.

The bill alleges that in his lifetime the father of appellees was the owner of the land in question, in fee, and that he did deed and convey this land to the appellees by warranty deed.</p> <p id=\"b438-4\" pgmap=\"438\">The bill also alleges, that that deed, being kept in the custody of the father after its execution until his death, fell into the hands of Berry B. Whitson, who fraudulently suppressed, destroyed, or concealed it; that the partition proceedings, under which the appellant corporation claims were instituted fraudulently by those who conducted those proceedings, with a knowledge of the rights of the complainants, and were consummated fraudulently and while complainants were minors, and that before the purchase of the land by the appellant corporation, actual notice was given to the corporation of the rights of the complainants in this regard.</p> <p id=\"b438-5\" pgmap=\"438(227) 439(20)\">If these allegations be true, and they are confessed by the demurrer of the appellant corporation, it seems plain that the decree against the corporation was just and proper. In the brief filed for appellants, we find a very elaborate discussion of the proofs taken, as against Berry B. Whitson, and other defendants, and of the circumstances attending the supposed execution of this deed; and it is earnestly insisted that, upon the proofs, it appears that Thomas Whitson, at the time of signing, sealing and acknowledging the deed, did n\u00a3&gt;t intend to part with the title. In other words, that the delivery of the deed, even for the benefit of minors, was not sufficient. This is, however, a question with which the appellant corporation has no concern. The appellant corporation has confessed, by the demurrer, that the father of the complainants did deed and convey this property to them by a warranty deed. If so, the title then passed to them, and the fact that the custody of the deed was, after that time, as shown by the bill, in the hands of their father, so long as he lived, could not divest them of the title which they must have received. If the allegation be true, which is found in the bill, that he \u201cdid deed and convey\u201d this property to them, the demurrer then, of the appellant corporation, was properly overruled, and the decree, as against that corporation, seems unquestionably right.</p> <p id=\"b439-6\" pgmap=\"439\">As to the other appellant, Berry B. Whitson, it is not perceived that he is in any way prejudiced by this decree. He claims no interest in the land. The prayer of the bill was that he should be required to surrender the title papers relating to this land, together with this deed about which this controversy arises; but the decree is silent on that subject. It deprives Berry B. Whitson of no right whatever, nor does it impose upon him any burden. He is not even charged with costs. The appellant corporation \u2022 alone is directed to pay the costs. Whether the allegation, that Berry B. Whitson fraudulently suppressed the deed or destroyed it, be true, in fact, or not, the interests of Berry B. Whitson are not affected thereby.</p> <p id=\"b439-7\" pgmap=\"439\">The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b439-8\" pgmap=\"439\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
