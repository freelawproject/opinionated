Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice BREYER, Justice SOTOMAYOR, and Justice KAGAN join, dissenting. I would deny the application to vacate the stay of execution entered by the Court of Appeals. See <em>Bowersox v. Williams,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744833\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/345/#p347\">517 U.S. 345</extracted-citation>, 347, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744833\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/345/#p347\">116 S.Ct. 1312</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744833\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/345/#p347\">134 L.Ed.2d 494</extracted-citation> (1996) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). (\"At the very least, before acting irretrievably, this Court might have invited prompt clarification of the Court of Appeals' [stay] order. Appreciation of our own fallibility, and respect for the judgment of an appellate tribunal closer to the scene than we are, as I see it, demand as much.\").</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
