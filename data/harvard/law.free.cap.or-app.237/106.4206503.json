The dismissal was involuntary, without prejudice, and it did not address the merits of the personal injury claim. That dismissal was \u201centered in the register\u201d of the circuit court. Plaintiff appealed. We affirmed, <em>Belinskey v. Clooten, </em>214 Or App 172, 164 P3d 1163 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 194 (2008). The Supreme Court then sent the appellate judgment back to the trial court, where it was also \u201centered in the register\u201d pursuant to ORS 19.450(3). Within 180 days after the <em>appellate </em>judgment from the Supreme Court was \u201centered in the register\u201d of the circuit court, but long after 180 days had elapsed since the original <em>trial court </em>judgment of dismissal had been entered in the circuit court register, plaintiff refiled her claim. By that time, of course, the statute of limitations had run, and defendant moved for summary judgment on that ground. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, rejecting plaintiffs argument that, because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>refiled, within 180 days of the entry of the <em>appellate </em>judgment, her action was \u201csaved\u201d by ORS 12.220. This appeal ensued. The question presented is what \u201cthe judgment dismissing the original action\u201d means in ORS 12.220(2). Defendant contends that, as the trial court ruled, the term refers to the first judgment \u2014 the trial court\u2019s original judgment dismissing the action before appeal. Plaintiff contends that the term also includes the judgment entered in the trial court register after the appellate mandate issues. We agree with defendant and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">We acknowledge that plaintiffs arguments have considerable force. Focusing first on the text and context of ORS 12.220, she notes that an appellate judgment, like a trial court judgment, is entered in the trial court register as a \u201cjudgment,\u201d not an \u201cappellate judgment.\u201d ORS 19.450(3). She also points out that \u201cdismiss\u201d commonly means \u201cto put (a legal action or a party) out of judicial consideration: refuse to hear or hear further in court.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>652 (unabridged ed 2002). Thus, she concludes, an action is not \u201cdismissed\u201d until it has run its course; when a party files an appeal, the appellate court acquires jurisdiction, ORS 19.270(1), the trial court loses jurisdiction for most purposes, ORS 19.270(6), and the case is not \u201cput out of judicial consideration\u201d until the appellate judgment issues and is entered in the trial court register as a dismissal. Further, a \u201cjudgment\u201d is the \u201cconcluding decision of a court on one or more requests for relief in one or more actions, as reflected in a judgment document.\u201d ORS 18.005(9). Because a trial court judgment of dismissal does not \u201cconclude\u201d an action that is appealed, the judgment referred to in ORS 12.220 must include the final judgment in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Turning to the legislative history, plaintiff cites the oral and written testimony presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of the Oregon Law Commission \u201cSaving Statute\u201d Work Group, which drafted the statute. Minutes, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, HB 2284, Tapes 126A &amp; 127A (Public Hearing, May 12, 2003); Exhibit D (Oregon Law Commission Saving Statute Work Group Report); Exhibit E (written testimony of Prof Maury Holland). That testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>she argues, demonstrates that one of the purposes underlying the statute was to avoid deciding cases on procedural grounds instead of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In the final analysis, however, plaintiffs arguments are not well taken. The statute provides that a plaintiff may refile an action when it is \u201cinvoluntarily dismissed without prejudice.\u201d That language logically refers to a proceeding at the trial court level. Trial court judges \u201cdismiss without prejudice\u201d and, although appellate courts on rare occasions \u201cdismiss\u201d an appeal, ORS 19.410, they more typically \u201caffirm, reverse or modify\u201d trial court decisions, ORS 19.420(1). Additionally, the term \u201cdismiss\u201d as a legal term of art means \u201c[t]o send (something) away; specif., to terminate (an action or claim) without further hearing, esp. <em>before the trial </em>of the issues involved.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>502 (8th ed 2004) (emphasis added). Again, because a dismissal usually occurs \u201cbefore the trial,\u201d not after a trial and appeal, ORS 12.220 likely refers exclusively to the trial court\u2019s pretrial judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">That likelihood is bolstered by consideration of the 2003 statute\u2019s context, which includes wording changes between that version and its predecessor. <em>See Krieger v. Just, </em>319 Or 328, 336, 876 P2d 754 (1994) (wording changes are a part of the context of the present version of the statute being construed). The 2003 statute replaced a version that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201c[I]f an action is commenced within the time prescribed therefor and the action is dismissed upon the trial thereof, <em>or upon appeal, </em>after the time limited for bringing a new action, the plaintiff, or if the plaintiff dies and any cause of action in the favor of the plaintiff survives, the heirs or personal representatives of the plaintiff, may commence a new action upon such cause of action within one year after the dismissal or <em>reversal on appeal; </em>however, all defenses that would have been available against the action, if brought within the time limited for the bringing of the action, shall be available against the new action when brought under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\"><em>Former </em>ORS 12.220 (2001) (emphasis added). We find it significant that the older statute expressly provided that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>plaintiff could refile a claim after both an appeal and a dismissal by the trial court. The change is significant because new language in a statute ordinarily signals a change in the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>State v. Click, </em>305 Or 611, 616 n 5, 755 P2d 693 (1988). Here, we have no reason to conclude otherwise. We regard the absence of the appeal language as strong support for the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The statute\u2019s legislative (and prelegislative) history also support affirmance. The current version resulted from amendments added in 2003 at the instigation of the Oregon Law Commission. According to the commission\u2019s work group dealing with the statute, the 2003 amendments were intended to remedy two defects. First, the existing statute did not expressly state that it applied only when the original action was dismissed on a procedural, as opposed to a substantive, ground, although that was how the courts were interpreting it. Second, the statute could not be applied where the original action was dismissed due to insufficient alias service, which was the most common procedural defect. <em>See </em>Minutes, Oregon Law Commission, Nov 22, 2002. Professor Maury Holland, chair of the work group, explained that \u201cthe bill draft is a modest change but one that would reduce the number of appeals.\u201d Minutes, Oregon Law Commission, Oct 11, 2002 (comment of Prof Maury Holland). Commission member Hans Linde offered his thanks to the work group, noting that \u201ctheir work will reduce appeals, which is a great service.\u201d Minutes, Oregon Law Commission, Nov 22, 2002 (comments of Prof Hans Linde).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The only testimony heard during the legislative process itself was from Professor Holland, who presented the report that the commission had developed on the amendments and explained why they would reduce the number of appeals. His report explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201cIn addition [to] affording greater assurance that cases are decided on their merits, rather than being dismissed because of technical defaults even when those can be cured \u2014 in other words, assuring that people claiming to have been injured get their day in court \u2014 amended 12.220 should result in at least one other significant benefit to the Oregon court system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201cSeveral years [ago] I began to notice, in reading the judicial advance sheets, how many cases came up on appeal where the single issue concerned sufficiency of service. For the following reason, amended 12.220 can be expected to reduce, though not totally eliminate, such appeals, with the delay and expense to litigants, and the consumption of judicial resources, they entail. The reason is that * * * when a trial court dismisses an action for insufficient service, rather than appeal, which is now plaintiffs only option, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will seek to make sufficient alias service, which will often, though not always, be practicable. The result would be to reduce the burden of these single-issue appeals on the appellate courts, especially the already overburdened court of appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Testimony, House Judiciary Committee, HB 2284, Feb 11, 2003, Ex 1 (statement of Prof Maury Holland). Plaintiff argues that this language suggests that the legislature\u2019s intent was to limit only appeals from dismissals based on faulty service. We find that argument unpersuasive. Although Professor Holland may have discussed limiting appeals only with respect to service of process errors, the language of the statute does not distinguish between those errors and others, except for limiting the number of days a plaintiff has to refile. Adopting plaintiffs interpretation in order to accommodate errors unrelated to service of process would negate the statute\u2019s obvious legislative purpose. Put another way, plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s interpretation forces her to make the risky choice between an appeal and refiling. That, we conclude, is exactly what the statute was intended to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Thus, in order to be \u201csaved\u201d by ORS 12.220 from the operation of the statute of limitations, plaintiff needed to have refiled her claim within 180 days of when the trial court entered its original, preappeal judgment. Because plaintiff failed to do so, the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-5\"> ORS 12.220 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201c(1) Notwithstanding ORS 12.020, if an action is filed with a court within the time allowed by statute, and the action is involuntarily dismissed without prejudice on any ground not adjudicating the merits of the action, or is involuntarily dismissed with prejudice on the ground that the plaintiff failed to properly effect service of summons within the time allowed by ORS 12.020 and the statute of limitations for the action expired, the plaintiff may commence a new action based on the same claim or claims against a defendant in the original action if the defendant had actual notice of the filing of the original action not later than 60 days after the action was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u201c(2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, a new action is commenced in the manner provided by ORS 12.020 not later than 180 days after the judgment dismissing the original action is entered in the register of the court, the new action is not subject to dismissal by reason of not having been commenced within the time allowed by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
