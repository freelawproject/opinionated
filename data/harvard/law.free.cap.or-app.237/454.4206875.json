Wild subsequently obtained counsel and challenged aspects of the administration and review of his claim; however, Wild died during the claim process. After Wild\u2019s death, SAIF accepted part of Wild\u2019s claim and issued a notice of closure. The attorney who had represented Wild then sought reconsideration by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division (WCD) of the notice of closure, which ultimately resulted in an order awarding Wild additional temporary disability benefits. Petitioners, SAIF Corporation and the Oregon Military Department, requested a hearing on the award, which led to an order by an administrative law judge (ALJ) that vacated the award on the ground that Wild\u2019s minor daughter, as Wild\u2019s beneficiary under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, was the person who had to have timely requested reconsideration. Because, according to the ALJ, Wild\u2019s daughter had not done that, the WCD had lacked authority to reconsider the notice of closure. Wild\u2019s daughter then appealed the ALJ\u2019s order to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The board concluded on appeal that the reconsideration request that the attorney had submitted was a request made on behalf of Wild\u2019s daughter. The board further concluded that, even if Wild\u2019s daughter had not submitted a timely reconsideration request, the notice of closure was procedurally invalid under OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d) (Jan 1, 2006)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the notice had not been mailed to the recipients specified in the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On judicial review, petitioners assign error to both of the board\u2019s rulings. Petitioners contend that, (1) although the attorney who had represented Wild filed a reconsideration request before the statutory deadline, he did not have authority to do that on behalf of Wild\u2019s daughter and, thus, Wild\u2019s daughter did not timely request reconsideration of the notice of closure, and (2) SAIF did not violate the mailing provisions in OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d) in issuing the notice of closure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>We conclude that the board erred with respect to both issues and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We relate the following undisputed facts that are material to our review. In May 2005, Wild filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for an occupational disease involving his neck and left arm. SAIF denied the claim in August 2005. That same month, Wild signed a retainer agreement with counsel and requested a hearing on the denial. After hearing, an AL J issued a January 2006 order affirming SAIF\u2019s denial, and Wild appealed that order to the board. Wild died thereafter on April 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In July 2006, the board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order in part and reversed it in part, setting aside the denial of the left arm condition and remanding the claim to SAIF for further processing. On August 1, 2006, SAIF issued a notice of acceptance of left elbow lateral epicondylitis and mailed it to Wild\u2019s home address. That notice was returned to SAIF with a notation that Wild had died. Additionally, in early August 2006, SAIF received notice from Wild\u2019s attending physician of Wild\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">SAIF closed the claim on August 16, 2006, and mailed copies of the notice of closure to Wild\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d at his former address and to the attorney who had represented Wild on the claim. The notice of closure explained that it could be appealed by requesting reconsideration within 60 days from the mailing date of the notice. Two days later, the attorney who had represented Wild requested reconsideration of the notice of closure. On September 6, 2006, the WCD Appellate Review Unit (ARU) issued an order on reconsideration affirming the notice of closure. Thereafter, the attorney asked the ARU to abate its order to consider additional information from Wild\u2019s attending physician. SAIF objected to the admission of the additional evidence but did not question whether the attorney had authority to pursue reconsideration. The ARU granted the request and subsequently issued an amended order on reconsideration on October 11, 2006, awarding temporary disability benefits for the period from July 2005 to January 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">On October 26,2006, SAIF challenged the validity of the reconsideration request, asserting that the attorney had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>not had authority to request reconsideration because Wild had died before the attorney requested reconsideration and there was no indication that the attorney represented anyone who was entitled under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law to receive Wild\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits on his death. The ARU declined to abate its order, and SAIF then requested a hearing. On the date of the hearing, December 29, 2006, the attorney executed a retainer agreement with the mother of Wild\u2019s minor daughter authorizing the attorney to represent Wild\u2019s daughter regarding her rights as the statutory beneficiary on Wild\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The ALJ issued an order vacating the amended order on reconsideration on the ground that the attorney had lacked authority to request reconsideration because he had not been retained to represent Wild\u2019s daughter until after the 60-day period to request reconsideration had expired. <em>See </em>ORS 656.268(5)(c) (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wild\u2019s daughter appealed the ALJ\u2019s order to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">On appeal, the board reversed the ALJ\u2019s order. It concluded that Wild\u2019s daughter, as the statutory beneficiary, had \u201ctimely pursued an appeal of the Notice of Closure.\u201d The board reasoned \u201cthat counsel was representing the interests of [Wild\u2019s daughter] when filing the reconsideration request regarding the Notice of Closure.\u201d The board explained that neither party had cited, nor had it found, \u201ca WCD rule that requires an executed retainer agreement before an attorney may file a valid reconsideration request.\u201d Additionally, the board noted that \u201c[t]he statutory scheme entitles a \u2018beneficiary\u2019 to pursue a Notice of Closure in the place of a deceased worker.\u201d In light of those considerations, the board concluded that \u201ccounsel\u2019s August 2006 request for reconsideration was filed on behalf of [Wild\u2019s daughter] (the deceased worker\u2019s statutory beneficiary) and, as such, was valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We begin our analysis by addressing petitioners\u2019 assignment of error to that ruling, which we review for legal error. ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8)(a); <em>SAIF v. Johnson, </em>198 Or App 504, 508-09, 108 P3d 662 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>In the event that a worker dies before receiving disability compensation to which the worker is entitled, ORS 656.218 (2005), in conjunction with ORS 656.204 (2005), provides that the deceased worker\u2019s statutory beneficiaries are entitled to the compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Wild\u2019s minor daughter, as Wild\u2019s sole statutory beneficiary, was entitled to the disability compensation benefits that would have gone to her father had he not died. Furthermore, she was authorized to pursue the compensation due her father by requesting a hearing on the notice of closure and, as a predicate to that, requesting reconsideration. <em>Edwards v. Cherry City Electric, Inc., </em>141 Or App 578, 582, 919 P2d 501 (1996). However, she was required to request reconsideration \u201cwithin 60 days of the date of the notice of closure.\u201d ORS 656.268(5)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The board concluded, in essence, that, because Wild\u2019s daughter was the person who was statutorily entitled to pursue her father\u2019s right to compensation, the attorney\u2019s request for reconsideration was, necessarily, made on her behalf and was therefore valid. The board\u2019s reasoning fundamentally falters, however, because ORS 656.218 (2005) and ORS 656.204 (2005) merely <em>entitled </em>the daughter to pursue her father\u2019s right to compensation. Contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>board\u2019s conclusion, those statutes do not obviate the need for the statutory beneficiary to request reconsideration within the 60-day period, regardless of whether the request is made personally or through an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The parties\u2019 dispute ultimately reduces to whether the attorney submitted the reconsideration request on behalf of Wild\u2019s daughter. On August 18, 2006, the attorney requested reconsideration of the notice of closure. He did that by submitting to the WCD a form entitled \u201cWorker Request for Reconsideration,\u201d which he signed on a line labeled \u201crequestor or designee.\u201d The cover letter that the attorney submitted with the form said that he \u201crepresents] Karl Wild regarding his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d and identified the claimant as Karl Wild. There is no reference in either document to Wild\u2019s daughter. Furthermore, nothing else in the record indicates that, at the time that he submitted the reconsideration request, the attorney was acting for Wild\u2019s daughter. Finally, according to the record, the attorney did not execute a retainer agreement authorizing him to represent the interests of Wild\u2019s daughter until December 2006, more than two months after the time to request reconsideration had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">At bottom, and in light of the facts in the record, the board\u2019s order does not explain how the daughter\u2019s <em>entitlement </em>to pursue an appeal made the reconsideration request that the attorney submitted \u2014 a request by an attorney who identified himself as Wild\u2019s attorney and Wild as the claimant \u2014 a request by the daughter. Accordingly, we conclude that the board erred in concluding that Wild\u2019s daughter had timely submitted a reconsideration request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We turn to petitioners\u2019 second assignment of error, in which they challenge the alternate basis on which the board relied to reverse the ALJ\u2019s order. Specifically, petitioners assign error to the board\u2019s conclusion that SAIF\u2019s \u201cmailing of the Notice of Closure to [Wild\u2019s] \u2018estate\u2019 does not satisfy the mailing requirements of OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>According to the board, OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d) required SAIF to mail the notice of closure to the last known address of the claimant, claimant\u2019s beneficiary, or claimant\u2019s attorney. Relying on that rule, the board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cA \u2018claimant\u2019 is a \u2018party\u2019 to a claim. ORS 656.005(21). Here, the deceased worker died on April 16, 2006. Thus, when SAIF mailed the August 16, 2006, Notice of Closure to the decedent\u2019s \u2018estate,\u2019 the deceased worker was no longer a \u2018party.\u2019 Instead, by the time of the Notice of Closure, \u2018claimant\u2019 was the deceased worker\u2019s beneficiary, i.e., his surviving minor child. Therefore, the Notice of Closure would only be valid under the applicable rules if it was mailed to either \u2018claimant\u2019 (the decedent\u2019s minor child, his sole statutory beneficiary) or to \u2018claimant\u2019s attorney.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Hence, according to the board, because the notice of closure was not mailed to Wild or his daughter, \u201cthe only viable route for establishing the validity of the Notice of Closure is that a copy of the notice was mailed to \u2018claimant\u2019s attorney.\u2019 \u201d That led the board to reason that \u201cthe only legally supportable way to establish the validity of the Notice of Closure\u2019s issuance would be to conclude that the notice was mailed to counsel as the attorney for the statutory \u2018beneficiary,\u2019 i.e.[,] the decedent\u2019s minor child.\u201d Consequently, the board concluded that, \u201c[i]n the absence of a properly mailed copy of the Notice of Closure to \u2018claimant\u2019s attorney,\u2019 the notice would be procedurally invalid[,] * * * thereby necessitating the issuance of a corrected Notice of Closure that would be mailed to [Wild\u2019s daughter] (as decedent\u2019s sole statutory beneficiary) and her attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The board reasoned, in other words, that, if the attorney did <em>not </em>represent the daughter when he filed the reconsideration request, that is, if the board had erred in concluding that the attorney had filed a timely reconsideration request for the daughter, then the attorney was <em>not </em>the daughter\u2019s attorney when he received the notice of closure. Hence, the notice of closure would not have been mailed to any of the people specified in OAR 436-060-0017.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The parties\u2019 dispute about the board\u2019s alternate analysis turns on the function of OAR 436-060-0017, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>WCD\u2019s rule on \u201cRelease of a Claim Document.\u201d That rule provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201c(1) For the purpose of this rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201c(a) \u2018Documents\u2019 include, but are not limited to, medical records, vocational records, written and automated payment ledgers for both time loss and medical services, payroll records, recorded statements, insurer generated records (insurer generated records exclude a claim examiner\u2019s generated file notes, such as documentation or justification concerning setting or adjusting reserves, claims management strategy, or any privileged communications), all forms required to be filed with the director, <em>notices of closure, </em>electronic transmissions, and correspondence between the insurer, service providers, claimant, the division and/or the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201c* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201c(3) A <em>request </em>for copies of claim documents must be submitted to the insurer, self-insured employer, or their respective third party administrator, and copied simultaneously to defense counsel, if known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">\u201c(4) <em>The insurer must furnish, </em>without cost, legible copies of documents in its possession relating to a claim, <em>upon request of the claimant, claimant\u2019s attorney or claimant\u2019s beneficiary, at times other than those provided for under ORS 656.268 and OAR chapter 438, as provided in this rule. </em>Except as provided in OAR, 436-060-0180, an initial request by anyone other than the claimant or claimant\u2019s beneficiary must be accompanied by a worker signed attorney retention agreement or a medical release signed by the worker. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">\u201c* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">\u201c(7) <em>The insurer must furnish copies of documents within the following time frames:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">\u201c(a) The documents of open and closed files, and/or microfilmed files <em>must be mailed </em>within 14 days of receipt of a request, and copies of documents of archived files within 30 days of receipt of a <em>request.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">\u201c(b) If a claim is lost or has been destroyed, the insurer must so notify the requester in writing within 14 days of receiving the request for claim documents.

The insurer is not required to furnish copies to both the claimant or beneficiary and the attorney. However, if a claimant or beneficiary changes attorneys, the insurer must furnish the new attorney copies upon request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Here, our task in interpreting OAR 436-060-0017 is to determine the intent of the WCD director, who adopted the rule. <em>Perlenfein and Perlenfein, </em>316 Or 16, 20, 848 P2d 604 (1993). Because OAR 436-060-0017 was adopted by the director, the board\u2019s interpretation of the rule is not entitled to deference. <em>SAIF v. Donahue-Birran, </em>195 Or App 173, 181, 96 P3d 1282 (2004). As the following discussion explains, the board\u2019s application of OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d) ultimately founders because the board has not adequately explained why the rule\u2019s mailing requirements apply in this case and, also, why failure to comply with them would invalidate the notice of closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">As the text of OAR 436-060-0017 indicates, the rule governs the release of claim documents, including notices of closure that are <em>requested </em>from insurers. <em>See </em>OAR 436-060-0017(3), (4). Specifically, the rule requires an insurer to furnish copies of claim documents <em>\u201cupon request </em>of the claimant, claimant\u2019s attorney or claimant\u2019s beneficiary, <em>at times other than those provided for under ORS 656.268 </em>and OAR chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>438, as provided in this rule.\u201d OAR 436-060-0017(4) (emphasis added). In turn, subsection (7) of the rule requires the insurer to mail copies of documents within a specified number of days of receipt of such a request \u201cto the last known address of the claimant, claimant\u2019s beneficiary or claimant\u2019s attorney.\u201d OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The board does not identify in its order the document request that makes the requirements of OAR 436-060-0017 applicable in this case or by whom it was made. Nonetheless, in the cover letter attached to the attorney\u2019s reconsideration request, the attorney said, \u201cBy copy of this letter to SAIF Corp, claimant requests copies of all documents used to close this claim.\u201d Thus, the attorney made a request for claim documents. We have found no other document request in the record. The request was made by an attorney who identified himself as Wild\u2019s attorney, notwithstanding that Wild had died roughly four months earlier, and who identified Wild as the claimant. In light of that information, the board\u2019s assertion that, for purposes of compliance with the rule, the claimant was the daughter and, therefore, the documents had to be sent to the daughter\u2019s attorney, cannot be squared with the facts in the record. Hence, on this record, we disagree with the proposition that the rule required SAIF to mail the notice of closure to the daughter\u2019s attorney, with notice to the daughter, rather than to the attorney who had made the request, with notice to the claimant identified in the request, Wild.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We disagree with the board for the further reason that it has not identified a source of law or principle that supports its conclusion that Wild\u2019s daughter automatically became a party to Wild\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim when Wild died. Generally, people become parties to claims or cases by taking some action, for example, by filing a claim, pleading, motion, or other document. The daughter could have become a party to Wild\u2019s claim and perhaps, as a consequence, a claimant, by doing or submitting something regarding the claim, but we are not persuaded that she became a party simply because, and when, her father died.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Finally, even if the board were correct that SAIF violated OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d) by failing to mail the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>closure to the daughter or her attorney, the board has not adequately explained why the provisions of OAR 436-060-0017 \u2014 which address the release of claim documents in response to document requests \u2014 should control whether a notice of closure was validly issued, as opposed to the provisions in ORS 656.268 and other WCD rules that specifically identify to whom insurers must provide notice of closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">ORS 656.268(5)(a) provides that \u201c[t]he insurer or self-insured employer shall issue a notice of closure of * * * a claim to the worker, to the worker\u2019s attorney if the worker is represented, and to the director.\u201d In addition, OAR 436-030-0020(8), \u201cRequirements for Claim Closure,\u201d specifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201c[a] copy of the Notice of Closure must be mailed to each of the following persons at the same time, with each copy clearly identifying the intended recipient:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201c(a) The worker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">\u201c(b) The employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201c(c) The director; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">\u201c(d) The worker\u2019s attorney, if the worker is represented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Thus, the rule requires that, in addition to issuing a notice of closure to the individuals specified in ORS 656.268(5)(a), the insurer must mail the notice to the worker\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The notification requirement in OAR 436-030-0020(8) is also reflected in the WCD rule on \u201cInsurer Responsibility,\u201d which provides that, \u201c[w]hen an insurer issues a Notice of Closure * * *, the insurer is responsible for * * * [providing the director, the parties, and the worker\u2019s attorney if the worker is represented, a copy of the Notice of Closure\u201d and other associated notifications. OAR 436-030-0015(1)(a). By specifying that the insurer is responsible for providing the parties with a copy of the notice of closure, OAR 436-030-0015(1)(a) harmonizes with the requirement in OAR 436-030-0020(8) that both the worker and the employer (that is, the \u201cparties\u201d) receive the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Framed within that context, the requirement in OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d) for mailing copies of claim documents in response to document requests does not appear to bear on whether a notice of closure has been properly issued. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Rather, the requirements for issuance of a notice of closure are set out in other statutes and rules, as discussed. In light of those considerations, we are not persuaded that, if SAIF violated OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d) by failing to mail the notice of closure to the daughter or her attorney, that failure would invalidate the notice of closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Furthermore, and contrary to the daughter\u2019s assertion, our review of the relevant statutes and rules has not identified any provision that requires an insurer to identify a deceased worker\u2019s statutory beneficiaries and provide them with a copy of the notice of closure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The provisions specific to an insurer\u2019s issuance of a notice of closure, on their face, require only that the insurer mail the notice to the worker, the worker\u2019s attorney, the employer, and the WCD director. ORS 656.268(5)(a); OAR 436-030-0020(8). The record indicates that SAIF complied with those requirements, to the extent that it literally could after Wild died, by mailing the notice of closure to Wild\u2019s last known address, Wild\u2019s attorney, Wild\u2019s former employer, and the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We appreciate that a deceased worker\u2019s statutory beneficiaries must first become aware of their right to pursue the worker\u2019s compensation rights before they can act on that right. However, when SAIF issued the August 2006 notice of closure, no rule or statute that the parties have identified or that we have found required SAIF to identify Wild\u2019s statutory beneficiary and provide her with the notice of closure. While OAR 436-060-0017 did authorize statutory beneficiaries such as Wild\u2019s daughter to request a copy of the notice of closure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>nothing required insurers to provide notice of closure to beneficiaries independent of such a request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, we conclude that the board erred in concluding that SAIF\u2019s August 2006 notice of closure was procedurally invalid under OAR 436-060-0017(7)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"> All references to the Oregon Administrative Rules are to the 2006 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> All subsequent references to ORS 656.268 are to the 2005 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\"> The provisions of ORS 656.218 (2005) relevant to this case state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201c(1) In case of the death of a worker entitled to compensation, whether eligibility therefor or the amount thereof have been determined, payments shall be made for the period during which the worker, if surviving, would have been entitled thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201c* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201c(4) If the worker dies before filing a request for hearing, the persons described in subsection (5) of this section shall be entitled to file a request for hearing and to pursue the matter to final determination as to all issues presented by the request for hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">\u201c(5) The payments provided in this section shall be made to the persons who would have been entitled to receive death benefits if the injury causing the disability had been fatal. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">ORS 656.204(4)(a) (2005) provides, in turn, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">\u201c[i]f death results from the accidental injury, payments shall be made as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">\u201c* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-14\">\u201c(4)(a) If the worker leaves neither wife nor husband, but a child under 18 years of age, a monthly benefit equal to 4.35 times 25 percent of the average weekly wage shall be paid to each such child until the child becomes 18 years of age.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\"> The parties do not dispute that the attorney lost the authority to act on Wild\u2019s behalf when Wild died. <em>See, e.g., Hamilton v. Hughey, </em>284 Or 739, 743, 588 P2d 38 (1978). Hence, the attorney\u2019s reconsideration request was not a timely request <em>by Wild </em>that Wild\u2019s daughter could pursue to its conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\"> We recognize that ORS 656.268(5)(a)(C) requires the notice of closure to inform \u201c[a]ny beneficiaries of death benefits to which they may be entitled pursuant to ORS 656.204 and 656.208.\u201d We do not understand that provision to require insurers to identify a deceased worker\u2019s statutory beneficiaries and to provide them with a copy of the notice. Rather, we understand it to require only that the insurer include in the notice a statement that beneficiaries may be entitled to receive statutorily authorized death benefits. SAIF complied with that requirement by including in the August 16,2006, notice of closure the following statement: \u201cThe worker\u2019s beneficiaries are entitled to any unpaid compensation for temporary or permanent partial disability.\u201d It thus appears that the statutes and rules in effect in August 2006 reflect an assumption that, by requiring that the notice of closure be mailed to the worker and the worker\u2019s attorney, statutory beneficiaries would be informed of their rights through either the representative of the deceased worker\u2019s estate or the worker\u2019s former attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b511-5\"> Effective January 1, 2010, the WCD has clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201c(1) If a worker is deceased, regardless of the cause of death, an insurer must address all future notices and correspondence to the worker\u2019s estate or qualified beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201c(2) If a worker is deceased, regardless of the cause of death, an insurer must still provide a written notice of acceptance or denial of a claim and issue a Notice of Closure, when applicable, to the estate of the worker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">OAR 436-060-0012(1), (2). However, that rule was not in effect when SAIF issued the August 2006 notice of closure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
