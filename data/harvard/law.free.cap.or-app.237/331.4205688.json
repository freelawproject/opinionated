J.</author>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Defendant, who entered a conditional plea of guilty, ORS 135.335(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894, appeals from the resulting judgment, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress statements that she made following a police officer\u2019s warrantless search of her wallet. We agree with defendant that the search of her wallet violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that her statements were the unattenuated product of that illegality. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress her statements and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We take the uncontroverted facts from the testimony of the arresting officer, Deluca, and a corrections deputy, Myers, who were the only two witnesses to testify at the suppression hearing. Deluca arrested defendant on an outstanding warrant for criminal mistreatment approximately six to 10 feet from her parked vehicle. According to Deluca, defendant, at that point, was \u201cvery cooperative. She was quiet, she was a little stunned * * * about the warrant, but she was * * * very cooperative and * * * understanding. She just had questions about the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">At the time of her arrest, defendant was holding a wallet that was approximately \u201cfour to five inches and not that tall.\u201d Deluca asked defendant to place the wallet on the hood of her car, hut defendant did not comply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the officer,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201c[defendant] started making movements to the driver\u2019s door of her vehicle and she wanted to put the wallet inside the vehicle. For officer safety reasons we said \u2018no.\u2019 We had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>just place our hands on her. We didn\u2019t have to use use of force but just place our hands on her and prevent her from getting in the vehicle, and told her \u2018no, put the wallet on the hood of the car, put your hands behind your back.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">When asked, at the suppression hearing, to explain his concerns about defendant\u2019s movement toward her vehicle, Deluca replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the vehicle. I also don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the wallet. * * * I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s weapons, contraband, means of escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">After Deluca made another request of defendant to place her wallet on the hood of the car, defendant \u201ccomplied, placed her hands behind her back.\u201d Deluca \u201chandcuffed her, and from there we searched the wallet[.]\u201d When Deluca opened the wallet, he saw a \u201cplastic baggy\u201d with methamphetamine and defendant\u2019s identification and credit cards. Deluca then</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201ctold [defendant] about what I have found, read her her Miranda warning and began to question her about her use, if I\u2019d find fingerprints on it, that, and was the last time she used, how much was it worth, and she provided all the information needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201c* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201c* * * [S]he told me it was approximately a twenty sack, which is street terms for about 2, 2.0 grams, worth about $20. She told me that she eats the methamphetamine and that we would not find any other paraphernalia on her person or, or in her car. And that if we did take fingerprints of the bag, we would find her fingerprints on this bag of methamphetamine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">According to Deluca, if he had not searched the wallet, it \u201cwould have been taken with [defendant] to the Deschutes County jail for reasons of identification.\u201d At the suppression hearing, Myers, a corrections deputy at the jail, testified that, pursuant to a policy, when an arrestee is booked into the jail, \u201c[a]ll the possessions in their pockets are taken out and placed onto the counter to be inventoried as well as purses, wallets, and everything else.\u201d The deputy testified that, if defendant had had the wallet in her possession when she arrived at the jail, it would have been searched pursuant to the inventory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Defendant moved to suppress the evidence found in the wallet and defendant\u2019s subsequent statements under Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant contended that the warrant-less search of her wallet did not fall within a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. Specifically, defendant asserted that the search incident to arrest doctrine did not apply because, in this case, there were no officer safety concerns and the search was unnecessary to prevent the destruction of evidence or to discover evidence relevant to the crime of criminal mistreatment for which defendant was arrested. Accordingly, defendant asserted, because the search was unlawful and the evidence obtained as a result of the search was the unattenuated product of that illegality, the evidence should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Conversely, before the trial court, the state contended that the search of defendant\u2019s wallet was a valid search incident to arrest on officer safety grounds. Alternatively, the state contended that, even if the search of defendant\u2019s wallet was not a valid search incident to arrest, the methamphetamine would have been inevitably discovered during the inventory of defendant\u2019s possessions at the jail. The prosecutor acknowledged, however, that, even under the state\u2019s inevitable discovery theory,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201cpotentially the statements made would be suppressed in that had the officer not searched the wallet there at the scene but the wallet was found during the booking process, * * * I can\u2019t say the same questions would have been asked or answered by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion, the court noted that there was no challenge to defendant\u2019s arrest pursuant to the warrant and reasoned that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201c[s]earch incident to arrest gives an officer the right to search the person for officer safety, for evidence of a crime, for means of escape. I think the issue here was, was really officer safety, means of escape, and the officer * * * was authorized to search that wallet at the scene.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Alternatively, the court reasoned that it was \u201cinevitable that [the wallet] would have been searched pursuant to the inventory search procedure at the jail had it not been located at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>scene\u201d and, thus, even if Deluca\u2019s search of the wallet was unlawful, the methamphetamine would not be suppressed. However, the court noted that a different result would be required with respect to defendant\u2019s statements if Deluca\u2019s search of the wallet was unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u201c[I]f the search incident to arrest was invalid and this motion to suppress was being denied solely based upon the inevitable search at the jail, then I think the statements made by the defendant between the time of her arrest and her arrival at the jail would be inadmissible and suppressed, but that\u2019s not what I found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cI found that it was a valid search incident to an arrest. Therefore, * * * I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to suppress any of her statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, she entered a guilty plea reserving, in writing, the right to appeal the court\u2019s ruling on that motion. ORS 135.335(3). This appeal ultimately followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On appeal, the parties\u2019 contentions are more limited than they were before the trial court. As in the trial court, defendant contends on appeal that the search of defendant\u2019s wallet was unlawful under Article I, section 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to defendant, the search \u201cdid not qualify as a search incident to arrest. Defendant had relinquished control of the wallet and was handcuffed during the search. Therefore, any potential threat posed by the contents of the wallet had dissipated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Unlike her position in the trial court, however, defendant \u201cdoes not contend that any contraband recovered from the wallet should have been suppressed.\u201d Instead, defendant \u201cargues only that [her] statements should have been suppressed.\u201d According to defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201ca minimal factual nexus existed between defendant\u2019s statements and the unlawful search. Because defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>statements were closely connected to and not independent of the officer\u2019s unlawful conduct, the statements were obtained through exploitation in violation of Article I, section 9. Therefore, the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence of defendant\u2019s statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The state counters that the denial of suppression of defendant\u2019s statements was correct for either of two reasons. First, the state reiterates its position before the trial court that the warrantless search of defendant\u2019s wallet was lawful under the search incident to arrest doctrine because of the arresting officer\u2019s \u201creasonable concerns regarding officer safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Second, the state contends that, even if the search was unlawful, suppression of defendant\u2019s subsequent statements was not required because \u201cthe provision of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and defendant\u2019s decision to speak with full knowledge of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, broke any causal link between the unlawful search and defendant\u2019s statements.\u201d Although the state acknowledges that our decision in <em>State v. Ayles, </em>220 Or App 606, 188 P3d 378 (2008), <em>aff'd, </em>348 Or 622, 237 P3d 805 (2010), \u201crequires the suppression of defendant\u2019s statements in this case if the wallet search was unlawful,\u201d it asserts that our decision in <em>Ayles </em>\u201cis incorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">With the issues so framed, in determining whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress her statements, we must resolve two subsidiary questions: (1) Did the warrantless search of defendant\u2019s wallet violate Article I, section 9? (2) If it did, were defendant\u2019s statements obtained through the exploitation of that unlawful search? We begin with the first of those two questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">As previously noted, Article I, section 9, guarantees \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure[.]\u201d \u201c[Warrantless * * * searches * * * are <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless falling within one of the few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). One such exception is a search incident to arrest. <em>State v. Hite, </em>198 Or App 1, 6, 107 P3d 677 (2005). \u201cThere are three valid justifications for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>a search incident to arrest: to protect the officers\u2019 safety or public safety, to prevent the destruction of evidence or the escape of the defendant, and to discover evidence relevant to the crime for which the defendant is being arrested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, although defendant\u2019s wallet was on her person at the time of the arrest, any search of it was not relevant to the crime for which defendant was being arrested \u2014 that is criminal mistreatment. Thus, only the first of those justifications \u2014 that is, officer safety \u2014 is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In <em>State v. Hoskinson, </em>320 Or 83, 879 P2d 180 (1994), the Supreme Court addressed the officer safety justification for a search incident to arrest. In that case, after arresting the defendant, the officer handcuffed him and conducted \u201ca \u2018pat-down search\u2019 of defendant\u2019s person. During the pat-down, the officer took a wallet from [the] defendant\u2019s back pocket. The officer opened and looked inside the wallet, discovering a small plastic bag containing powder residue that later tests confirmed was methamphetamine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85. During the suppression hearing, the officer testified that, before he opened the wallet, he could not tell whether it contained a weapon or means of escape and that it was his \u201c \u2018normal practice * * * to obtain the wallet and see if there are any weapons or any indications of things that would be used to escape that would alert [him] to search the subject more thoroughly and extensively for additional means of escape.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court in that case ultimately concluded that the search was a valid search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The Supreme Court disagreed. The court began by explaining the basic principles that govern a search incident to arrest on officer safety grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201c[A] pat-down or limited search for weapons to protect the officer or to prevent escape would be justified whenever a person is taken into custody. Beyond that limited search, however, a further search incident to arrest conducted to protect officer safety or to prevent escape must be reasonable, taking into account all the facts surrounding the arrest. Thus, an officer may conduct a further protective search if he or she develops a reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulable facts, that the person in custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>poses a serious threat of harm or escape and that a search would lessen or eliminate that threat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 87 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Hoskinson </em>then discussed, and distinguished, its recent application of those principles in <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 854 P2d 421 (1993), a case in which the court had upheld a search on officer safety grounds. As the <em>Hoskinson </em>court explained, in <em>Ehly, </em>the defendant \u201cappeared at the time to be under the influence of methamphetamine,\u201d \u201c[t]he officers knew that the defendant was a friend of a man, whom the officers saw leaving the motel parking lot and who was believed to be in possession of a handgun,\u201d and \u201cthe defendant began to rummage through his gym bag, with both hands concealed.\u201d 320 Or at 87. Accordingly, as the <em>Hoskinson </em>court noted, under such circumstances, the police officers in <em>Ehly </em>\u201chad a reasonable suspicion to believe that there was a gun in the bag\u201d and \u201cit was reasonable for one of the officers to dump out the contents of the <em>bag.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The <em>Hoskinson </em>court then explained that the circumstances presented in that case were materially different from those in <em>Ehly.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\u201cUnlike <em>in Ehly, </em>where the officers had a particularized suspicion of danger, the officer in this case testified that he searched defendant\u2019s wallet because it was his \u2018normal practice\u2019 to do so. Indeed, in this case, the officer testified affirmatively that he had <em>no </em>specific reason to believe that defendant\u2019s wallet contained either a weapon or a means of escape. He testified that his training and experience led him to believe that the wallet <em>could have </em>contained one of those items, but that he could not tell until he opened the wallet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cThere is nothing to suggest that the officer had a <em>reasonable </em>suspicion that defendant posed an immediate threat of escape or harm. It is not tenable to suggest that the mere fact that defendant carried a wallet gave the officer reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant posed a threat of serious physical harm or a threat of escape. Accordingly, the officer\u2019s decision to search the wallet was not reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>320 Or at 87-88 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the court held that \u201cthe search violated [the] defendant\u2019s right under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches, and the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The circumstances in this case are closely similar to those in <em>Hoskinson. </em>Here, although defendant did not initially comply with Deluca\u2019s request to place her wallet on the hood of the car, she complied with his second request, and Deluca testified that force was not used to obtain defendant\u2019s compliance. Thereafter, defendant was handcuffed and no longer had control of the wallet. Deluca\u2019s only justification for searching the wallet was that he did not \u201cknow what\u2019s in the wallet\u201d and did not \u201cknow if there\u2019s weapons, contraband, means of escape.\u201d As in <em>Hoskinson, </em>there is nothing in this record to suggest that the officer \u201chad a <em>reasonable </em>suspicion that defendant posed an immediate threat of escape or harm.\u201d 320 Or at 88 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, we conclude that the search of defendant\u2019s wallet violated Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Having concluded that the search was unlawful, we turn to the second question of whether defendant\u2019s statements were obtained through exploitation of that illegality. Here, after finding the methamphetamine in the wallet, the officer confronted defendant with what he had found, read defendant her <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and asked defendant several questions about her use of that drug. Based on the testimony at the hearing, those events occurred in rapid succession. Defendant\u2019s detailed incriminating statements concerning her use of methamphetamine and the amount and value of the methamphetamine immediately ensued. Under those circumstances, the minimal factual nexus between the unlawful search and defendant\u2019s incriminating statements is patent and the statements must be suppressed unless the state can demonstrate that <em>the Miranda </em>warnings were sufficient to attenuate the taint of the illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In that regard, as noted, the state acknowledges that our decision in <em>Ayles </em>is controlling and requires the suppression of defendant\u2019s statements \u2014 but contends that <em>Ayles </em>(which was pending before the Supreme Court at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the briefing and oral argument of this case) was wrongly decided. The Supreme Court recently affirmed our decision in <em>Ayles, State v. Ayles, </em>348 Or 622, 237 P3d 805 (2010), and nothing in the court\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> calls into question our conclusion that the rendition of <em>Miranda </em>warnings there did not operate per <em>se </em>to attenuate a suspect\u2019s statements upon being confronted with evidence obtained as a result of unlawful police conduct. <em>See Ayles, </em>220 Or App at 614, 615-16 (rejecting the argument that \u201cbeing given <em>Miranda </em>warnings operates as a \u2018universal solvent\u2019 to break the causal chain\u201d (footnote omitted); holding that \u201cthe mere proximate provision of <em>Miranda </em>warnings following an unlawful seizure or entry does not <em>per se </em>attenuate the taint of the prior illegal police conduct\u201d). The same principle is dispositive of the state\u2019s attenuation argument here. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress her statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> ORS 135.335(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">\u201cWith the consent of the court and the state, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or no contest reserving, in writing, the right, on appeal from the judgment, to a review of an adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion.

However, because we agree with defendant that the officer conducted an unlawful search in violation of Article I, section 9, and ultimately reverse in light of that violation, we do not reach defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b379-5\"> Or, indeed, in the concurring and dissenting opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
