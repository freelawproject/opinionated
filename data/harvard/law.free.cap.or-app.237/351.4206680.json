Defendant\u2019s driving records revealed that his license had been suspended. The deputy stopped defendant solely because his license had been suspended. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress all evidence that the deputy discovered during his random investigation. Defendant argues that the deputy\u2019s investigation constituted an unreasonable search in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and that the deputy\u2019s investigation imposed an unequal and standardless burden on defendant in contravention of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution. We review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions under Article I, sections 9 and 20, for errors of law, <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">On review for errors of law, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appellate courts if there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support those findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We state the facts according to that standard. Two on-duty Jackson County Sheriffs deputies were driving in a patrol car. Jackson County Sheriffs deputies regularly run registration plates of vehicles that they encounter. They do that for two reasons. First, they do so during traffic stops to identify the stopped individuals, to determine whether the stopped vehicles are stolen, and to assess the validity of the vehicles\u2019 registration plates \u2014 that is, whether the plates have been switched from other vehicles or are current. Second, they also routinely randomly run registration plates that they observe in public to determine whether vehicles have been stolen or whether the registration plates are valid. Although there was no written policy mandating that the deputies randomly run registration plates on vehicles they encountered, the deputies are trained to run registration plates for the described reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>As the two deputies were on patrol, they drove past defendant and observed his vehicle, registration plate, and face. In accordance with his training, the deputy in the passenger seat randomly ran the registration plate on the vehicle that defendant was driving.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deputy\u2019s decision was not based on defendant\u2019s appearance or a belief that defendant had committed a traffic infraction. Instead, the trial court found that the deputy\u2019s decision to run defendant\u2019s plate was purely random in the sense that the deputy could have run anyone\u2019s license plate. It observed that, consistently with the deputy\u2019s practice, \u201cwe are all subject to the same possibility, which is having our license plate run at such time as we choose to drive down the street.\u201d The deputy\u2019s random investigation revealed that the Oregon Department of Transportation, Driver and Motor Vehicles Division (DMV) had suspended the vehicle owner\u2019s driving privileges. Then, according to the deputy\u2019s routine practice, he accessed a Jackson County booking photo of the vehicle\u2019s owner to determine whether the vehicle\u2019s owner was the driver whom the deputy had observed. The photo matched the driver\u2019s appearance. After concluding that defendant was driving while suspended, the deputies stopped the vehicle, confirmed that defendant was driving while his license was suspended, and then arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all evidence derived from the deputy\u2019s random investigation. That evidence, defendant argued, was obtained through an unreasonable search under Article I, section 9, and was also an unlawful exercise of police discretion under Article I, section 20. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and defendant filed a conditional guilty plea to DWS, reserving his right to appeal the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. On appeal, defendant renews the arguments that he made in support of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We first consider defendant\u2019s argument regarding a warrantless search. Article I, section 9, provides, in pertinent part, \u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure.\u201d A police officer conducts an Article I, section 9, search by intruding upon a person\u2019s privacy interest. \u201cA privacy interest * * * is an interest in freedom from particular forms of scrutiny.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>306 Or 157, 170, 759 P2d 1040 (1988). If the government conduct did not invade a privacy interest, then no search occurred; Article I, section 9, is not implicated, and the inquiry is concluded. <em>State v. Meredith, </em>337 Or 299, 303, 96 P3d 342 (2004). Whether government conduct intrudes upon a person\u2019s cognizable privacy is a question of law. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>340 Or 319, 336, 131 P3d 173, <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1079 (2006). Accordingly, we first consider whether defendant has a protected privacy interest in his driving records.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Defendant identifies two potential privacy interests. First, he argues that, although his registration plate was in plain view as he drove on public streets, his driving records were not. Defendant concludes that he has a privacy interest in his driving records because they are not generally available to the public. Second, defendant argues that ORS 802.177 creates a privacy interest by prohibiting the Department of Transportation (DOT) from disclosing personal information contained in driving records.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Defendant\u2019s first argument relies on <em>Campbell. </em>In that case, police officers attached a transmitter to the defendant\u2019s vehicle and then pervasively and constantly monitored the defendant\u2019s movements. 306 Or at 160-61. That use of a transmitter implicated the defendant\u2019s privacy interest in moving about free from scrutiny, because \u201cthe police monitoring of the transmitter allowed the government to observe a range of conduct that normally would have been inaccessible to the general public or to government officials.\u201d <em>Meredith, </em>337 Or at 307 (summarizing <em>Campbell). </em>Defendant argues that, as in <em>Campbell, </em>\u201cinstantaneous and standardless access to the electronic DMV database creates a situation that exposed information about defendant that is otherwise not observable by either an officer or by members of the general public and is, thus, private.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Campbell </em>is misplaced. The officer\u2019s scrutiny of defendant\u2019s driving records is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>comparable to the pervasive and constant surveillance that occurred in <em>Campbell. See </em>306 Or at 172. To the contrary, here, the deputy\u2019s investigation was neither pervasive nor constant. The deputy\u2019s random access to defendant\u2019s driving records was prompted by the deputy\u2019s contemporaneous observation of defendant, and was limited to the information contained in defendant\u2019s DMV driving records.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><em>Johnson </em>further undermines defendant\u2019s argument. In <em>Johnson, </em>the state subpoenaed the defendant\u2019s bank, medical, cellular telephone, employment, and other similar records. The defendant objected to evidence that he drove a specific car. The Supreme Court rejected \u201cany claim that [the] defendant might have a cognizable privacy interest in the license plates on his car, photographs taken of him in a public place, the address that he provided to his employer for tax and payroll purposes, or the telephone usage records of his employer.\u201d 340 Or at 335-36. It then considered the defendant\u2019s argument that he had a privacy interest in his cellular telephone calls. The court recognized that the defendant had a privacy interest in the <em>content </em>of the phone calls, but rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that he had a privacy interest in the <em>records </em>of those calls. It reasoned, \u201cThe cellular telephone provider generated and maintained those records * * * for the provider\u2019s own, separate, and legitimate business purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Here, defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and car registration records were created by the state for its own purposes, just as in <em>Johnson, </em>where the cellular telephone provider\u2019s records were created for the provider\u2019s own purposes. The state has a substantial administrative interest in confirming that only licensed persons drive properly registered vehicles on public roads. ORS 803.300 requires vehicles to be registered. ORS 803.540 requires vehicles to display registration plates, in part, as confirmation that the vehicles are registered. ORS 803.550 prohibits obscuring registration plates. The state can access a person\u2019s driving records by observing a driver\u2019s registration plate that is displayed in plain view and looking up that registration plate number in the state\u2019s own records. <em>See Higgins v. DMV, </em>335 Or 481, 487, 72 P3d 628 (2003) (\u201cThe characters that the state assigns to a vehicle\u2019s registration plates facilitate the prompt identification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>vehicle for law enforcement purposes.\u201d). Indeed, the state has created an electronic system that allows authorized agencies and government entities to access the driving records of individuals and vehicles. <em>See </em>ORS 181.730 (establishing the Law Enforcement Data System). Notwithstanding our conclusion that defendant does not have an inherent privacy interest in his driving records, we next consider whether the state granted defendant a privacy interest in his driving records.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Defendant argues that ORS 802.177 creates a privacy interest in the personal information in his driving record by generally prohibiting the DMV, which is a division of the DOT, from disclosing personal information contained in those records. We agree with defendant that ORS 802.177 limits the disclosure of a person\u2019s personal information; however, that limitation extends no farther than the statute itself provides. <em>State v. Makuch/Riesterer, </em>340 Or 658, 671, 136 P3d 658 (2006). The limitation does not extend as far as defendant contends, because defendant fails to persuasively explain why the exceptions to ORS 802.179, which are expressly incorporated by ORS 802.177, do not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We construe the statute by considering its text in context along with any legislative history offered by the parties, if helpful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). ORS 802.177 generally prohibits the DMV from disclosing personal information contained in driving records to any person. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\"><em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in ORS 802.179, </em>neither the Department of Transportation nor any officer, employee or contractor of the department may knowingly disclose or otherwise make available to any person personal information about an individual that is obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">(Emphasis added.) An expressly incorporated exception to ORS 802.177, ORS 802.179(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201cThe Department of Transportation, upon request or as required by law, shall disclose personal information from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>motor vehicle record to a government agency for use in carrying out its governmental functions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Defendant argues that the exemption under ORS 802.179(1) applies only to a government entity\u2019s lawful function. Defendant concludes that the DMV \u201cwas not authorized to disclose [his] personal information in the course of satisfying the [deputy\u2019s] mere whims or curiosity.\u201d That argument is not persuasive. The deputy was on duty when he accessed defendant\u2019s driving records. One of the Jackson County Sheriffs duties is to arrest \u201call persons guilty of public offenses,\u201d ORS 206.010, and a sheriff is permitted to delegate his duties and authority to deputies, ORS 204.635(3). The deputy accessed defendant\u2019s driving records consistently with his governmental function of investigating to detect illegal activity. Because the exemption found in ORS 802.179(1) applies, defendant has no cognizable privacy interest in DMV records concerning him or vehicles registered to him under ORS 802.177, at least as to a law enforcement officer\u2019s investigation pursuant to the officer\u2019s duties. In conclusion, the deputy did not invade defendant\u2019s privacy interest. Therefore, there was no search under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We next consider whether the trial court erred in rejecting defendant\u2019s contention that the deputy\u2019s investigation of his driving records violated Article I, section 20. According to defendant, the deputy\u2019s action imposed an unequal burden on him because it \u201cnot only undercut defendant\u2019s ability to move freely through the public sphere without being subject to substantial scrutiny, but it also led to a criminal prosecution, one of the most severe burdens the government may impose on a citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Article I, section 20, provides that \u201c[n]o law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\u201d It proscribes two types of unequal treatment: \u201cfirst, to any citizen, and second, to any class of citizens. In other words, it may be invoked by an individual who demands equality of treatment with other individuals as well as by one who demands equal privileges or immunities for a class to which he or she belongs.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>291 Or 231, 237, 630 P2d 810 (1981). It \u201calso was early established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>that the guarantee reaches forbidden inequality in the administration of laws under delegated authority as well as in legislative enactments * * <em>Id. </em>at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"> Thus, \u201c[o]ne branch of Article I, section 20\u201d \u2014 the branch that defendant invokes in this case \u2014 calls for an \u201canalysis whether the government has made or applied a law so as to grant or deny privileges or immunities to an individual person without legitimate reasons related to that person\u2019s individual situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Said another way, the state must not distribute \u201ca benefit or burden in a haphazard, random, standardless, <em>ad hoc </em>fashion \u2014 that is, \u2018without any coherent, systematic policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Walton, </em>215 Or App 628, 633-34, 170 P3d 1122 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 671 (2008) (quoting <em>State v. Freeland, </em>295 Or 367, 375, 667 P2d 509 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">That said, \u201c[a] complaint of unequal treatment * * * cannot rest simply on the exercise of discretion.\u201d Rather, the defendant has the burden of proving that the state administered laws \u201c \u2018haphazardly by <em>\u2018ad hoc </em>decisions\u2019 that * * * do not \u2018uniformly rest on meaningful criteria that indeed make the privileges [or immunities] * * * equally available to all persons similarly situated, or, in the constitutional phrase, \u2018upon the same terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeland, </em>295 Or at 377 (quoting <em>State v. Edmonson, </em>291 Or 251, 254, 630 P2d 822 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">During the hearing on the motion to suppress, the deputy who ran defendant\u2019s plates testified regarding bis practice of running plates. The deputy testified that it is \u201can everyday activity\u2019 of his,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201cdirecting traffic stops, running plates \u2014 that I run plates routinely to know the individual that I am dealing with, to know whether it is a vehicle that has been stolen, plates have been switched, * * * and it is a good officer safety reason so that if I conduct, or before I conduct a traffic stop in knowing who I am dealing with before I get out of my vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Later, the deputy explained that he ran defendant\u2019s plates without any suspicion of criminal activity, and that he \u201crandomly run[s] plates to make sure that vehicles aren\u2019t stolen.\u201d That practice is \u201cjust normal course,\u201d a \u201cnormal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>On cross-examination, the deputy acknowledged that he was not aware of a \u201cpolicy that creates standards for how you are going to conduct these random license plate searches,\u201d and that he was not aware of a \u201cspoken custom or just informal policy that folks talk about in the Department.\u201d However, he testified that he is, in fact, trained to run plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Based on the deputy\u2019s testimony, defendant and the dissent conclude that the decision to run defendant\u2019s plates was essentially made <em>ad hoc, </em>unconstrained by any legitimate standards or criteria. The deputy\u2019s testimony could be read that way \u2014 as though he were making the decision to run the plates without any standard in mind. But that is not the only plausible reading of the deputy\u2019s testimony, nor \u2014 given our standard of review \u2014 is it the one we credit. <em>See, e.g., State v. Khoshnaw, </em>234 Or App 24, 26, 227 P3d 1188 (2010) (where trial court denies a motion to suppress, we \u201creview the record, and all inferences that it will support, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s findings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Though his testimony is not a model of clarity, the deputy explained that he runs license plates \u201crandomly\u201d in the ordinary course of his patrol duties, pursuant to his training. He further testified that, in this particular circumstance, he ran the plates after he saw \u201cthe license plate from the front of the truck, and * * * observed the face of the individual driving the truck.\u201d He then ran the plate \u201cjust to know who owned the vehicle that I am dealing with,\u201d to make sure that the vehicle was not stolen. The decision to run the plates, the deputy testified, \u201chad nothing to do with the individual\u2019s looks\u201d but was instead simply \u201ca normal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Viewed in the light most consistent with the trial court\u2019s ruling,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the deputy\u2019s testimony suggests that the decision to run the plates was not a haphazard or <em>ad hoc </em>decision at all. Instead, it was the result of a confluence of training, time, and opportunity: the deputy was trained to run plates to investigate for stolen vehicles; based on the position of defendant\u2019s vehicle, the deputy was able to see defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>front license plate and was able to make out defendant\u2019s physical characteristics, which would have allowed him to compare the driver to the registered owner. Under those circumstances, the result was that defendant\u2019s license plates were run as part of the deputy\u2019s normal activity of investigating for stolen vehicles. In the course of that activity, <em>any </em>driver who happened to be coming out of the parking lot at that moment would have been subject to the same scrutiny. There was nothing arbitrary or whimsical about the deputy\u2019s decision to run defendant\u2019s license plates; rather, that decision was \u201crandom\u201d \u2014 in the deputy\u2019s words \u2014 only in the sense that, because of the juxtaposition of time and place, the plates that were run were defendant\u2019s, and not some other citizen\u2019s. So understood, we cannot conclude that defendant was denied any privilege or immunity on the same terms as other citizens \u2014 the benchmark of Article I, section 20. <em>See Clark, </em>291 Or at 246 (\u201cWe do not believe equal protection goes so far as to require previously stated standards as long as no discriminatory practice or illegitimate motive is shown and the use of discretion has a defensible explanation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Given our view of the record, we need not address some of the more provocative issues raised in the dissent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We simply note that Article I, section 20, has never been applied to require police officers to articulate and adhere to criteria for every discretionary patrol activity that might occur in the ordinary course of a day. To extend <em>Freeland </em>in that way\u2014 that is, to require officers to justify decisions such as stopping one speeding car as opposed to another \u2014 would represent a quantum leap from where our Article I, section 20, jurisprudence has gone before.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\"> ORS 811.182 was amended in 2009.

That kind of discrimination is <em>not </em>an issue in this case. Defendant never asserted discrimination based on race, economic status, or gender. For that reason, the lead does not discuss a hypothetical problem that is not raised by the facts in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b401-6\">SERCOMBE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqL\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the <em>ad hoc </em>investigation of the license registration of a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>driven by defendant did not violate Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. I also agree that the investigation did not deny defendant an official privilege or immunity made available to other citizens of this state as proscribed by Article I, section 20. That provision provides that <em>\u201c[n]o law shall be passed </em>granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This case does not involve a law that classifies privileges in impermissible ways (\u201cgranting to any * * * class of citizens privileges [ ] or immunities\u201d) or that affects an individual citizen (\u201cgranting to any citizen * * * privileges[ ] or immunities\u201d) by a delegation of authority to a government agent to offer or restrict an official privilege or immunity that is available to that person. Under our case law, those are the types of laws that are regulated by Article I, section 20. The action of the police officer here was not taken under a law that either directly or indirectly classifies license check inquiries or creates privileges or immunities for persons affected by those inquiries. Thus, Article I, section 20, is immaterial to the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The guarantee under Article I, section 20, \u201creaches forbidden inequality in the administration of laws under delegated authority as well as in legislative enactments.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>291 Or 231, 239, 630 P2d 810, <em>cert den, </em>454 US 1084 (1981). That delegated authority could be conferred by different types of laws. For example, the legislature could confer authority on an agent to grant or deny benefits or permissions. Such an enactment violates Article I, section 20, when it empowers the agent to confer privileges or immunities that the legislature itself could not confer directly. <em>See White v. Holman, </em>44 Or 180, 74 P 933 (1904) (statute violates Article I, section 20, when it authorized a board to grant an exclusive privilege to operate a sailors\u2019 boarding house).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In such a case, the law creates the privilege or immunity <em>(e.g., </em>a license, permit, or legal advantage) and directs the agent to allocate or determine that advantage <em>(e.g., </em>grant or deny the license under particular circumstances). The statutes are replete with laws that create privileges or immunities by directing official action to allow or limit those privileges. For example, professional licensing requirements and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>oversight statutes, local government ordinances to allow zoning variances, and state regulations allowing water appropriations are all laws that create a legal privilege by directing actions by a governmental agent to allow, deny, or limit that entitlement. Those types of laws fit squarely within the scope of Article I, section 20, because they directly delegate authority to grant a privilege. Laws involving the specific authority to create a benefit are tested under Article I, section 20, for whether they permit outcomes that violate the constitutional command by, for example, improperly allocating a privilege or immunity or creating a monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In other cases, a law <em>separately </em>creates the benefit, advantage, or right that is administered under more broadly delegated authority from the legislature. The contemporary decisions on citizen rights under Article I, section 20, involve this type of benefit-creating law that is administered by an official under that official\u2019s general legal authority. <em>See City of Salem v. Bruner, </em>299 Or 262, 702 P2d 70 (1985) (administration by police officer of statutes creating different appeal rights under local ordinances defining the authority of a police officer); <em>State v. Freeland, </em>295 Or 367, 667 P2d 509 (1983), and <em>Clark, </em>291 Or 231 (administration by district attorney of dual charging system created by statute and constitutional provision under general state statutes defining the authority of a district attorney); <em>State v. Walton, </em>215 Or App 628, 170 P3d 1122 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 671 (2008) (administration by prosecutor of statutes creating different sanctions for conduct by probationer under state statutes defining the authority of a district attorney).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In this case, the deputy sheriff exercised authority conferred by statute. <em>See </em>ORS 206.010 (setting out general duties of a sheriff, including authority to \u201c[a]rrest * * * all persons guilty of public offenses\u201d); ORS 204.635(3) (delegating authority to deputy sheriff to \u201cperform any act or duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>that the principal has\u201d). Those statutes did not specifically authorize the deputy to establish the purported privilege or immunity at stake in this case. The question becomes whether some other law did.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The resulting Article I, section 20, inquiry, as framed by <em>Bruner, </em>is whether \u201ca person is denied some <em>advantage to which he or she would be entitled </em>but for a choice made by a governmental authority.\u201d 299 Or at 268-69 (emphasis added). An <em>entitlement </em>is necessarily legal in character; otherwise, the claim is unenforceable and without legal status. A privilege or immunity, in this entitlement sense, is an advantage that is created or embellished by a constitutional or statutory policy. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 268 (\u201c[T]he fact that two processes exist by which one person may enjoy advantages not available to another is precisely what triggers the Article I, section 20, concerns we addressed in <em>Freeland\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Thus, I interpret the <em>Clark </em>line of cases to require official consistency when a government official is tasked by law to create or allocate a specific legal right or is authorized by law to administer a privilege or immunity created by a separate law. Where I part company with the dissent is in its assumption that a citizen enjoys a privilege or immunity, in this constitutional sense, to be free of any bad consequence of official action. Under that logic, any arbitrary exercise of official discretion that produces some detriment to a defendant \u2014 such as a police officer\u2019s decision to pursue one of two speeding cars \u2014 violates Article I, section 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In my view, the reach of the provision is not that broad. Instead, a privilege or immunity under Article I, section 20, must be \u201cgranted\u201d in the sense of achieving that status by legislative or constitutional enactment; it is only official action with respect to that type of privilege or immunity that is constrained by the provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, there is no law that creates or regulates a privilege or immunity to be free from license plate scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Thus, defendant does not point to any entitlement created by law that is given to others but not him. Indeed, both the majority and the dissent agree that no person has a legal entitlement under Article I, section 9, to be free from official scrutiny in these circumstances. It is difficult to conclude that defendant has a privilege to obtain what others lack.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">I concur in the decision for these separate reasons.</p>\n<judges id=\"b405-5\">Landau, J., joins in this concurrence.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\"> Of course, when a law is challenged as granting privileges to a \u201cclass of citizens\u201d under Article I, section 20, the law itself creates a privilege or immunity by classifying groups for purposes of advantaging one group and not another. The advantage created by the classification is the privilege or immunity at stake. The question is whether such a benefit-conferring law is also required when an official action is said to violate Article I, section 20, because the action grants a privilege or immunity to a \u201ccitizen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\"> Our cases also apply Article I, section 20, to classifications of citizens made by a rule or practice of administrative agencies. <em>See, e.g., Tanner v.

The officer stopped defendant and cited him for that offense. ORS 811.182. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence derived from the database on the ground that, in accessing private information about him without any suspicion of unlawful activity, the officer conducted a search in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, and that, in randomly choosing defendant\u2019s car as the subject of an inquiry, the officer failed to treat him \u201con the same terms, * * * equally,\u201d with other citizens, in violation of Article I, section 20. The court denied the motion. Defendant renews his constitutional arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The lead opinion concludes that accessing defendant\u2019s personal information was not a search for purposes of Article I, section 9, and that the random selection of defendant\u2019s car as the subject of the inquiry did not offend Article I, section 20.1 concur with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion regarding Article I, section 9. A person who voluntarily provides DMV with personal information does not suffer any loss of freedom from unwanted scrutiny when a state law enforcement officer observes that information in the course of enforcing traffic laws. <em>See State v. Campbell, </em>306 Or 157, 171, 759 P2d 1040 (1988) (defining \u201csearch\u201d as a \u201cpractice, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>engaged in wholly at the discretion of the government, will significantly impair \u2018the people\u2019s\u2019 freedom from scrutiny\u201d). However, I believe the lead opinion\u2019s Article I, section 20, analysis is wrong, and I therefore dissent from that part of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">A well-established and unambiguous body of Supreme Court precedent establishes the framework for adjudicating the Article I, section 20, issue in this case. Oregon\u2019s equality guarantee protects \u201ccitizen[s]\u201d as well as \u201cclass[es]\u201d of citizens. It provides, \u201cNo law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\u201d Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 20. The latter protection has its counterpart in traditional federal Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence: A person claims that he or she is unlawfully denied a privilege or immunity based on the person\u2019s membership in some societally recognized class such as race, religion, or gender. The former protection is less familiar: An individual claims that he or she is denied (or that another person is granted) a privilege or immunity, not based on the person\u2019s class membership, but based simply on the fact that other individuals who are similarly situated for all relevant purposes are receiving the benefit and the claimant is not (or <em>vice versa) </em>\u2014 that, in other words, the privilege or immunity is not made available to all individuals \u201cupon the same terms.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>291 Or 231, 237, 630 P2d 810, <em>cert den, </em>454 US 1084 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">This court and the Supreme Court have developed a familiar, if not always seamless, approach to class-based Article I, section 20, claims. <em>See, e.g., Tanner v. OHSU, </em>157 Or App 502, 520-23, 971 P2d 435 (1998) (summarizing analysis; calling it a \u201cwork in progress\u201d). The court\u2019s approach to individual-based claims is less familiar, but it is more consistent and more easily stated. The prohibition against unlawful individual-based distribution of privileges or immunities applies not only against those who enact laws \u2014 legislators or the people through the initiative \u2014 but to those who administer laws through delegated authority. <em>Clark, </em>291 Or at 239. Unlawful individual-based denial (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>conferral) of a privilege or immunity occurs when government engages in \u201cwholly standardless application of a general law,\u201d id., that is, when government distributes privileges or immunities \u201cpurely haphazardly or otherwise on terms that have no satisfactory explanation,\u201d <em>State v. Edmonson, </em>291 Or 251, 254, 630 P2d 822 (1981). Article I, section 20, restrains \u201chaphazard, purely <em>ad hoc, </em>use of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Freeland, </em>295 Or 367, 373, 667 P2d 509 (1983). There must be \u201cconsistency among similar cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. Choices must \u201cadhere[ ] to sufficiently consistent standards to represent a coherent, systematic policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375. The rule has broad application: <em>\u201cWhenever </em>a person is denied some advantage to which he or she would be entitled but for a <em>choice made by a government authority, </em>Article I, section 20, requires that the government decision to offer or deny the advantage be made \u2018by permissible criteria and consistently applied.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Salem v. Bruner, </em>299 Or 262, 268-69, 702 P2d 70 (1985) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Several considerations limit the apparently dramatic sweep of this requirement limiting government actors\u2019 discretion. First, the burden of proving the haphazard, systemless, <em>ad hoc </em>application of the law falls on the person challenging the government action \u2014 here, of course, defendant. The obvious difficulty of proving a negative probably accounts for the fact that an individual-based Article I, section 20, claim has succeeded in only one case: <em>Freeland, </em>295 Or at 384. Second, the criteria that must be consistently applied need not be written; in fact, they need not be consciously adopted, pre-existing policies. \u201cEven without predetermined rules or guidelines, policies * * * can develop from consistency in practice, and consistency in practice can be both furthered and shown to exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378. Thus, the state can successfully defend against an individual-based Article I, section 20, challenge by articulating a rationale underlying the exercise of discretion, and that defense will defeat the challenge unless the challenger can demonstrate that the rationale has not been consistently followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>According to defendant, this case presents a rare but clear violation of Article I, section 20, that is not based on class membership. The arresting officer testified that his decision to enter defendant\u2019s license plate number into the DMV database was \u201crandom,\u201d by which he meant that, in deciding to run defendant\u2019s license plate, he was not guided by any suspicion of unlawful conduct nor by any formal or informal policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">\u201cQ [by defense counsel]: [Deputy] Bartlett, was Mr. Davis breaking the law when you ran his license plate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cA [by Deputy Bartlett]: At the time I ran his plate, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201cQ: No. So just to be clear, at the time you ran his plate you didn\u2019t have probable cause to believe that he had committed any traffic infraction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">\u201cA: At the time (inaudible), no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201cQ: Okay. And did you have any suspicion to believe that he was engaged in any other criminal activity at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">\u201cA: No, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">\u201cQ: Okay. So you just saw him driving and you thought you would run his license plate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">\u201cA: Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">\u201cQ: It was just a random occurrence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-14\">\u201cA: (No response heard.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-15\">\u201cQ: Yes? Okay. And you cited it as common practice that you run license plates. Do you do this without being in an investigation, or having any reason to believe that there is any criminal activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-16\">\u201cA: Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u201cQ: You do that just as a practice, and the Police Department does it as a practice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\">\u201cA: I randomly run plates (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201c* * <em>* * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cQ: Okay. Does Medford Police \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Jackson County Sheriffs Department \u2014 do you have a policy that creates standards or criteria for how you are going to conduct these random license plate searches?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cA: Not that I know, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201cQ: There is no written policy? I have actually read the Policy &amp; Procedures Manual, there is nothing in there. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201cA: Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">\u201cQ: No. There is no like spoken custom or just informal policy that folks talk about in the Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">\u201cA: Not that I know of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Thus, defendant argues, the deputy engaged in conduct that \u201cplaced a distinct and real burden on defendant\u2019s ability to be left alone and to anonymously go about his daily affairs [and] also led to a criminal prosecution, one of the most severe burdens the government may impose on a citizen\u201d \u2014 and he did so on an <em>ad hoc, </em>haphazard basis without any criteria at all, much less permissible criteria consistently applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">The state responds with two arguments. First, it argues that no issue arises under Article I, section 20, because the burden that Bartlett imposed on defendant does not rise to constitutional significance. In particular, the state focuses (as does defendant) on the invasion of defendant\u2019s privacy, that is, on the impairment of his freedom from scrutiny and of his freedom to be left alone. I agree; as indicated above, I conclude that defendant <em>had </em>no freedom from scrutiny of the personal information that he voluntarily provided to DMV when the scrutiny is by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. On the other hand, I agree with defendant that, when Bartlett ran his license plate, the deputy was initiating a law-enforcement investigation, and that such an act imposes a constitutionally significant burden on the person being investigated. In <em>Clark, </em>291 Or at 241, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Court held that the burden of being charged by grand jury indictment as opposed to by information was of constitutional significance. In <em>Bruner, </em>299 Or at 264-65, 269, the defendant was cited into municipal court for violating a city ordinance, and therefore was entitled to <em>de novo </em>review in circuit court but to Court of Appeals review only on the constitutionality of the ordinance. Had he been cited into municipal court for violating a state law or cited into circuit court in the first instance, he would have been entitled to full <em>de novo </em>review in the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court held that receiving the former entitlement instead of the latter was a burden of constitutional magnitude for purposes of Article I, section 20. If the minor and technical procedural advantages in a criminal adjudication are a burden of constitutional significance then surely the advantage of not being subjected to a criminal adjudication at all is as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">More importantly, this case, unlike the precedential Supreme Court cases, deals not with a privilege, but with an immunity. If that term from the text of Article I, section 20, means anything at all, it surely applies to the situation at issue here: one driver is subjected to a criminal investigation while other similarly situated drivers are, by virtue of the police officer\u2019s exercise of discretion, immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The concurring opinion is a more nuanced version of the state\u2019s argument. According to the concurrence, in running defendant\u2019s license plate, the officer did not distribute a \u201cprivilege or immunity\u201d as those terms are used in Article I, section 20. A privilege or immunity, the concurrence argues, is something to which a citizen is \u201centitled\u201d by statute or constitution. 237 Or App at 366-67. (Sercombe, J., concurring).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201c[A] privilege or immunity under Article I, section 20, must be \u2018granted\u2019 in the sense of achieving that status by legislative or constitutional enactment; it is only official action with respect to that type of privilege or immunity that is constrained by the provision. In this case, there is no law that creates or regulates a privilege or immunity to be free from license plate scrutiny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 364 (footnote omitted). That is an intriguing and interesting argument, but it cannot possibly be correct. The concurrence\u2019s unsupported assertion to the contrary notwithstanding, <em>id. </em>at 363 n 1, the term \u201cprivilege or immunity\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>under Article I, section 20, does not have one meaning with respect to class-based discrimination and a different meaning with respect to systemless treatment of individuals. The text does not permit such a reading: \u201cNo law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\u201d Nor does the concurrence suggest anything in the context, history, or case law that would support such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Thus, the necessary implication of the concurrence\u2019s interpretation of Article I, section 20, is that the section is simply not implicated in either of its aspects unless the privilege or immunity at stake is a statutory or constitutional entitlement. If that is true, then the officer in this case could freely run the license plates of only African-American drivers, because, in the concurrence\u2019s words, \u201cthere is no law that creates or regulates a privilege or immunity to be free from license plate scrutiny.\u201d By the concurrence\u2019s logic, nothing would prevent a district attorney who admits that he or she is driven by racial animus from selectively prosecuting an African-American arrestee but not a white one, because there is no law that creates a privilege or immunity for arrested persons to be free from prosecution. A state agency director presented with more qualified applicants than positions could hire only white people because there is no law that entitles a qualified applicant to a scarce employment opportunity. In sum, the concurrence fails to account for the fact that the public sphere is replete with advantages and disabilities that are not created by constitution, statute, rule, or policy, but that nonetheless cannot be distributed invidiously or <em>ad hoc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The state\u2019s second argument is equally unavailing. That argument depends on the following proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u201cThe very nature of police work is highly subjective and discretionary and involves a never-ending series of individualized, nuanced, fact-based choices as to whether and how to pursue an investigation and how to prioritize limited time and resources. A police officer\u2019s decision to conduct an investigation is a discretionary decision \u2018based on a vast array of subjective, individualized assessments\u2019 and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>result in like individuals being treated differently particularly given that law enforcement agencies have finite resources. Some people will be subject to a police investigation and some similarly situated people will not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><em>\u201c* * </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s position would subject an extremely broad range of police actions to Article I, section 20 review. Every time a police officer takes any action that could be perceived as \u2018burdening\u2019 a person, the person would have a potential Article I, section 20, challenge to that action. For example, a defendant could raise an Article I, section 20, challenge to an officer\u2019s decision to approach him on the street to engage in mere conversation and ask for consent to search even though courts have pointedly refrained from subjecting those types of decisions to judicial review. <em>See [State </em>v.] <em>Holmes, </em>311 Or [400,] 410[, 813 P2d 28 (1991).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">There are several problems with this argument. First, it cannot survive \u2014 at least in this court \u2014 in light of Supreme Court precedent: <em>\u201cWhenever </em>a person is denied some advantage to which he or she would be entitled but for <em>a choice made by a government authority, </em>Article I, section 20, requires that the government decision to offer or deny the advantage be made \u2018by permissible criteria and consistently applied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bruner, </em>299 Or at 268-69 (emphasis added). Indeed, the state\u2019s argument is nearly indistinguishable from the <em>dissenting </em>opinion in <em>Freeland, </em>in which Justice Jones, joined by no other justice, makes the same policy argument. <em>Freeland, </em>295 Or at 389-92 (Jones, J., dissenting). The only difference between Justice Jones\u2019s unsuccessful argument and the state\u2019s argument here is that <em>Freeland </em>concerned prosecutorial discretion regarding charging procedures, and the present case involves the discretion of police officers regarding the initiation of a criminal investigation. If anything, police discretion should be <em>more </em>constrained than prosecutors\u2019 discretion, because it is more frequent, more consequential, and more invisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Second, contrary to the state\u2019s presumption, Article I, section 20, does not prohibit a police officer from making \u201cindividualized, nuanced, [and] <em>fact-based </em>choices as to whether and how to pursue an investigation and how to prioritize limited time and resources.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Article I, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>20, prohibits police officers from making choices that are based on either no facts (that is, haphazard or <em>ad hoc </em>choices) or on impermissible facts (for example, race).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Third, <em>Holmes </em>and other cases permitting police officers to initiate contact with citizens are not relevant to Article I, section 20, analysis. Requiring consistently applied standards for police-citizen encounters does not limit police officers\u2019 ability to have such encounters. It limits their ability to make haphazard, <em>ad hoc, </em>or invidiously discriminatory decisions about whom to have encounters with. Thus, for example, if an officer without any suspicion chooses to engage a citizen in mere conversation and has a reason for doing so, that encounter is lawful unless the reason itself is impermissible \u2014 for example, that the person looks Middle Eastern or Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Finally, it must be emphasized that Article I, section 20, does not deprive state actors of their ability to exercise discretion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cDiscretion to choose a policy is not incompatible with consistency in practice. As one major study of prosecutorial discretion put it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201c \u2018That there should be consistent and evenhanded treatment of individuals within the framework of our legal system is such a commonly accepted notion that it hardly merits discussion and analysis * * *.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201c \u2018In its most elementary form, consistent and even handed treatment means that individuals in like circumstances will be treated alike * * *.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cAbrams, <em>Internal Policy: Guiding the Exercise of Prosecutorial Discretion, </em>19 UCLA L Rev 1, 4 (1971).

It is discretion to make policies for even application, not discretion to treat each case on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis.\u2019 <em>Sun Ray Dairy v.

According to the lead opinion, the decision to run defendant\u2019s plates was based on facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">\u201c[T]he deputy was able to see defendant\u2019s front license plate and was able to make out defendant\u2019s physical characteristics, which would have allowed him to compare the driver to the registered owner. Under those circumstances, the result was that defendant\u2019s license plates were run as part of the deputy\u2019s normal activity of investigating for stolen vehicles. In the course of that activity, <em>any </em>driver who happened to be coming out of the parking lot at that moment would have been subject to the same scrutiny. There was nothing arbitrary or whimsical about the deputy\u2019s decision to run defendant\u2019s license plates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>Davis, </em>237 Or App at 360-61 (emphasis in original). The first problem with this argument is that the state never made it to the trial court and makes it on appeal only insofar as it uses the term \u201cfact-based\u201d without ever asserting that the deputy\u2019s decision in the present case <em>was </em>fact-based or even mentioning any of the facts on which the lead opinion relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The second problem is more significant. Although the deputy testified that he observed defendant\u2019s face and license plate, that he noticed the truck was \u201ca later model pickup,\u201d and that the events occurred at a particular intersection, he never testified or in any way implied that any of those facts were criteria that he applies when deciding when to run a license plate. Indeed, he never even testified that those facts played any role in his decision to execute the investigation in <em>this </em>case. To the contrary, he testified on both direct and cross-examination that his decision to investigate defendant was <em>not </em>based on criteria or standards. It was \u201crandom.\u201d When asked, \u201cSo you just saw him driving and you thought you would run his license plate?,\u201d he responded, \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Thus, neither the witness, the state, nor the lead opinion presents any reason to conclude, nor any evidence from which we could infer, that the officer\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>initiate a criminal investigation of defendant was guided by criteria, policy, or system. The only evidence in the record establishes the exact opposite: that the decision was standardless and <em>ad hoc. </em>The witness\u2019s testimony affirmatively proves that fact, and to assert that the testimony proves or implies the <em>contrary </em>fact \u2014 that the decision <em>was </em>based on some criteria consistently applied \u2014 is, not to mince words, incomprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u201cTo allay misapprehension, perhaps a further comment is in order <em>\"Freeland, </em>295 Or at 382. The misapprehension here may be that the precedent governing this case, and this case itself, call into question the legitimacy of some governmental functions that are universally accepted yet appear to run afoul of Article I, section 20, because they, like Bartlett\u2019s choice to run defendant\u2019s license, involve the random conferral or denial of privileges. Most obvious are various lotteries, including the official State Lottery. As the state points out, however, there is a difference between \u201crandom\u201d and \u201carbitrary,\u201d or, more precisely, between \u201crandom\u201d and \u201chaphazard.\u201d A truly random distribution of privileges or immunities cannot sensibly be called systemless, haphazard, or <em>ad hoc. </em>Those terms all connote, and Article I, section 20, prohibits, distributions that permit absolutely unconstrained discretion. A legitimate lottery or truly random distribution <em>system </em>incorporates safeguards to prevent the exercise of discretion. Thus, for example, a <em>system </em>under which police officers run license plates of every fifth vehicle, or the first vehicle that an officer not otherwise occupied observes on the hour, or any other system under which an individual state actor\u2019s freedom to exercise discretion is constrained by criteria that he or she does not control, would not violate Article I, section 20. Under such systems, every similarly situated citizen would be guaranteed to have access to the privilege or immunity on equal terms \u2014 \u201con the same terms, * * * equally.\u201d The record in this case discloses that no such system was in play. For that reason, I partially dissent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Armstrong and Ortega, JJ., and Breithaupt, J. <em>pro tempore, </em>join this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-5\"> If the state successfully defeats an individual-based Article I, section 20, claim by demonstrating that the state actor applied the law systematically, then, of course, that system must itself pass muster under a traditional, class-based analysis. Thus, for example, if a person contends that police officers stopped him on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>a purely <em>ad hoc </em>basis, and the state demonstrates that, in fact, the officer stopped the person because the person was speeding, the state will prevail because imposing the burden on the class of persons who are suspected of speeding does not offend Article I, section 20. On the other hand, if the state defeats the accusation of <em>ad hoc </em>administration of the traffic laws by demonstrating that the officer had a policy or practice of stopping Hispanics, that policy would itself be unlawful under the more traditional, class-based Article I, section 20, analysis. <em>Clark, </em>291 Or at 239-40 (\u201c[W]hen wholly standardless application of a general law to individual cases is avoided by formal or informal criteria, these criteria in turn must pass muster under \u2018classification\u2019 analysis.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> There is perhaps one situation in which a police officer may necessarily and therefore lawfully engage in an arbitrary exercise of discretion: when the officer is presented simultaneously with two or more persons, each of whom is identically violating a law and both cannot be apprehended or investigated. The classic example is two cars running the same stop light at the same time. In such a situation, the only way the police officer could avoid an arbitrary choice would be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>apprehend or investigate neither. This case does not present that hypothetical problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
