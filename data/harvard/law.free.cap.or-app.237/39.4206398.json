The board\u2019s legal conclusion that claimant voluntarily left work is based on its factual finding that \u201ccontinuing work was available\u201d to claimant. Because that factual finding is not supported by substantial evidence, we reverse and remand. ORS 183.482(8)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The facts, as established by claimant\u2019s testimony, which was the only evidence before the board, are as follows. Claimant testified that he began working for employer in November 2008. He was hired to help build office spaces within a factory that was under construction. Claimant was hired and supervised by Todd, whom he knew from other construction projects. On March 11, 2009, claimant reported to work three minutes late. Todd told claimant, \u201cI guess you just can\u2019t fucking make it to work on time.\u201d Claimant did not respond., Todd demanded a response, saying, \u201cFucking what? What? You don\u2019t \u2014 what? You can\u2019t \u2014 you ain\u2019t got an answer for me?\u201d Claimant replied that he was only a few minutes late. Todd told him to \u201cfucking leave.\u201d Claimant left the work site, believing that Todd had fired him. Claimant never returned to work, and employer never called him back to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Claimant later sought unemployment benefits. A claimant is disqualified from receiving benefits if the claimant has been \u201cdischarged for misconduct connected with work\u201d or has \u201cvoluntarily left work without good cause.\u201d ORS 657.176(2)(a), (c). OAR 471-030-0038(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201cThe distinction between voluntarily leaving and discharge is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201c(a) If the employee could have continued to work for the same employer for an additional period of time the separation is a voluntarily leaving of work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u201c(b) If the employee is willing to continue to work for the same employer for an additional period of time but is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>not allowed to do so by the employer the separation is a discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The Employment Department denied claimant unemployment benefits on the ground that he voluntarily left work without good cause. To challenge the department\u2019s denial, claimant requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">At the hearing, claimant testified that he did not quit his job. He explained that he had been willing to continue to work for employer but did not because Todd told him to \u201c \u2018fucking leave.\u2019 \u201d The ALJ asked claimant whether he \u201cbelieve[d] that the [e]mployer would have allowed [him] to continue working,\u201d and claimant answered that, when Todd told him to leave, he believed \u201cthat that was it.\u201d The ALJ also asked claimant whether, if he had not left, Todd would have \u201callowed [him] to continue working\u201d and claimant answered, \u201cLike I said, I was under the * * * assumption when he said those words, that I was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Claimant testified that he had been hired to work on a particular project, which was \u201cabout over\u201d when Todd told him to leave the work site. Claimant further testified that he did not know whether employer \u201cwould have kept [him] on\u201d after that project. Employer did not submit any evidence or participate in the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The ALJ found that claimant \u201cwas willing to continue working for employer but was not allowed to do so by employer.\u201d Based on that finding, the ALJ concluded that claimant had not voluntarily left work; he had been discharged. The ALJ further concluded that claimant had not been discharged for misconduct, which is defined as a \u201cwillful or wantonly negligent violation of the standards of behavior which an employer has the right to expect of an employee\u201d and which does not include \u201cisolated instances of poor judgment.\u201d ORS 657.221(2)(a); OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a), (b). Because the ALJ concluded that claimant had not voluntarily left work, but rather had been discharged, and that the discharge was for reasons other than misconduct, the ALJ set aside the department\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Employer appealed, and the board reversed, reinstating the department\u2019s denial of benefits. The board found, \u201cPer claimant\u2019s testimony, some amount of continuing work was available at the time [claimant] left, and he had not been explicitly told that he was discharge[d].\u201d Based on those findings, the board concluded, \u201cThe work separation was, therefore, a voluntary leaving.\u201d The board further concluded that claimant did not have good cause for leaving. Based on its conclusions, the board held that claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">On review, claimant contends that the board erred in finding that he voluntarily left work. He disputes the board\u2019s finding that continuing work was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We review the board\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence. ORS 657.282; ORS 183.482(8)(c). A finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence if \u201cthe record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the board\u2019s finding that continuing work was available to claimant is not supported by substantial evidence; the record would not permit a reasonable person to find that claimant could have continued to work for employer after Todd told him to \u201cfucking leave.\u201d Nothing in what Todd said or did would support a finding that claimant was welcome to remain at or return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The board indicated that claimant testified that continuing work was available. Its order provides, <em>\u201cPer claimant\u2019s testimony, </em>some amount of continuing work was available at the time he left[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) But claimant never testified that he could have continued to work for employer; to the contrary, he repeatedly testified that he believed that he could not have continued to work for employer. The ALJ specifically asked claimant whether he would have been allowed to work, and claimant answered that, when Todd told him to leave, he understood \u201cthat that was it\u201d and that he was \u201cdone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Claimant\u2019s only other testimony regarding continuing work was that, at the time Todd told him to leave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>work site, the construction project for which claimant had been hired was almost over. From that testimony, the board could find that the project was going to continue for some amount of time after Todd told claimant to leave, but it could not find that claimant could have continued to work on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In sum, there is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable person could find that claimant could have continued to work for employer. Therefore, the board\u2019s finding that continuing work was available to claimant \u2014 a finding that is essential to the board\u2019s conclusion that claimant voluntarily left work \u2014 is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
