She assigns error to, first, the court\u2019s denial of mother\u2019s motion for a continuance; second, the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a letter the Department of Human Services sent to mother; and, third, the court\u2019s order granting father unsupervised parenting time. We reject mother\u2019s first two assignments of error without discussion and, for the reasons set forth below, reject mother\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In our review of the facts, we are bound by the relevant trial court findings if they are supported by evidence in the record. ORS 19.415(3)(b). We apply that standard of review because this is not an exceptional case in which we choose to exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo. DHS v. Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, </em>236 Or App 535, 538-42, 238 P3d 40 (2010). Accordingly, we state the facts \u201cconsistently with [the trial court\u2019s] findings and augment them where necessary with uncontroverted background and procedural facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Mother has a son (N) and a daughter (G). G was four years old when N was born in November 2008. N is father\u2019s child, but G is not. Mother and father were in a relationship for approximately three years. When N was four weeks old, mother and father ended their relationship after mother told father that either she was going to leave the family\u2019s home or father would have to leave. Father chose to leave. He explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have [mother] and the new baby and [G] leave the home, so I left.\u201d Father continued to pay mother\u2019s rent and utilities for a month and a half. After that time, mother moved out.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">For her part, mother testified that she had asked father to leave because of anger problems. Mother explained that father\u2019s anger problems are demonstrated by inappropriate statements that he has made. As examples, mother described several statements that father made in front of G. First, after mother woke up early with N and G but let father sleep, mother testified that father was frustrated because mother did not wake him up to help and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>you to cut me any F-ing slack.\u201d Mother testified that father then walked into a hallway where G was standing and said, \u201c[mother is] going to go tell everyone I\u2019m a deadbeat. I should just go kill myself.\u201d Second, mother testified that father, in front of G, \u201csaid that surgery is a 50/50 chance, 50 percent you\u2019ll live, 50 percent you\u2019ll die.\u201d In context \u2014 mother was pregnant with N \u2014 that prediction scared G. Third, mother stated that when she left father alone with G, \u201che would say inappropriate things\u201d in front of G. Finally, mother recounts that, when she was five months pregnant, \u201cwe were arguing and [father] told me that if I ever took his son away from him he would plant drugs on me and call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Both mother and father have used controlled substances. Father used methamphetamine but stopped five years ago after enrolling in a drug rehabilitation program and has not used methamphetamine since that time. Father and mother have used alcohol and marijuana together in the past year. However, father testified that he has been clean and sober for six months. Eleven months ago, father had to take a drug test as part of a job application. Father got the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Mother\u2019s pregnancy with N prompted father to address his past drug problem with renewed vigor. Father had stopped attending recovery meetings, but decided to start attending again just before N was born. Since renewing his commitment to attending recovery meetings, father has attended the meetings three times a week. In addition, father has recently completed a parenting class offered by Salem Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In December 2009, father filed a petition for parenting time with N. Mother opposed the petition, arguing, in part, that father should not have any unsupervised parenting time. In support of that argument, mother contended that father had used controlled substances, was an inexperienced parent, made inappropriate statements in front of the children, and had sexually abused G.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Father denied any allegation that he sexually abused G and posited that the allegation was fabricated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>someone other than G. The only evidence in the record of sexual abuse is through the testimony of mother and the maternal grandmother. The full extent of that evidence is mother\u2019s testimony that she believes G\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse are \u201ca hundred percent\u201d true and the grandmother\u2019s description of the allegations in slightly more detail during examination by mother\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">\u201cQ: Now, at some point this year you became aware of an allegation of sex abuse by [father] against [G], didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cA: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">\u201cQ: And how did you find out about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cA: [G] is four, so she needs help sometimes wiping her bottom when she poops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not going to let her testify to what the child said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">\u201c[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">\u201c[GRANDMOTHER]: And so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">\u201c[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">\u201cQ: You can\u2019t testify to anything that was said. You can testify to what you saw personally, but not anything the child said, okay? So did you have concerns about any physical aspect of [G] at that time?[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-13\">\u201cA: Well, she wouldn\u2019t allow me to help her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-14\">\u201cQ: With her toileting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-15\">\u201cA: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-16\">\u201cQ: Okay. And subsequent to that did you have any other concerns about [G] with [father] in the days that followed that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-17\">\u201cA: Quite a few. She got withdrawn and sad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-18\">\u201cQ: Okay. Any other symptomology, if you will, or uncharacteristic behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-19\">\u201cA: Tantrums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201cQ: Okay. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">\u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">\u201cQ: Any increased fearfulness at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">\u201cA: She wasn\u2019t sleeping, but things \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that can all be put on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">At the close of the hearing, the trial court granted mother sole custody. It also granted father unsupervised parenting time with N. The court explained that its judgment had to be based on N\u2019s best interests, it is important for children to have contact with both parents, and \u201cwhen children are small they need to have more frequent contact * * * with the non-primary parent.\u201d Moreover, the court found that there was \u201cno evidence that [father] is a danger to his son [and] no evidence that [father] has placed his son in danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Mother appeals and, as noted, we discuss only her assignment of error that the trial court awarded unsupervised parenting time to father. Mother contends that unsupervised parenting time is not in N\u2019s best interests. Specifically, mother argues that \u201cFather\u2019s actions, abandoning [m]other and [N] when [N] was a week old, failing to take advantage of parenting time when it was given to him, and proposing to take [N] into a home where other children, and [f]ather himself had been abused[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] speak much louder than words.\u201d Mother also contends that father\u2019s past drug use, anger problems, and the allegation that father sexually abused G mandate awarding father supervised parenting time only.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">In any proceeding to establish a judgment providing for parenting time with a child, \u201cthere shall be developed and filed with the court a parenting plan to be included in the judgment.\u201d ORS 107.102(1). When a parent requests, the court shall develop the parenting plan and, in doing so, \u201cthe court may consider only the best interests of the child and the safety of the parties.\u201d ORS 107.102(4)(b). The best interests determination is informed by the factors in ORS 107.137(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Here, the court found no evidence that father posed a danger to N, and found that father had not exposed N to any danger. The court reasoned that a child\u2019s best interest generally includes contact with both parents. <em>See </em>ORS 107.101(1) (\u201cIt is the policy of this state to * * * [a]ssure minor children of frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interests of the child.\u201d); <em>see also </em>ORS 107.137(1)(c) (best interest factor includes the desirability of a continued relationship between parent and child); ORS 107.137(1)(b) (The parties\u2019 interest and attitude toward child is a factor in the best interests determination.). Accordingly, the court granted father unsupervised parenting time with N on the basis that it is in N\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In determining whether parenting time by a noncustodial parent is appropriate, our paramount concern is with the best interests of the child. <em>Sundberg and Sundberg, </em>150 Or App 349, 355, 946 P2d 296 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>326 Or 464 (1998). And, as to whether parenting time with the noncustodial parent should be unsupervised, \u201c[generally, courts attempt to promote a strong relationship between children and their noncustodial parents. <em>Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick, </em>38 Or App 159, 161, 589 P2d 1153 (1979); see <em>also </em>ORS 107.149.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>Sundberg, </em>150 Or App at 355. Thus, we have affirmed an order granting a parent unsupervised parenting time with a child where \u201c[t]here is no evidence that [the parent\u2019s] visits need to be supervised to protect the child from [the parent.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Here, father established that he can act in N\u2019s best interests. He has addressed his prior drug problems and has implemented and followed a plan to continue to stay clean. Furthermore, father has taken a parenting class on his own volition to prepare to take care of N.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Mother\u2019s contention that father poses a danger to N is not supported by evidence in the record. To be sure, mother\u2019s allegations are concerning. However, given the lack of evidence to support her allegations, along with our standard of review and the trial court\u2019s express finding that father does not present any danger to N, mother has failed to satisfy her burden on appeal of proving reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Mother argues that father abandoned her and N when N was one week old. However, mother\u2019s testimony is not consistent with her argument. She testified that she gave father an ultimatum that father had to leave or else mother would leave with N. Mother gave father that ultimatum because she was concerned about inappropriate statements that father made in front of the children. Father chose to leave so that mother and N could live in the family home, and he continued to pay mother\u2019s rent until she moved. Thus, although father did move out of the family home \u2014 at mother\u2019s insistence \u2014 there is no evidence to suggest that father abandoned the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We next address mother\u2019s arguments that father\u2019s drug use and anger problems require that father only be allowed supervised parenting time. We similarly conclude that the evidence in the record in this regard does not support a conclusion that supervised parenting time with father is necessary. Mother contends that father has anger problems based on inappropriate statements that he made in front of G. To be sure, father\u2019s statements reveal less than ideal parenting. One statement \u2014 father\u2019s threat to plant drugs on mother if she took N away from father \u2014 is particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>concerning. However, mother never connected father\u2019s inappropriate statements to N\u2019s best interests. As to father\u2019s drug use, father has not used methamphetamine in five years and has a plan for staying clean. Father\u2019s historical drug problems and present recovery do not present a barrier to unsupervised parenting time. <em>See Brinkly and Brinkly, </em>223 Or App 113, 119, 195 P3d 405, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 257 (2008) (mother\u2019s history of methamphetamine use did not preclude the court from granting mother custody, not to mention unsupervised parenting time, when mother had been clean for more than one year).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Finally, we consider mother\u2019s allegation that father sexually abused G. The trial court found that, based on the evidence presented, there was no evidence that father posed a danger to N. Mother testified only that she believed G\u2019s sexual abuse allegations against father. Mother did not testify as to what G alleged or as to why G\u2019s allegations were believable. Grandmother\u2019s testimony regarding G\u2019s symptoms of alleged sexual abuse \u2014 not wanting to be helped with toileting, growing withdrawn and sad, throwing tantrums, and having trouble sleeping \u2014 are not connected by any evidence to sexual abuse. Moreover, there is no evidence that would allow us to take the next inferential step that, if abuse occurred, father was the abuser or that father\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of G could result in harm to N. Thus, although allegations of sexual abuse are deeply concerning, mother failed to produce evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In sum, mother makes numerous concerning but unsupported allegations about father. The record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that there is no evidence that father presents a danger to N. We conclude that the trial court did not err in granting father unsupervised parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-20\"> Mother does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>ruling that the grandmother could not testify as to what G said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-10\"> There is no evidence in the record to support mother\u2019s allegations that father failed to take advantage of parenting time that was offered to him, that father was sexually abused, or that sexual abuse has occurred in the home where father proposes to take N.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\"> ORS 107.102 does not specify factors that guide the \u201cbest interests\u201d determination with respect to a parenting plan. Although ORS 107.137(1) addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>factors that are relevant to determining best interests with respect to custody, they are also material in determining whether parenting time should be supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa0\">ORS 107.137(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">\u201cIn determining custody of a minor child under ORS 107.105 or 107.135, the court shall give primary consideration to the best interests and welfare of the child.
