The court merged the conviction for murder with one of the convictions for aggravated murder. It did not merge the two convictions for aggravated murder. Although defendant did not object, failure to merge the two aggravated murder convictions was plain error that we exercise our discretion to review. <em>State v. Acremant, </em>338 Or 302, 330, 108 P3d 1139, <em>cert </em>den, 546 US 864 (2005). \u201cWe therefore remand the case for entry of [a] corrected judgment of conviction reflecting defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge of aggravated murder * * * with the judgment separately enumerating the aggravating factors upon which [the] conviction is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a second assignment of error, defendant argues that the statute of limitation for aggravated murder is three years and not unlimited. We rejected that argument in <em>State v. Anthony, </em>234 Or App 659, 228 P3d 1222 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment reflecting one conviction for aggravated murder with the judgment separately enumerating the aggravating factors upon which the conviction is based; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
