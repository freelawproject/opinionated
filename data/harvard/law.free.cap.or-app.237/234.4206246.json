ORS 163.415.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant acknowledges that he failed to raise, and preserve, the asserted error before the trial court, but requests that we address, and remedy, that matter as an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). We do so and, accordingly, reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In Case Number A141879, defendant was convicted of two counts of third-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.415, and one count of harassment, ORS 166.065(4). A description of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge the two sexual abuse convictions, which were based on a single act that violated separate subparagraphs of ORS 163.415(1)(a). As noted, defendant did not object at trial to the court\u2019s failure to merge those convictions but now contends that the court\u2019s failure constitutes plain error that we should exercise our discretion to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Relying principally on <em>State v. White, </em>346 Or 275, 211 P3d 248 (2009), and <em>State v. Barnes, </em>209 Or App 332, 147 P3d 936 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), the state concedes that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to merge the guilty verdicts for both counts of third-degree sexual abuse constituted plain error,\u201d because \u201ceach section of ORS 163.415 provides alternative ways of committing a single crime and because those alternative ways, as a matter of law, basically constitute the same conduct[.]\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession, and, for the reasons described in <em>State v. Camacho-Alvarez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>225 Or App 215, 216-17, 200 P3d 613 (2009), we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In Case Number A141879, convictions on Counts 1 and 2 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for one count of third-degree sexual abuse reflecting that defendant was found guilty on both theories and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed. Case Number A141880 affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> ORS 163.415 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u201c(a) The person subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u201c(A) The victim does not consent to the sexual contact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\u201c(B) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being under 18 years of age[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\"> In the other consolidated case (A141880), defendant was convicted of public indecency, ORS 163.465. However, defendant does not raise any assignments of error concerning the judgment in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
