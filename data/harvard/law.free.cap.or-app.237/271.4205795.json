A juvenile court referee ordered that youth pay restitution to the car\u2019s owner in the amount of $250.00, her insurance deductible for the cost of repairing the car. The referee also ordered that youth pay $4,315.26 to AFNI Insurance Services (AFNI), the victim\u2019s insurance carrier, for repair costs it paid. Youth sought review of that order by a juvenile court judge, arguing that the insurance company was not a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the juvenile delinquency restitution statute, ORS 419C.450. The juvenile court agreed with youth in that regard, but rather than eliminate the award of $4,315.26, it made the amount payable to the car\u2019s owner instead of AFNI. Youth now appeals that judgment, again arguing that an insurance company is not a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of ORS 419C.450.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The problem with youth\u2019s argument is that the juvenile court did not award restitution to AFNI. Indeed, the court <em>agreed </em>with youth\u2019s contention that the \u201cvictim\u201d was the owner of the damaged car, and the judgment makes restitution payable to the car\u2019s owner and not AFNI. Thus, the issue that youth frames on appeal \u2014 the meaning of the word \u201cvictim\u201d in ORS 419C.450 \u2014 has no direct bearing on the ultimate correctness of the restitution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The juvenile delinquency restitution statute contemplates an award of restitution in the \u201cspecific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s injury, loss or damage.\u201d ORS 419C.450(1)(a)(A). Given the nature of the judgment in this case, the real question is what constitutes the \u201cfull amount of the victim\u2019s injury, loss or damage\u201d in light of the fact that an insurance company paid for repairs to the victim\u2019s car. That statutory construction question, however, has not been briefed or argued on appeal, and we decline to address it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Montez, </em>309 Or 564, 604, 789 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>1352 (1990) (refusing to consider an argument that was not adequately developed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\"> Read in isolation, youth\u2019s assignment of error \u2014 that the court \u201cerred by entering a juvenile judgment ordering the youth to pay $4565.26 to the victim, when the victim had only $250 in out-of-pocket costs, and the rest was paid by her insurance company\u201d \u2014 appears to frame the correct issue. Youth\u2019s argument in support of that assignment, however, is directed exclusively to the question whether an insurance company is a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of ORS 419C.450.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
