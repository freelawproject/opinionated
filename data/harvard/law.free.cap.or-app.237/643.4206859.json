On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on Counts 1 and 2, contending that \u201cthe state failed to offer any evidence that defendant constructively possessed the methamphetamine \u2014 that is, that she had the right to exercise control over it\u201d \u2014 because \u201cthe vehicle [that defendant was driving] did not belong to [her] and she had only been driving it for a few minutes.\u201d The state concedes that, in the totality of the circumstances of this case, \u201cthe evidence was insufficient to establish that defendant possessed methamphetamine that police discovered in the center console of a car that she was driving but did not own.\u201d As the predicate for that concession, the state cites <em>State v. Casey, </em>346 Or 54, 62-63, 203 P3d 202 (2009), in which the court reasoned that mere proximity to contraband, \u201cfor a brief period of time and, without more, is not sufficient to establish constructive possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We agree with the state that, in the circumstances presented here, the trial court erred in denying the MJOA and accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 1 and 2 and remand for resentencing, which obviates the need to address her remaining assignment of error concerning the exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Convictions on Counts 1 and 2 reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\"> Defendant was also convicted of failure to carry or present a driver\u2019s license. ORS 807.570. On appeal, defendant does not challenge that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
