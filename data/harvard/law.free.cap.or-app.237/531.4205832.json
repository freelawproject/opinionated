The county, however, interpreted the \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d provisions as applying only to the part of petitioners\u2019 property that actually housed the dust-sensitive or noise-sensitive <em>use </em>\u2014 i.e., the dwelling. On review, petitioners argue that the county interpreted its code too narrowly, and that LUBA erred in affirming that erroneous interpretation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The facts, as recited in LUBA\u2019s decision, are not disputed by the parties; we have supplemented our recitation of those facts with our understanding of the procedural history of the case. Respondent Mark Latham Excavation, Inc. (Latham) requested approval of a site plan and conditional use permit to operate a surface mine on an 80-acre parcel in Deschutes County. The property is located in a Surface Mining Zone, subject to Chapter 18.52 of the Deschutes County Code (DCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">By way of background, Chapter 18.52 is part of the county\u2019s implementation of Goal 5, the statewide planning goal concerning protection of natural resources and conservation of scenic, historic, and open space resources. OAR chapter 660, division 16. In 1990, the county adopted four ordinances to comply with its Goal 5 planning obligation. The first ordinance adopted new comprehensive plan goals and policies for surface mining. The second ordinance adopted an inventory of significant mineral and aggregate sites, including Latham\u2019s site (listed as site 303).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The third ordinance adopted what are known as \u201cESEE Findings and Decisions,\u201d which analyzed the economic, social, environmental, and energy consequences for individual sites, including site 303. The fourth ordinance amended the Surface Mining Zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>provisions in Chapter 18.52, the chapter of the county\u2019s code that is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Petitioners, who own adjoining property to the north of Latham\u2019s site, opposed his development application on a number of grounds, including that the mining operation would violate various provisions in Chapter 18.52 concerning \u201cdust-sensitive uses\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive uses.\u201d Those provisions included, for example, setback requirements, DCC 18.52.090(A) (subject to certain exceptions, \u201call surface mining activities and uses, including structures, shall be located and conducted at least 250 feet from a noise-sensitive or dust-sensitive use or structure\u201d), and screening requirements, DCC 18.52.110(B) (requiring screening to obscure the view of the mining operation from certain \u201c[n]oise-sensitive or dust-sensitive uses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">A hearings officer for the county determined that two of Latham\u2019s three proposed processing sites would not meet the minimum setback required by DCC 18.52.090; \u201c[t]he crusher and materials washer shall only be located in the southwestern processing site[.]\u201d She further concluded that certain mining activities would be visible from petitioners\u2019 property, in violation of DCC 18.52.110, and therefore conditioned approval of the application on Latham installing a berm and plantings within the setback that would screen the site from petitioners\u2019 property. Latham then sought reconsideration of those conditions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that the minimum distances for setback and screening criteria should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>determined based on the location of petitioners\u2019 actual residence, and not from the driveway or other grounds that surround the residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Latham relied on the definitions of \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d provided in the county code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">\u201c \u2018Dust-sensitive use\u2019 means real property normally used as a residence, school, church, hospital or similar use. Property used in industrial or agricultural activities is not \u2018dust-sensitive\u2019 unless it meets the above criteria in more than an incidental manner. Accessory uses such as garages and workshops do not constitute dust-sensitive uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201c* * <em>* * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201c \u2018Noise-sensitive use\u2019 means real property normally used for sleeping or normally used as schools, churches, hospitals or public libraries. Property used in industrial or agricultural activities is not \u2018noise-sensitive\u2019 unless it meets the above criteria in more than an incidental manner. Accessory uses such as garages or workshops do not constitute noise-sensitive uses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">DCC 18.04.030.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">On reconsideration, the hearings officer rejected Latham\u2019s interpretation of those definitions. She reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cThe use of the phrase \u2018real property\u2019 connotes the grounds around the dwelling, and not just the dwelling itself. * * * This understanding is consistent with the concept of\u2018noise-sensitive uses.\u2019 People traveling to and from those structures are likely to be more affected by noise than people who are entering or using structures for non-residential, church, library, school or hospital purposes. Further, the definition recognizes that some structures, namely garages, workshops and the like are not noise-sensitive areas. Again, if the board of county commissioners had intended to limit the area included in as a \u2018noise sensitive use\u2019 to only the dwelling or other sleeping quarters, it could have done so. Similarly, the definition of \u2018dust-sensitive uses\u2019 applies to \u2018real property used as a residence * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201cThe evidence shows that [petitioners\u2019] property is used as a residence. People driving along [petitioners\u2019] driveway can see and hear mining activities that occur right across the property line. Further, while [Latham] provided testimony and evidence that applicable standards could be met if measured from [petitioners\u2019] dwelling, there is no evidence that the standard can be met if measured from the driveway patronized by residents of the dwelling or their guests. Therefore, mining activities that affect the residential use of [petitioners\u2019] property must be considered, and conditions imposed to ensure that the applicable standards are satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Both Latham and petitioners appealed the hearings officer\u2019s decision to the board of county commissioners, challenging various aspects of the decision. One of the issues before the board was the hearings officer\u2019s conclusion that \u201cnoise-sensitive and dust-sensitive uses comprised, not just the immediate area surrounding the dwellings or structures that define the use, but other areas of the property, including fields and driveways far removed from the structures that define the use.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The board, after considering the definitions in DCC 18.04.030, rejected the hearings officer\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use.\u201d The board explained that, based on their text and context, the definitions were intended to apply only \u201cto the area around the structure and not the entire property.\u201d Accordingly, the board overturned the hearings officer\u2019s order to the extent that it measured distances for setbacks and screening from places on petitioners\u2019 property other than the dwelling itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Petitioners sought LUBA\u2019s review of the board\u2019s order, and Latham cross-petitioned for review. The parties disagreed about a number of aspects of the board\u2019s order, but as relevant here, petitioners took issue with the county\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>use,\u201d arguing that the county had applied the definitions in DCC 18.04.030 too narrowly. LUBA framed the issue in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">\u201cThe reference in the [definitions for \u2018dust-sensitive use\u2019 and \u2018noise-sensitive use\u2019] to \u2018real property\u2019 and to particular kinds of uses that are normally housed in structures arguably permits at least two significantly different interpretations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201cUnder the first interpretation, a dust-sensitive use would include all of the real property (the entire lot or parcel) that is developed with a \u2018residence, school, church, hospital or similar use.\u2019 Similarly, under the first interpretation, a noise-sensitive use would include the entire lot or parcel that is developed with a dwelling or other building where people sleep or with \u2018schools, churches, hospitals or public libraries. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cUnder the second interpretation, since both interpretations refer almost exclusively to uses that are carried out for the most part in structures, and structures provide refuge from noise and dust, the emphasis would be on the structures that house those uses. Under this interpretation, only the structures used for residences, schools, churches, hospitals or similar uses would qualify as dust-sensitive uses. Similarly, only the structures used for sleeping or the structures \u2018normally used as schools, churches, hospitals or public libraries\u2019 would qualify as noise-sensitive uses. As we explain below, the county adopted a variation on the second interpretation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">After examining the text of DCC 18.04.030, LUBA explained that \u201cthe definition is ambiguous in that there is language in the definition that would permit it to make the entire lot or parcel noise-sensitive or only the structure noise-sensitive.\u201d Moreover, LUBA reasoned, \u201cthe context cited by the county adds some additional support to its interpretation that the structure is the noise-sensitive use.\u201d That context included \u201cother sections of the DCC [that] commonly measure setbacks from structures\u201d; \u201cmeasuring setbacks from undefined activities or accessory uses of property that might be associated with the structure would be difficult and uncertain\u201d; and \u201cthe exclusion of garages and workshops suggests only structures were intended to qualify as noise-sensitive uses.\u201d For those reasons, LUBA, citing this court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>Siporen v. City of Medford, </em>231 Or App 585, 220 P3d 427 (2009), <em>rev allowed, </em>348 Or 13 (2010), deferred to the county\u2019s interpretation \u2014 an interpretation that LUBA considered \u201cplausible,\u201d indeed \u201cat least as plausible as petitioners\u2019 interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Petitioners now seek review of LUBA\u2019s decision. In a single assignment of error, petitioners submit that \u201cLUBA erred in its application of the <em>Siporen </em>\u2018plausibility<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> standard of review for a local jurisdiction\u2019s interpretation of its own provisions and violated the requirements of ORS 197.829 and the Oregon Supreme Court [decision in <em>Clark v. Jackson County, </em>313 Or 508, 836 P2d 710 (1992)].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to petitioners, the county erroneously interpreted \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d as referring only to the use within a <em>structure, </em>as opposed to the surrounding grounds. In petitioners\u2019 view, that interpretation ignored the \u201cexpress language\u201d of the code provisions, and LUBA erred in affirming it.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">As we explained in <em>Siporen, </em>when reviewing a local government\u2019s interpretation of its own code, \u201cour task is to determine whether, based on the express language of the code, the [local government\u2019s] interpretation concerning the applicability [of the code] is \u2018plausible\u2019 we do not determine whether the local government\u2019s decision is \u201c \u2018correct\u2019 in some absolute sense of choosing among various plausible interpretations,\u201d but only whether the interpretation is plausible based on its text and context. 231 Or App at 598-99 (emphasis in original); <em>see also Western Land &amp; Cattle, Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Umatilla County, </em>230 Or App 202, 209-10, 214 P3d 68 (2009) (explaining that \u201cthe \u2018consistency with the express language\u2019 inquiry looks at the text of the plan provision or the regulation in question, as well as the context of other parts of the plan or regulation that are relevant to the textual meaning of that \u2018express language\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The \u201cexpress language\u201d at issue in this case is set forth in DCC 18.04.030, in the definitions of \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use.\u201d Those definitions, once again, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201c <em>\u2018Dust-sensitive use\u2019 means real property normally used as a residence, school, church, hospital or similar use. </em>Property used in industrial or agricultural activities is not \u2018dust-sensitive\u2019 unless it meets the above criteria in more than an incidental manner. Accessory uses such as garages and workshops do not constitute dust-sensitive uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c* <em>* </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201c <em>\u2018Noise-sensitive use\u2019 means real property normally used for sleeping or normally used as schools, churches, hospitals or public libraries. </em>Property used in industrial or agricultural activities is not \u2018noise-sensitive\u2019 unless it meets the above criteria in more than an incidental manner. Accessory uses such as garages or workshops do not constitute noise-sensitive uses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">DCC 18.04.030 (emphasis added). Both definitions refer to the way in which \u201creal property\u201d is \u201cnormally used.\u201d The term \u201creal property\u201d means <em>\u201cland, </em>buildings, <em>structures, </em>improvements and fixtures, mines, minerals, quarries, vegetation, timber and water rights.\u201d DCC 1.04.010 (emphasis added). \u201cUse,\u201d meanwhile, is defined in the code as \u201cthe purpose for which <em>land or a structure </em>is designed, arranged or intended, or for which it is occupied or maintained.\u201d DCC 18.04.030 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">There is no question that, as a general matter, the term \u201cuse\u201d is not limited solely to \u201cstructures\u201d under the Deschutes County Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As set out above, a \u201cuse\u201d under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>code typically refers to the purpose for which <em>land or a structure on that land </em>is designed, arranged, or intended, or for which it is occupied or maintained. Moreover, \u201creal property\u201d could plausibly be interpreted as referring to the entire parcel on which a \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d or \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d is found, and not simply the structure in which it is housed. In short, petitioners\u2019 proposed interpretation \u2014 that a noise-sensitive use or a dust-sensitive use extends to real property beyond the structure itself \u2014 is indeed a reasonable construction of the code. But our inquiry is not whether petitioners\u2019 interpretation is reasonable \u2014 or even the better one; our inquiry is whether the county\u2019s interpretation, based on the express language of the text, is plausible. <em>Siporen, </em>231 Or App at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Other text within the definitions of \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d persuades us that a noise-sensitive or dust-sensitive use plausibly refers, as the county concluded, to the use <em>within a structure. </em>To begin with, only real property \u201cnormally used as a residence, school, church, hospital or similar use\u201d qualifies as a \u201cdust-sensitive use.\u201d Likewise, only real property \u201cnormally used for sleeping or normally used as schools, churches, hospitals or public libraries\u201d qualifies as a \u201cnoise-sensitive use.\u201d All of the specifically identified \u201cuses\u201d of real property \u2014 with the exception of \u201csleeping\u201d \u2014 are also structures: residences, schools, hospitals, churches, public libraries. And even the lone exception, sleeping, typically occurs within a structure. Thus, the text of the definitions is consistent with the county\u2019s understanding that dust-sensitive and noise-sensitive uses are limited to the part of the real <em>property </em>\u2014 i.e., the <em>structure </em>\u2014 where the dust- and noise-sensitive activities occur, and do not encompass the surrounding parts of the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Moreover, other parts of Chapter 18.52 lend support to the county\u2019s interpretation. DCC 18.52.090, for example, concerns \u201cminimum use setbacks\u201d in the Surface Mining zone and requires that \u201call surface mining activities and uses, including structures, shall be located and conducted at least 250 feet from a noise-sensitive or dust-sensitive use or structure.\u201d It then allows for a written agreement \u201cfor a lesser setback made between the owner of the noise-sensitive or dust-sensitive use or structure located within 250 feet of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the proposed surface mining activity and the owner or operator of the proposed surface mine.\u201d As the county correctly points out, \u201csetbacks\u201d are measured throughout the Deschutes County Code in terms of distance from a <em>building. </em>The code defines a setback as \u201can open space on a lot which is unobstructed from the ground upward except as otherwise provided in DCC Title 18.\u201d It then provides the following related definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201c \u2018Setback, front\u2019 means a setback between side lot lines, measured horizontally at right angles to the front lot line from the front lot line to the nearest point of a building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201c \u2018Setback, rear\u2019 means a setback between side lot lines, measured horizontally at right angles to the rear lot line from the rear lot line to the nearest point of a building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201c \u2018Setback, side\u2019 means a setback between the front and rear yard measured horizontally at right angles from the side lot line to the nearest point of a building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201c \u2018Setback, street side\u2019 means a setback adjacent to a street between the front setback and rear lot line measured horizontally and at right angles from the side lot line to the nearest point of a building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">DCC 18.04.030. The fact that \u201csetback\u201d requirements in the county\u2019s code are measured from \u201cbuildings\u201d is, at the very least, consistent with the county\u2019s view that the \u201cnoise-sensitive uses\u201d and \u201cdust-sensitive uses\u201d from which setbacks are measured in Chapter 18.52 are likewise buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Petitioners contend that such a construction renders other parts of Chapter 18.52 superfluous \u2014 namely, those provisions that refer to a \u201cnoise-sensitive or dust-sensitive <em>use or structure.\u201d </em>DCC 18.52.090 (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in DCC 18.52.090, all surface mining activities and uses, including structures, shall be located and conducted at least 250 feet from a noise-sensitive or dust-sensitive use or structure.\u201d); <em>see also </em>DCC 18.52.110(I), (J) (referring to \u201cnoise-sensitive or dust-sensitive use or structure\u201d); DCC 18.52.140(A) (\u201cnoise-sensitive use or structure\u201d); DCC 18.52.140(C)(1), (2) (\u201cnoise or dust-sensitive use or structure\u201d). An interpretation that gives effect to every word in the county\u2019s code is obviously preferable, but that is not possible here; even petitioners\u2019 proposed construction yields <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>redundancy. As explained above, a \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d necessarily includes a \u201cnoise-sensitive structure\u201d within the meaning of the code, and a \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d likewise includes a \u201cdust-sensitive structure.\u201d In the context of the code as a whole, the employment of the phrase \u201cdust-sensitive use or structure\u201d or \u201cnoise-sensitive use or structure\u201d \u2014 rather than the defined terms \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d \u2014 is as likely the product of inexact drafting as it is a textual clue as to the meaning of the terms \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d or \u201cnoise-sensitive use.\u201d <em>Cf. Friends of Yamhill County v. Yamhill County, </em>229 Or App 188, 194-95, 211 P3d 297 (2009) (noting that redundancy is a fairly common feature of legislative drafting). For that reason, we are not persuaded by petitioners\u2019 contextual analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In addition to arguing that the code definitions of \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d were misconstrued by the county, petitioners appear to argue, alternatively, that the county looked to the wrong <em>source </em>for the definition of those terms. More specifically, petitioners argue that the county should have looked to the \u201cdefinitions\u201d of those terms in a site-specific ESEE Findings and Decision rather than the definitions in DCC Chapter 18.52. As previously noted, the county adopted in 1990 an \u201cESEE Findings and Decision\u201d for site 303, the site which Latham intends to mine. The ESEE Findings and Decision discusses various \u201cconflicts with the uses at the site and in the surrounding zones,\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201c(1) The impacts of noise (including heavy equipment, truck traffic, blasting, processing, and drilling) on persons dwelling in or patronizing noise-sensitive uses in the surrounding zoning. The Board finds that under DEQ noise standards, all possible uses in the surrounding zones would be noise-sensitive uses, except utility uses, landfill uses, other mining or geothermal uses, personal landing strip uses, forest products processing uses, and hydroelectric uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201c(2) The impacts of dust on dust-sensitive uses. The Board finds that all commercial, residential, park, or community-type uses are dust-sensitive uses due to the potential health impacts of dust on occupants and patrons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Petitioners argue that, to the extent that those \u201cdefinitions\u201d conflict with the county\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d in the county code, the ESEE controls. For that proposition, petitioners rely on DCC 18.52.020, which provides that, \u201c[w]hen there is a conflict between the site-specific ESEE analysis and the provisions of DCC 18, the site-specific ESEE analysis shall control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The county rejected that same argument, on the ground that petitioners had misinterpreted DCC 18.52.020\u2014 specifically, the term \u201cESEE analysis.\u201d The \u201cESEE analysis,\u201d the county explained, referred to a particular part of the ESEE Findings and Decision, the \u201cProgram to Meet the Goal\u201d section, which actually describes the standards for implementing the program to meet Goal 5 with respect to site 303. The \u201cdefinitions\u201d of noise-sensitive and dust-sensitive uses relied on by petitioners are found in the \u201cFindings and Conclusions\u201d section of the ESEE Findings and Decision, which, the county determined, is not part of the \u201cESEE analysis\u201d and therefore cannot somehow trump the provisions of Chapter 18.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Given our deference to the county\u2019s interpretation of its own code, we are not persuaded that LUBA or the county erred regarding treatment of the ESEE Findings and Decision. The term \u201cESEE analysis\u201d is not defined in the county\u2019s code, the ESEE Findings and Decision, or, as far as we can tell, anywhere else. The county\u2019s interpretation of that phrase in DCC 18.52.020 is certainly a plausible one, considering that the \u201cProgram to Meet the Goal\u201d section of the ESEE Findings and Decision embodies the county\u2019s zoning determination (\u201cthe site on the top of the plateau will be zoned for surface mining\u201d) and imposes particular \u201cESEE conditions\u201d in order to ensure that Goal 5 will be met. It is logical to conclude, as the county did, that the zoning and conditions established in the \u201cProgram to Meet the Goal\u201d are the types of \u201canalysis\u201d that would potentially conflict with the zoning provisions of DCC Chapter 18.52. We therefore reject petitioners\u2019 contention that the \u201cdefinitions\u201d in the ESEE Findings and Decision required a different decision by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Lastly, and alternatively, petitioners contend that, to the extent that we conclude that the county\u2019s interpretations of \u201cnoise-sensitive use\u201d and \u201cdust-sensitive use\u201d are \u201cplausible\u201d \u2014 which we described in <em>Siporen </em>as the standard for affirming a local government\u2019s interpretation of its own code \u2014 then Siporen\u2019s \u201cplausibility standard\u201d is contrary to ORS 197.829 and <em>Clark, </em>313 Or 508. We reject that argument without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> Pursuant to Goal 5, local governments are to inventory key resources including mineral and aggregate sites. <em>See </em>OAR 660-016-0000 (inventory of Goal 5 resources).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> Condition 9 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cThe owner/operator shall control noise generated by the mining operation and its associated activities so as to meet all applicable DEQ standards.
