J.</author>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">Third-party defendant-respondent Central Oregon Logging (COL) petitions, pursuant to ORAP 6.25(1), for reconsideration of our decision reversing the trial court\u2019s allowance of COL\u2019s first motion for summary judgment and remanding this matter to the trial court to determine third-party plaintiff-appellant PacifiCorp\u2019s asserted entitlement to indemnification from COL. <em>Dept. of Forestry v. PacifiCorp, </em>236 Or App 326, 237 P3d 861 (2010). We allow reconsideration to address one of COL\u2019s contentions, which we understand to be a request for clarification of our disposition, reject COL\u2019s other contentions without discussion, and, with the modification set out below, adhere to our original opinion and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">COL contends that our opinion, in several instances, at least implies that the only issue remaining to be litigated and determined on remand with respect to PacifiCorp\u2019s asserted entitlement to indemnification is whether the East Antelope Fire was caused by PacifiCorp\u2019s sole negligence. That is, our opinion could be read to suggest that, unless the fire was caused by PacifiCorp\u2019s sole negligence, COL will be contractually obligated to indemnify PacifiCorp. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 337-38 (\u201cBased on our review of the record, we conclude that there are disputed issues of material fact as to whether the fire was caused by PacifiCorp\u2019s sole negligence.\u201d). COL further asserts that the scope of remand cannot properly be so limited because, under Article 13 of the parties\u2019 contract, COL\u2019s indemnification obligation pertains solely to losses, costs, and damages</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cresulting from, arising out of, or in any way connected with any act, omission, fault or negligence of [COL] in the performance or nonperformance of [COL\u2019s] obligations under this Contract or in any way related to this Contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Thus, COL reasons, even if it is determined on remand that the fire was not caused by PacifiCorp\u2019s sole negligence, COL will not be liable to PacifiCorp for indemnification unless PacifiCorp also proves the above-quoted prerequisite for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>PacifiCorp, for its part, candidly acknowledges that the scope of remand could not properly be limited to a determination of whether the fire was caused by its sole negligence. Rather \u2014 and while observing that \u201c[n]othing in the court\u2019s opinion is to the contrary\u201d \u2014 PacifiCorp</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">\u201cagrees that it had the burden, as an initial matter, of showing that the Oregon Department of Forestry\u2019s claim came within the scope of the indemnity clause, for example, that the 2002 East Antelope fire resulted from, arose out of or was in any way connected to the Contract or COL\u2019s performance under the Contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Notwithstanding that acknowledgment by PacifiCorp, and to forestall any misunderstanding on remand, the practical and prudent course is to modify our opinion so as to leave no question as to the scope of the inquiry on remand. Accordingly, we modify the opinion in two respects. First, we revise the following sentence at 236 Or App at 333 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cNevertheless, PacifiCorp was not entitled to prevail on its cross-motion for summary judgment, because there are unresolved issues of material fact pertaining to the application of the Article 13 indemnification provision in this case \u2014 and, particularly, whether the predicate liability arose from PacifiCorp\u2019s \u2018sole negligence\u2019 <em>and, if not, whether the predicate liability resulted from, arose out of, or was in any way connected with COL\u2019s performance or nonperformance of the contract or in any way related to the contract.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">(New language emphasized.) Second, the penultimate sentence of the opinion, 236 Or App at 337-38, is modified to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cWe reject that contention summarily: Based on our review of the record, we conclude that there are disputed issues of material fact as to whether the fire was caused by PacifiCorp\u2019s sole negligence <em>and, if not, whether the predicate liability resulted from, arose out of, or was in any way connected with the performance or nonperformance of COL\u2019s obligations under the contract or in any way related to the contract.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">(New language emphasized.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> Given those modifications, we decline COL\u2019s invitation to make additional, parallel revisions to other portions of the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
