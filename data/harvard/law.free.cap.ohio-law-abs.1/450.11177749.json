An indictment charging that defendants induced a carrier to take a shipment of liquor for delivery to a named consignee in New York when the purpose was to have delivery made at a different place to one not the consignee, is sufficient to charge an offense under the national prohibition act.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
