Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs, Department of State, State Board of Nursing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2014),\n   <em>\n    petition for allowance of appeal denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20680\">\n    109 A.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.2015), which affirmed that new interpretation. Because we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   's punitive interpretation of the ambiguous statutory provisions of the Nursing Law violates the principle that ambiguities in penal statutes must be strictly construed against the government, Section 1928(b)(1) of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (Statutory Construction Act), 1 Pa.

Therefore, we reverse the Board's Order to the extent that it mandates a 10-year suspension of Ms. McGrath's license and requires, based on\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   , Ms. McGrath to reapply for a new license under Section 6(c)(1) of the Nursing Law, rather than request reissuance of her suspended license pursuant to Section 15 of the Nursing Law, 63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 216(c)(1), 225.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. McGrath is a licensed registered nurse. On August 29, 2013, the Commonwealth filed a Petition for Automatic Suspension (Petition) requesting that Ms. McGrath's license automatically be suspended pursuant to Section 15.1(b) of the Nursing Law, 63 P.S. \u00a7 225.1(b) (requiring the automatic suspension of a nursing license following a felony conviction for violating the Drug Act). Attached to the Petition were certified copies of records from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County indicating that Ms. McGrath had been \"convicted of one count of Acquisition or Possession of a Controlled Substance by Misrepresentation, Fraud, Forgery, Deception or Subterfuge, a felony under Section 13(a)(12) of\" the Drug Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Final Adjudication at 1 (footnote omitted).) On September 20, 2013, the Board issued a Notice and Order of Automatic Suspension (Notice and Order) automatically suspending Ms. McGrath's license and advising her of her hearing and appeal rights. (Notice and Order, C.R. Item 1.) Ms. McGrath requested a hearing and, because her criminal charges were being appealed, a stay of the suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    B. Statutory Language and the Board's Varying Interpretations Thereof\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before detailing the Board's determination, we set forth the relevant statutory language from the Nursing Law that governs the Board's authority to suspend, revoke, and reissue a professional nursing license. Section 14 of the Nursing Law sets forth the discretionary bases for suspending or revoking a professional nursing license. Under that section, the Board may suspend or revoke a license for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : \"being convicted of, pleading guilty or\n   <em>\n    nolo\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    contendere\n   </em>\n   , to a crime of moral turpitude\"; or \"receiv[ing] probation without verdict ... in the disposition of felony charges.\" 63 P.S. \u00a7 224(a)(5). Section 15 describes the process of suspending, revoking, and reissuing licenses, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   All suspensions and revocations shall be made only in accordance with the regulations of the Board, and only by majority vote of the members of the Board after a full and fair hearing before the Board. All actions of the Board shall be taken subject to the right of notice, hearing and adjudication, and the right of appeal therefrom, in accordance with the provisions in Title 2 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (relating to administrative law and procedure), or any amendment or reenactment thereof, relating to adjudication procedure.\n   <em>\n    The Board, by majority action and in accordance with its regulations, may reissue any license which has been suspended. If a license has been revoked, the Board can reissue a license only in accordance with section 15.2.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   63 P.S. \u00a7 225 (emphasis added). This section thus distinguishes between suspended and revoked licenses, permitting the Board to reissue any suspended license, while limiting the circumstances under which the Board can reissue revoked licenses. Section 15.1(b) of the Nursing Law addresses\n   <em>\n    automatic suspensions\n   </em>\n   of licenses and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A license issued under this act shall automatically be suspended upon the legal commitment to an institution because of mental incompetency from any cause upon filing with the Board a certified copy of such commitment,\n   <em>\n    conviction of a felony under [the Drug Act]\n   </em>\n   or conviction of an offense under the laws of another jurisdiction, which, if committed in Pennsylvania, would be a felony under [the Drug Act]. As used in this section the term \"conviction\" shall include a judgment, an admission of guilt or a plea of nolo contendere. Automatic suspension under this subsection shall not be stayed pending any appeal of a conviction.\n   <em>\n    Restoration of such license shall be made as\n    <em>\n     hereinafter\n    </em>\n    provided in the case of revocation or suspension of such license.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   63 P.S. \u00a7 225.1(b) (emphasis added). Immediately following Section 15.1 is Section 15.2, which, by its terms, applies to\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     revoked\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   licenses and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Unless ordered to do so by Commonwealth Court or an appeal therefrom, the Board shall not reinstate the license of a person to practice nursing or dietetics-nutrition which has been\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     revoked\n    </em>\n    . Any person whose license has been\n    <em>\n     revoked\n    </em>\n    may reapply for a license, after a period of at least five (5) years,\n    <em>\n     but must meet all of the licensing qualifications of this act for the license applied for\n    </em>\n    , to include the examination requirement, if he or she desires to practice at any time after such revocation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   63 P.S. \u00a7 225.2 (emphasis added). The licensing qualifications for\n   <em>\n    applicants\n   </em>\n   are found in Section 6 of the Nursing Law, subsection (c), which provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (c) The Board shall not issue a license or certificate to an applicant who has been convicted of a felonious act prohibited by [the Drug Act] or convicted of a felony relating to a controlled substance in a court of law of the United States or any other state, territory or country unless:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    (1) at least ten (10) years have elapsed from the date of conviction;\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   63 P.S. \u00a7 216(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Previously, the Board interpreted this statutory language as permitting it to consider each automatic license suspension on a case-by-case basis to determine the length of the suspension and to approve\n   consent decrees setting forth the term of the suspension.\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at 967, 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board's interpretation relied on Section 15, which gives the Board discretion in imposing and reviewing license suspensions under the Nursing Law. 63 P.S. \u00a7 225. However, in 2013, the Board changed its interpretation of these provisions without, as observed in\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   , engaging in either formal interpretation, i.e., promulgating regulations, or informal interpretation, i.e., issuing policy guidelines, regarding its new interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at 969-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the Board \"altered its application of the [Nursing] Law based upon a directive from its parent agency, the Department of State [ (Department) ], Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs [ (Bureau) ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the Board, \"the [Bureau] made the determination that the language in all the acts with automatic suspension provisions authorized the boards to impose a [10] year automatic suspension and that all healthcare providers should be treated equally.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 970 n. 10 (internal quotation omitted). Thus, \"until ... the Bureau or the Department issued an unidentified directive in 2013 to all health profession boards\" indicating that \"the Board (and apparently prosecutors in the Bureau)\" had to apply Sections 15.1 and 15.2 in a non-discretionary manner, the Board and the Bureau's prosecutors interpreted the statutory language as authorizing the exercise of discretion in determining the length of a suspension issued pursuant to Section 15.1(b).\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Board's Determination Here\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A Board Hearing Examiner held a formal hearing on November 7, 2013, at 1:30 p.m., at which Ms. McGrath was not present. The Commonwealth offered into evidence the Petition, the Notice and Order, and certified records from Ms. McGrath's criminal proceedings and rested. Following the admission of these documents, the Hearing Examiner concluded the hearing at 1:49 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. McGrath arrived at 2:15 p.m., but the hearing had already concluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. McGrath requested a new hearing on November 22, 2013. By Proposed Memorandum and Order dated February 18, 2014, the Hearing Examiner denied the request for a new hearing and affirmed the Notice and Order. The Board indicated that it was going to review the Proposed Memorandum and Order. Ms. McGrath filed a Brief on Exceptions, to which the Commonwealth filed a Reply Brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After reviewing the entire record and applying its new non-discretionary interpretation of the Nursing Law, the Board issued its Final Adjudication and Order affirming the mandatory 10-year suspension of Ms. McGrath's license based on her felony conviction for a single count of violating Section 13(a)(12) of the Drug Act. The Board held that, pursuant to Section 15.1(b) of the Nursing Law, this felony conviction\n   <em>\n    mandated\n   </em>\n   that her license be automatically suspended and could \"only be restored pursuant to the requirements for suspension and revocations.\" (Final Adjudication at 5.) Citing\n   Section 15.2 of the Nursing Law, the Board concluded that \"\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   licensees [must] meet all of the licensure requirements at the time of restoration\" and that Ms. McGrath was \"precluded by Section 6(c)(1) of the [Nursing Law], 63 P.S. \u00a7 216(c)(1), from being relicensed for [10] years.\" (Final Adjudication at 5 (emphasis added).) Section 6(c)(1), which applies to\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   applicants, requires a 10-year period between an application for a new license and a felony conviction under the Drug Act. 63 P.S. \u00a7 216(c)(1). Although Ms. McGrath objected to the change in the Board's interpretation of their review under Section 15.1, the Board responded that\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   held that the Board's new interpretation was reasonable. (Final Adjudication at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   970 n. 11 ).) Finally, the Board rejected, as not relevant, Ms. McGrath's argument that she was appealing her conviction, claiming that it had no discretion where there was a felony conviction under the Drug Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. McGrath now petitions for review of that Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Packer\n    </em>\n    and Principles of Statutory Construction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Board relied on\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   to deny Ms. McGrath's appeal because, in that case, this Court affirmed the Board's new interpretation of Sections 15.1(b) and 15.2 of the Nursing Law as requiring a mandatory 10-year suspension of a professional license for a nurse whose license was suspended because of a felony conviction under the Drug Act. (Final Adjudication at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   970 n. 11 ).) After reviewing the above-cited statutory language in\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   , we stated that \"the statute lacks clarity with regard to which provision or provisions of the [Nursing] Law govern the length of time of an automatic suspension under Section 15.1(b) of the [Nursing] Law, [and] ... conclude[d] that this provision is ambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we found it necessary to resort to the rules of statutory construction to ascertain the General Assembly's intent and resolve the ambiguity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those well-settled rules provide the following.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   When the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) The occasion and necessity for the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) The circumstances under which it was enacted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) The mischief to be remedied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (4) The object to be attained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (5) The former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (6) The consequences of a particular interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (7) The contemporaneous legislative history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (8) Legislative and administrative interpretations of such statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1 Pa.

Section 1928(b)(1) of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.

Thus, in addition to the arguments set forth in their initial briefs related to, respectively, whether the Board erred in relying on\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   and in changing its interpretation of the Nursing Law without promulgating a rule or regulation setting forth that new interpretation, and that\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   mandates the result here, the parties filed supplemental memoranda of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ms. McGrath argues that\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   's interpretation is inconsistent with Section 1928(b)(1) of the Statutory Construction Act, as the sections involved are penal in nature and yet\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   imposed a harsher punishment than others available in the Nursing Law. She asserts that, despite the other provisions of the Nursing Law that address suspensions,\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   's interpretation singles out these particular suspensions to impose a mandatory 10-year suspension, which does not consider the context of the entire Nursing Law. Ms. McGrath maintains that the General Assembly is aware of the difference between a suspended license and a revoked license, as it distinguished between the two in Section 15 of the Nursing Law. In that section, Ms. McGrath asserts, the General Assembly sets forth one way of reissuing suspended licenses, under Section 15, and a second way of reissuing revoked licenses, under Section 15.2. According to Ms. McGrath, \" 'where a section of a statute contains a given word, the omission of such word from a similar section of the statute shows a different legislative intent,' \" and the General Assembly did not include the phrase \"suspended license\" in Section 15.2 and that phrase should not be read into this provision.

Absent specific language in Section 15.2 requiring that section to apply to suspended licenses, Ms. McGrath contends that the general provisions related to the Board's review of suspended licenses of Section 15 should apply to an automatic suspension imposed under Section 15.1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Board argues that there is no need to apply Section 1928(b)(1) and the rule of lenity because, following the principles of statutory construction, this Court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   that when the relevant provisions of the Nursing Law are read together, Section 15.1(b) of the Nursing Law is not ambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This interpretation,\n   according to the Board, is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Whalen v.

The Board asserts that, in these cases, the respective courts held that where the general rules of statutory construction can ascertain the General Assembly's intent, it is not necessary to resort to the rule of lenity or Section 1928(b)(1) of the Statutory Construction Act. The Board further asserts that, even if Section 15 applies to the automatic suspensions imposed under Section 15.1(b), the Board could still require those licensees to wait 10 years before the Board reissues their licenses through the discretionary review process provided in Section 15. It contends that treating licensees with suspended licenses for felony Drug Act convictions the same as new applicants by imposing a 10-year period between conviction and reissuance/grant of a professional nursing license comports with the General Assembly's intent to limit the Board's discretion under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    D. Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   correctly found that these provisions of the Nursing Law are ambiguous and, therefore, subject to principles of statutory construction in order to ascertain the General Assembly's intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. McGrath and Ms. Packer each pleaded guilty to a single violation of Section 13(a)(12) of the Drug Act which is a felony; therefore, Section 15.1(b) of the Nursing Law applies. Section 15.1(b) states that, because of the conviction, her nursing license \"shall automatically be\n   <em>\n    suspended.\n   </em>\n   \" 63 P.S. \u00a7 225.1(b) (emphasis added). Yet, Section 15.1(b) also contains the following sentence: \"\n   <em>\n    Restoration\n   </em>\n   of such license shall be made\n   <em>\n    as hereinafter provided\n   </em>\n   in the case of\n   <em>\n    revocation or suspension\n   </em>\n   of such license.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Moreover, Section 15 of the Nursing Law does distinguish between suspended and revoked licenses. Section 15 provides that \"[t]he Board, by majority action and in accordance with its regulations,\n   <em>\n    may reissue\n    <strong>\n     any\n    </strong>\n    license\n   </em>\n   which has been\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    If\n   </em>\n   a license has been\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   , the Board can reissue a license\n   <em>\n    only in accordance with section 15.2\n   </em>\n   .\" 63 P.S. \u00a7 225 (emphasis added). Section 15.2 applies by its terms to\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   licenses, prohibiting the Board from reissuing a\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   license, and instead, providing that \"[a]ny person whose license has been\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   may reapply for a license, after a period of at least five (5) years, but must meet\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the licensing qualifications of this act for the license applied for ....\" 63 P.S. \u00a7 225.2 (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    New applicants\n   </em>\n   for a nursing license fall within Section 6(c) of the Nursing Law, which requires a\n   <em>\n    10-year waiting period\n   </em>\n   between a conviction under the Drug Act and the issuance of a nursing license. 63 P.S. \u00a7 216(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Initially, the interpretation may seem clear. Under Section 15.1(b), Ms. McGrath,\n   like Ms. Packer, had her nursing license automatically\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   as a result of her conviction. Under Section 15, the Board may reissue any\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   license, which, as Ms. McGrath argues, gives the Board discretion to make a determination on a case-by-case basis. In fact, this rather simple interpretation is the interpretation the Board previously used until directed to do otherwise by \"the Bureau or the Department [in an] unidentified directive in 2013.\"\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at 970-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, Section 15.1(b) also states that \"\n   <em>\n    [r]estoration\n   </em>\n   of such license shall be made\n   <em>\n    as hereinafter provided\n   </em>\n   in the case of\n   <em>\n    revocation or suspension\n   </em>\n   of such license.\" 63 P.S. \u00a7 225.1(b) (emphasis added). The phrases \"as\n   <em>\n    hereinafter\n   </em>\n   provided\" and \"\n   <em>\n    revocation or suspension\n   </em>\n   \" create an ambiguity because the section after 15.1 is 15.2, which applies to revocations but does not even mention suspensions. While Ms. McGrath argues that the Board may reissue the\n   <em>\n    suspended license\n   </em>\n   under Section 15, the Board and this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   found that Section 15.2 applies, and so the suspended license has to be treated as if it had been revoked for restoration purposes. Under that interpretation, Ms. McGrath, like Ms. Packer, has to reapply for her license as if she is a new applicant. The result is that, instead of the Board having discretion to reissue their suspended nursing licenses when appropriate, their licenses have been revoked for a minimum of 10 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But Section 15.1(b) of the Nursing Law provides for the automatic\n   <em>\n    suspension\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    not revocation\n   </em>\n   , of a license for a conviction under the Drug Act. The Board could have sought revocation of Ms. McGrath's license based upon her conviction under Section 14 of the Nursing Law, 63 P.S. \u00a7 224 (providing bases for discipline, including revocation of a license, for being convicted for crimes of moral turpitude or the possession or use of controlled substances for other than medical purposes), but\n   <em>\n    it did not\n   </em>\n   . Had the Board successfully revoked her license, the\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   license plainly then would have been subject to the requirements of Section 15.2. Reissuance of\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   licenses is addressed\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in Section 15, which provides the Board with broad discretion for reissuing such licenses. Section 15 expressly states that revocations are governed by Section 15.2, which provides either a 5-year or 10-year revocation period when read in conjunction with Section 6(c)(1). 63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 216(c)(1), 225, 225.2.\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that Section 15 could not apply because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , it preceded Section 15.1(b) disregards the fact that Section 15.2 expressly refers\n   <em>\n    only to license revocations\n   </em>\n   , and does not address suspensions.\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   focused on the word \"hereinafter,\" in Section 15.1(b), and in doing so, expanded the application of Section 15.2, a provision that applies by its terms\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   licenses, to also include\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   licenses. This addition expanded Ms. McGrath's automatic suspension into a mandatory 10-year revocation and eliminated the Board's discretionary review\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   permitted in Section 15, which seems contrary to the rule of statutory construction that preclude courts from adding language to statutes.\n   <em>\n    Summit Sch., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886204\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/108/192/6886204/#p199\">\n    108 A.3d at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   However, construing this language as applying Section 15, rather than Section 15.2, as the standard for reissuing licenses suspended under Section 15.1(b) also is problematic. Thus, both interpretations cause difficulty: one requiring the Court to add language to Section 15.2 (expanding its application to include suspended licenses) as discussed above, the other omitting language from Section 15.1(b) (not giving effect to the word \"hereinafter\") as referenced in\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   . Neither interpretation completely comports with the principles of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(a) (requiring that we attempt to give effect to all the provisions of a statute);\n   <em>\n    Summit Sch., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886204\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/108/192/6886204/#p199\">\n    108 A.3d at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that courts do not \"have authority to add or insert language into a statute\" and should not, through interpretation, add a requirement that the General Assembly did not include). Moreover, although licenses are automatically suspended pursuant to Section 15.1(b) thereby reflecting the General Assembly recognition that Drug Act convictions are unquestionably serious matters, the General Assembly did not impose the automatic\n   <em>\n    revocation\n   </em>\n   of such licenses, which would have\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   limited, under the plain language of both Sections 15 and 15.2 of the Nursing Law, the Board's review of the restoration of those licenses to the terms set forth Section 15.2. Although\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   interpreted those provisions as meaning that the General Assembly \"more likely\" wanted to remove\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   discretion from the Board to review these\n   <em>\n    suspensions\n   </em>\n   for 10 years,\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , had the General Assembly intended to do so, it would have required the automatic\n   <em>\n    revocation\n   </em>\n   of those licenses, not suspension. Accordingly, despite applying the general rules of statutory construction, this statutory language remains ambiguous, and it is, therefore, necessary to apply the principles set forth in Section 1928(b) of the Statutory Construction Act and the rule of lenity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Statutory provisions that impose punishment, such as the suspension or revocation of a professional license, for specified acts are considered\n   <em>\n    penal\n   </em>\n   in nature.\n   <em>\n    Pa.

As previously described, the rule of lenity provides that the statute should provide a clear and unequivocal warning in language that people generally would understand, as to what actions would expose them to liability for penalties and what the penalties would be. Additionally, ambiguities should be strictly construed against the government. The language of Section 15.2 does not comply with the rule of lenity as it does not provide \"a clear and unequivocal warning ... that people generally would understand\" that the reissuance of a nursing license\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   under Section 15.1(b) would be governed by the more restrictive requirements of Section 15.2, which applies to\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   licenses, rather than by Section 15, which expressly addresses the reissuance of suspended licenses.\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280309\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/20/596/#p600\">\n    20 A.3d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted). This is particularly troubling where the Board changed its long-standing interpretation of those provisions without providing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   formal or informal warning, via regulation or policy guideline, of that change to the licensees over whom the Board exercises authority. Moreover, the change in interpretation was not premised on the Board's own review of the language of the Nursing Law, but on an unidentified Department or Bureau directive that, regardless of the actual language within the professional licensing statute at issue,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   professional licensing boards that license healthcare providers were to impose a mandatory 10-year license suspension based on a felony conviction under the Drug Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922945\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/965/\">\n    99 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   970 n.10.
