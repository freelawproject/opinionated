On July 24, 2015, the court denied the motion without hearing or written opinion. This appeal followed. It presents an appropriate occasion for a macroscopic overview of Rule 4-345(a) : its origin; its purpose; its resultant freedom from a filing deadline; its critical distinction between inherent sentence illegality and antecedent procedural illegality; the great leap forward from looking simply at statutory sentencing caps to more ambiguous caps imposed by plea negotiations; and the criteria for deciding precisely what a negotiated agreement means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Antecedent Trial and Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the trial of the case based on the agreed statement of facts on April 18, 2011, the appellant was found 1) guilty of conspiracy to commit theft of property with a value of at least $1,000 and 2) guilty of making a false statement when under arrest. On August 11, 2011, he was sentenced to a term of ten years' incarceration with all but four years suspended followed by four years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The appellant appealed his convictions to this Court. In a 44-page opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ray v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000521\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/206/309/\">\n    206 Md.App. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000521\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/206/309/\">\n    47 A.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), this Court affirmed the convictions. That opinion is not pertinent to the issue now before us. The Court of Appeals granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to consider the single issue of whether there was probable cause for the arrest. The majority opinion for the Court, however, held that the Fourth Amendment issue had not been properly preserved for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    Ray v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725775\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/1/\">\n    435 Md. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725775\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/435/1/\">\n    76 A.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

The contention, however tardy, is cognizable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    For Auld Lang Syne\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Whence, then, Rule 4-345(a)'s unique and open-ended filing calendar? Rule 4-345(a), without the loss or gain of a comma, has been with us a long time (since 1951). The Rules of Criminal Procedure were completely recodified by Order of the Court of Appeals dated April 6, 1984, and effective as of July 1, 1984. What is now Rule 4-345(a) had theretofore been codified, verbatim, as Maryland Rule 774(a). That provision had, in turn, been codified as Maryland Rule 764(a) prior to July 1, 1977. Before a yet earlier rewriting of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, adopted on September 15, 1961 and effective as of January 1, 1962, the provision, in precisely its present language, had been Rule 744(a). Before 1962, the same unchanged provision had been Rule 10(a) of the Criminal Rules of Practice and Procedure. As Rule 10(a), it may be found, in the verbatim language of Rule 4-345(a) today, in Vol. 3, Horace Flack,\n   <em>\n    Annotated Code of Maryland\n   </em>\n   , Appendix B, General Rules of Practice and Procedure (1951). In\n   <em>\n    Drain v. Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207699\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/207/620/#p621\">\n    207 Md. 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.2d%20422\">\n    113 A.2d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955), the Court referred to this venerable progenitor of today's rule: \"If a sentence is illegal, the trial court may correct it at any time. General Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 4, rule 10.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The General Rules of Practice and Procedure were first adopted by the Court of Appeals in 1941. The minutes of the meeting of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of March 28, 1950, reflect that the reporter \"presented for the consideration of the Committee a letter from Chief Judge Ogle Marbury,\" reading in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"At the Conference (\n   <em>\n    Judiciary\n   </em>\n   ) the question was raised whether judges have power after the expiration of the term, or after 30 days, to reduce or suspend sentences imposed by them in criminal cases. The county judges were practically unanimous in their view that it could not be done, but the city judges seem to be doing it without any definite authority.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Chief Judge Marbury's request to the Rules Committee had been prompted by a discussion among judges at the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Judicial Council of Maryland in 1950 in which there was spirited disagreement over whether a trial judge possessed any authority to correct an illegal sentence or otherwise amend a sentence after the formal term of court in which the sentencing took place had terminated. The minutes of the meeting in Annapolis of May 29, 1951, reflect that the Rules Committee recommended to the Court of Appeals what the Court subsequently adopted as Rule 10(a): \"The Court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   What is now Rule 4-345(a) is virtually identical to an earlier version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1877483\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/274/29/#p39\">\n    274 Md. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=333%20A.2d%2037\">\n    333 A.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) (\"Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ... is virtually identical to the provisions of Maryland Rule 764a.\"). Federal Rule 35(a) at that time provided, \"The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\" In\n   <em>\n    Berkoff v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1123266\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/159/5/#p7\">\n    159 F.2d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (1947), the Eighth Circuit pointed out that Federal Rule 35 \"became effective March 21, 1946, but made no change in existing law.\" Thus, with respect to what is now Rule 4-345(a), the limit of legal memory is the 1951 adoption by the Court of Appeals of what then became Rule 10(a) of the Maryland Rules of Practice and Procedure. Beyond 1951, appellate memory runneth not to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Reason For the Filing Exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 4-345(a)'s exemption from a filing deadline is, indeed, a very narrow one. Despite the generality of the Rule's\n   wording, it does not permit the correction \"at any time\" of any illegality that may have lead to or contributed to the sentence\n   being challenged. The illegality referred to by Rule 4-345(a) must be an illegality inherent in the sentence itself as opposed to being some procedural (even constitutional) flaw in the trial resulting in the conviction for which the sentence is imposed or even a flaw in the sentencing procedure itself.\n   <em>\n    Tshiwala v.

The most obvious example of an excessive sentence would be one that, because it is so obvious, is never actually found in the caselaw. The better to understand the category, however, it should nonetheless always be kept in mind.

For an illegality, even when proved, to invoke the sanction of the rule, the sentence, either in its length or in its imposition of some other sanction, had to be somehow in excess of what had been expressly authorized by the legislature. The focus was on the sentencing statute itself. Courts could readily measure the sentence then being challenged against the statute. Until 2010, therefore, a Rule 4-345(a) hearing typically did not require any fact-finding. The hearing was essentially limited to legal argument. With respect to such argument, it was seldom necessary to look upstream to some earlier point along the adjudicative continuum. The boundary markers that were relied upon to measure the inherent legality of the sentence were well settled and essentially immutable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Cuffley\n    </em>\n    Trilogy: From Statutory Sentencing Caps to Negotiated Sentencing Caps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In a 14-month period between October of 2010 and January of 2012, the world of Rule 4-345(a) was transformed from a relatively obscure enclave of only infrequent challenges into a beehive of adjudicative activity. This appeal is at the epicenter of that beehive. The transformative agent was a trilogy of opinions:\n   <em>\n    Cuffley v.

(\"the\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   Trilogy\"). For the first time in a Rule 4-345(a) context, the Trilogy recognized a binding plea bargain, agreed to by a judge, as an effective modality for establishing an upper limit on a sentence. Any sentence in excess of that limit would be as inherently illegal under Rule 4-345(a) as would be a sentence in excess of a statutory limit. This was no minor change. Rule 4-345(a) was transformed from a relatively esoteric challenge to a sentence into a hub of busy post-conviction activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With the introduction of the plea bargain into the equation, several adjustments in Rule 4-345(a) practice became inevitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Prior to the introduction of a plea bargain as a binding upper limit on sentences, little fact-finding was required in Rule 4-345(a) cases because a controlling statute, inflexibly, was what it was. There could be little, if any, argument about the statute's very existence or about its express meaning. That world of comfortable certainty, however, now had to be left behind. Fact-finding, with all that it entails, now takes on far greater significance with sometimes the very existence of the plea agreement having to be hammered out on an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   case by case basis, as well as the meaning and the understanding of the plea agreement. To what extent, moreover, will the rules of statutory interpretation or contract interpretation now come into play in interpreting a plea agreement? It is a brave new world, with many still unanswered (and some still unasked) questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For analytic clarity, it also behooves us to remember that in a Rule 4-345(a) case\n   involving a plea bargain, we have not substituted a negotiated sentencing limitation for a statutory sentencing limitation. We have simply superimposed a new and secondary limitation on the older and primary limitation. Although in a plea negotiation case, attention will inevitably focus on the negotiated limitation, an illegality might theoretically inhere in a violation of either limitation. With plea bargains, we have added, not substituted an element to the mixture. See generally,\n   <em>\n    Carlini v.

Following the acceptance of Dotson's guilty plea, the judge properly sentenced him to a term of 15 years. A subsequent sentencing review panel, however, vacated that sentence and imposed sentences yielding a total of 30 years. Dotson appealed that aggregate sentence as illegal. The Court of Appeals left no doubt that a sentencing limit imposed by a plea bargain has the same legal effect as a sentencing limit imposed by a statute, and that a sentence in excess of either limit, by a sentence review panel or by the original sentencing judge, is illegal\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Generally, the maximum sentence allowable by law is that designated by the Legislature\n   </em>\n   .

The aspect of the agreement which motivated the pleas was that if they met the required criteria for acceptance, the judge would impose\n   a sentence not to exceed a total of 15 years. ...\n   <em>\n    When the judge accepted the pleas, the agreement as to punishment came into full bloom\n   </em>\n   ; it stood approved by the judge.\n   <em>\n    Thereafter, the agreement was inviolate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    and the judge was required\n   </em>\n   under the dictate of Rule 4-243(c)(3)\n   <em>\n    to embody in the judgment the agreed sentence\n   </em>\n   .

When that happens, of course, there is engaged the whole world of Rule 4-243, dealing with Plea Agreements. This then is the procedural context for the present appeal. Even more particularly, we are concerned with Rule 4-243(c)(3), which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \"(3) Approval of plea agreement. If the plea agreement is approved, the judge shall embody in the judgment the agreed sentence, disposition, or other judicial action encompassed in the agreement[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On March 2, 2011, the defense attorney for the appellant and the Assistant State's Attorney for Montgomery County, having reached an agreement, submitted to the Assignment Office of the circuit court, a signed memorandum indicating that they had agreed on a disposition of the case on two counts and requested that the case be set before the court as promptly as possible. The Memorandum fully recorded the terms of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \"The defendant agrees to proceed by way of an agreed statement of facts on count one, amended to allege conspiracy to commit theft of property having a value at least $1,000 but less than $10,000 and on count four, alleging false statement when under arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    CAP OF FOUR YEARS ON ANY EXECUTED INCARCERATION\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"Judgements of restitution totaling $8,377 will be entered as part of the\n   sentence, not merely as a term of probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \"The State will enter nolle prosequi to counts two and three at sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \"The State will defer to the Court as to the defendant's bond status between the date of the trial and the date of sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \"The defendant will waive his right under Maryland Rule 4-345(e) to request modification of his sentence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The meaning of that sentencing cap on \"any executed\" portion of the \"incarceration\" is the core issue of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    The Trial and the Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The hearing on the acceptance of the appellant's plea, and the subsequent trial itself, were held on April 18, 2011. The appellant was found 1) guilty of conspiracy to commit theft of property with a value of at least $1,000 and 2) guilty of making a false statement when under arrest. Our concern is only with the subsequent sentence on the first of those two counts. It was four months after the trial on the agreed statement of facts that the court imposed the sentence. At the outset of the August 11, 2011 sentencing hearing, the Assistant State's Attorney reminded the judge of the plea bargain to which the judge had earlier given his approval.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \"In this case, Your Honor agreed to\n   <em>\n    a cap of four years of any executed incarceration\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   After an extended discussion of other sentences the appellant was facing in Washington County on a series of recent but unrelated convictions, the court pronounced his sentence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \"Now,\n   <em>\n    on the first Count\n   </em>\n   , conspiracy to commit theft,\n   <em>\n    the Court will impose a sentence of 10 years to the Maryland Department of Corrections; I'll suspend all but four years\n   </em>\n   and that will be\n   <em>\n    concurrent with the sentence in the Hagerstown case\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   \"Now, with the false statement in violation of section 9-501 of the criminal law article, the Court will impose a sentence of six months, which is the maximum sentence in that particular case, and that will be concurrent with the sentence in Count 1.

The appellant invokes the\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   Trilogy of cases in support of his argument. The State's counter-contention is that a cap on \"executed incarceration\" is a cap only on that portion of the total sentence that is unsuspended, and that the sentence with all but four years suspended is, therefore, a legal sentence within the contemplation Rule 4-345(a). The State also invokes the\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   Trilogy of cases in support of its argument. Our mission, therefore, is to determine\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , as a matter of law, what the term \"cap of four years on any executed incarceration\" meant in the plea bargain that was before the court in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    How to Construe a Plea Bargain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Although negotiating a private contract and negotiating a guilty plea are by no means identical exercises, there is nonetheless a strong overlapping and symbiotic relationship between them. The caselaw, however, has had some trouble with the relationship. Virtually every statement in the case law pays lip service to that relationship\n   as it begins its discussion by affirming the strong relationship, but then it immediately disavows the potency of that relationship.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In these \"yes, but\" discussions the reader is very much left at sea. Shall we swim to the shore-or back to the ship? This indeterminate status of principles of contract interpretation can create a troubled middle ground when it comes to applying the principles to a given plea agreement. In terms of sometimes lacking analytic balance on the subject, appellate opinions themselves have not been without sin. Those opinions holding a defendant not bound by the arguably binding terms of his plea agreement stress the dissimilarities between the two contexts and tend to ignore totally the similarities that might cut the other way. Conversely, the opinions holding a defendant bound by the terms of the plea agreement stress the similarities between the two contexts and tend to ignore the dissimilarities. What is desperately needed is the appreciation that 1) the construing of a plea agreement is not, to be sure, slavishly controlled by contract principles but that 2) contract principles may nonetheless control a given outcome and may not be blithely repudiated or ignored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    The Prime Directive: The Overarching Significance of the Words Themselves\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   One interpretative principle is transcendent. The prime directive for statutory construction, for contract construction,\n   and now for the construction of a plea agreement is simply to read the words themselves that call for construction. If their meaning is clear and distinct and undisputed, the interpretive exercise is over.

They mean four years to be served in jail. They mean four years of \"hard time.\" They make no reference whatsoever to any suspended sentence and, indeed, distinguished themselves from it. They could not reasonably be interpreted by anyone to make such reference. Indeed, the term \"executed incarceration\" negates any reference to unexecuted incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The perennial flaw with most non-specific sentencing caps imposed on split sentences is that the ostensibly limiting cap provision does not indicate which part of a split sentence is being capped. A non-specific cap leaves open the possibility that the entire sentence (the unsuspended and the suspended portions alike) is being capped rather than that only the \"hard time\" is being capped. In that regard, our present case stands in stark contrast to all three cases in the\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   trilogy. In all three cases, the cap was upon the sentence generally with no express indication as to whether the cap was only on the executed portion of the sentence or also on the suspended part of the sentence. Those three sentencing caps were accordingly ambiguous by definition. To resolve that ambiguity, it became necessary to turn to extrinsic evidence, including most significantly the understanding or the intent of\n   the defendant himself (or, more accurately, a reasonable lay person in the shoes of the defendant, of which more\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ). In the present case, there was no such ambiguity and no reason to turn to any extrinsic evidence to resolve ambiguity. One does not need to resolve non-ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In our case, the distinct parts of the split sentence are \"executed incarceration,\" on the one hand, contrasted with \"unexecuted incarceration,\" on the other hand.\n   <em>\n    Webster's Unabridged Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Ed.) gives as definitions of \"executed\": \"carried out, performed\"; and as definitions of \"unexecuted\": \"not carried out, unperformed.\" There is no ambiguity in contrasting \"incarceration that is carried out\" with \"incarceration\n   that is not carried out\" or in contrasting \"performed incarceration\" with \"unperformed incarceration.\" This is no mere undifferentiated \"sentence within the guidelines.\" There is even a suggestion in\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   , 424 Md. at 524,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705302\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/503/\">\n    36 A.3d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that an adjective (past participle) such as \"executed\" is exactly what the plea bargain in that case needed to dissipate any possible ambiguity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   \"Neither did the State, defense counsel, or the Court\n   <em>\n    explain\n   </em>\n   for the record\n   <em>\n    that the words\n   </em>\n   'guideline range'\n   <em>\n    referred solely to executed time\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Finding no ambiguity in the critical terms of the plea bargain in this case, we hold that there was no reason to look elsewhere to resolve an ambiguity. No ambiguity existed. It is, moreover, hornbook law that extrinsic sources of evidence that may be helpful in resolving an ambiguity, when it actually exists, may not be used to create an ambiguity in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    The Man on the Clapham Omnibus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Even if we were to assume, purely\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the term \"executed incarceration\" might refer ambiguously to the suspended or unexecuted portion of a split sentence as well as to that portion of the sentence actually to be served, it would avail the appellant naught. In those situations where the terms of the plea agreement itself are ambiguous, it would become necessary to look to extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity. That is the circumstance in which the defendant himself and his understanding might play a role in the interpretive process. The earlier caselaw did, to be sure, seem to take a strong tilt of deference toward the appellant's own subjective understanding of what his plea bargain actually meant.\n   <em>\n    Solarzano v. State\n   </em>\n   , 397 Md. at 668,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860832\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/661/#p668\">\n    919 A.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , stated that the terms of a plea agreement are to be construed \"according to the reasonable understanding of the defendant when he pled guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   There lurked, of course, in that initial deferential tilt as to whose understanding of the plea agreement would prevail such a potentially counterproductive danger that the law could not allow those early statements to be carried to the limits of their logic. A defendant's understanding of what he agreed to might be paramount, but could the law trust the defendant to tell us what his understanding really was? Any savvy prisoner who challenges the legality of his sentence under Rule 4-345(a), after ruminating for 15 years after his guilty plea and the imposition of the sentence, will know full well what his purported understanding of his plea bargain will now have to be in order to make the sentence in ostensible excess of that plea agreement illegal. The prisoner to whose understanding we would defer, therefore, would be in the almost incontrovertible position of deciding his own Rule 4-345(a) motion. The caselaw, whatever to the contrary it may apparently have said along the way, could not fall for so transparent a ruse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Alert to the problem,\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   came up with the ultimate solution by devising a\n   way to defer to the defendant's bargaining predicament without deferring to the defendant's testimonial credibility. The deference will be only to the defendant as an abstraction. The magnificently clever solution was to substitute for the defendant, of palpably shaky reliability, a more trustworthy stand-in.\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   pioneered the substitution and introduced into Rule 4-345(a) jurisprudence the legendary \"reasonable man,\" that salutary legal fiction whom the British cousins call \"the man on the Clapham omnibus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The understanding of the terms of the deal by the defendant who entered the plea as his part of the deal may remain a dominant factor. Rather than accept\n   <em>\n    the defendant's subjective version\n   </em>\n   of what his understanding actually was, however, we prefer to determine\n   <em>\n    objectively what a reasonable non-lawyer's version\n   </em>\n   of the deal would have been under circumstances similar to those of the defendant, confining the knowledge of that hypothetical reasonable man to that which was formally\n   on the record of the hearing on the acceptance of the plea. In effect, the appellate court, applying the prescribed criteria and then making a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   objective determination, plays the role of the reasonable man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   In the words of\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695813\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/568/\">\n    416 Md. at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695813\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/568/\">\n    7 A.3d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"Whether a trial court has violated the terms of a plea agreement is a question of law, which we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\" Implicit in that statement is that the appellate court makes the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   determination, as a question of law, as to what the terms of a plea agreement actually were.

In the last analysis, we are only deferential to the defendant's objective manifestation (as a reasonable man) and not to his subjective manifestation (through his own testimony). That salutary substitution essentially eliminates the potential harm. The reasonable man, after all, does not delude us with self-serving testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   A word more about the reasonable man. In the context of interpreting plea agreements, of course, he is a non-lawyer with no sophisticated legal training of any sort. His knowledge is circumscribed, moreover, by what he can see and hear on the record in the course of the plea bargaining process itself, largely (if not entirely) at the hearing on the acceptance of the plea. His circumstances, moreover, are comparable to those of the appellant himself. Whether that implies that he is, therefore, a criminal defendant is by no means clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Who then is the reasonable man? Most significantly, how well or how ill does he handle the English language? Defense counsel harshly denigrates him in the context of his competency to understand the terms of a plea agreement, consigning him to the depths of borderline illiteracy. Counsel contends that the plea agreement in this case was\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   ambiguous because the past participle \"executed\" was too difficult a word for the appellant himself to wrap his brain around. The appellant never told us that, of course, but we are asked to surmise it. The necessary next step in the appellant's thesis is that if the appellant does not understand the word, neither would any reasonable lay person in the appellant's circumstances. Counsel doth, we think, protest too much. Even were we to attribute to our reasonable man the stigma of being a criminal defendant, we will not assume that he is thereby an untutored sluggard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   As we undertake our Promethean task of creating a fictive reasonable man and equipping him with reasonable linguistic attributes or even if our task were restructured to one of creating a reasonable member of a reasonable den of thieves, we know of no precedential authority that would forbid us to cast Fagin himself or at least Jack Dawkins (the glib Artful Dodger) in the role and that would restrict our choice to the lumpish Bill Sykes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent to which our profile of the literacy of the reasonable man might arguably be influenced in any way by the profile of the appellant himself, the circumstances of the appellant's original conviction of conspiracy to commit theft of the value of at least $1,000 reveal a sophisticated criminal involved in a clever scheme of using counterfeit credit cards to commit large scale theft.\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

Thus, what appeared to be a very complex case is very simply resolved. Game! Set! Match!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The competence of the reasonable man to understand the terms of the plea agreement was reinforced, moreover, by the\n   circumstances of the April 18, 2011 hearing at which the plea was entered. That hearing essentially circumscribes the universe of knowledge available to the reasonable man as he forms his understanding of the terms of the agreement. The full terms of the plea agreement had been reduced to a formal Memorandum that had earlier been submitted to the court. As the appellant stood before the court and was questioned by the judge about the voluntariness of his plea, the subject of the plea agreement was raised. The judge, with the Memorandum before him, read the key terms of the agreement into the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don't know that we put the terms of the plea actually on the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   \"THE COURT:\n   <em>\n    The terms of the plea are\n   </em>\n   that the defendant agrees to proceed by way of an agreed statement of facts on Count 1, amended to allege conspiracy to commit theft of property having a value of at least $1,000 but at less than $10,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   \"And\n   <em>\n    on Count 4, alleging false statement when under arrest.

The State will enter a nolle prosequi to Counts 2 and 3 at sentencing, and the State will defer to the Court as to defendant's bond status between the date of trial and the date of sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   \"The defendant will waive any right under Maryland rule 4-345(e) to request a modification of his sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   \"Are those the complete terms of the statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: They are, Your Honor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Defense counsel immediately turned to the appellant and confirmed that what the judge had said about the agreement\n   was precisely what the appellant and defense counsel had discussed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Montgomery, understanding those terms of the agreement ...\n   <em>\n    are those the terms of the plea agreement that you and I discussed\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   \"[THE APPELLANT]:\n   <em>\n    Yes\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). The reasonable man, observing that exchange, would have been in a position to infer that the key party to the plea agreement was,\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   , acquiescing in the common understanding of what the words of the agreement said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Because our reasonable lay man in the circumstances of the appellant was hypothetically endowed with the powers to see everything and to hear everything that took place at the April 18, 2011 hearing, he might have made one other interesting observation that could at least have reinforced the conclusion he had already reached about the nature of the plea agreement. One of the lesser provisions of the agreement was that the appellant would be permitted to remain out on the street on bail between the acceptance of the plea agreement (in April) and his sentencing\n   in August. What the reasonable man might have noticed was that the appellant was no mere passive observer but was keenly interested in \"street status\" as opposed to \"jail status,\" more than in some long-term status of an abstract sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   \"[THE APPELLANT]:\n   <em>\n    What was it about the bond issue\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The bond is that\n   <em>\n    the State's not going to be asking to have your bond revoked\n   </em>\n   -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   \"[THE APPELLANT]:\n   <em>\n    Okay\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:-(unintelligible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   \"THE COURT: Whether you stay out of jail between now and the time you get sentenced or not,\n   <em>\n    the State is not going to request that you be locked up while you're waiting for sentencing, okay\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   \"[THE STATE]: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   \"[THE APPELLANT]:\n   <em>\n    Yes, sir\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The reasonable man might have inferred from that exchange that even with respect to the ultimate sentence itself, the critical term that the appellant, among others, had hammered out was a term focused more on \"hard time\" than on the sentence in the abstract. Such an inference, however, would have been only peripheral reinforcement for the reasonable man's determination and is not pivotal in our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Maryland Rule 4-345(a) has come a long way since 1951. It is a far more significant body of law today than it was then. After burnishing the critical distinction between an illegality inherent in the sentence itself and other lesser illegalities, it expanded massively by embracing plea agreements as well as statutes as sentencing caps. It took on significant new complexity as it then ventured into the briar patch of split sentences. The critical fault line of the moment is that of construing the meaning of a plea agreement and the newly found instrumental utility of the reasonable man in performing that function. Emerging from this kaleidoscopic maze of issues is our conclusion that the sentence under immediate review was not inherently illegal and that the court was, therefore, correct in denying the appellant's Rule 4-345(a) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    By today's standards the sentencing mistake may seem bizarre, but in 1992 it was readily understandable.
