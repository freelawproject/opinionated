The dissolution of a non-traditional marriage just compounds the difficulties of this already challenging inquiry. This appeal arises out of a divorce between a lesbian couple, and involves a dispute over one spouse's right of access to a child conceived by artificial insemination and born before the couple was married. Petitioner calls upon us to revisit the concept of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parenthood and our previous\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Janice M. v. Margaret K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558896\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/404/661/\">\n    404 Md. 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558896\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/404/661/\">\n    948 A.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Michelle\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Brittany Conover began a relationship in July 2002. The parties discussed having a child and agreed that Brittany would be artificially inseminated from an anonymous donor arranged through the Shady Grove Fertility Clinic. The child was conceived in 2009. The couple gave birth to a son, Jaxon William Lee Eckel Conover (\"Jaxon\"), in April 2010. The birth certificate listed Brittany as Jaxon's mother, but no one was identified as the father. The parties married in the District of Columbia in September 2010 when Jaxon was about six months old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In September 2011, Michelle and Brittany separated. From the date of separation until July 2012, Michelle visited Jaxon and had overnight and weekend access. At some point in July 2012, Brittany prevented Michelle from continuing to visit Jaxon. In February 2013, Brittany filed a Complaint for Absolute Divorce, stating that there were no children shared by the couple from the marriage. Michelle filed an Answer later that month in which she requested visitation rights with respect to Jaxon. In March 2013, Michelle filed a Counter-Complaint for Absolute Divorce, in which she repeated her request for visitation rights. Michelle did not request custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In April 2013, the parties appeared at a hearing in the Circuit Court for Washington County to determine Michelle's standing to seek access to Jaxon. Brittany, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , argued that Michelle did not have parental standing because she was not listed on the birth certificate as a parent of Jaxon,\n   and that as a third party, she could not assert visitation rights. Michelle asserted that she had standing because she met the paternity factors for a \"father\" set forth in Md. Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), Estates &amp; Trusts (\"ET\"), \u00a7 1-208(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, Michelle's counsel\n   averred that there were \"constitutional reasons\" that supported this interpretation, but provided no further explanation. The Circuit Court requested supplemental memoranda. Michelle filed a legal memorandum in which no constitutional contentions were made. Brittany did not submit a memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Circuit Court then conducted an evidentiary hearing and took testimony from Michelle and Brittany. The following pieces of evidence were elicited at the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Michelle helped choose an anonymous sperm donor with characteristics similar to her own;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Brittany took on the more \"female\" role in the relationship, while Michelle took on the more \"masculine\" role;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Although Brittany later objected to the practice, Jaxon, at times, called Michelle \"Dada\" or \"Daddy\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Brittany sometimes referred to Michelle as Jaxon's father;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 A document, dated July 16, 2010, written entirely in Brittany's handwriting was introduced. It stated that both parties \"verified\" that they agreed to \"joint custody\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   of Jaxon with \"[t]he exact terms of which to be determined at a later date\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Michelle testified that the parties considered initiating a proceeding for Michelle to adopt Jaxon, but they could not afford the cost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the proceeding, Michelle's counsel contended that parental standing existed under ET \u00a7 1-208(b). She also argued that Brittany was estopped to deny that Michelle was the child's father. Finally, she stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   An alternative argument is that my client has standing for custody based on extra ... extraordinary circumstances. And ... and I'm not sure if you want me to go into that argument or not. Ah, but for a custody proceeding, a Court can consider custody to a third party or visitation to a third party if the Court finds that there are extraordinary circumstances. And I believe that this case screams extraordinary circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In June 2013, the Circuit Court issued a written opinion concluding that Michelle did not have standing to contest custody or visitation. First, the court found that Michelle did not have parental standing. The court took note of the common law and statutory presumption that a child born during a marriage is presumed to be the child of both spouses, but concluded that the presumption was not applicable here as Jaxon was conceived and born prior to Brittany and Michelle's marriage. The court also found Michelle did not establish parental standing under ET \u00a7 1-208(b) because she was not Jaxon's \"father.\" The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Although it is certainly a creative argument, the statute is intended for children to claim parentage and rights to\n   property after a parent has deceased, not for the parent to claim the child under it. Moreover, this Court finds that\n   even under its broadest interpretation, the statute's application was intended by the [L]egislature to be applied in instances of child support, not to establish standing for visitation and custody of a child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Fam.%20Law%20%C2%A7%205-1005\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 5-1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). [Michelle] argues that although not a male, she has sufficiently satisfied three of the four criteria under [ET] \u00a7 1-208(b) to qualify as the minor child's father. [Section] 1-208(b) specifically pertains to the parentage of an illegitimate child claiming his or her \"father[,]\" which [Michelle] in this case is not. During the hearing the parties testified to the fact that [Michelle] is in fact a female, had not adopted the child, and in no way was related to the child, thus not sufficiently establishing that she could be the \"father\" of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the Circuit Court stated that Michelle was Jaxon's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent, it relied on\n   <em>\n    Janice M. v. Margaret K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558896\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/404/661/\">\n    404 Md. 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558896\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/404/661/\">\n    948 A.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) in concluding that\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent status was not recognized in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, the court found that Michelle did not have \"third party\" standing to contest custody or visitation. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Janice M.\n   </em>\n   , the court held that Michelle, as a \"third party,\" had to show that Brittany was unfit or that exceptional circumstances existed to overcome the biological mother's constitutionally protected interest in the care and control of her child. Based on the testimony at the hearing, the court found Brittany to be a fit parent and that \"[t]here [had] been no showing of exceptional circumstances.\" The Circuit Court denied Michelle's request for custody or visitation based on lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the divorce was granted, Michelle timely appealed the Circuit Court's order on visitation to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in a reported decision.\n   <em>\n    Conover v. Conover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n    224 Md.App. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n    120 A.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). First, the intermediate appellate court considered it inappropriate to address the issue of whether ET \u00a7 1-208(b) must be read to include women.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n    at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n    120 A.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that whether the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution or the Equal Rights Amendment of\n   the Maryland Declaration of Rights necessitate that the term \"father\" in ET \u00a7 1-208(b) be given a gender-neutral construction was an issue that was neither raised nor decided below.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Next, the court ruled that even if Michelle qualified as a \"father\" under ET \u00a7 1-208(b) despite her being female, the statute did not establish parentage for purposes of child custody and visitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A non-biological, non-adoptive spouse who meets one, two or even three tests under ET \u00a7 1-208(b) is still a \"third party\" for child access purposes. Under\n   <em>\n    Janice M.\n   </em>\n   , he or she is not a \"legal parent\" .... He or she must still show exceptional circumstances to obtain access to a child over the objection of a fit biological parent and to overcome the natural parent's due process rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n    at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346520\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/224/366/\">\n    120 A.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We granted Michelle's Petition for Writ of Certiorari presenting the following two questions for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (1) Should Maryland reconsider\n   <em>\n    Janice M. v. Margaret K.\n   </em>\n   and recognize the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parenthood?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (2) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that Michelle is a \"third party,\" where Michelle is a legal parent under ET \u00a7 1-208(b) ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We hold that\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parenthood is a viable means to establish standing to contest custody or visitation and thus answer yes to the first question. We shall reverse\n   the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Because we overturn\n   <em>\n    Janice M\n   </em>\n   . and recognize\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent status, we need not address Michelle's arguments regarding ET \u00a7 1-208 and thus do not answer the second question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Brittany and Michelle agree that the facts in this case are not in dispute.

Although I agree with the Majority in the recognition of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parenthood in Maryland, in my view, the Majority, in adopting the four-factor test set forth by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in\n   <em>\n    In re Custody of H.S.H-K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8664832\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/193/649/\">\n    193 Wis.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8664832\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/193/649/\">\n    533 N.W.2d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 73 - 75, 85, 146 at A.3d 446-47, 453, adopts a standard that is too broad and that could have a negative impact on children in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   By adopting the four-factor test set forth in\n   <em>\n    H.S.H.-K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8664832\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/193/649/\">\n    533 N.W.2d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Majority holds that, under the first factor, when seeking\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent status, the third party must show \"that the biological or adoptive parent consented to, and fostered,\n   the [third party]'s formation and establishment of a parent-like relationship with the child[.]\" In other words, the Majority holds that only one parent is needed to consent to\n   and foster a parent-like relationship with the would-be\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent. This will work in cases such as this one, where a second biological or adoptive parent does not exist,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where there is only one existing parent. Where there are two existing parents, however, permitting a single parent to consent to and foster a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent relationship could result in a second existing parent having no knowledge that a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a third parent, is created. Such situations may result in a child having three parents vying for custody and visitation, and being overburdened by the demands of multiple parents. Today, many children are not living in a classic nuclear family. Families include not only same-sex married parents-in which one parent had a child before marriage-but also separated or divorced parents who conceived children during a marriage, as well as two parents who have never married. The Majority has written broadly a solution for\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parents that will serve couples well under circumstances similar to the parties in this case, where there is only one biological or adoptive parent. The majority opinion, however, will have greater consequences in cases for children with two existing parents because a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent request may occur without the knowledge or consent of the second existing parent. Children who already have difficulty with visitation schedules, or experience custody issues pertaining to two parents, will not be served well by the creation of a test that does not account for the second existing parent's knowledge and consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Oddly, the Majority expresses concern that multiple\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentships not be created and that trial courts should be cautious about overburdening families with multiple people seeking access in that regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 75 n.18, 146 A.3d at 447 n.18. Ironically, however, the Majority expresses no concern about the creation of a single\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship where there are already two existing parents, and where one parent may create a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship absent the other existing parent's notice of, and consent to, the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship of a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Imagining the untenable situation of a child who is parented by two adults one of whom, without the knowledge or consent\n   of the second already existing parent, creates a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship, I cannot agree with simply adopting the four-factor test without additional limits and safeguards. Even creating a standby guardianship in Maryland has traditionally required the consent of both parents. Indeed, under Md. Code Ann., Est. &amp; Trusts (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 13-903(a), concerning judicial appointment of a standby guardianship, provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) and (3) of this subsection, a petition for the judicial appointment of a standby guardian of the person or property of a minor under this section may be filed only by a parent of the minor, and if filed,\n   <strong>\n    shall be joined by each person having parental rights over the minor\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   (2) If a person who has parental rights cannot be located after reasonable efforts have been made to locate the person, the parent may file a petition for the judicial appointment of a standby guardian.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   (3) If the petitioner submits documentation, satisfactory to the court, of the reasonable efforts to locate the person who has parental rights, the court may issue a decree under this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   (Emphasis added). By contrast, here, the Majority creates the irreconcilable result that one parent in Maryland may not consent to a standby guardianship, absent documentation that the parent made reasonable efforts to locate and obtain the consent of the other parent, but that one parent may consent to and foster a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   (third) parent for a child without any sort of notice to, or consent from, a second existing parent. In my view, this is not a desirable result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Further, during the 2010 and 2015 legislative sessions, the General Assembly failed to pass\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent bills which were similarly or more narrowly constructed than the holding of the majority opinion. In 2010, two bills-Senate Bill 600 and House Bill 1241-were introduced \"for the purpose of requiring a court to determine that an individual is a de facto parent under certain circumstances; establishing that an individual\n   who is judicially determined to a be a de facto parent has the duties and obligations of a parent; and generally relating to de facto parents.\" S.B. 600, 2010 Regular Session, General Assembly of Maryland, http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2010rs/bills/sb/sb0600f.pdf [https://perma.cc/952F-XRN4] (capitalization omitted); H.B. 1241, 2010 Regular Session, General Assembly of Maryland, http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2010rs/bills/hb/hb1241f.pdf [https://perma.cc/8RQT-DAYP] (capitalization omitted). At that time, the proposed bills would have added a new section to the Family Law Article, providing, in pertinent part, that a court shall determine that an individual is a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent if the individual requests a judicial determination of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentage and if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the following circumstances exist:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (I)\n   <strong>\n    each parent of the minor child consented to, supported, and fostered the establishment of a parent-like relationship between the minor child and the individual\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   (II) the individual has exercised parent-like responsibility for the minor child; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   (III) the individual has acted in a parent-like role for a length of time sufficient to have established a bonded and dependent relationship with the minor child that is parental in nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   S.B. 600, 2010 Regular Session, General Assembly of Maryland, http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2010rs/bills/sb/sb0600f.pdf [https://perma.cc/952F-XRN4] (capitalization omitted) (emphasis added); H.B. 1241, 2010 Regular Session, General Assembly of Maryland, http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2010rs/bills/hb/hb1241f.pdf [https://perma.cc/8RQT-DAYP] (capitalization omitted) (emphasis added).

Notably, Senate Bill 402 and House Bill 577 altered the definition of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent previously proposed in 2010 by setting forth different criteria, including that the individual must have lived with the child over a substantial period of time and by eliminating the requirement that both parents of a child must consent to and foster the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent relationship. Additionally, the proposed bills altered the burden of proof necessary for a court to determine whether an individual is a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent to a preponderance of the evidence from clear and convincing evidence as previously proposed in 2010. Ultimately, Senate Bill 402 received a hearing in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, but received an unfavorable report,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.B. 402, 2015 Regular Session, General Assembly of Maryland, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Voting Record, http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2015RS/votes_comm/sb0402_jpr.pdf, [https://perma.cc/5LM9-J55U], and House Bill 577 received a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee, but was subsequently withdrawn following an unfavorable report,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   H.B. 577, 2015 Regular Session, General Assembly of Maryland, House Judiciary Committee Voting Record, http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2015RS/votes_comm/hb0577_jud.pdf [https://perma.cc/6JPQ-PLPD].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The proposed bills from 2010 and 2015 demonstrate that there are a number of details that necessarily must accompany any decision to recognize\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parenthood in Maryland-from what burden of proof an individual bears to how an action for\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship should be pled and what criteria an individual must satisfy to be declared a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent. In my view, the majority opinion is broader than, and\n   without the\n   constraints of, the withdrawn bills. For example, the majority opinion includes no information on the burden of proof in a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent case, the manner of petitioning to become a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent, how a trial court should deliver an opinion in a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent case, or, most importantly, a very basic limit that would protect children who already have two existing parents from the creation of a third parent in the absence of both existing parents' knowledge and consent to that\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   To fill the obvious void left by the majority opinion, I would offer the following guidance. In every instance in which a trial court is confronted with a request for\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship, the trial court should ascertain whether there are one or two existing biological or adoptive parents. In the case of two existing parents, the trial court should require that the second parent have notice of the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent request and ascertain whether the second parent consents to the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent relationship. In satisfaction of the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    H.S.H.-K.\n   </em>\n   test, an action for\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parenthood may be initiated only by an existing parent or a would-be\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent by the filing of a verified complaint attesting to the consent of the establishment of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent status. The trial court should find by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   (1) that the biological or adoptive parent consented to, and fostered, the petitioner's formation and establishment of a parent-like relationship with the child, and in the event of two existing biological or adoptive parents, that both parents consented to the establishment of a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   (2) that the petitioner and the child lived together in the same household;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   (3) that the petitioner assumed obligations of parenthood by taking significant responsibility for the child's care, education and development, including contributing towards the child's support, without expectation of financial compensation; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   (4) that the petitioner has been in a parental role for a length of time sufficient to have established with the child a bonded, dependent relationship parental in nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <em>\n    See H.S.H.-K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8664832\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/193/649/\">\n    533 N.W.2d at 435-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court should be required to issue a written opinion explaining the reasons for granting or denying the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   To be sure, the majority opinion is appropriate for the parties in this case and provides Petitioner deserved relief, but, in simply adopting the four-factor test from\n   <em>\n    H.S.H. - K.\n   </em>\n   , with no additional safeguards or limitations, the Majority has drafted an opinion that fails to provide important safeguards as to how\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentships are to be created and fails to serve all litigants, including those similarly situated to the parties in this case as well as others who do not live in a classic nuclear family. In addition to lacking important procedural safeguards, the majority opinion does citizens, and particularly the children, of Maryland a disservice by not including additional protections to ensure that children and families are not overburdened by the custody and visitation demands of multiple parents, and by not including the limitation that, in circumstances where\n   there are two existing parents, both parents need to have notice of, and the opportunity to consent to, the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parentship of a third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Judge Battaglia has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    In her brief, Michelle notes that she is now a \"transgender man\" and states that the record does not reflect her gender identity because she transitioned to living as a man after the contested divorce hearing occurred.
