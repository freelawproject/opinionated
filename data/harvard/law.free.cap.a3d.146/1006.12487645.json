Although the trial court authored a well written and thorough memorandum of decision, we, nevertheless, conclude that the form of judgment was improper because the plaintiff lacked standing to assert these claims in his individual capacity, and we reverse the judgment and remand the matter with direction to dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following extensive facts, as specifically found by the trial court, inform our review. Scarfo \"has been a licensed realtor in the State of Connecticut for almost twenty-eight years and works with the Century 21 agency .... Snow ... has been engaged in construction and real estate development for more than twenty years. The parties had known one another for a period of time before [they entered into] the December, 2004 contract .... [Scarfo] had an office across the hall from [Snow] at the time of the contract, and the parties continued to have their business offices in the same building, on the same\n   floor, across from one another, for the entire period of time at issue ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Sometime in 2002 or 2003, Snow saw a Century 21 ad for a 'raw' piece of land for sale in Cromwell. The\n   owner was Evergreen Realty [ (Evergreen) ]. Snow consulted with a local planning and zoning attorney with regard to a possible project, but there were difficulties with initial proposals. In the spring of 2004, Snow submitted to the Connecticut Secretary of [the] State papers for registering Cider Hill Associates as a limited liability company, partially for insurance and liability reasons, with the intent of development of the property. One of Snow's companies, Premier Development, entered into a purchase agreement for the land from Evergreen in April, 2004. Scarfo had discussed with Snow the possibility of buying a lot in the planned subdivision, but instead decided to become a partner in the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On December 17, 2004, [Cider Hill] filed with the Secretary of [the] State its Articles of Organization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As memorialized in their agreement dated December 30, 2004, Scarfo presented Snow with a cashier's check in the amount of $262,500 on December 17, 2004, and, on December 20, 2004, the closing took place in which [Cider Hill] purchased the property at issue from Evergreen. As listing agent, Scarfo took a $25,000 commission on the sale of the property, which Snow admits was a reduced commission .... Scarfo contends that Snow never contributed his $262,500 share of the initial investment. Snow claims that his work in making all of the arrangements to procure the land, investigation, hiring engineers and soil scientists, planning, and incurring other professional fees before the December, 2004 agreement, amount to costs in the range of $250,000, plus he contributed the option moneys from the November, 2004 agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"On December 30, 2004, [Scarfo] and [Snow] signed a written [operating] agreement [ (agreement) ], calling themselves 'members,' with each to have a 50 percent interest in Cider Hill .... They further agreed that, as of the date of the agreement, the value to each member was one half of the unpaid obligations of the company plus $262,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The agreement obligated each of the members, at the end of each fiscal year, to ascertain a valuation based primarily upon the opinion of the [certified public accountant] retained by the company, and further provided that, if the members could not agree on the valuation, another certified public accountant was to determine the value of the interest. Neither member to the agreement ever provided an accounting and neither member submitted an inquiry for an accounting to a specially nominated accountant during the pendency of the agreement. However, Snow arranged for the accounting firm of Guilmartin, DiPiro &amp; Sokolowski\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for [Cider Hill] and Michael DiPiro of that firm prepared all of\n   [Cider Hill's] tax returns and [schedule K-1 tax forms]. One might find that this revealed Snow's compliance with the 'accounting' portion of the agreement mentioned ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"In an 'Amendment' to the agreement, also dated December 30, 2004, the parties stated that each of them was contributing 'real property to [Cider Hill] with an agreed upon value of $262,500.' [Scarfo] and [Snow] further agreed that they would obtain financing to complete the acquisition of real property to develop a project in the estimate amount of $1,500,000, and they\n   further agreed to divide equally the costs associated with debt service, taxes, and other expenses. The only specific delineation of responsibilities to either of the partners was that ... Snow was to be responsible to 'obtain all required approvals, including but not limited to subdivision approvals, planning and zoning approval, permitting, Cromwell approvals, Department of Transportation approvals, architectural rendering.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"There has been no allegation that Snow did not perform these duties. Instead, [Scarfo] has alleged in his amended complaint ... that Snow was the 'managing partner' and [and that he] failed to value the membership annually, failed to notify [Scarfo] of the value of his membership interest, failed to obtain bids, and failed to distribute profits from the sale of the lots on the development property [in breach of the amended agreement].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Neither the agreement, nor the [December 30, 2004] amendment ... renders [Snow] the 'manager' of the property. Nor does the agreement require [Snow] to determine a value of the membership and provide it to [Scarfo]. Indeed, each partner had that responsibility to the other. Except for the annual tax returns and K-1s provided by the [Cider Hill] accountant, neither party did so and neither inquired of the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Two other provisions of this agreement specifically applicable to this litigation are paragraphs 7 and 8, which provide:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"7. All aspects of the construction of the housing units and related structures shall be performed by PREMIER BUILDING &amp; DEVELOPMENT, INC., at a cost plus 5 [percent]. [Cider Hill] shall obtain [three] bids for this work to estimate the fair market value of this work and to agree on the cost of said work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"8. The cost of work performed by PREMIER BUILDING &amp; DEVELOPMENT, INC., or its affiliates or assigns,\n   and PATRICK SNOW, or his affiliates or assigns, shall be paid from the proceeds of the construction loan as customary ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Scarfo contends that he entered the agreement because he relied on a preliminary budget prepared by Snow, which reflected expenditures of $1,727,100. The agreement does not make any mention of budgets or reliance thereon. In addition, neither the agreement nor any other document provides any guarantee of profit nor pay-back to an investor in the event of going over budget. Nor does the agreement provide that lots should sell at a certain price or that the partner who actually was negotiating the sale of the lots could not exercise discretion in the sale, depending on the benefit to [Cider Hill] or the difficulty in selling any particular lot on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Snow devoted full-time effort to the development of the [Cider Hill] subdivision and sale of the properties. While he was not designated by the parties in their agreement as the 'managing partner,' he was the only one of the two equal partners who worked on developing the property, engaging engineers, pavers, landscapers, etc.; procuring estimates; considering the contractors and providers to be hired and used, etc.; negotiating the necessary arrangements and business transactions, as\n   well as the loans; and, preparing for and procuring necessary approvals from appropriate authorities. In essence, he was the 'de facto' managing member, or the operation would never have even begun to get under way. Snow never received any salary or compensation for his efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In November, 2005, the Town of Cromwell Planning and Zoning Commission approved the subdivision, with special and general conditions. In 2006, lots began to be sold; indeed approximately twelve of the twenty-three lots were sold in that year. The number decreased\n   in 2007 and 2008. The real estate market, which had been 'on a roll,' began the tumultuous decline from which we are only now beginning to recover, just as is the general economy. As Snow testified, he had high hopes in 2004, and before 2008, he never expected a loss. In an undated supplementary budget, proposed expenditures had increased to $2,979,050. This was prepared by Snow, and Scarfo did not ask any questions about it. Snow testified that the property proved to be a very difficult site on which to work. Among other things, trees had to be cleared, there were inclines and declines, a hill, the necessity of the construction of a retaining wall, the soil was a type that was difficult to control and had to be moved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The income tax returns for [Cider Hill] reflect the following: 2004-no gross receipts or sales; 2005-loss of $455; 2006-profit of $166,705; 2007-loss of $98,501; 2008-loss of $230,048; 2009-loss of $13,845; 2010-loss of $157,472, and, 2011-loss of $20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Snow's 'bookkeeping' and 'records' keeping in this project [were] unique. According to Kathy Lehman, the woman who was his bookkeeper, customer service representative and office manager for seven years until 2010, each lot in the twenty-three lot [Cider Hill] subdivision had its own folder, containing the plot plan and closing documents. The records produced at trial certainly confirm that. Invoices from subcontractors were placed in a 'to be paid' pile and she never paid any bill without an invoice. Thereafter, the payment set-up got confusing. [Cider Hill] did not have a credit card and had little in the way of equity at its commencement. In order to benefit from the delay of having to pay immediately, Snow took advantage of the sixty day payment plan for vendors [and] on various of the other entities' and Snow's credit cards, and those cards were used to pay [Cider Hill] bills. Snow would then later make the credit card payments. Whenever Snow needed\n   to be reimbursed for an expenditure, he would give Ms. Lehman the receipt. According to Ms. Lehman, the credit card statements were at the office when she left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"In the early portion of its existence, [Cider Hill] used a [particular] software package ... [but], by the time of the commencement of this litigation, it was no longer accessible. [Cider Hill] then changed to Quick Books.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Neither Scarfo nor any of his Century 21 colleagues assisted in the sale of any of the lots in the development. In late 2008, or early in 2009, Snow advised Scarfo that he thought that they would come in under budget. Subsequently, however, when Snow advised Scarfo that such was not the case and that there would not be a profit, Scarfo initiated this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"According to Ms. Lehman, Scarfo never asked her for any documents or made any inquiries about [Cider Hill] or Snow until 2009, when she provided Scarfo documents in response to a request he made to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[Scarfo] alleges that the equities favor him because of numerous discrepancies [that] he and his experts are unable to resolve at this time and because of his belief that the defendant was self-dealing. There is no question in this court's mind\n   that the evidence in this case presents examples of what one might consider unorthodox ways of making and keeping records. It may go beyond 'sloppy,' however, the evidence does not reveal that there was an intent to deceive or hide or self-deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"One of the major complaints raised by Scarfo is that Snow authorized 'credits' on the sale of lots in the subdivision without authorization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scarfo does not\n   point to any portion of the agreement, however, that requires the partner working on the project to not be able to exercise discretion in his attempts to move the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Scarfo also complains that he only signed one of the 'consent' forms for the sale of the properties and that was at a fax request of the closing attorney when Scarfo was in Florida. These forms listed the sales price terms, including credits, for each lot in the subdivision. Scarfo contends that he did not sign the other forms [that] appear to have his signature. Snow denies that he affixed that signature. No handwriting expert testified, and the court has no idea as to how these consent forms were signed. Scarfo contends that he would never have approved these credits had he known about them. These forms, however, together with all of the other closing documents ... were all available to Scarfo at any time during the course of the tenure of the contract. In addition, Scarfo, having been in the real estate business for more than twenty-five years, knew of the necessity of such documents, and if he did not, he certainly was alerted to that when he was asked to fax his signature by the [Cider Hill] attorney at one of the closings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Scarfo also contends that the agreement was breached because three written bids were not procured for each phase of the project. The agreement does not call for bids to be 'written.' In addition, the credible testimony reveals that the [three bid] rule was usually abided by and that, in his many years of experience, Snow had established relationships with vendors and subcontractors who were reliable, competent, and provided work and goods at competitive prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[Scarfo's] expert, [certified public accountant] Michael Sobol, was retained in 2013. At trial, he testified that 'his firm' reviewed every item in the five boxes of\n   documents produced in discovery in this case, delivered to [Scarfo's] counsel in 2011 or 2012. Mr. Sobol explained that, with regard to the documents which were 'some eight years after the events took place,' he and his office tried to 'get our heads around what transpired from an accounting perspective.' He expected to find matching invoices or similar documents and accounts for all transfers and expenditures made, but was not able to do so. As an example, Mr. Sobol stated that, while he saw disbursements to [Connecticut Light and Power], he would find it an unsupported disbursement unless he could find an invoice. As another example, Mr. Sobol could not match expenditures for General Paving, but a document shown to him in court revealed a good portion of the amount paid was indeed for that entity. There were, however, many other discrepancies for which there was no identifiable vendor or service provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Mr. Sobol testified that all of the credit card statements were not in the materials delivered from [Snow], but he also admitted that, even if he had all of the credit card statements, he might not be able to identify the vendor or service provider. Mr. Sobol concluded that the fact that\n   disbursements were unsupported did not mean that they were inappropriate or unauthorized. Clearly, Mr. Sobol found, and this court cannot disagree, that as of the time of the delivery of these documents, they did not reveal the pristine accounting or documentation that was desired, nor did the document production even come close to it. The records at this point in time were certainly not in good order or well maintained. However, Mr. Sobol, [Scarfo's] own expert, testified that he could not say that there was unrealized profit for which Scarfo was entitled to payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"In 2011, the town of Cromwell brought a civil action against [Cider Hill] and General Paving and Construction Corp[oration (General Paving) ], alleging that [they]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   failed to construct properly certain public improvements within the subdivision in accordance with the plans that had been filed and approved [ (Cromwell action) ]. There is dispute about how and when Scarfo learned about [the Cromwell action]. Scarfo testified that [he first learned of that action when he read] about it in the newspaper. Snow contends that he approached Scarfo, advising him not only of the suit, but also asking him to advance his share of the funds necessary to defend [that action] and proceed against General Paving. It was Snow's belief that [Cider Hill] could prevail in its claim that General Paving was responsible to the town of Cromwell and to [Cider Hill]. Because neither he nor [Cider Hill] had the financial resources to hire counsel, Snow asked Scarfo to contribute to legal representation costs. By this time, the [present] litigation had commenced and, on the advice of counsel, Scarfo refused to contribute and also refused the choice of [Snow's] counsel in the [present] lawsuit as counsel to represent [Cider Hill] in the Cromwell [action] and the proposed claims against General Paving. The town of Cromwell was requiring the repair to the roads; [Cider Hill] could not do it; and General Paving refused to do it. Snow agreed to forfeit the bond and have the town correct the problem, and a default judgment entered against [Cider Hill]. In his counterclaim, Snow asserts breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence claims against Scarfo for refusing to contribute to legal costs [arising out of the Cromwell action].\" (Footnotes altered.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court also found that there remained many unanswered questions after the close of evidence, and it stated that it had \"much doubt about the veracity of\" either Scarfo or Snow. Furthermore, the court opined: \"The complexity of the issues in this case arise from the various allegations the parties have made, the very\n   confusing and manipulative way in which [Snow] conducts his business(es), and the complete lack of any attention whatsoever by [Scarfo] to the subdivision development [that] is the subject of this lawsuit, as well as a complete lack of any attention at all by [Scarfo] to the partnership or the business on which he premises his contentions that he is now entitled to damages and other relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the basis of these findings and astute observations, the court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to establish any of his causes of action, and it rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following appellate briefing and oral argument, we, sua sponte, issued the following supplemental briefing order: \"The parties are hereby ordered to file simultaneous supplemental briefs of no more than ten pages within ten days of issuance of notice of this order to address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"1.

The plaintiff then specifies the particular parts of the amended operating agreement he alleges Snow violated and how he sustained direct injury, separate and apart from any injury to Cider Hill. For example, the plaintiff argues: \"The [amended] agreement between [the] plaintiff and ... Snow regarding capital contributions created personal duties and obligations under the operating agreement to each other. The claim is direct because it arises from a special relationship, [namely,] the contractual relationship between [the] plaintiff and ... Snow .... The agreement between [the] plaintiff and ... Snow to divide equally the costs and expenses of the company created a joint duty and obligation wherein [the] plaintiff has a right to contribution/damages.\" Specifically as to his breach of fiduciary duty claim, the plaintiff argues that he has standing to raise a direct claim because his \"claim is for express and continuing breaches of personal duties and obligations under the [amended] agreement by ... Snow and not general fiduciary duties and obligations to the company ....\" He also contends that he has \"standing to raise [a] claim\n   that ... Snow breached his fiduciary duty to defendant [Cider Hill] and [to the] plaintiff, individually, by breaching the operating agreement and [the] amendment [thereto] by self-dealing.\" We disagree that these are direct injuries, and we conclude that the plaintiff did not have standing in his individual capacity to maintain his various causes of action and that the trial court should have dismissed his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that a party must have standing to assert a claim in order for the court to have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim.... Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion .... Standing requires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a [party] ordinarily establishes ... standing by allegations of injury .... [I]f the injuries claimed by the plaintiff are remote, indirect or derivative with respect to the defendant's conduct, the plaintiff is not the proper party to assert them and lacks standing to do so.

The agreement provides that Scarfo and Snow each were 50 percent members of Cider Hill. The amendment specifically states that it was drafted for the purpose of \"memorializ[ing] their agreement regarding the division of labor and expenses regarding the development of the property on Evergreen Road in Cromwell ....\" Both Scarfo and Snow each signed the original operating agreement as a \"Member\" of Cider Hill. They each then signed the amendment to the Cider Hill operating agreement as \"Its Member, Duly Authorized.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On October 27, 2009, Scarfo brought a six count amended complaint against Snow and Cider Hill alleging damages, breach of fiduciary duty, and spoliation\n   of evidence, as well as requesting an accounting and an opportunity to pierce the corporate veil of the various defendant companies in which Snow was a participant, including Cider Hill. The complaint was based upon Snow's alleged breaches of the amended agreement regarding the Evergreen Road development (Evergreen Project). The court found that Scarfo had failed to prove his causes of action, and it rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.
