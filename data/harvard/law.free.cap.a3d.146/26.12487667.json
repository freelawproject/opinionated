Petrov, to modify the primary physical custody of the parties' minor child. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court (1) improperly modified primary physical custody of the child when there was no material change in circumstances since the time of the last modification, (2) improperly modified primary physical custody of the child by failing to base its orders on present circumstances, and (3) abused its discretion by determining that the change in primary physical custody was in the\n   best interests of the child. We disagree and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The defendant and the plaintiff are the parents of the child. The defendant and the plaintiff, who were never married, lived together in Fairfield when the child was born, but separated one year after her birth. For a period of time following their separation, both parties continued to reside in Fairfield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 15, 2010, the plaintiff filed his initial application, seeking joint legal custody and primary physical custody of the child. The defendant submitted an answer and cross complaint on October 7, 2010, in which she sought, inter alia, joint legal custody, primary physical custody, and a schedule of visitation for the plaintiff. On January 20, 2011, the plaintiff submitted an additional application, in which he again sought joint legal custody and primary physical custody, as well as child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As noted by the trial court, \"[t]he two inch thick file at the Superior Court reflects numerous back and forth motions for findings of contempt and for other court\n   orders, with pendente lite agreements as to custody and access.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 8, 2012, the court,\n   <em>\n    Klatt, J.,\n   </em>\n   held a hearing on competing motions for modification of custody filed by the plaintiff and the defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the parties agreed would operate as a final hearing on the plaintiff's custody application. In its July 10, 2012 memorandum of decision (2012 decision), the court found that the defendant's move to New York was for a legitimate purpose, the location was reasonable in light of that purpose, and it was in the best interests of the child. Consequently, the court permitted the child to relocate to the defendant's home in New York. The court also adopted the defendant's proposed parental responsibility plan, which was appended to its memorandum of decision. This plan provided, inter alia, that the defendant would have primary physical custody of the child and that the parents were to share legal custody, during which they were to consult one another and jointly make decisions concerning the child's health, education, and religious upbringing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 12, 2012, the plaintiff filed the motion at issue in this appeal, requesting that the 2012 custodial determination be modified, and a motion requesting that Connecticut maintain jurisdiction over the child's custody. He also filed motions for contempt on November 16, 2012, and December 6, 2013. Prior to the April,\n   2014 hearing, both parties submitted proposed orders concerning these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Constance L. Epstein,\n   </em>\n   judge trial referee, held a multiday hearing on the plaintiff's motions on April 22, 23, and 24, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 29, 2014, the court issued a memorandum of decision (2014 decision). Adjudicating the plaintiff's motions for contempt, the court found the defendant in contempt for her knowing and wilful violations of the court orders, but refrained from ordering sanctions due to its resolution of the plaintiff's motion to modify. With respect to the plaintiff's motion to modify, the court determined that the undisputed fact that the child was about to begin school full-time constituted a material change in circumstances. On the basis of the testimonial and documentary evidence presented over the three days, the court held that it was in the best interests of the child for the plaintiff to have primary physical custody. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be discussed as necessary to our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before we turn to the substance of the defendant's claims on appeal, we briefly discuss the applicable principles of law governing postjudgment motions to modify custody. \"The standard of review in domestic relations cases is well established. An appellate court will not disturb a trial court's orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented.... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thus, unless the trial court applied the wrong standard of law, its decision is accorded great deference because the trial court is in an advantageous position to assess the personal factors so significant in domestic relations cases.... A mere difference of opinion or judgment cannot justify the intervention of this court. Nothing short of a conviction that the action of the trial\n   court is one which discloses a clear abuse of discretion can warrant our interference....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 provides trial courts with the statutory authority to modify an order of custody or visitation. When making that determination, however, a court must satisfy two requirements. First, modification of a custody award must be based upon either a material change [in] circumstances which alters the court's finding of the best interests of the child ... or a finding that the custody order sought to be modified was not based upon the best interests of the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... Second, the court shall consider the best interests of the child and in doing so may consider several factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ... Before a court may modify a custody order, it must find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the prior order of the court, but the ultimate test is the best interests of the child.... These requirements are based on the interest in finality of judgments ... and the family's need for stability.... The burden of proving a change to be in the best interest of the child rests on the party seeking the change.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; footnotes altered; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Clougherty v.

The defendant argues that, in making the determination that the child's imminent enrollment in school full-time constituted a material\n   change that justified a modification of the existing custody order, the court erred because: (1) it impermissibly based its decision on a change of circumstances not alleged in the plaintiff's motion to modify custody; (2) it improperly relied on a prospective change of circumstances; and (3) the evidence shows that, under\n   the facts of this case, the child attending school full-time was not a material change in circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to her first argument, the defendant argues that the plaintiff's motion to modify listed only three grounds, yet the court impermissibly premised its determination on a fourth, unalleged ground. Consequently, the defendant argues, the court's judgment is void. In response, the plaintiff contends both that the court was not limited to the grounds asserted in the motion to modify and, also, that the court, in fact, substantiated the grounds he had raised in his motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our rules of practice state what a party must include in any motion to modify custody. Motions to modify custody are governed by Practice Book \u00a7 25-26. Section 25-26(e) provides: \"Each motion for modification shall state the specific factual and legal basis for the claimed modification and shall include the outstanding order and date thereof to which the motion for modification is addressed.\" We have never had the opportunity to interpret this particular provision in the context of motions to modify custody. Reviewing this requirement\n   in the context of motions to modify support orders, we have held that a court's reliance on a ground not raised in a motion to modify is an abuse of discretion in the absence of an amendment to the motion.\n   <em>\n    Prial v.

In the performance of this duty it was unhampered, either in its inquiry or in its decision, by the allegations or prayers of the parents.

An important consideration in this respect is whether she was aware that the changes brought on by the child's impending commencement of full-time schooling were at issue even without having been pleaded. See\n   <em>\n    Gosselin v. Gosselin,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058445\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/110/142/#p147\">\n    110 Conn.App. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20A.2d%2060\">\n    955 A.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The proposition that full-time school would require readjustment of the existing orders was presaged prior to the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to modify. In the 2012 decision, Judge Klatt found: \"[T]he court will find that the defendant's relocation was for a legitimate purpose, the location is reasonable in light of that purpose, and that it is in the best interests of the [child]. While the defendant's relocation is not distant, it is nevertheless necessary to make some changes regarding the parenting schedule for the benefit of the [child]. In the future,\n   <em>\n    more may\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    be necessary, given that the child will soon reach school age.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Similarly, though recommending in her report that the custody orders remained unchanged, the family relations officer noted: \"The need for the change [to the visitation orders] in the parenting plan arises from the fact that [the child] has started kindergarten. The current routine has this young girl traveling too frequently and too far now that she is in school.\n   <em>\n    This will be even more challenging once her school day is full-time.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the fact that the impending start of full-time school by the child-no longer a distant concern at the time of the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to modify-might be raised in some capacity was firmly within the contemplation of the parties prior to the April, 2014 hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the matter was discussed explicitly during the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to modify custody in terms that made it clear that the plaintiff was asserting that the start of full-time school itself was not only a factor to be considered in the child's best interests, but also represented a material change in circumstances. In particular, the plaintiff's attorney posed multiple questions to the family relations officer concerning the circumstances governing the prior order and whether the commencement of full-time school would require a change to the parties' parenting plan. The guardian ad litem similarly testified about her understanding as to what the court intended in the 2012 decision when it addressed the impact of full-time school on the parenting plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also testified as to the changes caused by the commencement of full-time schooling, and the impact of school on the child's life and\n   well-being.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the attorneys for both parties emphasized in closing argument the disruption that the\n   child's full-time attendance at school would have on the existing parenting plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under these circumstances, it is clear that the defendant had notice that this issue was presented as the material change in circumstances, and, that she had a full and fair opportunity to address this issue. The questions by the plaintiff's attorney, as well as the responses to those questions by the family relations officer during cross-examination and by the guardian ad litem on direct examination, clearly indicate that the impending commencement of full-time school was to be considered, not merely as a factor in appraising the child's present best interests, but as a significant change in itself. The defendant also had a full and fair opportunity to address this issue during the hearing. Additionally, the defendant's attorney argued during closing argument that the child's attending school full-time was the \"big change\" in this case. Consequently, we conclude that the failure of the plaintiff to raise this ground in filing his motion to modify did not unduly prejudice or surprise the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the defendant had notice that the child's change to full-time schooling might constitute a material change in circumstances that would require revisiting the existing custody and visitation orders, this claim was framed as such during the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to modify, and the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to address this issue during the hearing, we agree with the plaintiff that the defendant has failed to preserve for appeal her other arguments related to the court's determination that a material change was the fact that the child was about to begin school full-\n   time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the defendant has waived her two remaining claims; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ; and we will not reach them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant's remaining claims allege various errors by the court in its appraisal of the child's best interests. She argues that the court erred in modifying the primary physical custody of the child without basing its orders on her present best interests. In particular, the defendant points to two distinct aspects of the 2014 decision, which she argues demonstrate that the court was not considering the present best interests of the child: the court's stated concerns about potential or possible future circumstances and risks;\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the court's \"hyper-focused\" reliance on information that occurred prior to the 2012 decision. Thus, the defendant argues, the court impermissibly premised its decision on both speculation and stale evidence, and not on the child's present best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In modifying a custody order, the court is required to determine the best interests of the child. See\n   General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Among the various factors the\n   court may consider when determining the best interest of the child are the parties' parenting skills ... the child's emotional ties to each parent ... the psychological instability of the parent and whether the child is in a stable and loving environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...

Although the court discussed many actions that preceded the 2012 decision, it appears to have relied on these actions to place in context the defendant's more recent actions as continuing a pattern of behavior that has interfered over several years with the parental relationship between the plaintiff and the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, we cannot\n   conclude that the court erred in according some weight to this parental behavior now that the child was about to begin school full-time, as there was evidence concerning the effect that her entering school full-time would have on the child's schedule, schoolwork, and extracurricular activities and her resulting availability to the noncustodial parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendant also contends that the statements by the court that it had concerns regarding certain possibilities that might arise suggest that the court engaged in mere speculation concerning the child's best interests. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition to the court's explicit findings that the parties have considerable trouble communicating, there also were indications in the file and evidence before the court that the parties historically had been better able to resolve issues than they were at the time of the hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that recent efforts to rectify their issues communicating had been unsuccessful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also heard testimony from the guardian ad litem that, if the parties did not work on their communication issues with a coparenting counselor, it would be \"problematic\" for the child. On the basis of evidence presented, the court found that the child had been unable to participate in certain activities due to the parties' inability to reach\n   an agreement. Under these circumstances, the court's fear that any continued deterioration in the parties' ability to communicate would negatively impact the child was not unreasonable or merely speculative. Rather, the court considered the past and present behavior of the parties, and their present and future ability to parent the child, as it was explicitly permitted to do pursuant to our law; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (c) ;\n   <em>\n    Blake v. Blake,\n   </em>\n   supra, 207 Conn. at 224-25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%201201\">\n    541 A.2d 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and made a determination that, in light of the fact that the child was to begin school full-time, her then best interests required giving the plaintiff primary physical custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We note further that the court's primary focus throughout its memorandum\n   of decision was clearly on which parent was better suited to address the child's needs as she was about to begin school full-time. An examination of a child's best interests permits a court to consider not only which parent is better able to meet the child's present needs, but also permits some consideration of how those present needs affect the child's long-term best interests.

Although we note that it seems likely that the defendant intended the reference to be the child's regular attendance in half-day kindergarten, which had not yet begun when her motion was filed, her reliance on it demonstrates, at the very least, that she was aware prior to the April, 2014 hearing that changes in the child's schooling would be disruptive to the current parenting plan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    In response to the plaintiff's questions during direct examination, the guardian ad litem testified that her understanding of Judge Klatt's statements in the 2012 decision was that a change would be required because the 2012 decision was structured as \"a true shared custody arrangement,\" and this arrangement would not work once the child started school full-time.

Specifically, she noted that the enrichment program is \"probably more fun\" than full-time school would be, and agreed with the plaintiff's attorney that full-time school would include a number of accompanying changes, such as activities, sports, homework, and after-school functions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In her closing argument, the plaintiff's attorney stated that, \"if [the plaintiff] were to have the child more of the time for school purposes in Fairfield, it would be a better situation, [in] that the parties would communicate better, which is the ultimate goal, as well, in the terms of the best interests of the child.\" Similarly, in urging that physical custody remain with the defendant and that the court adopt whatever orders that it deemed appropriate, the defendant's attorney in his closing argument directed the court's attention to the statements by the family relations officer and guardian ad litem.
