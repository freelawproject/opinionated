Claimant argues that the Board erred when it determined that the two years she spent teaching in Ohio through the Teacher Corps program was not \"school service\" purchasable under the Public School Employees' Retirement Code (Retirement Code), 24 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8101 -8536. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Claimant retired on June 20, 2011, after teaching in Pennsylvania schools from 1976 to 1980 and again from 1993 to 2011. (Board's Op., Findings of Fact (FOF) \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, 70.) Prior to retiring, Claimant submitted two applications with the Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS) to purchase out-of-state service (together, \"Application\") related to the time she taught at the Meigs Local School District (MLSD) in Pomeroy, Ohio from 1974 to 1976. (Board Op. at 2; FOF \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.) Claimant received her teaching certification in Ohio in April 1974 and taught full-time as a \"teacher-intern\" at the\n   MLSD high school through the federal Teacher Corps program from the fall of 1974 to the summer of 1976 while she was attending graduate school at Ohio University. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7, 20.) The Board made the following findings of fact regarding Claimant's participation in the Teacher Corps program.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   5.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87.) Claimant appealed the denial of her request to the Executive Staff Review Committee (ESRC) of PSERS by letter dated June 13, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91.) The ESRC denied Claimant's appeal on the grounds Claimant's work with the MLSD was not in the context of an employer-employee relationship and that the STRSO indicated that the service does not qualify for service for participation in STRSO. (Letter from ESRC to Claimant, March 5, 2013, PSERS-6, C.R. at Item 12; FOF \u00b6 94.) Claimant subsequently filed a timely Appeal and Request for Administrative Hearing with the Board. (FOF \u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Hearings were held before a Hearing Examiner on August 27, 2014 and November 13, 2014, where Claimant and Steven Wolf, Retirement Administrator over the purchase of service refunds for PSERS, testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the first hearing, Claimant \"submitted a document to PSERS purporting to show that, as of May 2013, STRSO now permitted Claimant to purchase 1.94 years of service with MLSD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96.) While PSERS initially objected to the consideration of the document by the Hearing Examiner, the parties stipulated at the November 13, 2014 hearing that STRSO would certify to two years of service, which means that Claimant's service in Ohio met the one-year of service requirement of receiving out-of-state service pursuant to Section 8304(c) of the Retirement Code, 24 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8304(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Hr'g Tr., November 13, 2014, at 320-21, C.R. at Item 12.) The remaining issue before the Hearing Examiner was whether the service conducted in Ohio through the Teacher Corps program is of the type that is purchasable under Section 8303 of the Retirement Code, 24 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8303. The Hearing Examiner issued an Opinion and Recommendation on July 6, 2015, concluding that Claimant's service at the MLSD through the Teacher Corps program was \"school service\" and recommended that the Board grant her request to purchase 1.94 years of out-of-state service. (Hearing Examiner Recommendation at 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   PSERS filed a brief on exceptions asking the Board to reject the Hearing Examiner's Opinion and Recommendation and find that the service Claimant performed through the Teacher Corps program was not purchasable for service credit. (PSERS' Br. on Exceptions at 5-6, C.R. at\n   Item 22.) Claimant filed a responsive brief but did not file her own exceptions. (Claimant's Br. in Response to PSERS' Br. on Exceptions at 1, C.R. at Item 23.) PSERS argued that the Hearing Examiner misunderstood the relationship between Claimant and MLSD when it concluded that Claimant's service was school service. According to PSERS, Claimant was a graduate student taking part in a program directly tied to her studies, not an employee of the school. (PSERS' Br. on Exceptions at 15.) Claimant argued in response that she was a certified teacher when she worked at MLSD and taking classes in the evening with Ohio University did not render her any less of a teacher. (Claimant's Br. in Response to PSERS' Br. on Exceptions at 1.) Claimant contended that \"it is the substance of the work that defines one's employment, not the administrative detail.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Board Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Board independently reviewed the entire record and the briefs filed by the parties and concluded that Claimant was ineligible to purchase out-of-state service credit for the time she spent working at the MLSD under the purview of the Teacher Corps program. The Board first reviewed the relevant provisions of the Retirement Code and its interpretation thereof through PSERS' Business Rules and relevant precedent.

While the language of the Act did speak to helping meet the needs of underserved school districts, it equally discussed a desire to train inexperienced teachers. Undoubtedly school districts such as MLSD that took part in this program were understandably concerned more with their staffing than with the education of the teacher-interns. Claimant, however, was a teacher-intern-and the\n   Act was clear that, at least regarding the \"teacher-interns,\" the focus of the program was on training inexperienced individuals to become better teachers. ... Claimant's\n   <em>\n    entire participation in the program\n   </em>\n   , including her in-classroom instruction at MLSD, consisted of training-either through hands-on experience in the classroom or through coursework specifically tailored to the program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Board further concluded that Claimant's tenure at MLSD was that of a student, not a teacher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) In support of this conclusion, the Board pointed to the fact that Claimant was placed at MLSD by the Teacher Corps program and that Claimant did not have a contract with MLSD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) The Board further noted that Claimant was paid with federal grant money and did not receive employment benefits other than sick and vacation days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, the Board found it to be especially relevant that in order to participate in the Teacher Corps program, Claimant was required to take courses through Ohio University and perform community service in addition to teaching in the classroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the Board:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Claimant testified that graduate studies at Ohio University, in-classroom instruction and community service were not optional, and if she failed to perform any of the three activities,\n   <em>\n    she would not have been paid\n   </em>\n   . Tying Claimant's compensation to all three requirements of her participation in this Teacher Corps program, including two requirements that had nothing to do with MLSD, exemplify the fact that Claimant was not in the same position as any other full-time teacher at MLSD during that time, as she has argued, and therefore did not have a bargained-for exchange typically present in an employment relationship. Instead, Claimant was a student taking part in a program offered by her graduate school.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).)

Teacher Corps Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Claimant first argues that determining whether a student is an employee within the meaning of the Retirement Code requires an assessment of the purpose of the program in which the student is enrolled. Claimant contends that the Teacher Corps was intended \" 'to strengthen the educational opportunities available to children in areas having concentrations of low-income families' \" and that her work\n   was focused on teaching these children. (Claimant's Br. at 3 (quoting Section 511 of the Act, P.L. 89-329,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Stat.%201219\">\n    79 Stat. 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1255, at \u00a7 511(a)).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Claimant is correct that determining whether a student is an employee under the Retirement Code requires an assessment of the purpose of the work performed.\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"960576,12024422\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/696/801/\">\n    696 A.2d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While we agree with Claimant that strengthening educational opportunities of students in underserved communities was one of the purposes of the Teacher Corps program, Claimant omits the other, equally important, purpose of the program as detailed in the Act itself. The Act states two purposes: (1) increasing educational opportunities available to children in underserved communities; and (2) \"encourag[ing] colleges and universities to broaden their programs of teacher preparation by ... attracting and training inexperienced teacher-interns who will be made available for teaching and inservice training to local educational agencies in such areas in teams led by an experienced teacher.\" Section 511(a) of the Act, P.L. 89-329,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Stat.%201219\">\n    79 Stat. 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1255, at \u00a7 511(a). The Board correctly explained the Teacher Corps program as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   The Act authorized arrangements between the local educational agencies and institutions of higher learning to provide, among other things, \"teaching teams, each of which ... consist[ed] of an experienced teacher and a number of teacher-interns who, in addition to teaching duties, shall be afforded time by the local educational agency for a teacher-intern training program ...\" and for \"institutions of higher education to provide training for teacher-interns while teaching in schools for local educational agencies ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     leading to a graduate degree\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Stat.%201219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 513(a) and (b) (emphasis added).

Because the Teacher Corps program, at least as it pertained to Claimant, was inextricably linked to the pursuit of a graduate degree, we agree with the Board's interpretation of the Act and conclude that the purpose of the Teacher Corps program is to both serve disadvantaged communities and to train teacher-interns who already have a bachelor's degree and are pursuing a graduate degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

We applied the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   by assessing the purpose of the claimant's time spent at the Academy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11893043\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/701/310/#p313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11893043\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/701/310/#p313\">\n    at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the claimant's time was not purchasable because it \"served an educational purpose so that he could take his place as a member of the active military service in a position as a commissioned officer. Without his bachelor's degree from the Academy, [the claimant's] commissioned officer status upon entry into active military service would not have been assured.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11893043\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/701/310/#p313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Claimant argues that her case differs from\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   , and should lead to a contrary holding. Claimant argues that unlike her, the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   : (1) did not attend school at night in addition to her day job; (2) needed the program to receive a certification; (3) was paid less than a market rate; and (4) participated in the residency program at the Medical Center solely to obtain a certification, and her primary motive was to teach. Similarly, Claimant contends that the factual differences between her case and\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   should lead to a different result. According to Claimant, the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   sought to purchase the time he was actually in school at the Academy, not the time he worked outside of his class time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Based on the facts in this case as found by the Board and the language of the Act, we agree with the Board that Claimant's role within MLSD is analogous to the claimant's role at the Medical Center in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   . Like the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   , Claimant here already had a basic certification to engage in her career, and enrolled in a program to obtain specialized training-here, a reading specialty through Ohio University, and in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   , an oncology certification. Further, Claimant's compensation was set by statute and paid entirely by a federal grant, indicating that, like the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   , there was no bargained-for exchange between employer and employee. Also like the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   who spent her time at the Medical Center treating patients under the supervision of a physician, Claimant here spent her time at MLSD teaching under the supervision of another teacher. In both\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   and here, the work performed served two purposes: first, benefiting the population and institution the student served; and second, furthering the claimant's educational goals. We therefore conclude that the Board did not err in determining that the purpose of Claimant's participation in the Teacher Corps program was educational and did not include the bargained-for exchange typically present in an employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As in both\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   , the purpose of the program at issue here was primarily educational. The fact that Claimant's subjective primary intent in joining the Teacher Corps program may have been to teach is not dispositive when the purpose of the Teacher Corps program includes providing educational opportunities to Claimant, and Claimant's relationship with MLSD was not that of an employer-employee. Thus, we observe no error in the Board's application of rules of law discussed in Simmonds and Donovan to the facts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Board's Interpretation through the Business Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Finally, Claimant argues that the Board should not have applied the Business Rule because it does not apply to her case, and even if it does apply, she should be considered an employee under the Business Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   We disagree that the Board should have not utilized the Business Rule. The Business Rule applies to situations where a claimant was a student at the time the service was rendered. There is no dispute that Claimant was a graduate student while she was teaching at MLSD under the purview of the Teacher Corps program and we concluded above that, based on the language of the Act, Claimant's teaching at MLSD was directly linked to her studies at Ohio University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Further, we see no error in the Board's application of the Business Rule. The Board stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Consistent with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   ..., PSERS employs the [Business Rule] that if service is to fall within the definition of \"school service,\" and therefore entitled to service credit under the Retirement Code, the person who provides it must be an employee in the bargained-for exchange that exists in typical employment relationships.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (Board Op. at 17.) The above passage, the only time the Business Rule is mentioned in the Board's analysis, notes that the relevant Business Rule is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   in that the touchstone of the analysis focuses on the presence of a bargained-for exchange between the employer and the claimant. Relevant to this case, the Business Rule states that service should be denied if \"the service was part of the student's curriculum,\" or if \"the employment was only available to students.\" (Business Rule POS-2008-01, Ex. PSERS-A, C.R. at Item 13.) The Board found that\n   Claimant's service at MLSD was related to her studies and that Claimant could not have taught at MLSD through the Teacher Corps program if she was not also a student and did not attend evening and summer classes. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 25-29.) Because we conclude above that the Board did not err by concluding that Claimant is not eligible to purchase credit pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Simmonds\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Donovan\n   </em>\n   , the Board's interpretation of the Retirement Code through PSERS' Business Rule is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
