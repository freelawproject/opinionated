See\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal, the defendant contends that the Appellate Court: (1) erred in concluding that, prior to the amendment to \u00a7 54-102g in 2011 specifically authorizing the use of reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample; Public Acts 2011, No. 11-144, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 11-144); the trial court had the jurisdiction and authority to grant the state permission\n   to use reasonable physical force to obtain a sample of the defendant's DNA; and (2) improperly concluded that the prosecution of the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 54-102g did not violate the defendant's right to due process; Conn. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 ; or the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution. U.S. Const. amend. V. After our review of the defendant's claims, we conclude that the Appellate Court properly resolved both issues and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's appeal. On April 18, 2005, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a and one count of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 53a-217. On April 20, 2005, the defendant was sentenced to thirty years incarceration. At the time of sentencing, the defendant was informed that, by virtue of his new status as an incarcerated felon, he would be required to provide a DNA sample to the Department of Correction (department) for inclusion in the state DNA data bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 3, 2009, department personnel requested that the defendant provide a DNA sample pursuant to \u00a7 54-102g (a). The defendant refused to do so. On December 28, 2009, department personnel again asked the defendant to provide a DNA sample. Once again, the defendant informed department personnel\n   that he would not do so. On March 17, 2010, the department directed the defendant and nine other inmates who had previously refused sampling to provide a DNA sample in accordance with \u00a7 54-102g (a). The defendant again refused to submit to the taking of a sample and told department personnel that if they wanted a sample of his DNA, they would have to get a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 19, 2010, the state filed a motion in the trial court seeking permission to use reasonable physical force in order to obtain a DNA sample from the defendant and another inmate, Mark Banks,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who also had consistently refused to willingly provide a DNA sample. As authority for its motion, the state cited to \u00a7 54-102g. The defendant opposed the state's motion, arguing that \u00a7 54-102g did not permit the state to use reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample from an unwilling inmate and that the only remedy available to the state was to prosecute him for failure to provide a blood or other biological sample for DNA analysis under \u00a7 54-102g (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 8, 2011, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision rejecting the defendant's claims and authorizing the state to implement reasonable physical force to obtain a DNA sample from the defendant. The trial court determined that the statute inherently provided the state with the authority to use reasonable force, because allowing individuals subject to \u00a7 54-102g to refuse sampling outright would substantially frustrate the legislative goal in establishing a DNA data bank. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-102g (f)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   sample to be submitted for DNA analysis,\n   and identification characteristics of profile resulting from such analysis shall be stored in DNA data bank). The defendant appealed from the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 9, 2010, while the state's motion was pending before the trial court, the defendant was charged with a violation of \u00a7 54-102g (g) for his failure to submit to the taking of a blood or other biological sample for DNA analysis. On December 16, 2010, the defendant moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that it violated his due process rights and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. On January 4, 2011, the trial court held a hearing on the defendant's motion at which the defendant argued that submitting a DNA sample was a punishment and that it thereby violated the double jeopardy clause by subjecting him to additional punishment for his original crimes. In response, the state argued that \u00a7 54-102g is not a punitive sanction and that there was no double jeopardy violation present under the test set forth in the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Blockburger v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719289\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/299/#p304\">\n    284 U.S. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719289\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/299/#p304\">\n    52 S.Ct. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719289\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/299/#p304\">\n    76 L.Ed. 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1932) (\"the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not\"). The trial court denied the defendant's motion, noting that \u00a7 54-102g is not a punishment and that the defendant was not being prosecuted in connection with his underlying crimes, but for his new act of not complying with the statutory duty to submit to the taking of a DNA sample. The defendant thereafter was tried before a jury and found guilty of one count of refusing to provide a DNA sample. The defendant was sentenced to one year incarceration, to be served consecutively with his existing sentence. The defendant filed a separate appeal from the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Appellate Court considered the defendant's consolidated appeals and upheld both the trial court's grant of the state's motion for permission to use reasonable physical force to acquire a DNA sample from the defendant and the defendant's conviction under \u00a7 54-102g (g) for refusing to submit to the taking of a DNA sample.\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the state's motion, and that it improperly determined that \u00a7 54-102g authorized the use of reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample from a resistant inmate.

Drakes,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 516,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20A.3d%201104\">\n    70 A.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant also argued that his prosecution and conviction under \u00a7 54-102g violated the constitutional guarantee of due process and the prohibition against double jeopardy. Id., at 518,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20A.3d%201104\">\n    70 A.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court rejected the defendant's argument, reasoning that \u00a7 54-102g is regulatory, not punitive, in nature, and that the defendant's prosecution was for the new act of refusing to submit to the taking of a DNA sample and was unrelated to the criminal conduct that provided the basis for his original conviction. Id., at 519,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20A.3d%201104\">\n    70 A.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We subsequently granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant first argues that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider and ultimately grant the state's motion for permission to use reasonable physical\n   force as a means of obtaining a DNA sample. Likewise, the defendant contends that prior to the legislature's 2011 amendment to \u00a7 54-102g, which expressly authorized the department to use reasonable physical force to obtain DNA samples from unwilling inmates, there was no authority for the trial court's granting of the state's motion to use such force. See P.A. 11-144. In response, the state posits that because \u00a7 54-102g is regulatory, not penal, in nature, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider its motion. The state further contends that \u00a7 54-102g provides inherent authority to the department to use reasonable physical force, as a conclusion to the contrary would substantially frustrate the objectives of the statutory scheme. We agree with the state and conclude that the Appellate Court properly resolved both questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We observe at the outset that the jurisdictional and statutory claims that the defendant raises in the present case are essentially identical to those raised and addressed in the companion case to the defendant's appeal that we decided today. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487665\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/1/\">\n    321 Conn. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487665\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/1/\">\n    146 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Our examination of these same issues in\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   thoroughly resolves the claims of the defendant in the present case and there is nothing in this case that would mandate a different result than that which we reached in\n   <em>\n    Banks.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487665\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/1/\">\n    Id., at 830-844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487665\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/1/\">\n    146 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we adopt the reasoning and conclusions of that opinion herein. See\n   <em>\n    Minnesota Methane, LLC v. Dept. of Public Utility Control,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730253\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/700/#p712\">\n    283 Conn. 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20177\">\n    931 A.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    Rocque v.

We therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court in regard to the defendant's claims that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction and that \u00a7 54-102g did not authorize the use of reasonable physical force to ensure compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant also argues that the Appellate Court improperly rejected his claim that his conviction for failure to submit to the taking of a blood or other biological sample for DNA analysis in violation of \u00a7 54-102g (g) infringes upon his due process rights and violates the federal and state constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy. We disagree with the defendant's claim and affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \"[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb....\" Although our state constitution does not contain an explicit prohibition on double jeopardy, it is well settled that \"the due process and personal liberty guarantees provided by article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution have been held to encompass the protection against double jeopardy.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant's conviction at issue in the present case was due to his refusal, following his original criminal conviction and subsequent incarceration, to provide a DNA sample as required by \u00a7 54-102g. Thus, the defendant's prosecution and conviction were premised on conduct separate from his initial conviction, and the defendant's conviction for violating \u00a7 54-102g (g) in no way affects his prior sentence.
