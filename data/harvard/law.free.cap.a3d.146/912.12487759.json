In those orders, the trial court directed the defendant to pay to the plaintiff, inter alia, lump sum alimony in the amount of $7.5 million and attorney's fees in the amount of $140,000. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court: (1) improperly rendered a lump sum alimony\n   award that constitutes a property distribution in violation of the parties' prenuptial agreement (agreement); and (2) abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the plaintiff in light of its other awards to her. We disagree with the defendant's claim that the lump sum alimony award is actually an improper property distribution, but agree that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the plaintiff. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff and the defendant were married in Greenwich in 1997 and have four minor children. The\n   defendant earns $970,000 per year from employment and investments, and received $37 million from the sale of a software program in 2000. The plaintiff, a full-time homemaker and the primary caretaker of the children, presently earns no income. She suffers from a thyroid condition and is borderline diabetic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly before their marriage, the parties entered into the agreement. The agreement provided for sole ownership\n   of separate property acquired before the marriage, which would not be subject to equitable distribution in the event of dissolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marital assets were to be divided in accordance with a formula based upon the length of the marriage and the number of children. The agreement stated that the issues of alimony and child support would be addressed by the courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, the plaintiff brought the present action seeking a legal separation, and later amended her complaint to seek a dissolution of the marriage. After trial, the trial court ordered the defendant to pay, inter alia, $40,000 per month in periodic unallocated alimony and child support, and $7.5 million in lump sum alimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the lump sum alimony award, the court noted that \"under all the circumstances [the] award ... is appropriate to provide for continuing support of the [plaintiff]\" in light of the following: \"[the plaintiff's] health issues; her lack of recent employment; her primary child care responsibilities for four children, which limits her ability to enter the workforce on a full-time basis; and her limited opportunity to acquire assets in the future.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In making the award, the court stated that\n   it considered the factors in the alimony statute, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as \"other factors which may be appropriate for a just and equitable resolution.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In discussing\n   alimony generally, the court noted that \"both parties ... made significant contributions to the acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of the family assets, including the real estate.\" The court also ordered the defendant to contribute $100,000 toward the plaintiff's attorney's fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   reasoning that \"to require the [plaintiff], who has minimal earning capacity and the responsibility for the primary care of four minor children age nine through fifteen, three of whom have learning issues, to pay these fees from her portion of the financial award ... would undermine the purposes of [the] same\" and that \"it would be fair and equitable for the [defendant] to pay [those fees].\" The defendant then filed this appeal. See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff subsequently moved for an award of appellate attorney's fees. After a hearing, the trial court\n   ordered the defendant to contribute an additional $40,000 toward the plaintiff's appellate attorney's fees. The court stated that the plaintiff needed \"reasonable access to the court system [to] defend an appeal that [the defendant] made\" and that she \"does not have ample liquid assets\" or \"resources that are readily available\" to pay the fees because several of the trial court's orders were stayed pending the defendant's appeal. Thereafter, the defendant filed an amended appeal challenging the trial court's award of appellate attorney's fees. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the defendant contends that: (1) the lump sum alimony award constitutes a functional property distribution in violation of the agreement; and (2) the trial court abused its discretion in ordering him to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees. We address each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first claims that the lump sum alimony award is actually a property distribution in violation of the agreement because: (1) in making the award, the trial court considered two factors-the plaintiff's opportunity to acquire assets in the future and her contribution to the marital estate-that appear in the property distribution statute, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   but not the alimony statute, \u00a7 46b-82 ; and (2) the lump sum\n   award is more than necessary for the plaintiff's continued support, thus indicating that it is functionally a property distribution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly awarded lump sum alimony, rather\n   than a disguised property distribution, because: (1) the trial court unambiguously characterized the lump sum award as alimony, and retained discretion to consider equitable factors beyond \u00a7 46b-82, including those listed in \u00a7 46b-81, in making the award; and (2) the award was appropriate in light of the standard of living of the marriage, the substantial assets awarded to the defendant under the agreement, and the equitable factors considered by the trial court. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The question of whether the trial court properly applied the law when fashioning the lump sum alimony award is a question of law subject to plenary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   See\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304767\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/153/#p162\">\n    295 Conn. 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 162,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201060\">\n    989 A.2d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

We discuss each rationale in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, the trial court consistently described the lump sum award as alimony in its decision, articulation, and comments. From the beginning of its decision, the trial court distinguished between the property distribution allowed under the prenuptial agreement and its broad authority to award alimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the trial court explained that, \"under all the circumstances,\" the purpose of the lump sum award was to provide \"continuing support\" to the plaintiff-the quintessential purpose of alimony. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Dombrowski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Noyes\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dombrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708709\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/127/#p132\">\n    273 Conn. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=869%20A.2d%20164\">\n    869 A.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).

The trial court made no reference or allusion to this equitable purpose in making the lump sum alimony award, and instead divided the property in accordance with the agreement. The trial court also specifically cited \u00a7 46b-82, the alimony statute, and two judicial opinions in which lump\n   sum alimony was properly awarded when making the lump sum alimony award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546650\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/32/#p47\">\n    222 Conn. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=608%20A.2d%2079\">\n    608 A.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (\"[a]ny ambiguity as to the criteria upon which the court relied for alimony was put to rest [when] the trial court indicated that it had relied upon the criteria in \u00a7 46b-82 for its award of alimony\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In light of this language, the trial court's mere mention of two factors in the property distribution statute, namely, the plaintiff's opportunity to acquire assets in the future and her contribution to the marital estate, did not render the lump sum award an improper property distribution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   See id. at 46-47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=608%20A.2d%2079\">\n    608 A.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (trial court did\n   not improperly predicate alimony award on \"impermissible statutory criterion [by] ... refer[ring] to \u00a7 46b-81 \" in decision);\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"540884\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/211/485/#p497\">\n    211 Conn. at 495-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=560%20A.2d%20396\">\n    560 A.2d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (trial court's characterization of lump sum payment as alimony in oral decision did not render it alimony, as opposed to property distribution, when court otherwise consistently characterized award as property distribution).

In awarding lump sum alimony, the trial court emphasized the plaintiff's \"primary child care responsibilities for four children, which limits her ability to enter the workforce on a full-time basis ....\" The alimony statute lists as a factor, \"the desirability and feasibility of [the] parent's securing employment\" in the case of parents to whom the custody of minor children is awarded.

The property distribution statute contains no such factor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court's articulation also supports the characterization of the award as alimony and not a property distribution. The plaintiff sought an articulation as to whether the trial court \"considered, applied, or intended to apply\" a factor in \u00a7 46b-81 when it awarded lump sum alimony. The trial court responded: \"In making an equitable division of marital property or an award of alimony, whether periodic\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   lump sum, the court must, as it did, consider the statutory criteria set forth in ... \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82\n   <em>\n    respectively\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis altered.) The word \"respectively\" indicates the court's understanding that each statute applies to each type of financial order. This language therefore confirms the trial court's application of \u00a7 46b-82, not \u00a7 46b-81, when awarding lump sum alimony. The trial court also acknowledged its equitable power to consider \"any appropriate additional factors, statutory or otherwise\" in its articulation, noting that those powers gave \"the court the authority to consider all the circumstances that may be appropriate for a just and equitable resolution of the marital dispute.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court further differentiated between the lump sum alimony award and its property distribution orders at a hearing on the plaintiff's motion to terminate an appellate stay on several of its orders. The court stated, \"I crafted this order ... [a]nd\n   <em>\n    I specifically separated what I consider property settlement from\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    lump sum alimony\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The court explained that it awarded both periodic and lump sum alimony in consideration of how the defendant's income \"comes in\" and \"flow[s]\" from his various income streams. The court noted that \"there's a method to the ... madness in terms of how the decree is crafted.\" Thus, the court evidently did not intend to effectuate a functional property distribution by awarding lump sum alimony, but intended to account for the fact that\n   the defendant received some components of his income only a few times per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, we disagree with the defendant's contention that, because the combined alimony and child support payments exceed the plaintiff's claimed expenses, the lump sum alimony award is a functional property distribution, in light of the standard of living of the marriage and the equitable factors considered by the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   See footnote 10 of this opinion. The plaintiff attested\n   to having $65,444\n   per month in expenses at the time of trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The $40,000 per month periodic alimony\n   <em>\n    and child support\n   </em>\n   payments would not cover this amount.

At the time of trial, the defendant's bank account contained $84,238. Because the plaintiff's efforts as a homemaker and the primary caretaker of the children increased the defendant's earning capacity at the expense of her own, she is entitled to maintain this standard of living after the divorce, to the extent possible.

Such factors include: \"the length of the marriage, the causes for the ... dissolution of the marriage ... [and] the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, earning capacity, vocational skills, education, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a). The trial court must also consider any property distributions made pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81 and, \"in the case of a parent to whom the custody of minor children has been awarded, the desirability and feasibility of such parent's securing employment.\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, the plaintiff's expenses do not represent the only factor that the trial court must consider when awarding alimony.

The court must not only examine the spouse's financial situation at the time of trial, but look ahead to his or her ability to generate income in the future. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (instructing court to consider spouse's \"age, health, station, occupation ... earning capacity, vocational skills, education, [and] employability\"). Several of the factors relate in no way to the spouse's expenses, such as the length of the marriage and the cause of the breakdown of the marriage. The trial court must also look to the\n   <em>\n    payor\n   </em>\n   spouse's financial situation, in addition to that of the recipient spouse. Specifically, the trial court must consider the\n   <em>\n    payor's\n   </em>\n   age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, earning capacity, vocational skills, education, and employability. These factors have nothing to do with the recipient spouse's claimed expenses. Thus, it cannot be said that the trial court was constrained by the plaintiff's claimed expenses in awarding alimony. The trial court instead had \"wide discretion\" to ensure that the plaintiff and the parties' children continued to enjoy the standard of living of the marriage for years to come.

At the time of trial, the defendant earned nearly $1 million per year from his employment and investments. By contrast, the plaintiff was forty-five years old at the time of trial, suffers from a thyroid condition, and is borderline diabetic. She has a college degree from Emerson College, but did not work for the \"greater portion\" of the parties' seventeen year marriage. When she did work, she earned approximately $30,000 per year, with a maximum of $65,000 to $70,000 per year. She earned no income at the time of trial and claimed $65,444 per month in expenses.

The trial court, at least, found it appropriate to deviate from the presumptive minimum child support amount under the guidelines based on the defendant's income. Moreover, the parties' four minor children are entitled to maintain the standard of living of the marriage, to the extent possible.

The trial court reasoned, with respect to the trial attorney's fees award, that \"to require the [plaintiff], who has minimal earning capacity and the responsibility for the\n   primary care of four minor children age nine through fifteen, three of whom have learning issues, to pay these fees from her portion of the financial award ... would undermine the purposes of [the] same\" and that \"it would be fair and equitable for the [defendant] to pay [those fees].\" After the defendant filed an appeal, the trial court awarded the plaintiff an additional $40,000 in appellate attorney's fees, stating that the plaintiff needed \"reasonable access to the court system [to] defend an appeal that [the defendant] made.\" The trial court noted that several of its financial awards to the plaintiff, including the $2,082,000 payment under the agreement, the $375,000 biannual lump sum alimony payments, and the $100,000 trial attorney's fees award, were automatically stayed pending the defendant's appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a). The $40,000 per month periodic alimony and child support payments were not stayed, however, and the plaintiff continued to receive those payments. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (c) (\"no automatic stay shall apply ... to orders of periodic alimony, [or child] support\"). The trial court also noted that the plaintiff had only $3700 in her bank accounts at that time and, thus, she was \"land rich but cash poor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court therefore concluded that\n   the plaintiff did \"not have ample liquid assets\" or \"resources that are readily\n   available\" to pay the fees. Four months later, the plaintiff successfully moved to terminate the stay on the $2,082,000 payment and the lump sum alimony award. Specifically, the plaintiff was scheduled to receive the $2,082,000 payment and the first $375,000 installment of the lump sum alimony award by December 19, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in making the attorney's fees awards because the plaintiff received ample liquid funds as a result of the trial court's judgment, and the trial court's determination that not awarding attorney's fees to the plaintiff would undermine its other awards was unreasonable. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Koizim\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Koizim\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952658\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/181/492/#p493\">\n    181 Conn. at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20A.2d%201030\">\n    435 A.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We further disagree with the plaintiff's contention that the appellate stay on the trial court's financial orders justifies the appellate attorney's fees award because the trial court could have terminated the stay sua sponte, and because the plaintiff did, in fact, successfully move to terminate the stay on several of those orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, the trial attorney's fees award represents a very small portion of the liquid assets awarded to the plaintiff in the trial court's judgment. Pursuant to the judgment, the plaintiff would receive: $2,082,000, the amount owed to her under the agreement, within sixty days of the judgment; $40,000 per month in periodic alimony and child support, starting twelve days from the judgment; and $7.5 million in lump sum alimony, payable in biannual installments of $375,000, starting two and one-half months from the judgment. Thus, the plaintiff would receive liquid assets totaling $2,577,000 within three months of the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial attorney's fees award represents only 4 percent of this amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have previously held attorney's fees awards amounting to a low portion of the payee's liquid assets to constitute an abuse of discretion, since the payee could easily have paid the fees out of those assets, despite the existence of equitable factors supporting the award.

Even if we agree with this formulation of a functional property distribution, we disagree that it applies to this case for two reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    First, the defendant does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    claim that he must invade his assets to make the alimony and child support payments and, accordingly, he does not argue that his need to do so indicates that the lump sum award is a functional property distribution. He simply argues that, because the alimony and child support awards apparently exceed the plaintiff's claimed expenses, the award is actually a property distribution. As acknowledged by Justice Zarella, \"this fact alone does not make the lump sum alimony award a functional property distribution.\" We respectfully disagree, however, with Justice Zarella's subsequent assertion and consideration of the defendant's purported need to dip into his assets-the second factor in his two part test-in concluding that the lump sum alimony award is a functional property distribution. The defendant did not raise or brief this claim and, as such, the plaintiff did not have an opportunity to address whether the defendant had to invade his assets to pay the awards or the effect that it would have on this court's determination of whether the lump sum award is a functional property distribution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    We respectfully disagree with Justice Zarella's contention that the defendant's argument that he must invade his assets is \"necessarily subsumed\" within his claim that the award is a functional property distribution. The defendant's argument may reasonably be understood as being that, because the award exceeds the plaintiff's claimed expenses, the award is actually a property distribution, regardless of how he\n    <em>\n     pays\n    </em>\n    the award-out of his income\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    assets. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Michael T.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20623\">\n     319 Conn. 623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 635 n. 7,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20558\">\n     126 A.3d 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015) (respondent's \"argument\" that \"there was a strategic reason not to call an expert\" was \"subsumed\" within its \"claim\" that \"habeas court incorrectly determined that ... petitioner's trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present expert testimony\"). Moreover, even if the parties discussed this issue at oral argument, it is well settled that a claim cannot be raised for the first time at oral argument.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Lenarz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775691\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/417/\">\n     301 Conn. 417\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 483 n. 22,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20A.3d%20536\">\n     22 A.3d 536\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011). We find Justice Zarella's distinction between claims and arguments unpersuasive in this context, considering the plaintiff's inability to brief and fully respond to the invasion of assets issue. See\n    <em>\n     Michael T.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 635,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20558\">\n     126 A.3d 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (petitioner could not claim to have been \"ambushed\" by respondent's argument that there was strategic reason not to call expert, in support of claim that habeas court improperly determined that petitioner's trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not calling expert). We therefore address the issue as squarely presented by the defendant. See also footnote 10 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Second, even if the defendant\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    briefed this claim, we cannot presume that he\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    invade his assets to pay the alimony and child support awards based upon this record. The posture of this case presents us with a significant anomaly. Although the trial court made findings as to the defendant's income at the time of trial, our review of the record indicates that the court did not make any determination as to whether its finding of the defendant's income was also a finding of his\n    <em>\n     earning capacity\n    </em>\n    . See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a) (in awarding alimony trial court \"shall consider the ... earning capacity ... of each of the parties\");\n    <em>\n     Auerbach\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Auerbach\n    </em>\n    , 113 Conn.App. at 318, 334-35,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20292\">\n     966 A.2d 292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (court may base financial awards on earning capacity rather than actual earned income), cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145848,4145564\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/902/\">\n     292 Conn. 902\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20A.2d%2040\">\n     971 A.2d 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009). Without establishing this factual predicate, we cannot agree with Justice Zarella's conclusion that the defendant would have to dip into assets that were the subject of the prenuptial agreement, because we cannot presume that the defendant would need to invade those assets to satisfy the awards. See\n    <em>\n     In re Jason R.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20438\">\n     306 Conn. 438\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 453,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%20334\">\n     51 A.3d 334\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012) (\"[w]e read an ambiguous trial court record so as to support, rather than contradict, its judgment\"). For illustrative purposes, we note that the defendant earned significantly more income-enough to pay the alimony and child support awards without utilizing any assets-in several years leading up to the dissolution of the marriage. For example, in 2006, he earned $1,687,677 in yearly income, which equates to $140,639 per month-more than enough to pay the alimony and child support awards and maintain a considerably high standard of living. The following year, he earned $1,253,766 in yearly income, which equates to $104,480 per month, which is still enough to cover the alimony and child support payments. To the extent that the defendant's earning capacity is, in Justice Zarella's words, \"theoretical,\" it is only so because the trial court did not make such a finding. In the absence of such a finding, we read the record to support, rather than undermine, the trial court's judgment.\n    <em>\n     DeNunzio\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     DeNunzio\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20178\">\n     320 Conn. 178\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 197,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20901\">\n     128 A.3d 901\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016).

During litigation, the parties entered into a stipulation that the trial court made an order of the court, in which the defendant agreed to pay $250,000 of the plaintiff's attorney's fees.

The defendant argues that the trial court's finding that he waived or was equitably estopped from claiming that the agreement bars an award of attorney's fees was clearly erroneous, because the parties agreed in the stipulation that \"[t]he [plaintiff] shall not be precluded from seeking additional [attorney's] fees, pendente lite, and the [defendant] shall not be precluded from opposing the [plaintiff's] request for additional [attorney's] fees.\" See\n    <em>\n     Banks Building Co., LLC\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Malanga Family Real Estate Holding, LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038769\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/102/231/#p239\">\n     102 Conn.App. 231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 239,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=926%20A.2d%201\">\n     926 A.2d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007) (\"waiver [is a question] of fact ... we will not disturb the trial court's [finding] unless [it is] clearly erroneous\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ); see also\n    <em>\n     Fischer\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Zollino\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174454\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/661/#p667\">\n     303 Conn. 661\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 667-68,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%20270\">\n     35 A.3d 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012) (reviewing trial court's finding of equitable estoppel for clear error).

By upholding the trial court's $7.5 million lump sum alimony award, the\n   majority eviscerates the parties'\n   <em>\n    enforceable\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   premarital agreement, defeats the purpose behind the Connecticut Premarital Agreement Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36a et seq., and fails to keep pace with the development of matrimonial law in our sister states. In light of the majority's opinion, an enterprising trial court struck by sympathy for a recent divorcee who entered into a less than favorable-\n   <em>\n    but not unconscionable\n   </em>\n   -premarital agreement may now end-run the agreement, consciously or subconsciously, by awarding greater \"alimony,\" unless the agreement expressly provides for the level of alimony. Today's result defeats Connecticut's public policy of encouraging the private settlement of family matters and removes the predictability the act was intended to create. See, e.g., Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 7, 1995 Sess., p. 2492 (\"[one] purpose of the [proposed] [a]ct is to provide certainty as to the enforceability of the provisions in premarital agreements\"). Prospective spouses who enter into premarital agreements that settle issues of property division in the unfortunate event of a future divorce but leave for the courts the award of alimony-a seemingly prudent decision\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -do so at their own risk.\n   No longer can such prospective spouses be sure that the Connecticut courts will honor their intentions as expressed in the agreement. Until the legislature addresses the majority's conclusions, attorneys are well advised to include alimony waivers or provisions setting alimony amounts and terms in premarital agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LUMP SUM ALIMONY AWARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the present case, the majority upholds the trial court's financial order awarding the plaintiff, Marjorie Hornung, lump sum alimony of $7.5 million. The defendant, Robert Hornung, claims that, in light of the periodic alimony award, the property settlement resulting from the premarital agreement, and the trial court's express reliance on statutory criteria pertaining to property division, the lump sum alimony award was an improper property distribution in contravention of the parties' premarital agreement. More specifically, the defendant claims that the parties intended that all property matters be settled by the premarital agreement. He argues that the lump sum alimony award subverted such intention because it was, either in fact or function, a disguised property distribution. To support his contention that\n   the alimony award is a property distribution, the defendant argues, among other things, that the support award far exceeds what the plaintiff requires for her support and maintenance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree with the\n   defendant that the lump sum alimony award is a functional property distribution. I reach this conclusion in light of the fact that the support award in the present case far exceeds the plaintiff's need for support and maintenance,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   requires the defendant to invade his assets to satisfy the obligation. I additionally conclude that the lump sum alimony award undermines the premarital agreement because the agreement contemplated alimony, which is an award sufficient to allow the recipient to continue in his or her current lifestyle. In the present case, however, the trial court's alimony award exceeds an amount sufficient for such purpose and the reasonable bounds of discretion. For these reasons,\n   I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for the entry of new financial orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   An understanding of the premarital agreement is essential to the resolution of the defendant's claim. On July 14, 1997, the plaintiff and the defendant executed a\n   premarital agreement. The agreement defines and identifies each party's separate property. It also defines marital property as \"all property that is acquired by either or both parties subsequent to the marriage ....\" In the event of dissolution of the marriage, the agreement provides that each party shall retain his or her separate property, the defendant will retain the marital property, except for certain personal property, and the plaintiff will receive from the defendant a property settlement payment. A formula for determining the amount of the property settlement payment is provided in the agreement. The payment amount increases with the length of the marriage and the number of children of the marriage. It was the express intention of the parties that the property distribution effectuated by the agreement fully satisfy both party's claims to property under Connecticut's equitable property distribution statute, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81. The agreement also provides that \"a court of competent jurisdiction shall address the issues of alimony and/or child support, both temporary and permanent ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July, 2008, the parties amended the agreement. At the time of the dissolution, the trial court found that, under the terms of the amended agreement, the plaintiff was to receive a property settlement payment of $4.75 million, $1.25 million under the terms of the original agreement and\n   an additional $3.5 million pursuant to the July, 2008 amendment for her separate interest in the marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addressing alimony and child support, the trial court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff periodic unallocated alimony and child support, as well as lump sum alimony. The court awarded $40,000 per month in periodic unallocated alimony and child support, which the parties do not challenge on appeal. That award is time limited, ending upon the death of either party, the plaintiff's remarriage, or in March, 2029, at which time the plaintiff will be sixty years old. In addition, the periodic award provides the plaintiff with an income safe harbor of $50,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also awarded the plaintiff $7.5 million in lump sum alimony, payable in twenty semiannual installments of $375,000. The lump sum award is nonmodifiable, survives the death of either party, and does not terminate upon the remarriage of the plaintiff. During the ten years that the plaintiff will receive both periodic and lump sum alimony payments, she will collect monthly support of $102,500. The lump sum alimony payments will end in 2024, at which time all four of the parties' children will be well past the age of majority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff will\n   continue to receive the monthly periodic unallocated\n   alimony and child support until March, 2029, unless she has remarried or she or the defendant has died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The trial court's $7.5 million award, despite being characterized by the court as lump sum alimony, operates as a property distribution and subverts the premarital agreement. The award functions as a property distribution because it (1) exceeds the plaintiff's support and maintenance needs,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) requires the defendant to invade the assets he retained pursuant to the premarital agreement in order to meet the claimed alimony obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I will first address the excessiveness of the alimony, beginning by setting forth the legal principles that govern this determination. Generally, trial courts enjoy broad discretion when equitably distributing property and entering alimony orders in a marital dissolution case. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3152063\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/348/#p360\">\n    275 Conn. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20872\">\n    880 A.2d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Such broad discretion is necessary due to the myriad circumstances surrounding marriage dissolution actions and the court's objective to place each spouse in an equitable postdissolution position.

It has often been said that the court's equitable power is \"the keystone [of] the court's ability to fashion relief\" when dissolving a marriage and that,\n   without it, and the court's broad discretion, it might be impossible to fairly resolve some dissolution disputes.\n   <em>\n    Sunbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sunbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"563470\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/210/170/#p173\">\n    210 Conn. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20A.2d%20612\">\n    553 A.2d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).

(Emphasis added.) Moreover, the factors to be considered under each statute largely overlap. In assigning property under \u00a7 46b-81 and determining whether alimony should be awarded under \u00a7 46b-82, the court must consider, inter alia, \"the length of the marriage, the causes for the ... dissolution of the marriage ... the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, earning capacity, vocational skills, education, employability, estate ... and needs of each of the parties ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c) ; accord General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a). Under the property division statute, the court must also consider each party's liabilities, contributions to the \"acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates,\" and future opportunities to acquire capital assets and income; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c) ; and, in rendering alimony orders, the court must consider whether the alimony recipient is the custodial parent of any minor children and the desirability and feasibility of such parent securing employment.

Nevertheless, these statutes are distinct and serve separate\n   purposes, namely, property division and spousal support.

The dividing line between the two statutes becomes particularly important when the divorcing parties have entered into a premarital agreement that completely resolves the property distribution, such as in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The existence of a premarital agreement in a dissolution action implicates additional statutory provisions, namely, the Connecticut Premarital Agreement Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36a et seq. The act authorizes premarital agreements and provides for the form and permissible content of such agreements. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-36c and 46b-36d. It also sets forth the factors that courts are to consider in determining whether premarital agreements are enforceable. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g. When divorcing spouses invoke these statutory provisions to seek enforcement of a premarital agreement in a dissolution proceeding, these provisions come into tension with \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82. In such cases, therefore, we must harmonize the dissolution court's broad discretion, conferred by \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and\n   46b-82, with the parties' right and intention to settle the property distribution and/or alimony issues privately, as permitted by the act. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Rainforest Cafe, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Revenue Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146649\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/363/#p377\">\n    293 Conn. 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377-78,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20650\">\n    977 A.2d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (\"we must, if possible, construe two statutes in a manner that gives effect to both, eschewing an interpretation that would render either ineffective\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n   At the very least, it should be obvious that premarital agreements have some impact on the operation of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82. If they did not, premarital agreements and the act would be meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This case presents this court with its first opportunity to clarify the impact that a premarital agreement has on a trial court's discretion to structure financial orders pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82. In the presence of a premarital agreement that distributes the parties' property but leaves open the question of alimony, the trial court's broad discretion in fashioning financial orders, by necessity, becomes limited. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6120644\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/765/747/#p753\">\n    765 N.W.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753-54 (S.D.2009) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11580124\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/740/1181/#p1187\">\n    740 So.2d 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1187 (Fla.App.1999) (\"A primary purpose of [a premarital] agreement is to modify or shrink the general discretion of the dissolution ... [court] in doing equity between the parties. The agreement itself is intended to define the mutual equities, and the [dissolution court] is not free to ignore its provisions\n   <em>\n    or to render them ineffective\n   </em>\n   .\" [Emphasis added.] ). The trial court's discretion in dissolution matters could be thought of as a sliding scale. At one end of this scale, where the court has the greatest discretion to craft financial orders, is the case in which the parties have not executed a premarital agreement. In such cases, the court may begin by unscrambling the marital assets through consideration and weighing of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 46b-81. Then, the court might turn to alimony, assessing the alimony recipient's support needs, in accordance with the factors set forth in \u00a7 46b-82. Of course, the amount and type of property awarded to the recipient spouse may impact that spouse's ability to meet all, or some, of his or her support needs and thereby affect the appropriate alimony amount. See\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 751 (\"[c]ourts are to consider property division and spousal support jointly because an award of more assets can eliminate\n   or reduce the need for spousal support and vice versa\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). It is this sequence of events-the property distribution, the alimony order, and the assessment of the alimony recipient's ability to provide for his or her own needs in light of the property distribution-that I am referring to when I speak of balancing the property distribution and alimony award. The trial court is balancing the orders in the sense that the alimony recipient's needs and ability to provide for those needs may vary depending on the type and amount of property that he or she is awarded through the equitable distribution of property. See id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Conversely, when the parties have entered into a premarital agreement that divides the separate and marital property, but does not address or prohibit alimony, the court's discretion necessarily narrows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under such circumstances, the trial court no longer has any discretion to divide the parties' property under \u00a7 46b-81. Likewise, because the court cannot distribute the property, it no longer has the flexibility to balance the property and alimony awards, at least not in the same sense. Instead, the court is working from a\n   fixed property settlement, one the parties have decided is acceptable, and the court's role is to determine,\n   <em>\n    in light of that property distribution\n   </em>\n   , whether an alimony award should be made and, if so, in what amount and under what terms. The fixed property settlement also influences the alimony obligor's ability to meet an alimony obligation and the alimony recipient's support and maintenance needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the trial court's discretion\n   is limited to making an award that provides for the support of the recipient spouse, and the court need only consider how the property settlement impacts that alimony recipient's ability to provide for himself or herself and the alimony obligor's ability to satisfy the alimony obligation. Stated differently, the award should reflect what the alimony recipient needs in order to maintain, to the extent practicable, the lifestyle he or she enjoyed during the marriage, in light of the property distribution reached by the parties. The award should not attempt to counterbalance the property distribution reached by the parties in the name of doing equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   My view of the interrelationship between \u00a7 46b-81, \u00a7 46b-82, and a premarital agreement is supported by the legislative history of the act. See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-170 (P.A. 95-170). The purpose of the act was to \"serve as a guideline and standard for planning for people who are entering into a marriage ... [and] to provide certainty as to the enforceability of the provisions in premarital agreements ....\" Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 2492; see also 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1995 Sess., p. 3210, remarks of Representative Ellen Scalettar (\"This bill establishes standards and guidelines for premarital agreements. It includes what the agreements may have in them, what they can include, and also under what conditions the agreements will be unenforceable.\"). Thus, the act provides\n   prospective spouses with the necessary tools to ensure that, in the unfortunate event of a divorce, they, themselves, may settle their financial affairs and that the trial court will honor their expectations. Such an objective is consistent with the noted public policy of this state to encourage the private resolution of family matters and to foster the \"private settlement of the financial affairs of estranged marital partners ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Billington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Billington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545014\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/220/212/#p221\">\n    220 Conn. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%201377\">\n    595 A.2d 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). These purposes and policies would be undermined, however, if the trial court were allowed to order alimony that unreasonably exceeds the support needs of the alimony recipient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   With respect to the present case, for the first ten years following the divorce, the plaintiff will receive $102,500 in monthly support through periodic and lump sum alimony. Thereafter, she will continue to receive monthly periodic unallocated alimony and child support until March, 2029,\n   unless she has remarried or she or the defendant has died. The trial court found, in relation to the alimony award, that time limited alimony was proper and that the purpose of both periodic and lump sum alimony was to provide for the continued support of the plaintiff. In addition, the trial court decided that, \"under all the circumstances, an award of lump sum alimony payable over time, in addition to the award of periodic alimony, [was] appropriate to provide for [the] continuing support of the [plaintiff] ... given the [plaintiff's] health issues, her lack of recent employment, her primary child care responsibilities for four children, which limits her ability to enter the workforce on a full-time basis, and her limited opportunity to acquire assets in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In light of the more limited discretion trial courts have to fashion alimony orders when the parties have entered into a premarital agreement, reviewing courts\n   should carefully evaluate such awards. In this case, the record reveals that the plaintiff's monthly support need is approximately $45,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The monthly support that the plaintiff receives pursuant to the trial court's financial orders, however, far exceeds such need. Under the current financial orders, the plaintiff will receive $102,500 in monthly support over the next ten years. That is approximately $57,500 per month, or $690,000 per year, more than she claims to need. Thus, during that ten year period, she will collect $6.9 million in alimony that is not attributable to her need for support and maintenance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of these facts, it is difficult to understand how the financial support orders in the present case comport with the limited support purpose of alimony. The plaintiff contends that the award was not excessive and results in only minimal surplus, if any.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   She argues that the periodic award of $40,000 per month is insufficient to provide for her expenses, let alone the expenses of the children, which the award, as unallocated alimony and child support, was intended to cover.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, she asserts that the shortage is even greater\n   when the tax consequences of the alimony award are considered, and, therefore, the lump sum award was necessary to provide for the shortfall between her and her children's needs, on the one hand, and the periodic unallocated alimony and child support award, on the other. Even if one were to accept these arguments, the approximately $6.9 million in alimony that is not attributable to the plaintiff's monthly expenses, which include considerable child care costs; see footnote 15 of this opinion; will certainly provide for the children and the tax consequences of the periodic award, and still result in more than minimally excessive alimony. This is particularly true in light of the fact that the defendant is responsible for a substantial amount of the expenses related to the children. In addition to the child support award, the defendant is required to maintain health and dental insurance for the minor children, provide for 60 percent of their unreimbursed medical and dental expenses, including orthodontic, optical, pharmaceutical and psychological expenses, and pay for one half of the children's extracurricular activities. Moreover, one child has reached the age of eighteen, another child, who is currently sixteen, is quickly approaching the age of majority, and the other two children are not particularly young-fourteen and eleven, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority acknowledges that, at the very least, the monthly alimony award of $102,500 exceeds the plaintiff's stated monthly need of $65,444 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the majority argues that this fact alone does not transmute the lump sum alimony award into a functional property distribution. Instead of ending its inquiry there, however, the majority suggests, in light of the marital standard of living, the factors set forth in \u00a7 46b-82, the relative division of the marital estate, and the lack of a specific allocation for child support, that, perhaps, the lump sum alimony award is not excessive or improper at all.

I cannot agree, however, that the alimony award is necessary for the plaintiff to maintain such a standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court made no finding regarding the marital standard of living or the monthly marital expenses. Nevertheless, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 25-30 (a), both the plaintiff and the defendant submitted financial affidavits to the trial court, which cataloged their current incomes, expenses, assets, and liabilities around the time of the dissolution. Our cases have made clear that courts are entitled to rely on the truth and accuracy of such affidavits. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Billington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Billington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545014\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/220/212/#p221\">\n    220 Conn. at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%201377\">\n    595 A.2d 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the\n   trial court is entitled to rely on such affidavits, I see no reason why this court cannot also rely on such affidavits, particularly when the trial court has not discredited such affidavits and appears to have relied on them itself. The plaintiff's affidavit reveals monthly expenses of approximately $45,000, and a cursory review of her affidavit leaves the reviewer with but one reasonable conclusion, namely, that $45,000 per month is the cost of maintaining her current lifestyle, not, as the majority seems to suggest, merely the cost of her basic living expenses. A sampling of the plaintiff's monthly expenses is illustrative: more than $2000 for clothing, approximately $1300 for \"personal care,\" including costs for hairdressing, manicures, pedicures, massages, and fitness classes, and more than $3800 for entertainment, travel, and vacations. The defendant's affidavit discloses monthly expenses of $97,645. Contained in that amount is a monthly expense for alimony and child support in the amount of $46,000.\n   When the alimony and support expense is subtracted, the defendant is left with $51,645 in his own living expenses. Given the similarity in the monthly expenses disclosed by the plaintiff and the defendant, it appears from the record that, in order to sustain their current lifestyle, the parties each need between $45,000 and $52,000 per month. Such a conclusion is further supported by the parties' stipulation for unallocated alimony and child support,\n   <em>\n    pendente lite\n   </em>\n   , of $46,000 per month. Of course, the trial court made no finding in this regard, and it is not the province of this court to do so. I highlight these facts simply to make the following point: no trial court could reasonably conclude that an alimony award of $102,500 per month, an amount that is nearly 230 percent of the plaintiff's monthly expenses, is proper based on the facts of the present case. Moreover, the record reveals no evidence that would support a finding that the plaintiff's monthly expenses-and, therefore, the cost of maintaining her current lifestyle-are anywhere near $102,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Next, the majority notes, and correctly so, that the marital standard of living, or station, and expenses, or needs, of the parties are but two of the statutory factors that the trial court is to consider when entering alimony orders. Consideration of all the factors, the majority states, \"militates against characterizing the lump sum alimony award as a property distribution.\" Text accompanying footnote 25 of the majority opinion. I presume this means that the majority has concluded, in light of the statutory factors set forth in \u00a7 46b-82, that the alimony award is not excessive or improper. See footnote 18 of this opinion. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, the majority mistakenly assumes that the \u00a7 46b-82 factors go exclusively to the alimony award amount, and, therefore, because that statute includes factors in addition to \"station\" and \"needs,\" an alimony award may properly exceed the recipient's support and maintenance\n   needs. Section 46b-82 does direct the trial court to consider factors other than station and need, such as \"the length of the marriage, the causes for the ... dissolution of the marriage ... the age, health ... occupation, amount and sources of income, earning capacity, vocational skills, education, employability, [and] estate ... of each of the parties ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a). These factors are not only relevant for determining the amount of an alimony award, but they must also be considered \"[i]n determining\n   <em>\n    whether alimony shall be awarded, and the duration ... of the award\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. To be sure, not all factors go to the cost of maintaining the recipient's lifestyle. Nonetheless, they do relate to the recipient's support and maintenance needs. More specifically, the factors\n   help the trial court determine, in light of the recipient's assets and income, the amount and duration of alimony necessary for the recipient to maintain the lifestyle that he or she enjoyed at the time of dissolution. For example, the court is to consider the age, health, occupation, amount and sources of income, earning capacity, vocational skills, education, and employability of the parties. These factors, as they relate to the recipient spouse, inform the court of the recipient's current income or potential future income and, therefore, his or her ability or inability, as the case may be, to provide for his or her own support needs, at least in part. For example, if the recipient did not work for the greater portion of the marriage, like the plaintiff in the present case, such recipient's age, health, vocational skills, education, and employability may lead the trial court to conclude that he or she, despite having been unemployed during the marriage, can, in time, find employment, potentially reducing the amount, or shortening the duration, of the alimony needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, and relatedly, it is an axiom of matrimonial law that the purpose of alimony is to provide the recipient with support and maintenance. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Dan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dan\n   </em>\n   , supra, 315 Conn. at 10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20A.3d%20118\">\n    105 A.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[h]istorically, alimony was based [on] the continuing duty of a divorced husband to support an abandoned wife and should be sufficient to provide her with the kind of living [that] she might have enjoyed but for the breach of the marriage contract by the [husband]\" [internal quotation marks omitted] );\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730979\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/494/#p503\">\n    283 Conn. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20894\">\n    927 A.2d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (\"[t]he traditional purpose of alimony is to meet one's continuing duty to support\" [internal quotation marks omitted] );\n   <em>\n    Gay\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2637256\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/641/#p647\">\n    266 Conn. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20A.2d%201\">\n    835 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (\"[t]he purpose of both periodic and lump sum alimony is to provide continuing support\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Thus, the \u00a7 46b-82 factors are intended to help the trial court determine, first, whether alimony is necessary for the recipient's support and maintenance, and, second, if alimony is necessary, the amount and duration necessary to provide for the recipient's support and maintenance. The factors do not, however, transform alimony into something it is not. Stated differently, the factors are not to be utilized to justify an award that exceeds the purpose of alimony, namely, support and maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The alimony award is also justified, the majority suggests, due to the disparity in the premarital agreement's distribution of the marital assets. The majority emphasizes that the defendant received more than $25 million in assets as a result of the divorce, compared to the approximately $4.5 to $5 million in assets that the plaintiff\n   received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   To support its suggestion that the alimony award is proper in light of the premarital agreement's comparative property distribution, the majority cites \u00a7 46b-82, particularly, the factor directing the trial court to consider the estate of each party. Section 46b-82 provides no support for this approach. Indeed, the court must consider the estate of both\n   spouses. Consideration of the estate of the alimony obligor is necessary to determine his or her ability to pay alimony, and, likewise, consideration of the estate of the alimony recipient is necessary to determine his or her need for alimony. Considering the estates of the parties in a relative fashion, as the majority does in the present case, however, is an entirely different application of that factor. The majority's suggestion that a large lump sum alimony award, one not necessary to provide for the recipient's support and maintenance, might be justified due to the comparative share of the assets received by each spouse in accordance with a premarital agreement is entirely antithetical to the concept of such agreements. In fact, approving a $7.5 million lump sum alimony award because the parties' premarital agreement awarded the obligor $25 million in assets and the recipient between $4.5 and $5 million in assets is simply an attempt by the court to rewrite the parties' agreement. Our case law makes clear that the courts are not to second-guess the wisdom or question the fairness of premarital agreements that are entered into voluntarily. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304767\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/153/#p162\">\n    295 Conn. 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201060\">\n    989 A.2d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"whether the trial court or this court thinks the [premarital] agreement was a good bargain for the plaintiff does not enter into the analysis of [its enforceability]\").\n   In a final attempt to justify the lump sum alimony award in the present case, the majority claims that the trial court did not specify how much of the unallocated alimony and child support award was intended for the children's support, rather than the plaintiff's. Although the trial court did not expressly state what the child support award amount was, we are not without guidance. Using the trial court's findings in the present case and the Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (guidelines) in effect at the time of the dissolution, we can, at the very least, determine the baseline for child support. To assist courts in calculating equitable and consistent child support orders, the guidelines contain a schedule of basic child support obligations based on the number of children and the parents' combined net weekly income. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-2b (f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present case, the parties have four minor children and a combined net weekly income of $12,097. For families with four minor children, however, the schedule only provides basic child support obligations for families with a combined net weekly income ranging between $370 and $4000. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201060\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"When the parents' combined net weekly income exceeds [$4000], child support awards shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, and the current support prescribed at the [$4000] net weekly income level shall be the minimum presumptive amount.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201060\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 46b-215a-2b (a) (2). In accordance with the guidelines, therefore, the presumptive minimum child support obligation in the present case is $765 per week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086186\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/80/#p108\">\n    296 Conn. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20A.2d%201\">\n    995 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), this court explained that, when a trial court is making a case specific child support determination for a family with a combined net weekly income that exceeds the upper range of the schedule, it must still follow the principle on\n   which the guidelines are based, namely, \"that the child support obligation as a percentage of the combined net weekly income should decline as the income level rises.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20A.2d%201\">\n    Id., at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20A.2d%201\">\n    995 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the rule to be gleaned from\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   is that the minimum child support order in high income cases should presumptively be no less than \"the current support prescribed at the [$4000] net weekly income level\"; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-2b (a) (2) ; for a family with the same number of minor children, and the presumptive maximum order should \"not exceed the [maximum] percent [set forth in the schedule] when the combined net weekly income of the family exceeds $4000 ....\"\n   <em>\n    Dowling\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Szymczak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20390\">\n    309 Conn. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678965\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/892/8/3678965/\">\n    72 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). With these principles in mind, I conclude that the presumptive appropriate range for the child support order in the present case is between $765 and $2314 per week-19.13 percent of the combined net weekly income. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678965\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/892/8/3678965/\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (child support obligation for high income family should not exceed percent of combined net weekly income used for family with same number of minor children at highest combined net weekly income set forth in schedule);\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maturo\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 96,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20A.2d%201\">\n    995 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (presumptively, support order for family with combined net weekly income in excess of income range covered by schedule should not exceed same percentage of income provided for family with same number of children and highest combined net weekly income provided by schedule); see also Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-2b (f) (setting child support obligation percentage for four minor children and combined net weekly income of $4000 at 19.13 percent). Thus, the presumptive maximum monthly\n   child support, about $10,000, accounts for only a small amount of the excessive alimony. Even if it is assumed that the trial court found it necessary to deviate upward, there is no evidence in the record that would support the magnitude of the excessiveness of the award in the present case. Moreover, and as I explained in response to the plaintiff's argument on this point, the plaintiff's financial affidavit contains significant costs related to child care. Thus, simply stacking the presumptive child support amount on top of the expenses that the plaintiff listed in her financial affidavit would likely result in the double counting of some costs. Furthermore, the defendant is obligated to pay, in addition to the alimony and child support award, a substantial portion of the child care expenses, including health and dental insurance, 60 percent of unreimbursed medical and dental expenses, and one half of the expenses from the children's extracurricular activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because the monthly alimony obligation of $102,500 unreasonably exceeds the plaintiff's monthly support need of $45,000, and despite the arguments advanced by the plaintiff and the majority, I conclude that the lump sum alimony award, in conjunction with the periodic alimony award, is excessive. I concede, however, that this fact alone does not make the lump sum alimony award a functional property distribution. Indeed, for the alimony award to function as a property distribution, it must result in the transfer to the plaintiff of property that the defendant was awarded pursuant to the premarital agreement. The lump sum alimony award in the present case results in such a transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The defendant has a monthly income of approximately $80,833. The alimony obligation, however, is $102,500 per month. Thus, the defendant's monthly income is insufficient to satisfy the monthly alimony obligation, and, therefore, the defendant will necessarily need to invade his assets-assets that he was awarded under the premarital agreement-to cover the balance of the obligation, nearly $22,000 per month. Of course, the need to invade assets, in and of itself, does not make the lump sum alimony award a functional property distribution.

When an alimony award is necessary to provide for the support and maintenance of the recipient, the fact that the obligor needs to invade his or her assets to satisfy the obligation does not change the award's function, which is to provide support and maintenance. On the other hand, when an alimony award is excessive\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   requires the obligor to invade his or her assets to satisfy the obligation to pay the award, the function of the award changes. In this circumstance, the obligor is forced to transfer assets to the recipient, assets that the obligor was awarded in the dissolution proceeding and that are unnecessary for the support and maintenance of the recipient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In the present case, the alimony order results in the plaintiff receiving at least $6.9 million in excess of her support and maintenance needs. Thus, the award goes beyond the purpose of alimony. Moreover, the award is nearly 127 percent of the defendant's monthly income, and, therefore, he will need to invade his assets to satisfy the court order. Thus, under the trial court's current financial support orders, the defendant must transfer to the plaintiff assets that he was awarded under the premarital agreement, assets that are\n   <em>\n    unnecessary\n   </em>\n   for the plaintiff's support and maintenance. The only logical conclusion is that the trial court has effectuated, whether intentional or not, a transfer of the defendant's assets to the plaintiff, contrary to the intention of the parties as represented in their premarital agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   I thus conclude that the lump sum alimony\n   award in the present case is a functional property distribution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The analysis employed in this case is consistent with the development of matrimonial law in other jurisdictions.

When the parties divorced, the trial court denied the husband's request for lump sum alimony because the court found that he had not established a need for the alimony or the wife's ability to pay alimony.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6120644\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/765/747/#p753\">\n    Id., at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6120644\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/765/747/#p753\">\n    id., at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Even if the lump sum alimony award in the present case was not a functional property distribution, I would still find it to be improper under the circumstances. As I already discussed, the award far exceeds\n   the plaintiff's needs for support and maintenance. For that reason alone, I believe it undermines the premarital agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   When the parties agreed to allow the court to set alimony in the event of a divorce, they intended for the court to award an amount that would provide for the recipient spouse's support; after all, that is what alimony is. According to the plaintiff's own financial affidavit, that amount is approximately $45,000 per month. When the trial court entered an order requiring the defendant to pay alimony in considerable excess of the plaintiff's needs, the order provided the plaintiff with a windfall that was not contemplated by the parties' premarital agreement. In doing so, the trial court defeated that agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the premarital agreement\n   in the present case was executed, as amended, the plaintiff and the defendant intended that, if their marriage were to be dissolved, each would keep his or her own separate property, the defendant would keep the marital property and, in exchange, the plaintiff would receive a property settlement payment, which increased with the length of the marriage and the number of children, and the court would set an alimony award. Because the purpose of alimony is to provide support and maintenance, at the time of dissolution, the alimony award the parties had bargained for was approximately $45,000 per month. Of course, the award need not be that amount exactly and could be in lump sum, rather than periodic, form. The trial court, however, awarded more than twice that amount. That is not what the parties bargained for. Thus, the court's alimony award is improper and undermines the premarital agreement because it exceeds the plaintiff's support and maintenance needs beyond all reasonable bounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In light of the foregoing facts, I conclude that the lump sum alimony award in the present case is a functional property distribution because it far exceeds the plaintiff's need for support and requires the defendant to invade assets to satisfy the obligation. The lump sum alimony award is also improper because the parties' bargain allowed for the court to set alimony-an award that would provide for the support and maintenance of the recipient. The award in this case goes far beyond that purpose. Moreover, \"[b]ecause the financial orders in an action for dissolution of marriage are of necessity interwoven and because the rendering of judgment in an action for the dissolution of marriage is a carefully crafted mosaic ... each element of which may be dependent on the other\"; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <em>\n    Wiegand\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wiegand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4245361\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/129/526/#p540\">\n    129 Conn.App. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20489\">\n    21 A.3d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ; the defendant's second claim regarding attorney's fees is affected by the trial court's\n   improper lump sum alimony award.

In light of that opinion, trial courts can effectively undermine premarital agreements entered into by prospective spouses by making excessive alimony awards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, I fear that parties\n   will be encouraged to include in their premarital agreements provisions either establishing alimony, by amount or formula, or precluding it altogether. Although the public policy of this state generally favors the private settlement of family matters; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Billington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Billington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545014\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/220/212/#p221\">\n    220 Conn. at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%201377\">\n    595 A.2d 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and alimony is a permissible subject matter for premarital agreements; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36d (a) (4) (parties to premarital agreement may contract with respect to \"[t]he modification or elimination of spousal support\"); in my view, alimony is more appropriately settled at the time of dissolution, when the obligor's ability to pay and the recipient's support needs are both known, rather than at some time before the marriage, when these relevant considerations are uncertain.\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   ENFORCEABILITY OF PREMARITAL AGREEMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The plaintiff filed a cross appeal challenging the enforceability of the premarital agreement. Her appeal, however, was contingent on the defendant prevailing on his claims or this court otherwise remanding the case for the entry of new financial orders. Because I would reverse the trial court's financial orders and remand the case for a new hearing on the financial matters, I reach the plaintiff's cross appeal. The plaintiff claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the premarital agreement entered into by the parties in 1997, and amended in 2008, was enforceable. In essence, she argues that the agreement is unenforceable because (1) the defendant did not make a fair and reasonable disclosure of his income when the agreement was amended in 2008, (2) the defendant did not make a fair and reasonable disclosure of the value of certain software in which he had a proprietary interest when the parties married, and (3) the agreement was unconscionable when entered into in 1997, when amended in 2008, and when the defendant sought enforcement of the agreement in 2014. I agree that the defendant did not make a fair and reasonable disclosure of his income in 2008, when he and the plaintiff amended the premarital agreement, and, therefore, I need not address the plaintiff's other arguments. In light of the defendant's unfair and unreasonable disclosure of his income, I conclude that it was improper for the trial court to enforce the amended agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The following facts are relevant to this claim. The plaintiff and the defendant executed a premarital agreement on July 14, 1997, approximately three weeks before they were married. As I previously noted, the agreement provided that, in the event of dissolution of the marriage, each party would retain their separate\n   property, the defendant would retain the marital property, with the exception of certain personal property, and the plaintiff would receive a property settlement payment, which increased with the length of the marriage and the number of children. Both parties made financial disclosures in connection with the agreement, including a disclosure by the defendant of his proprietary\n   interest in a certain software program. At that time, the defendant valued that interest at between $285,000 and $570,000. Within three years of marrying, the defendant sold the software and received approximately $37 million for his interest in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In July, 2008, the parties amended their premarital agreement. The amendment ratified and confirmed the terms of the original agreement. In addition, it granted the plaintiff a separate interest in the marital home and provided that, in the event of a legal separation or a divorce, the plaintiff would receive $3.5 million for such interest, along with any payment due pursuant to the formula set forth in the original agreement. The parties again made financial disclosures in connection with the amendment. Among other things, the defendant listed his taxable income for 2004, 2005, and 2006 in the amounts of $1,249,989, $902,025, and $1,687,677, respectively. He did not, however, disclose his 2007 income or his income in 2008 as of the date of the amendment, namely, July 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   I will begin with the standard of review and governing legal principles. A trial court's determination of whether a premarital agreement is unenforceable under \u00a7 46b-36g is a mixed question of fact and law, and, therefore, this court's review of such determination is plenary. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Friezo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Friezo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949700\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/166/#p180\">\n    281 Conn. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%20533\">\n    914 A.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Thus, I must decide whether the trial court's \"conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 181..\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Premarital agreements entered into on or after October 1, 1995, such as the agreement in the present case, are governed by the Connecticut Premarital Agreement Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36a et seq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   See P.A. 95-170, \u00a7\u00a7 10\n   and 11 (act applies to premarital agreements executed on or after October 1, 1995). Under the act, a premarital agreement or amendment thereto is unenforceable \"if the party against whom enforcement\n   is sought proves that: (1) [s]uch party did not execute the agreement voluntarily; or (2) [t]he agreement was unconscionable when it was executed or when enforcement is sought; or (3) [b]efore execution of the agreement, such party was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the amount, character and value of property, financial obligations and income of the other party; or (4) [s]uch party was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel.\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The plaintiff contends, among other things, that the defendant's financial disclosure in connection with the 2008 amendment to the premarital agreement was not fair and reasonable because he did not disclose his 2007 and 2008 income. In response, the defendant argues that he provided the plaintiff with a three year income history, including 2004, 2005, and 2006. He further contends that he generally does not know his exact annual income until he has filed his income tax returns and that, as of July, 2008, he had not filed his 2007 income tax return; therefore, he could not have disclosed his 2007 and 2008 income at the time the parties amended their premarital agreement. Under these circumstances, the defendant claims that his financial disclosure was fair and reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Friezo\n   </em>\n   is our seminal, and only, case addressing what constitutes a fair and reasonable disclosure under \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3).

I am convinced that\n   <em>\n    Beyor\n   </em>\n   was incorrectly decided, and, therefore, I will not apply its reasoning to the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   With this background in mind, I turn to the present case. I begin by noting that\n   what is a fair and reasonable financial disclosure under \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3) depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. It is undisputed in the present case that the defendant did not disclose his 2007 and 2008 income when he and the plaintiff entered into the July, 2008 amendment to the premarital agreement. In light of this, I conclude that the defendant, like the husband in\n   <em>\n    Oldani\n   </em>\n   , failed to make a fair and reasonable disclosure of his income in 2008. In\n   <em>\n    Oldani\n   </em>\n   , the Appellate Court held that the disclosure in question was not fair and reasonable because, although the husband disclosed his interests in certain real estate and the net operating income generated by such real estate-which arguably could provide a general picture of his income-he did not expressly disclose his income, did not provide information on how to calculate his income, and did not disclose all the information necessary to accurately estimate his income. See\n   <em>\n    Oldani\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oldani\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071731\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/132/609/#p615\">\n    132 Conn.App. at 619-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20407\">\n    34 A.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, not only did the defendant fail to disclose his 2007 and 2008 income, but he did not even provide information from which an estimate of his income for those years could be derived. The defendant might\n   argue that an estimated income for 2007 and 2008 could be derived by averaging the historical income data. This argument is unavailing, however, given the fluctuating nature of his income, which varied by nearly 50 percent over the three years disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The defendant argues that he disclosed three years of historical income and that such a disclosure was sufficient to provide the plaintiff with a \"general approximation\" of his income. (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) A disclosure of historical income information, however, does not provide a general approximation of the defendant's\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   I conclude that a fair and reasonable disclosure requires the disclosing party to divulge his or her current income. This is consistent with the purpose of the disclosure requirement. As I noted previously, the purpose of the disclosure requirement \"is to ensure that each party has sufficient knowledge of the other party's financial circumstances to understand the nature of the legal rights being waived. ... In other words, a party cannot know what is being waived unless he or she is privy to all of the relevant facts, in particular, the financial status of the other party.\" (Citation omitted; footnote\n   omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Friezo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Friezo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949700\" index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/166/#p180\">\n    281 Conn. at 186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%20533\">\n    914 A.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Providing historical, rather than current, income information does not provide the party receiving such disclosure with accurate knowledge of the discloser's income at the time the agreement is being executed and, therefore, prevents the receiving party from intelligently waiving his or her statutory\n   rights. Receiving current income information is particularly important in cases, like the present case, in which the receiving party is waiving equitable distribution of property and receiving a right to alimony. The party waiving equitable distribution in exchange for alimony undoubtedly relies on the income disclosure of the opposing party in assessing whether he or she agrees with the terms of the premarital agreement. Moreover, under the facts of the present case, the defendant's disclosure of his 2007 and 2008 income was important given the fluctuating nature of his income. See footnote 34 of this opinion. The defendant's disclosure in connection with the 2008 amendment to the premarital agreement and his testimony at trial revealed that he had variable income. His income for the years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 was $1,249,989, $902,025, $1,687,677, $1,253,766, and $575,266, respectively. Knowledge of such variable income would be necessary for an intelligent waiver of statutory rights, particularly when a party is to receive alimony, and, therefore, disclosure of both historical and current income is necessary for a fair and reasonable disclosure when the discloser's income fluctuates like the defendant's had in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The defendant also argues that he could not have disclosed his 2007 and 2008 income when the parties executed the 2008 amendment because he did not have the tax information for those periods at that time and, thus, was not aware of his precise income for those tax years. This argument is unavailing. First, as the defendant has acknowledged, an exact disclosure of\n   his income is not necessary. Indeed, all that is required for a fair and reasonable financial disclosure is that the defendant provide the plaintiff with \"a general approximation of [his] income, assets and liabilities ....\"\n   <em>\n    Friezo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Friezo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949700\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/166/#p180\">\n    281 Conn. at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"382\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%20533\">\n    914 A.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, he need not wait until his income tax returns are filed in order to make an exact disclosure. He can instead provide an accurate and reasonable estimate of his income. Moreover, there can be no doubt that, by July, 2008, he had some general idea of the income he had received in 2007 and the income he had received during the first half of 2008. Second, at trial, the plaintiff claimed that it was improper for the defendant to value the assets in his financial disclosure as of December 31, 2007, when he had available valuations for those assets that were contemporaneous with the execution of the amendment to the premarital agreement in July, 2008. Although the trial court did not find the use of the six month old valuations fatal, and I express no opinion on that issue, it did note that \"the evidence supports a finding that the [defendant] actually had available virtually all [of] the asset figures on a contemporaneous basis,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    by inference\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    his income figures as well\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, it appears, despite the defendant's contention, that he would have been able to provide income estimates for 2007 and 2008 when the parties amended their premarital agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, the defendant contends that, if he had provided a \"snapshot\" of his 2008 income at the time the parties amended their premarital agreement, and had that snapshot turned out to be substantially higher than his actual 2008 income, the plaintiff would still be challenging the accuracy of his disclosure. Even if that were true, it does not excuse him from making such a disclosure. The defendant had a duty to disclose information that would provide the plaintiff with a general approximation of his income. If, for whatever reason, the disclosure\n   subsequently appeared to the plaintiff to be inconsistent with the defendant's actual 2008 income, and she wanted to challenge the accuracy of such disclosure, that is her prerogative. In such a case, she would carry the burden of establishing that the disclosure was inaccurate\n   when it was made. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (allocating burden of establishing unenforceability of premarital agreement to party against whom its enforcement is sought).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In sum, the defendant did not make a fair and reasonable financial disclosure when the parties executed the 2008 amendment to their 1997 premarital agreement, and I therefore conclude, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-36g (a), that their amended premarital agreement is unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court insofar as the trial court enforced that agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   EVELEIGH, J., with whom ESPINOSA, J., joins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   I agree with and join part I of the majority opinion, which affirms the judgment of the trial court with respect to the award of lump sum alimony to the plaintiff, Marjorie Hornung. I respectfully dissent, however, from part II of the majority opinion, which concludes \"that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the plaintiff.\" Specifically, I would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering the defendant, Robert Hornung, to pay attorney's fees to the plaintiff where it determined that \"to require the [plaintiff], who has minimal\n   earning capacity and the responsibility for the primary care of four minor children age nine through fifteen, three of whom have learning issues, to pay these fees from her portion of the financial award ... would undermine the purposes of [the] same ....\" Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court with respect to the award of attorney's fees to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   I agree with the facts and the procedural history set forth by the majority. Additional facts are set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Contrary to the majority's representation, I can find no example of where this court has employed a purely mathematical calculation to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees. Furthermore, I would conclude that merely analyzing the percentage that the award of attorney's fees represents in the overall financial award is contrary to the mandates of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 46b-82, which require the trial court to examine certain equitable factors in deciding whether to make an award of attorney's fees. Those equitable factors are eviscerated when one attempts to boil down these considerations to a mathematical equation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Before addressing whether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding attorney's fees to the plaintiff in light of its other awards to her, I must address the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiff because the parties' prenuptial agreement (agreement) bars the award of attorney's fees. In response to this claim, the plaintiff asserts that the defendant failed to preserve this claim for review as it relates to the $100,000 trial attorney's fees because he did not assert that the agreement barred the award at trial. Furthermore, the plaintiff asserts that the defendant waived his right to claim that the agreement barred the award of attorney's fees because he entered into stipulations that explicitly allow the plaintiff to apply for attorney's fees. I agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   First, despite the fact that the issue of attorney's fees was addressed at the trial in this matter, the defendant never claimed that the agreement barred the award of attorney's fees. Specifically, the trial court heard testimony relating to counsel fees and an affidavit of fees was submitted as an exhibit. Furthermore, the defendant had already agreed to pay $250,000 of the plaintiff's attorney's fees pendente lite. The defendant never contested the court's authority to award attorney's fees at trial. To the contrary, the defendant's claim that the agreement barred the award of attorney's fees was first raised well after trial, and only in relation to the motion for appellate attorney's fees. \"It is well settled that [o]ur case law and rules of practice generally limit [an appellate] court's review to issues that are distinctly raised at trial.\" (Internal quotation marks\n   omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Netherlands Ins.

Specifically, the trial court concluded that the defendant had waived his right to claim that the agreement barred the award of attorney's fees because he had entered into numerous stipulations allowing for attorney's fees. Specifically, prior to judgment, the defendant entered into a stipulation in which he agreed to pay $250,000 of the plaintiff's attorney's fees and $100,000 of her expert fees. The stipulation also permitted the plaintiff to seek additional counsel fees in the future. The defendant also entered into four separate stipulations providing for payment of the plaintiff's counsel fees in order to induce the plaintiff to sign gift tax returns and joint income tax returns. The trial court properly recognized that this conduct constitutes a waiver of any right to claim that the agreement precluded an award of attorney's fees. It is well established\n   that \"waiver and estoppel are questions of fact\" and that this court \"will not disturb the trial court's findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    New Haven\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Local 884, Council 4, AFSCME, AFL\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CIO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200370\" index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/378/#p388\">\n    237 Conn. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%201350\">\n    677 A.2d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). I would agree with the trial court and conclude that the defendant cannot enter into a stipulation that the plaintiff is allowed to apply for attorney's fees and then later reverse course and assert that the agreement\n   bars the award of any attorney's fees. Although the defendant was allowed to challenge the award of attorney's fees, by entering into these stipulations, the defendant acknowledged that the trial court had authority to award the plaintiff attorney's fees in some circumstances. The defendant was aware of and understood the terms of the stipulations at the time they were presented to the court and by now asking this court to conclude that the agreement bars the award of any attorney's fees, the defendant \"is taking a position clearly inconsistent with his previous position\" and \"would derive an unfair advantage from this change of position.\"\n   <em>\n    Dougan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dougan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775521\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/361/#p374\">\n    301 Conn. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20791\">\n    21 A.3d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).

We are not to substitute our judgment for the trial court, but only to determine if, based on the record before it, the trial court could have reasonably concluded as it did.

Specifically, the majority reasons that \"although the plaintiff's amended financial affidavit showed only $3700 in her bank accounts, she was still receiving $40,000 per month in periodic alimony and child support, and attested to having personal property\n   worth $305,810, a home worth $2.1 million, and other assets worth $79,794.\" First, the majority relies on the plaintiff's home and furnishings as available liquid assets that she could have used to pay her attorney's fees. This position is contrary to our case law. In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682800\" index=\"407\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/46/#p59\">\n    191 Conn. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20578\">\n    463 A.2d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which the majority cites favorably, this court reversed the judgment of the trial court awarding attorney's fees because it concluded that the trial court had improperly found that the defendant had ample liquid assets with which to\n   pay the attorney's fees. Specifically, this court concluded that \"a close inspection of the property disposed of by the judgment discloses that the family home was the only real asset capable of generating the funds to respond to the award of counsel fees. It, however, was not a 'liquid asset' although by our disposition of this appeal, the sale of the family home hereinafter ordered will yield liquid assets for both parties. Under the circumstances, the award of counsel fees to the plaintiff constituted error.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"409\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20578\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Similarly, in the present case, the marital home and the furnishings contained therein were not liquid assets available to the plaintiff to pay her own attorney's fees in the present case. Furthermore, although the plaintiff had other assets totaling $79,794, she also had liabilities of $68,142, not including the attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Second, the majority relies on the $2,082,000 payment due under the agreement. That payment was not available to the plaintiff because it was stayed pending the appeal. Although, as the majority states, the plaintiff could have moved to terminate the stay on that order or the trial court could have, sua sponte, terminated the stay on that order, the trial court was required to award the attorney's fees based on the total assets at the time the award was made. The possibility of terminating the stay is not a reason to consider that payment as liquid funds available to the plaintiff. Furthermore, the fact that the stay on that award was terminated after the award of attorney's fees was made is not relevant to our review of whether the trial court could have reasonably made the award of attorney's fees at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   At the time the trial court made the award of attorney's fees in the present case, the only liquid assets available to the plaintiff was the $40,000 in monthly alimony and child support. The majority fails to acknowledge that, after taxes, the plaintiff's net\n   monthly alimony and child support award was $23,600. In her affidavit, the plaintiff averred that she had $44,332 in monthly expenses and approximately $219,487 in attorney's fees. Accordingly, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that requiring the plaintiff to pay the attorney's fees out of the monthly alimony and child support would have undermined that award. This court has previously concluded that a trial court's award of attorney's fees was proper where \"the [wife] would have been required to [forgo] a portion of the alimony award in order to satisfy her obligations to her attorney, thereby undermining its other orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"687861\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/194/25/\">\n    194 Conn. at 34-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20A.2d%201000\">\n    478 A.2d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Bornemann\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bornemann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"102085\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/245/508/#p544\">\n    245 Conn. 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20A.2d%20978\">\n    752 A.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (\"Of the significant assets that the [wife] received in the distribution, only the shares of stock would have been easily convertible to liquid form; the family residence and automobile were not liquid assets, the first three flights of stock options had not yet been exercised, and the fourth flight was not yet exercisable as of the date of dissolution. Further, the shares of stock owned outright that were awarded to the [wife] were not worth an amount sufficient to cover all of the fees owed. As a result, the court reasonably could have concluded that unless it awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiff, its other financial\n   orders would be undermined, or that the plaintiff lacked the liquidity necessary to enable her to pay her own fees. We conclude, therefore, that the award of attorney's fees did not constitute an abuse of the court's discretion.\"). In comparison, the defendant in the present case had ample liquid assets available to him at the time that the trial court made the award of attorney's fees. Specifically, the defendant had more than $14 million in securities and bonds, which could have been easily converted to liquid form. See\n   <em>\n    Bornemann\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bornemann\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 544-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20A.2d%20978\">\n    752 A.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Despite recognizing that those are the proper considerations, the majority appears to ignore those factors and rely entirely on a mathematical calculation of what percentage of the assets awarded to the plaintiff the attorney's fees represent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The majority further states that \"[w]e have previously held attorney's fees\n   awards amounting to a low portion of the payee's liquid assets to constitute an abuse of discretion, since the payee could easily have paid the fees out of those assets ....\" The majority cites to\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546650\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/32/#p47\">\n    222 Conn. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=608%20A.2d%2079\">\n    608 A.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"540884\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/211/485/#p497\">\n    211 Conn. 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=560%20A.2d%20396\">\n    560 A.2d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), in support of its position.

In the present case, the trial court explicitly determined that failing to award the plaintiff attorney's fees would undermine the other financial awards and pointed to the evidence in the record that supported that finding-namely, the plaintiff's limited earning capacity and her role as the primary caretaker for four minor children, three of whom have learning issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In fact, the evidence in the record supports the award of the attorney's fees on the other equitable factors, as well. First, the parties were married for seventeen years. Second, the trial court found as follows: \"As to the breakdown of the marriage, the [plaintiff] testified at length about the [defendant's] frequent use of inappropriate language and his bizarre behavior, toward her and others, that was both demeaning and sophomorically ... crude. In addition, he frequently mimicked her tendency to stutter when placed in stressful situations. She admitted to a [one year long] affair late in the marriage. That relationship, now long since ended, was not the cause of the breakdown. Evidence supports a finding that the cause for the breakdown is primarily attributable to the [defendant]. It is abundantly clear that right from the beginning, with the execution of the ... agreement, that [the defendant] was not looking for a true marital partner, and has shut the [plaintiff] out both fiscally and emotionally. He is a controlling, emotional bully, who has failed to appreciate [the plaintiff's] true worth as a wife, let alone her contributions. He offers her the minimum, which he believes that he can, in order to preserve the greater bulk of his assets for himself. The [defendant], she said, engaged in frequent, long-winded arguments about his plans, and badgered her to go along with his ideas, such as the ... agreement.

This court has previously noted that '[s]ince the trial court fashioned the other financial awards, it [is] uniquely qualified to determine whether those awards would be undermined by rejecting [a party's] request for counsel fees and expenses. All the awards were made at the same time and were predicated on the assumption that the total of all the awards regardless of the items to which they were apportioned, was reasonable in the light of the respective financial abilities of the parties and the criteria set forth in \u00a7 46b-82.' \" Id., at 387-88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"468\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20721\">\n    999 A.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   This court further reasoned that \"the financial orders of the trial court required the [wife] to pay a share of\n   many expenses, including the medical, day care, summer camp and extracurricular activities of the children, attorney's fees for the guardian ad litem and a portion of her own attorney's fees, including for her appellate counsel. All of the other financial awards, however, clearly required the [husband] to pay a larger portion of the expenses presumably in light of his significantly higher earning capacity. Accordingly, we conclude that the record supports a finding that the order requiring the [husband] to pay a portion of the [wife's] attorney's fees in this case was necessary so as not to undermine the other financial orders.\" Id., at 388,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"469\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20721\">\n    999 A.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the [wife] had liquid assets resulting from the judgment, in reviewing the overall awards, we cannot say that the trial court's order for counsel fees was unreasonable.\" In the present case, although the plaintiff is receiving significant assets as a result of the dissolution of the marriage, the trial court made findings regarding the plaintiff's limited future earning capacity based on her health condition, her role as a primary caregiver to the parties' minor children, and her lack of recent work\n   experience.

They may have no children or four children. The possibilities are endless, and the needs of the potential alimony recipient are unknowable.

Moreover, it is unclear why a court's consideration of the minor children in awarding support to a custodial parent would be improper. It is true that the formula for dividing marital property in the premarital agreement contemplated the children. That does not, however, foreclose consideration of the same factor when support determinations are made. Indeed, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a) requires that the court consider, \"in the case of a parent to whom the custody of minor children has been awarded, the desirability and feasibility of such parent's securing employment.\" In any event, the existence of children seems like an\n    <em>\n     appropriate\n    </em>\n    additional factor for the court to consider in determining the type, amount, and duration of an alimony award, even when such factor is also accounted for in a premarital agreement that governs the division of property.

To illustrate, assume that a marital estate includes an asset that produces significant income. Awarding such an asset to the alimony obligor impacts his or her ability to satisfy an alimony obligation. If, instead, the asset is awarded to the alimony recipient, the asset would provide an income stream from which the recipient could provide for some, or perhaps all, of his or her support and maintenance needs, thereby impacting the necessary amount of alimony. When the parties have executed a premarital agreement, however, and have decided which spouse will receive the income producing asset, not only have they effectuated the property distribution, and consequently limited the trial court's discretion to divide the property, but they have also impacted the alimony obligor's ability to pay alimony and the alimony recipient's needs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The plaintiff submitted a financial affidavit to the trial court, outlining her monthly income and expenses. In that affidavit, she claimed monthly living expenses of $65,444, and, because the trial court did not make any particular findings regarding such expenses, I will accept the plaintiff's financial affidavit as true. Nevertheless, some adjustments to the affidavit are necessary. The plaintiff included what appear to be one time expenses, such as $11,787 for furniture, home furnishings, and home improvements, as well as $3750 for a Bat Mitzvah for one of the children. The affidavit also includes $6559 in monthly expenses arising from property the parties owned in Vermont, which was awarded to the defendant pursuant to the parties' premarital agreement. Removing these items from the plaintiff's monthly expenditures results in expenses totaling $43,348. This figure is consistent with the affidavit the plaintiff submitted in a posttrial proceeding, in which she outlined monthly living expenses totaling $44,332. For ease of calculation, I rounded the plaintiff's monthly support need to $45,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    I note that, even with these adjustments, the plaintiff's monthly expenses are likely overstated. She claims $2712 in monthly medical expenses for both her and the children, and $6846 for the children's monthly expenses, including various extracurricular activities (this figure excludes the Bat Mitzvah expense previously discussed). The defendant, however, was ordered to pay one half of the costs for the children's camps, tutors, lessons, and extracurricular activities, and to provide for the children's health and dental insurance and to pay 60 percent of the unreimbursed medical and dental expenses. For a period of three years, the defendant also must pay the premiums for the plaintiff's continuing health insurance coverage, should she elect to obtain such coverage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    Even if it is assumed that the plaintiff's periodic alimony and expenses remain unchanged, it appears, at first blush, that she will have a support deficit of $5000 a month, or $60,000 a year, for the five years after the lump sum alimony installments end in light of her estimated monthly support need of $45,000 per month and the court's award of $40,000 in monthly periodic alimony and support. A closer examination of her financial affidavit, however, reveals that the $40,000 in monthly periodic alimony will be more than sufficient to cover her support needs when the lump sum alimony installments end. The plaintiff's monthly expenses include approximately $15,755 in expenses relating to the children. See footnote 15 of this opinion. As I previously noted, however, when the lump sum alimony payments end in 2024, the parties' children will have reached the age of majority. See footnote 7 of this opinion. Thus, the periodic alimony and support award of $40,000 per month, if unchanged, will provide the plaintiff with nearly $11,000 more in monthly support than she needs ($45,000 less $15,755 equals $29,245, which is approximately $11,000 less than the $40,000 monthly periodic alimony and support award).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    The plaintiff also argues that the lump sum alimony award is not a functional property distribution because the trial court unequivocally referred to the award as alimony and stated that the purpose of the award was for the support and maintenance of the plaintiff. The majority makes similar arguments. The mere labeling of the award as alimony and finding that the award \"is appropriate to provide for [the] continuing support of the [plaintiff]\" does not necessarily mean that the award was proper and did not function as a property distribution. Instead, the alimony award must\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    be consistent with its purpose-support-and when the alimony award provides approximately $6.9 million more than the plaintiff needs for support, I cannot conclude that it comports with such a purpose.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    I question the extent to which the $40,000 periodic award is insufficient to provide for the\n    <em>\n     plaintiff's\n    </em>\n    needs because her financial affidavit includes numerous expenditures that relate to the children. The affidavit includes the following monthly expenses incurred for the children: restaurant costs ($851), medical, dental, and counseling costs ($949), clothing costs ($2851), personal care costs ($222), nanny and sitter costs ($4036), and lessons and extracurricular costs ($6846, excluding Bat Mitzvah costs). If these costs are subtracted from the plaintiff's expenses, as adjusted in this opinion (approximately $45,000), the plaintiff's monthly support need totals $29,245. Thus, the monthly unallocated alimony and child support award of $40,000 per month would completely provide for the plaintiff's needs and leave approximately $11,000 per month to defray child care costs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    In addition, the lump sum alimony award is nonmodifiable. As a result, the defendant will be unable to modify the obligation as the children attain the age of majority.

See footnotes 12, 13 and 15 of this opinion. In addition, there is no reason to believe that the plaintiff's financial affidavit does not reflect the expense of maintaining her current lifestyle. Surely, no one could reasonably argue that the stated monthly support need, or the support need as adjusted in this opinion, merely covers the\n    <em>\n     bare necessities\n    </em>\n    . Moreover, it is no doubt a truism that $102,500 exceeds both $65,444 and $45,000.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    The majority claims that it \"make[s] no judgment as to the excessiveness or propriety of the alimony award as alimony.\" (Emphasis omitted.)

In light of this requirement, and because, as the majority acknowledges, the trial court made no finding regarding the defendant's earning capacity, the financial orders in the present case must be based on the defendant's actual income. Thus, the\n    <em>\n     reality\n    </em>\n    of the present case is that the trial court ordered an alimony award that exceeds the defendant's income, thereby requiring the defendant to invade his assets to satisfy the alimony and support obligation.

The trial court did not base its orders on such reasoning, and the orders should not be upheld on the basis of such reasoning. That the trial court did not impute income to the defendant evinces that the court concluded that the defendant is reasonably meeting his earning potential and should not be obligated to do better. The fact that, theoretically, the defendant may be able to generate a greater income does not mean that he should have to.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    A recent decision of the Appellate Court is instructive.

Immerman, The CIA in Guatemala: The Foreign Policy of Intervention (1982) p. 102. Of course, in this case, the alimony award has a label. That fact, however, cannot be dispositive. See footnote 14 of this opinion. The label does not change the award's function.

Instead, it states: \"[W]hen a trial court awards a spouse alimony exceeding his or her claimed expenses in the wake of a [premarital] agreement distributing all of the parties' property, the award may still be challenged as\n    <em>\n     excessive alimony\n    </em>\n    , rather than a functional property distribution.

Footnote 30 of the majority opinion. This is just semantics. It seems to me that in a case in which the alimony award exceeds both the recipient's needs and the obligor's income-thereby necessitating the obligor to use assets to satisfy the alimony obligation-it should not matter whether the obligor characterizes the alimony award as excessive alimony or a functional property distribution.

That the majority believes that the legislature must do\n    <em>\n     more\n    </em>\n    in order to prevent trial judges from circumventing premarital agreements is akin to directing those judges to ignore the act altogether.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    The parties disagree on which standard should be applied to review the premarital agreement in the present case. The plaintiff contends that the agreement should be treated as a postnuptial agreement because it was amended during the marriage, and, therefore, the agreement should be subjected to \"special scrutiny\" in accordance with\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776164\" index=\"523\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/691/#p697\">\n     300 Conn. 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 697,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20A.3d%2017\">\n     17 A.3d 17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011). She contends that the same policy concerns present in\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    , which resulted in the adoption of heightened scrutiny for postnuptial agreements, are present in this case as well. On the other hand, the defendant claims that the amended agreement should be treated as a premarital agreement because the act expressly provides for the modification of such agreements during the marriage. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36f (\"[a]fter marriage, a premarital agreement may be amended\"). Thus, the defendant claims, the enforceability of the agreement should be governed by \u00a7 46b-36g, like all premarital agreements. Moreover, the defendant argues that the plain language of \u00a7 46b-36g (a) requires such a conclusion in that it provides that \"[a] premarital agreement\n    <em>\n     or amendment\n    </em>\n    shall not be enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves\" either that such party did not voluntarily enter into the agreement, the agreement was unconscionable, such party was not provided with a fair and reasonable disclosure regarding the property, financial obligations and income of the other party, or such party was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel. (Emphasis added.) Because I have concluded that the premarital agreement in the present case would not survive the scrutiny required by \u00a7 46b-36g, which is less exacting than the scrutiny required by\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    , I need not decide which standard should be applied to a premarital agreement that is amended during the marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    The plaintiff also argues that the defendant has waived the argument that \u00a7 46b-36g, rather than\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    , should govern the enforceability of the agreement. She asserts that the defendant failed to challenge the trial court's application of\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    , and, therefore, he cannot now challenge it on appeal. As the defendant correctly notes, however, he was not aggrieved by the trial court's enforcement of the premarital agreement and, thus, could not appeal the trial court's decision to apply the special scrutiny required for postnuptial agreements in accordance with\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    .

At trial, the plaintiff argued that the defendant's disclosure of his assets was inadequate because he had valued the assets as of December 31, 2007, rather than contemporaneously with the execution of the amendment to the premarital agreement in July, 2008. In addition, she argued that the defendant had the information necessary for such valuation. The trial court agreed that the defendant could have valued the assets as of July, 2008, but nonetheless found the disclosure of the value of the assets to be adequate. The trial court reasoned that \"the evidence supports a finding that the [defendant's] earlier disclosure of [the value of his] assets [was] substantially the same as the financial picture at the time the [amendment] was executed.\" (Emphasis omitted.) The court then went on to state: \"The same, however, cannot be said for the [defendant's] failure to adequately disclose his income for the [eighteen months] preceding the execution of the [amendment] in [July] of 2008.\" I do not read this to be a finding that the defendant's disclosure was inadequate, in the sense that it was not fair and reasonable as required by \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (3), as the plaintiff suggests. Instead, when read in conjunction with the preceding sentence, the trial court's finding was that the defendant's income disclosure was unlike his asset disclosure in that the income disclosure did not provide the plaintiff with a current value of his income, whereas the asset disclosure, despite being based on a six month old valuation, provided a value that was substantially similar to the value of the assets at the time the 2008 amendment was executed. This reading is consistent with the ultimate conclusion of the trial court, namely, that the premarital agreement was enforceable. If the trial court had in fact found that the defendant's financial disclosure was not fair and reasonable, it could not have ultimately enforced the agreement, regardless of whether the court applied the standard set forth in \u00a7 46b-36g or in\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bedrick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776164\" index=\"529\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/691/#p697\">\n     300 Conn. 691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"530\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20A.3d%2017\">\n     17 A.3d 17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    Second,\n    <em>\n     Bauer\n    </em>\n    is inapposite. In that case, the factual finding at issue was that \"[t]he parties agree to split equally the [husband's] ... pension and annuity 403 (b) plans ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Bauer\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bauer\n    </em>\n    , supra, 308 Conn. at 126,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.3d%20950\">\n     60 A.3d 950\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The trial court's orders, however, failed to address these plans.

The trial court subsequently granted the wife's motion for clarification and clarified the ambiguity created by the absence of an order addressing the court's finding that the parties would split the value of the pension and annuity plans. See id., 127-28,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.3d%20950\">\n     60 A.3d 950\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In light of the finding that the husband was to split his pension and annuity plans with the wife, the absence of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    order regarding the plans, and the ambiguity created when the two were considered together, we concluded that the husband was indeed aggrieved by the finding. Id., 135-37,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.3d%20950\">\n     60 A.3d 950\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In the present case, however, even though the finding might arguably be to the defendant's disadvantage, the trial court enforced the premarital agreement. Thus, the defendant was not aggrieved and could not have appealed the trial court's finding. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Seymour\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Seymour\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"652953\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/107/#p110\">\n     262 Conn. 107\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 110-11,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=809%20A.2d%201114\">\n     809 A.2d 1114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002) ; see also footnote 29 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    We noted that such factors may be relevant to whether a party executed the premarital agreement voluntarily or whether the agreement was substantively fair, but they do not affect the adequacy of the disclosure.\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949700\" index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/166/#p180\">\n     281 Conn. at 193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"538\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%20533\">\n     914 A.2d 533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, the timing of the disclosure or the ability of the recipient of the disclosure to understand it may serve as a basis for finding an agreement unenforceable under \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (1) (voluntariness), or \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (2) (unconscionability).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Schedule E income can include real estate rental income, royalties, and income from partnerships or S corporations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    The Appellate Court's reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Beyor\n    </em>\n    is flawed for a number of reasons. First, a premarital agreement is enforceable only when it is entered into voluntarily. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) (1). In\n    <em>\n     McHugh\n    </em>\n    , we noted that, in order for the waivers effectuated by a premarital agreement to be voluntary and knowing, the waiving party must \"be aware of any right that he [or she] possesses prior to a proper waiver of it.\"\n    <em>\n     McHugh\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     McHugh\n    </em>\n    , supra, 181 Conn. at 486,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"539\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20A.2d%208\">\n     436 A.2d 8\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We explained that fair and reasonable disclosure is a prerequisite to a valid agreement precisely because each party must know what is being waived. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20A.2d%208\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Thus, with respect to\n    <em>\n     Beyor\n    </em>\n    , that the wife had waived any right to alimony is of no consequence to the adequacy of the husband's disclosure. Indeed, the fact that the husband did not make a fair disclosure of his income calls into question the validity of the wife's waiver. Second, in\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    , we noted that financial disclosure in this context is a duty to inform, and, accordingly, the focus of the examination should be on the actions of the disclosing party, not on the party to whom disclosure is made. See\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949700\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/166/#p180\">\n     281 Conn. at 192-93\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%20533\">\n     914 A.2d 533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because disclosure is a duty to inform, the fact that the wife in\n    <em>\n     Beyor\n    </em>\n    knew of the significant disparity in her wealth and the husband's wealth misses the mark. The Appellate Court's focus should have been on the husband's disclosure. Of course, if the wife had\n    <em>\n     sufficient\n    </em>\n    , independent knowledge of the husband's income, then the husband would not have had to make a fair and reasonable disclosure of such income. See id., at 188,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%20533\">\n     914 A.2d 533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that majority of jurisdictions require disclosure \"when a party's independent knowledge is insufficient\");\n    <em>\n     Winchester\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     McCue\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753882\" index=\"544\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/91/721/#p729\">\n     91 Conn.App. 721\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 729,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"545\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=882%20A.2d%20143\">\n     882 A.2d 143\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that premarital agreement was enforceable despite omission of parties' income from disclosures because parties possessed independent knowledge of each other's financial situation), cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991394,3991755,3990726\" index=\"546\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/922/\">\n     276 Conn. 922\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"547\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%2091\">\n     888 A.2d 91\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005). It does not appear to me, however, that the Appellate Court's decision was based on the conclusion that the wife had sufficient knowledge of the husband's\n    <em>\n     income\n    </em>\n    , as opposed to his wealth. Third, and finally, the 2006 Schedule E income was a significant portion of the husband's annual income. In his financial disclosure, the husband disclosed a weekly gross income of $4610.\n    <em>\n     Beyor\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Beyor\n    </em>\n    , Conn. Appellate Court Briefs &amp; Appendices, March Term, 2015, Plaintiff's Appendix p. A33. That is $239,720 annually. The undisclosed Schedule E income was $394,048;\n    <em>\n     Beyor\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Beyor\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"548\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20752\">\n     158 Conn.App. at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"549\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20A.3d%20734\">\n     121 A.3d 734\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; approximately 62 percent of the husband's $633,768 annual income in 2006. It strains credulity to suggest that the husband's financial disclosure was fair and reasonable, despite the omission of such a substantial portion of his income.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"34\">\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    This is not to say that, in all instances, a disclosure of historical income data would not constitute a fair and reasonable disclosure of the disclosing party's current income. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    , the parties executed the premarital agreement in November, 1998, but the husband disclosed his 1997 gross income.\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Friezo\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949700\" index=\"550\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/166/#p180\">\n     281 Conn. at 177, 191\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"551\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%20533\">\n     914 A.2d 533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In that case, we did not decide whether the disclosure was fair and reasonable despite the disclosure of past, rather than current, income because the wife did not make such an argument. Nonetheless, I can imagine a set of circumstances in which such a disclosure would be fair and reasonable, such as those in which the disclosing party's income does not materially fluctuate from year to year. That is not this case, however, when one's income has varied significantly. In 2006, the defendant's income increased to nearly $1.7 million from approximately $900,000 the year before. Then, in 2007, his income decreased to approximately $1.25 million. Finally, in 2008, his income had fallen to approximately $575,000. This income range of more than $1 million in just four years is not an immaterial fluctuation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    Neither party has argued that the invalidation of the 2008 amendment on the basis of an inadequate financial disclosure would reinstate the original 1997 premarital agreement.

First, the majority's position is contrary to the statute. The statute does not require, or even suggest, that the trial court should examine what percentage of the total financial picture the attorney's fees represents. Instead, the statute clearly requires the trial court to examine whether the statutory factors support an award of attorney's fees. Second, the majority cannot point to any other case in which this court has used percentages in examining whether an attorney's fees award is appropriate.

I disagree. Instead, I would conclude that the analysis of the equitable factors as it relates to the award of attorney's fees in the present case is an essential component of this opinion. Particularly, in light of the majority's conclusion that it does \"not contend that attorney's fees awards amounting to 4 or 6 percent of a spouse's assets constitute a per se abuse of discretion\"; id; an analysis of the equitable factors in the present case is essential to understanding why the award of attorney's fees amounting to 4 or 6 percent of the spouse's assets is an abuse of discretion in the present case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    The majority analyzed the facts of the present case in light of the equitable factors of \u00a7 46b-82 in part I.

Instead, this court merely stated that the property awarded to the defendant constituted 76 percent of the marital property, but this court then proceeded to engage in an analysis of all of the awards to each party to determine whether they constituted an abuse of discretion and did not rely on mere percentages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-251\">\n    Fourth, although this court did use percentages in discussing an alimony award in\n    <em>\n     Koizim\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Koizim\n    </em>\n    , supra, 181 Conn. at 496,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"562\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20A.2d%201030\">\n     435 A.2d 1030\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , it only did so to address a dispute in the valuation of the award, not whether an alimony award was proper under \u00a7 46b-82.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-252\">\n    Fifth, the Appellate Court also used percentages in addressing a claim that an alimony award was excessive in\n    <em>\n     Pellow\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Pellow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709116\" index=\"563\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/113/122/#p129\">\n     113 Conn.App. 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 128-29,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"564\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=964%20A.2d%201252\">\n     964 A.2d 1252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009). In doing so, the Appellate Court was addressing the issue of whether the defendant was going to have the ability to pay the award, not whether the trial court properly applied the equitable factors. The defendant's ability to pay the attorney's fees in the present case is certainly not an issue, therefore, the use of percentages in\n    <em>\n     Pellow\n    </em>\n    , is inapplicable. Likewise, in\n    <em>\n     Valentine\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Valentine\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415059\" index=\"565\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/799/#p807\">\n     149 Conn.App. 799\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 807,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"566\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20A.3d%20300\">\n     90 A.3d 300\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014), the Appellate Court considered what percentage of the defendant's income the trial court's financial award represented and concluded that the trial court failed to consider whether the defendant would be able to comply with its financial orders. I would not dispute that, when considering whether one party is able to comply with financial orders it is appropriate to consider whether the financial order represents a large majority of his or her income. In the present case, however, the majority relies on percentages as its only analysis of whether the award of attorney's fees was unreasonable in the present case. I would conclude that the majority's use of percentages is not in compliance with our prior case law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
