The plaintiff, Nelson Pena, appeals from the trial court's,\n   <em>\n    Tindill, J.,\n   </em>\n   denial of his motion for attorney's fees to defend the related appeal brought by the defendant, Laura Gladstone. In that related appeal, the defendant has appealed from the order of the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Heller, J.,\n   </em>\n   which requires her to pay $75,000 to the plaintiff for attorney's fees related to past and future legal services rendered in connection with custody and visitation issues involving the parties' minor child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court (1) improperly determined that he had an earning capacity of $200,000 per year, and (2) abused its discretion in denying his motion for appellate attorney's fees. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history, portions of which are set forth in our\n   opinion in the related appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are relevant to this appeal. \"The parties were divorced on August 17, 2010. The defendant was awarded sole legal and physical custody of the parties' minor child in accordance with Article II of a separation agreement executed by the parties. That lengthy and complex section of the agreement, regarding custody and visitation, as well as other parenting considerations, provided the plaintiff with liberal parenting time with\n   the child. Litigation between the parties continued, however, after the entry of the dissolution judgment, and each party filed numerous motions relative to parenting issues. The situation deteriorated to the point where on July 28, 2014, the parties agreed to engage the services of Visitation Solutions to evaluate and facilitate the minor child's visitation with his father. A $3500 retainer was required for the use of this service; the plaintiff was ordered to pay 18 percent of the costs and the defendant was to be responsible for the remaining 82 percent. On May 6, 2014, the plaintiff, alleging the defendant's consistent interference with his relationship with the minor child, filed a motion for modification of legal custody, seeking joint legal custody, along with a motion for attorney's fees [postjudgment] that sought attorney's fees in an 'amount sufficient to prosecute the underlying motion for modification'.... He further alleged that he previously had 'earnings of less than $150,000 per year' and was unemployed as of May 2, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The court heard the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees on July 28, 2014, and issued its memorandum of decision on November 19, 2014. The court noted that the 'parties were before the court on the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees, postjudgment ... in which the plaintiff seeks an award of attorney's fees for counsel to represent him in the parties' continuing dispute over custody and visitation, particularly in prosecuting the plaintiff's motion for modification for joint legal custody.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The court then found the following facts. 'The plaintiff testified that he had been unemployed since May, 2014. He was residing with his parents at the time of the hearing. According to his financial affidavit, the plaintiff has net weekly income of $15, representing residuals for his prior work in television and film. The plaintiff's financial affidavit reflects a total of $2785 in\n   his checking and savings accounts and liabilities totaling $58,139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \" 'According to the affidavit of counsel fees submitted by the plaintiff's counsel, the plaintiff had paid $22,339 and owed $41,261 as of the hearing date. The plaintiff testified that he had not asked his parents for financial assistance to pay his legal bills. There was no evidence that the plaintiff's parents were willing or able to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \" 'The defendant is a managing director of Gladstone Management Corporation, a family company. According to her financial affidavit, her net weekly income from employment is $5569. She had $7742 in her checking account and retirement assets totaling $429,075 as of the hearing date. The defendant reported liabilities of $288,354 on her financial affidavit, $266,450 of which was a loan from the defendant's father for her legal fees in this action. The balance due to the defendant's father had increased by approximately $166,000 since January, 2014. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \" 'There is a significant disparity between the financial resources of the plaintiff and those available to the defendant. In addition to her own earnings and assets, the defendant has a loan facility with her\n   father to fund her legal fees as necessary. The plaintiff does not have a similar line of credit arrangement with his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \" 'If the plaintiff cannot afford an attorney to represent him in postjudgment custody and visitation matters, he may be unable to protect his interests and the best interests of the parties' child.... Where, as here, a minor child is involved, an award of counsel fees may be even more essential to insure that all of the issues are fully and fairly presented to the court. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \" 'The court finds that the attorney's fees and costs sought by the plaintiff are reasonable under the circumstances. An award that includes a retainer for future\n   professional services is also appropriate here in view of the issues relating to the parties' child that are pending before the court.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The court granted the plaintiff's motion and ordered that the defendant pay $75,000 toward the plaintiff's attorney's fees, which payment 'includes a retainer for services to be rendered in the future, to counsel for the plaintiff on or before December 15, 2014.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Pena v.

The defendant appealed the court's award of $75,000 in attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 19, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for attorney's fees to defend the appeal. In his motion, the plaintiff represented that he was unemployed and was not earning income, that he had substantial visitation expenses that he was unable to pay, and that he did not have any assets to enable him to pay counsel fees, transcript fees, and other costs to defend the appeal. On February 23, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Tindill, J.,\n   </em>\n   held a hearing. At that hearing, the plaintiff and the defendant testified and filed their respective, updated financial affidavits. The plaintiff's financial affidavit was dated January 12, 2015, and the defendant's financial affidavit was dated February 23, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff's testimony, which included extensive cross-examination, established that he was continuing to search for employment but had not received any job offers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff acknowledged that his mother\n   allowed him to live with her rent free. He also indicated to the court, however, that he hoped soon to find employment, and the court concluded that he expected to secure employment soon. He told the court that he would accept a salary as low as $45,000 if he was offered a job to get his foot in the door, but he testified that a potential salary or other compensation was never disclosed or discussed during any of his recent job interviews. When asked about his past work in film and television, which was the source of a small amount of residual income in the amount of $15.05 per week, the plaintiff stated that he had acted in small parts on television shows, including Law and Order, and in commercials for McDonald's, Sprite, Eurovision, and Levi's, which had been shown\n   on Spanish television. He did not indicate during his testimony that he was no longer able to obtain work in the entertainment field. Furthermore, he testified that he started receiving unemployment compensation in June or July, 2014, but then he contradicted his earlier testimony by saying that it commenced in September, 2014. He said that he did not know if he had received any retroactive payment for unemployment compensation in September, 2014, although he had lost his job in May, 2014. He advised the court that he previously had earned $90,000 working for major league baseball. The plaintiff also indicated that he was able to charge some of his weekly expenses of $130.25 on his credit card. He testified that his attorney was owed $53,219 and that he did not know if he had paid his attorney in the past two years, but he subsequently admitted that he had used his credit card to pay some of his attorney's fees in the spring or summer of 2014. He testified that he was not paying child support, or any part of the child's medical or child care expenses. He further stated that he had paid 18 percent of the cost of visitation supervision by Visitation Solutions until the end of December, 2014, but none of the\n   guardian ad litem's fees since the date of the dissolution judgment, although the guardian ad litem was still working on the case. The plaintiff defended his lack of financial support for the child by stating the following: \"My child is well taken care of. My ex made a million dollars roughly last year in salary and had a bonus that was from her last financial affidavit of roughly $420,000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On his financial affidavit, the plaintiff claimed a net weekly income of $15.05, a total of $580 in his checking and savings accounts, liabilities totaling $67,815.30, and assets of $24,698.74, which were contained in two IRAs. At the conclusion of the hearing, the plaintiff's attorney requested a $25,000 award of attorney's fees to defend the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant, when called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified only briefly. She indicated that her salary as managing director of Gladstone Management Corporation was $22,333.34 per month, and that she had received a bonus of $422,222 in September, 2014. The defendant also stated that she had dividend and interest income. She was asked no further questions about her financial affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She indicated that she had paid her appellate attorney a full retainer of $10,000 to appeal Judge Heller's decision to award the plaintiff attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendant's financial affidavit reflected a net weekly income of $6143. Her weekly expenses were $5619. 20 and her liabilities were $1,509,553, including an amount of $109,539 owed for her own counsel fees. Her assets were $484,132.74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court rendered judgment and issued its memorandum of decision, which it delivered orally from the bench, on the same\n   date as the hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, prior to issuing its decision, indicated that it had reviewed the transcript of the proceedings before Judge Heller, Judge Heller's decision, and the financial affidavits submitted by the parties dated January 12, 2015, which was the plaintiff's, and February 23, 2015, which was the defendant's. The court further indicated that it had exercised its discretion and inherent power to award an allowance of fees, and it considered the parties' respective financial abilities as well as the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. The court found that the income and earning disparity that Judge Heller had noted continued to exist between the parties. The court noted that the plaintiff was still unemployed and residing with his parents and had a net weekly income of $15.05. It also found that the defendant had a net monthly income of $26,618.86. The court then indicated that it found the plaintiff's testimony, regarding his expenses and available financial resources, not to be credible. It determined that the plaintiff could earn a minimum of $90,000 per year in the field in which he was actively looking for work, and that, given his age, experience, and education level, he had an earning capacity of at least $200,000 per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the basis of its foregoing findings, the court found that the plaintiff \"has the resources or can garner the resources to defend the appeal and will not be deprived\n   of his rights if the court declines to grant [his] motion.\" The court then denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees to defend the appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After appealing, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation, which the trial court denied. Then he filed a motion for review with this court, which motion was granted, but the relief requested was denied. In the same order, however, this court ordered the trial court, sua sponte, to \"articulate the basis for [its] finding that the plaintiff has an earning capacity of $200,000 annually.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response to this court's order, the trial court articulated the basis for its finding that the plaintiff's annual earning capacity is $200,000. In its articulation, the court provided the following additional bases for its decision not to award the plaintiff attorney's fees to defend the appeal. The court found that the plaintiff's testimony regarding his current earnings, monetary and other contributions from his mother, current rent, payments to his attorney, unemployment compensation, and American Express credit card was neither forthcoming nor honest; the information on the plaintiff's sworn financial affidavit regarding his current earnings and expenses was not truthful; and his claimed expenses and financial resources were not credible. The court noted that prior to residing with his mother, the plaintiff had rented a New York City apartment for $2500 per month and had earned an annual salary of $90,000 at his prior job as recently as September, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   doing sales and marketing for major league baseball. The court further found that the plaintiff has a bachelor's degree in finance and a master's degree in business\n   administration. It\n   noted that his testimony as to his salary requirements, compensation discussions, or offers from the companies where he had sought employment was dishonest and that he concealed the amount of potential compensation for such jobs, which constituted a violation of his duty to provide a full and frank disclosure to the court. The court also articulated that the plaintiff has income from past television and film work and continues to be able to do such work. The court found that the plaintiff is in his forties and appears to be in excellent health, and that given the plaintiff's age, level and amount of work experience, job history, educational attainment, and the depth, breadth, and intensity of his job search and networking efforts, he has an annual earning capacity of $200,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We address only the plaintiff's second claim because we conclude that our determination of it is dispositive of this appeal.

The defendant argues that there was no abuse of discretion because the plaintiff failed to provide credible evidence to convince the court by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he was unable to pay appellate attorney's fees. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We begin with our standard of review, which we set forth in the opinion we released today in the related appeal of\n   <em>\n    Pena v.

The plaintiff had the burden to prove what he alleged in his motion: that he was unemployed and not earning income, that he had substantial visitation expenses that he was unable to pay, and that he did not have any assets\n   or other financial resources to enable him to pay attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We presume the court correctly analyzed the law and the facts in rendering its judgment.

Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the court did not determine that the plaintiff had ample liquid assets with which to pay his fees, but rather, in accordance with \u00a7 46b-62, it considered the respective financial resources and abilities of the parties in accordance with the criteria contained in \u00a7 46b-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the court's finding that his earning capacity was $200,000 was the sole basis for\n   the denial of an attorney's fee award, but the court's decision and its articulation list numerous other reasons for its denial of the plaintiff's motion, including his health; his vocational abilities; his level of education; the intensity of his job search efforts; his lack of credibility, including testimony the court deemed evasive as to his job-related inquiries; the level of financial contributions he was getting from his mother; his unemployment compensation; his credit card payments; and his past payments to his attorney. Furthermore, the court does not have to specify each and every criterion it considers in assessing the parties' total financial resources under \u00a7 46b-82.

Although we agree with the plaintiff that there was no support in the record for the court's finding that the plaintiff realistically could be expected to\n   earn $200,000 annually,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   it was harmless error in light of the fact that it was not the only factor that the court expressly considered or may have considered in determining that he had the resources, or could garner the resources, to pay $25,000 in appellate attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Among other factors reflected in the record that the court might reasonably have considered was the fact that although the plaintiff claimed that he owed his attorney $53,219, his attorney continued to represent him, and the defendant already had been ordered by Judge Heller to pay an unspecified $75,000 award of attorney's fees to the plaintiff, which the plaintiff's counsel suggested had a \"90 percent\" chance of being affirmed on appeal. The plaintiff's financial affidavit also revealed nearly $25,000 in two retirement savings\n   accounts, which he testified he had not considered liquidating to pay his attorney's fees because \"[t]hat's all my money.\" He did not testify that these accounts could not be liquidated or borrowed upon. The plaintiff also testified, and the court found, that he had past earnings of $90,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also might reasonably have assumed that the plaintiff-given the optimism he expressed concerning his job search, his flexibility as to salary requirements, and the strength of his efforts in seeking employment-would soon find gainful employment in either the sports marketing or the entertainment field. The court also heard considerable evidence that the plaintiff was contributing nothing to the support of the child and that that burden had become the defendant's exclusively. The defendant also had been voluntarily paying 100 percent of the cost of the visitation evaluator, Visitation Solutions. The defendant's appellate attorney had requested a retainer of $10,000, not $25,000, to take her appeal. The court also might have considered the considerable expenses and liabilities reflected in the defendant's financial affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff further argues that even if the court concluded that he had sufficient financial assets to pay appellate attorney's fees, the court could not properly\n   have concluded that its failure to award him attorney's fees to defend the appeal would not undermine Judge Heller's prior financial order granting him $75,000 in fees.

He notes that but for the appellate stay, the only resource that could be applied to pay for the expense of defending the appeal would be to\n   take some portion of the court's prior $75,000 award, and that shifting a portion of the court's prior award to defend the appeal would impair and diminish the plaintiff's ability to prosecute his motion for modification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This argument is similar to one that was raised in\n   <em>\n    Clougherty v.

The mother appealed, arguing that she lacked ample liquid funds, and that the court had improperly considered the father's substantial child support burden in deciding not to award her additional fees. This court upheld the denial of attorney's fees, concluding that there was no reason why the court could not equitably consider factors other than those enumerated in \u00a7 46b-82 if such factors are appropriate for a just and equitable resolution of the dispute.

In\n   <em>\n    Clougherty,\n   </em>\n   this court further emphasized that the court was not obligated to make any finding as to whether the failure to award additional fees would undermine the court's existing financial orders. \"Furthermore, the court was not obligated to award the plaintiff additional attorney's fees merely because she\n   exhausted [the court's] initial award ... to defend the defendant's motion to modify custody.\" Id., at 878,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20A.3d%20886\">\n    133 A.3d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We iterate that the language of \u00a7 46b-62 permits, but does not require, the awarding of attorney's fees. See\n   <em>\n    Marcus v.

It is clear from the record that the court thought the plaintiff was less than forthcoming\n   about his financial resources. The manner in which he testified, particularly on cross-examination, reasonably could have left the court with the impression\n   that he was concealing or conveniently forgetting financial information. Ultimately, therefore, in light of the court's conclusion that the plaintiff did not provide the court with full and frank disclosure as to his financial situation, he did not meet his burden of proving that it was fair and equitable, in light of all the circumstances, to order the defendant to pay him additional attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 46b-62 to defend the defendant's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On the basis of our review of the full record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiff appellate attorney's fees. The court specifically stated that it considered all of the statutory criteria set forth in the applicable statute, as well as the parties' testimony and financial affidavits. Affording the court every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its decision, we assume that the court relied on evidence relevant to each statutory criterion as it applied to both parties, and not solely on its finding as to the plaintiff's earning capacity. In light of the credible evidence and the court's findings, we conclude that the court properly exercised its wide discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    This court denied the parties' motions to consolidate the two appeals.

These inconsistencies are the result of factual, and significantly, credibility determinations of separate fact finders as to different, albeit similar, motions in which financial abilities were considered seven months apart and determined in light of separate and distinctive factual presentations by the parties. As a result, we cannot say that the apparent inconsistencies in the two decisions render either outcome illogical or unreasonable. In\n    <em>\n     McCarthy v.

This court disagreed and held that the doctrine of the law of the case did not apply because the issue of appellate counsel fees was not an issue requiring a legal ruling, but rather a motion for the exercise of the trial court's discretion, which confers a wide degree of freedom when the same question is presented to different judges of a single district court, particularly when new or overriding circumstances exist.
