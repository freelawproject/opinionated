The defendant appeals, following our grant of certification, from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming both the trial court's judgment granting the state permission to use reasonable physical force to obtain a DNA sample from the defendant and the judgment of conviction rendered following the defendant's refusal to submit to the taking of a blood or other biological sample for DNA analysis in violation of \u00a7 54-102g (g).\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415807\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/485/#p487\">\n    143 Conn.App. 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 487-88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20582\">\n    71 A.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The defendant contends that the Appellate Court: (1) improperly concluded that the trial court had authority to grant the state permission to use reasonable physical force in obtaining a DNA sample from him prior to the 2011 amendment to \u00a7 54-102g that incorporated a provision authorizing the state to use such force; see Public Acts 2011, No. 11-144, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 11-144); and (2) incorrectly determined that \u00a7 54-102g, as applied to the defendant, did not violate his due process rights and the ex post facto clause of the federal constitution. See U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 10. We conclude that the Appellate Court properly resolved both of the defendant's claims and therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. In 1997, following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of four counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a)(4), four counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92, and two counts of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-217c for robberies committed in 1995. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

On December 19, 1997, the trial court sentenced the defendant\n   to fifteen years incarceration to run consecutively with a sentence the defendant was already serving from a prior conviction. The defendant has remained incarcerated since his 1997 convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his brief to this court, the defendant states that on December 8 and 29, 2009, personnel from the Department of Correction (department) instructed him to submit to the taking of a DNA sample pursuant to \u00a7 54-102g (a), but that he refused to comply. On March 17, 2010, department personnel again instructed the defendant and nine other inmates to provide DNA samples in accordance with the statute. The defendant remained steadfast in his refusal to submit to the taking of a DNA sample.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 19, 2010, the state filed a motion in the trial court seeking permission to use reasonable physical force to collect a DNA sample from the defendant and a fellow inmate, Roosevelt Drakes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who had likewise refused to submit a sample. The state cited \u00a7 54-102g as the authority for its motion. The defendant opposed the state's motion, arguing that if he refused to submit a DNA sample for inclusion in the DNA data bank, the only recourse available to the state was to prosecute him pursuant to \u00a7 54-102g (g) for refusal to provide a blood or other biological sample for DNA analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant further\n   argued that he was not required to submit a DNA sample because at the time of his convictions in 1997, General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 54-102g\n   applied only to those persons convicted of certain sex offenses and did not apply to incarcerated felons, such as the defendant, until the legislature amended the statute in 2003. See Public Acts 2003, No. 03-242, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-242). Accordingly, the defendant claimed that requiring him to provide a DNA sample would constitute an added punishment to his original sentence and run afoul of the ex post facto clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2011, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Mullarkey, J.,\n   </em>\n   issued a written memorandum of decision rejecting the defendant's claims and granting the state's motion for permission to use reasonable physical force to collect a DNA sample from the defendant. The trial court determined that submitting to the taking of a DNA sample for the purposes of \u00a7 54-102g was a nonpunitive, regulatory measure that did not affect the defendant's original 1997 sentence and, therefore, that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the state's motion. Likewise, because the trial court determined that \u00a7 54-102g is regulatory in nature, it concluded that the statute did not run awry of the ex post facto clause. Additionally, after examining the text and legislative history of \u00a7 54-102g, the court determined that the statute necessarily included the option of enforcing compliance through reasonable force, because allowing incarcerated felons to simply refuse to provide DNA samples would substantially frustrate the legislature's goal of creating a comprehensive DNA data bank to aid in criminal investigations. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, the defendant was charged via a substitute information with refusal to submit to the taking of a blood or biological sample for DNA analysis in violation\n   of \u00a7 54-102g (g) for his March 17, 2010 refusal. The defendant moved to dismiss the charge and, at a hearing before the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Carbonneau, J.,\n   </em>\n   presented similar arguments to those he previously presented in opposition to the state's motion to use physical force, namely, that application of the statute would violate the ex post facto clause as applied to him. The trial court adopted the reasoning of Judge Mullarkey in his memorandum of decision, concluded that the taking of a DNA sample was not a penalty and denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. Following a bench trial, the defendant was found guilty and sentenced to one year incarceration, consecutive to his existing sentences. The defendant filed a separate appeal to the Appellate Court from the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Appellate Court considered the defendant's consolidated appeals and ultimately upheld both the defendant's conviction and the trial court's grant of the state's motion for permission to use reasonable physical force in obtaining a DNA sample from the defendant.\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415807\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/485/#p487\">\n    143 Conn.App. 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 487-88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20582\">\n    71 A.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant argued that: (1) the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the state's motion; (2) \u00a7 54-102g, as applied to him, violated\n   his due process rights and the ex post facto clause; (3) the legislature, although it had amended \u00a7 54-102g in 2011 to authorize the use of reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample; P.A. 11-144; did not intend that amendment to have retroactive effect; and (4) prior to 2011, \u00a7 54-102g did not authorize the department to use reasonable force.\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 492, 508,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20582\">\n    71 A.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court, largely adopting the reasoning of the trial court's memorandum of decision, concluded that \u00a7 54-102g is regulatory rather than punitive in nature and, therefore, that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the state's motion and that application of the statute to the defendant did not violate his due process rights or contravene the ex post\n   facto clause.

In analyzing the text and history of \u00a7 54-102g, the Appellate Court determined that the statute was not applied retroactively to the defendant and that, as the trial court concluded, the statute authorized the use of reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample from those who refused to willingly submit one. Id., at 507,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20582\">\n    71 A.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We thereafter granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal. See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to addressing the defendant's substantive claims, we provide an overview of the history of the statutory scheme which underlies the defendant's claims. The current revision of \u00a7 54-102g (b) requires DNA samples to be collected from all persons convicted of a felony, among others. When initially enacted in 1994, however, the statute only required the collection of DNA samples from persons convicted of certain sex offenses. Public Acts 1994, No. 94-246, \u00a7 1; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-102g. The statute was further amended in 1999 to extend the DNA collection requirements to individuals who had committed a criminal offense against a victim who was a minor. Public Acts 1999, No. 99-183, \u00a7 1. In 2003, the legislature expanded the scope of the statute to require all incarcerated felons to submit a DNA sample for inclusion in the state DNA data bank. See P.A. 03-242, \u00a7 1. The 2003 amendment broadening the category of those subject to \u00a7 54-102g is the source of the defendant's present appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court properly granted the state's motion for permission to use reasonable physical force as a means of obtaining a sample of the defendant's DNA.\n   <em>\n    State v. Banks,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415807\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/485/#p487\">\n    143 Conn.App. at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20582\">\n    71 A.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant contends that \u00a7 54-102g is penal rather than regulatory in nature and, therefore, that the trial court was without jurisdiction because the defendant was already serving the sentences for his underlying criminal convictions. The state avers that \u00a7 54-102g is not punitive in nature and that the trial court properly had jurisdiction to consider the state's motion given that the court's actions would not affect the defendant's original sentences. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the most fundamental sense, subject matter jurisdiction \"involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is well settled that, in criminal matters, \"[t]he jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates when the sentence is put into effect, and that court may no longer take any action\n   <em>\n    affecting the sentence\n   </em>\n   unless it has been expressly authorized to act.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Aronow,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20748\">\n    319 Conn. 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756-57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20970\">\n    127 A.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    In re Tyriq T.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%2099\">\n    313 Conn. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104-105,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%20494\">\n    96 A.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Our analysis of \u00a7 54-102g is therefore guided by General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z and standard principles of statutory construction. As both the trial court and the Appellate Court observed, \u00a7 54-102g (f) demonstrates that the purpose of the statute is to further the nonpunitive goal of maintaining a DNA data bank to assist in criminal investigations: \"The identification characteristics of the profile resulting from the DNA analysis shall be stored and maintained ... in a DNA data bank and shall be made available only as provided in section 54-102j.\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-102g (f). We agree that the overall purpose of the statute is not to punish those convicted of crimes by requiring them to submit a DNA sample, but to use DNA as a means of aiding law enforcement investigations. See\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. King,\n   </em>\n   ---U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p1966\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1966,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p1966\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\"[L]aw enforcement, the defense bar, and the courts have acknowledged DNA testing's unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty.

For example, the statutory scheme contains provisions regulating: the manner in which DNA samples are collected; General Statutes \u00a7 54-102h ; the manner in which the analysis of DNA samples is to be conducted; General Statutes \u00a7 54-102i ; and the legitimate purposes for which information in the DNA data bank may be used. General Statutes \u00a7 54-102j. Likewise, the statutory scheme contains provisions that: outline penalties for misuse of information in the DNA data bank; General Statutes \u00a7 54-102k ; provide for the destruction of DNA data bank information upon a person's exoneration; General Statutes \u00a7 54-102l ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   and create a DNA Data Bank Oversight Panel charged with safeguarding the information in the DNA data bank and the privacy of individuals registered therein. General Statutes \u00a7 54-102m. All of these provisions further the regulatory purpose and ensure that the DNA data bank is used only in accordance with its proper purpose of assisting in criminal investigations. Notably, all fifty states have\n   enacted statutes similar to Connecticut's that require convicted felons to submit a DNA sample in order to aid in criminal investigations.\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Banks,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415807\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/485/#p487\">\n    143 Conn.App. at 498-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20582\">\n    71 A.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the Appellate Court's determination that a statutory provision that subjects a person to prosecution for noncompliance does not automatically convert an otherwise regulatory statutory scheme into a penal statute. At the time the defendant in the present case was charged, \u00a7 54-102g (g) provided that any person who failed to submit to the taking of a DNA sample was guilty of a class A misdemeanor. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Megan's Law contains several provisions similar to \u00a7 54-102g (g) whereby a person who is required to register as a sex offender,\n   yet fails to do so, is guilty of a class D felony. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-251(e), 54-252(d), 54-253(e) and 54-254(b). In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The penalty for failure to submit a DNA sample is no greater than the penalty for failure to register as a sex offender and the defendant offers no reason as to why that penalty is any more burdensome in this context. Accordingly, consistent with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Kelly,\n   </em>\n   the penalty provision of \u00a7 54-102g (g) does not render the entire statutory scheme punitive in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our examination of the other\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors does not lead us to the conclusion that \u00a7 54-102g is punitive in fact. We are unaware of any tradition that considers the submission of a DNA sample to be a historically recognized punishment and the defendant offers no support for such a proposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, requiring convicted felons to submit to the taking of a DNA sample in no way furthers the retributive or deterrent goals of punishment for their underlying crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The purpose of collecting DNA samples is not to punish felons for their underlying crimes or to deter future criminals, but to bolster the usefulness of the DNA data bank in criminal investigations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statutory scheme furthers this purpose by only imposing a minimal inconvenience on those who must submit DNA samples and thereafter safeguards the interests of those in the data bank via the DNA Data Bank Oversight Panel and the destruction of DNA records upon exoneration. The goals expressed in the statute and the operative statutory mechanisms by which they are to be carried out are inconsistent with the goals of punishment. We therefore\n   conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that \u00a7 54-102g is not punitive in fact under the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez.\n   </em>\n   As the statute is neither punitive in law or in fact and therefore does not affect the defendant's original sentences, the Appellate Court was correct in its conclusion that the trial court properly had subject matter jurisdiction over the state's motion seeking permission to use reasonable physical force to obtain a DNA sample from the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although the trial court was vested with jurisdiction to consider the state's motion, we must next determine whether the trial court properly granted the state's motion for permission to use reasonable physical force. At the time of the state's motion, \u00a7 54-102g contained no provisions explicitly outlining the remedies available\n   to the department should an incarcerated felon refuse to willingly submit to the taking of a DNA sample. The legislature subsequently amended the statute to specifically allow department personnel to use reasonable force to obtain samples from those who refuse to do so. See P.A. 11-144. Thus, we must determine whether, prior to the legislature's amendment, it was permissible for the trial court to authorize the state to use reasonable physical force to obtain a sample of the defendant's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its memorandum of decision on the state's motion, the trial court initially concluded that the plain meaning of \u00a7 54-102g is clear in that the DNA sample requirement is mandatory. The court observed, however, that at that point in time, the statute did not expressly provide for the use of reasonable force in the event of an individual's refusal to submit a sample. The defendant argued that the statute's silence evinced an inability to implement force as a means of obtaining the sample whereas the state argued that if the use of reasonable force were not permissible then the entire purpose of the statute would be rendered meaningless by the ability of inmates to refuse sampling. Determining that both interpretations were plausible, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 54-102g is ambiguous within the meaning of \u00a7 1-2z and proceeded to review the relevant legislative history, which provided no clarity on the use of reasonable force in this context. The trial court ultimately determined that the use of reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample was inherent in the statute because: (1) the legislature's silence on the topic could not be construed as evidence of legislative intent to the contrary; (2) it was department policy to seek a court order authorizing reasonable force in the event of an individual's refusal and the legislature had not addressed that question despite making interim revisions to the statute; and (3) the overall purpose of the statute would be substantially\n   frustrated otherwise. Accordingly, the trial court granted the state's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the department's ability to use reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample is implicit in the statute as its fundamental purpose would be subverted otherwise.\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal before this court, the defendant argues that the Appellate Court erred in its interpretation of the statute, and that, prior to its 2011 amendment, \u00a7 54-102g contained no authority, implicit or otherwise, to use reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample. The state argues\n   in response that the Appellate Court properly upheld the trial court's reading of the statute and that to hold otherwise would severely undercut the legislature's goals in enacting \u00a7 54-102g. We disagree with the defendant's argument and conclude that the Appellate Court correctly upheld the trial court's interpretation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As the defendant's claim presents us with a question of statutory interpretation, we are guided by \u00a7 1-2z and the standard precepts of statutory construction.

More tellingly, the objective at the heart of \u00a7 54-102g is the DNA data bank, the creation and efficacy of which would be substantially impeded without the collection of DNA samples from those persons covered by the statute. Thus, the submission of DNA samples by convicted felons is certainly a matter of substance rather than one of mere convenience, as fulfillment of the statute's goals would be utterly hindered by an individual's refusal to submit a DNA sample. Although the plain language of the statute clearly suggests that \u00a7 54-102g imposes a mandatory obligation on an individual to submit to the taking of a DNA sample, the mandatory language of the statute does not address the crux of the defendant's claim, namely whether the statute authorizes the use of reasonable force to obtain a sample from an unwilling individual.

We agree with the Appellate Court's determination that, prior to the 2011 amendment, the use of reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample from an unwilling individual was \"inherent\" in \u00a7 54-102g.

Although, as the defendant observes,\n   \u00a7 54-102g (g) subjects a person to further criminal prosecution for refusal to submit a DNA sample, such prosecution does not, as the defendant's case itself demonstrates, remedy the fact that the ultimate objective of \u00a7 54-102g has been thwarted. For the statute to be effective, it must necessarily allow for the department to use reasonable force in those instances where a person required to submit to the taking of a DNA\n   sample refuses to do so. See\n   <em>\n    Rendelman v. Scott,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Fed.%20Appx.%20309\">\n    378 Fed.Appx. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313 (4th Cir.2010) (\"[T]he [s]tate's right to obtain [a] DNA sample from designated inmates must necessarily carry with it the right to use a reasonable degree of force that is sufficient to ensure compliance. Otherwise, the [s]tate's right can be rendered meaningless by an inmate who refuses to grant permission....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Furthermore, at the time of the state's motion, the department had a policy in place that when an inmate subject to \u00a7 54-102g refused to provide a DNA sample, department personnel were to direct the inmate to complete a \"DNA Advisement/Refusal Form\" (refusal form) that informed the inmate that refusal to submit a sample pursuant to the statute was a prosecutable offense. See Department of Correction, Felony DNA Policy (October 1, 2010), available at www.ct.gov/doc/lib/doc/pdf/PolicyDNAFelony.pdf (last visited May 6, 2016). In its memorandum of decision, the trial court observed that the refusal form also advised an inmate that if the inmate continued to refuse to provide a sample, the department could seek a court order to use reasonable force in order to ensure compliance with the statute. The court noted that, despite the existence of such a policy, the legislature had not taken any action in subsequent amendments to disavow the state's policy of seeking the authorization of reasonable force should an individual refuse to submit to sampling.

Indeed, the legislature's 2011 amendment took the opposite course of action by explicitly amending the statute to permit the department to use reasonable force in those cases where an individual refuses to comply with the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, we agree with the conclusions of the Appellate Court. Given the statute's mandatory nature, its overall goals and objectives, and the legislature's subsequent amendment to the statute, it was proper for the trial court to grant the state's motion seeking permission to use reasonable physical force to obtain a DNA sample from the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We next address the defendant's claim that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that the application of \u00a7 54-102g to the defendant did not run afoul of the ex post facto clause of the federal constitution. The defendant suggests that, because at the time of his underlying robbery related convictions in 1997, the statute applied only to those convicted of certain sex offenses, the requirement imposed by the 2003 amendment to \u00a7 54-102g that all convicted felons submit to the taking of a DNA sample violates the ex post facto clause and the defendant's due process rights. The state counters that the defendant's claim must fail due to the fact that providing a DNA sample is not a punitive sanction and therefore it does not contravene the ex post facto clause or the defendant's due process rights. We agree with the state that \u00a7 54-102g does not violate the federal constitution's bar on ex post facto laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The constitution of the United States, article one, \u00a7 10, provides in relevant part that \"[n]o State shall ... pass any ... ex post facto Law....\" A law may be considered to violate the ex post facto clause if it \"punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; which makes more\n   burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, or which deprives one charged with [a] crime of any defense available according to law at the\n   time when the act was committed....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dobbert v.

The trial court rejected the defendant's claim on the ground that \u00a7 54-102g is not a penal statute and therefore does not fall within the purview of the ex post facto clause. When the defendant was subsequently prosecuted for violating \u00a7 54-102g, the defendant moved to dismiss on the basis of the ex post facto clause and the trial court denied the motion on the basis of the same reasoning it relied on in granting the state's previous motion to use reasonable physical force. On appeal, the Appellate Court concluded\n   that its determination that the statute was regulatory rather than punitive foreclosed the defendant's ex post facto claim and it therefore affirmed the trial court's judgments.\n   <em>\n    State v.

See General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 54-102g (a). Thus, at the time the defendant was convicted of his underlying offenses in 1997, he was not required to submit to the taking of a DNA sample for inclusion in the DNA data bank. The 2003 amendment, however, broadened the scope of the statute to include all persons convicted of a felony-a group that includes the defendant-to submit a biological sample for the purposes of the statute. See P.A. 03-242, \u00a7 1. Although this factual scenario would seemingly implicate the ex post facto clause, as we already extensively discussed in part I A of this opinion, \u00a7 54-102g is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a penal statute.

Courts have not required strict compliance with statutes that relate to a matter of convenience rather than substance when they are directed at public officials because, unlike private persons, public officials ordinarily are not acting on their own behalf, but for the benefit of the public, and it would be unfair to hold members of the public responsible for acts and omissions over which they had no control.

Accordingly, I would conclude that any substantive statute that requires a private party to perform or to refrain from some act in order to assert his or her own rights or to protect the substantive rights of other persons is mandatory, at least in the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary. Indeed, even\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   requirements directed at private parties have generally been\n   considered mandatory,\n   in the sense that they must be complied with in the absence of waiver or consent by the opposing party. See footnote 6 of this concurring opinion. Thus, I do not believe that in the present case we are required to consider whether the requirement of General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54-102g (a) that \"[a]ny person who has been convicted of a ... felony ... shall, prior to release from custody and at such time as the [C]ommissioner [of Correction] may specify, submit to the taking of a blood or other biological sample for DNA ... analysis,\" is, as a matter of legislative intent, mandatory or directory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In my view, the statute is mandatory because it uses the term \"shall\" and is directed at a private party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   When a party has failed to comply with a mandatory statute, the only questions that the court should address are whether the mandatory requirement is subject to\n   waiver and, if so, whether it has been waived.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

With respect to statutes vesting power in public officials, the term \"mandatory\" is used to describe provisions with which the public official must strictly comply, as distinguished from \"directory\" provisions, which have\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    obligatory force. In contrast, with respect to statutes placing time limitations on\n    <em>\n     private\n    </em>\n    parties,\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    such statutes are mandatory in the sense that the party must strictly comply with them, but the failure to comply strictly with a nonjurisdictional statute is fatal\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    in the absence of waiver, consent or equitable excuse. A comprehensive review of all of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Connecticut cases involving these distinctions is beyond the scope of this concurring opinion. Suffice it to say, however, that, as this court acknowledged in\n    <em>\n     Williams,\n    </em>\n    our jurisprudence in this area has not always been entirely clear or consistent. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Statewide Grievance Committee v. Rozbicki,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"540911\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/211/232/#p240\">\n     211 Conn. 232\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 240-43,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=558%20A.2d%20986\">\n     558 A.2d 986\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1989) (concluding that limitation on time within which subcommittee of Statewide Grievance Committee, which is public body, must conclude hearings and render proposed decision was\n    <em>\n     mandatory,\n    </em>\n    which ordinarily would mean that noncompliance would invalidate any further proceedings, but ultimately concluding that noncompliance did\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    deprive trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over presentment proceeding).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    I do not agree that the statutory requirement that an employer use a form approved by the commissioner is directory, i.e., that it constitutes \"a mere direction or instruction of no obligatory force, and involving no invalidating consequence for its disregard....\" Black's Law Dictionary (4th Ed.1968). First, I would conclude that the mandatory/directory distinction properly applies only to procedural requirements directed at public officials, and \u00a7 31-71e (2) is not directed at a public official, but requires the employer to use a form approved by the commissioner. Second, the court's conclusion in\n    <em>\n     Weems\n    </em>\n    renders the statutory language entirely superfluous and essentially allows an employer to determine for itself whether a written authorization to withhold wages complies with substantive statutory requirements that are intended to protect employees, a result that the legislature could not have contemplated. Accordingly, I believe that the sole questions that the court should have addressed in\n    <em>\n     Weems\n    </em>\n    were whether the requirement that the employer use a form approved by the commissioner was waivable and, if so, whether the plaintiffs had waived it. I express no opinion on those questions here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    I note that the plain language of General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54-102g (a) clearly\n    <em>\n     requires\n    </em>\n    a defendant to submit a blood or other biological sample for DNA analysis, and does not merely authorize or permit him to do so. Compare\n    <em>\n     C.R. Klewin Northeast, LLC v. Fleming,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956733\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/250/#p262\">\n     284 Conn. 250\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 262-64,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=932%20A.2d%201053\">\n     932 A.2d 1053\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007) (statute providing that \"[s]uch certificate [of authorization by the governor to settle a disputed claim by or against the state] shall constitute sufficient authority to such officer or department or agency to pay or receive the amount therein specified in full settlement of such claim\" did not require officer or department to pay upon receipt of authorization, but merely authorized payment [emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ). I further note that the question of whether a statute is mandatory, i.e., it\n    <em>\n     requires\n    </em>\n    certain conduct, or\n    <em>\n     permissive,\n    </em>\n    i.e., it\n    <em>\n     authorizes\n    </em>\n    certain conduct, is different than the question of whether a statute is mandatory or\n    <em>\n     directory,\n    </em>\n    i.e., of no obligatory force.
