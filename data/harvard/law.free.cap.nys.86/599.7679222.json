It is true that the language of the last clause of the section refers strictly to cases of appeals from judgments only, but, in view of the general character of the legislation, and of the fact that all the reasons which suggest the propriety of the judge directing the filing of the printed papers in the case of an appeal from a judgment apply with equal force to all the instances in which the appeal is founded upon a case prepared and settled, it is evident that the intention was that in all such cases the judge who tried the case should direct the printed papers to be filed with the clerk of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The motion should therefore be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
