The attorneys have apparently regarded the unsigned opinion of the learned justice at Special Term as a decision, and upon that alone the clerk has entered the judgment which has been appealed from. The opinion, after a lengthy discussion of the facts and law, concludes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-19\">\u201cIf I am correct in the conclusion reached, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded in his complaint and to a permanent injunction restraining the municipality from enforcing the tax levied. Judgment is granted accordingly, with costs.\u201d 81 N. Y. Supp. 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-20\">This is an action where the costs are in the discretion of the court, and the section of the Code alluded to provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-21\">\u201cIn an action where the costs are in the discretion of the court the decision or report must award or deny costs; and if it awards costs it must designate the party to whom the costs to be taxed are awarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-22\">Even if the opinion could properly be regarded as a decision, the clause quoted therefrom, which is all there is touching the question of costs, shows that there has been no compliance with this provision of the Code, and that the court has not designated the party to whom the costs to be taxed are awarded. We think, however, that the opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ion cannot stand in the place of the formal decision required by the Code. It is apparent it was not intended as such, and, if it was intended by the justice as a \u201cshort decision,\u201d he would undoubtedly have signed it, and he would have inserted therein proper directions concerning the entry of the judgment, and in relation to costs. As it is, there has been no compliance with the section referred to as it stood at the time of the trial, which was before the amendment thereto made by Laws 1903, p. 237, c. 85, and which section required the decision to \u201cstate separately the facts found and the conclusions of law,\u201d or to state \u201cconcisely the grounds upon which the issues have been decided,\u201d and in either case \u201cto direct the judgment to be entered therein.\u201d The judgment therefore has been entered without any decision upon which to base it. The case has been tried, but, so far as this record shows, has not been decided. It is true that the justice has expressed the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded in the complaint, but on that opinion a formal decision should have been prepared, as required by the Code, as a foundation for the judgment. The section of the Code cited requires that the decision, when filed, shall form part of the judgment roll, and the stipulation annexed to the record is that it contains a true copy of the judgment roll. No decision being found therein, we may assume that none has been filed, and that the judgment, so far as this record shows, has been wrongly entered. There are numerous authorities to the effect that, in a situation like this, the appeal is not in a condition to be heard upon the merits. Hall v. Beston, 13 App. Div. 116, 43 N. Y.

E. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">No motion having been made to vacate the judgment for want of a decision, we must reverse it, and will do so without costs to either party, and remit the case to the Special Term for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Judgment reversed, without costs, and case remitted to Special Term for decision. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
