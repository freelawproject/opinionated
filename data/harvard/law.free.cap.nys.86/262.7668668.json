Thereupon the defendant moved for dismissal for failure to prove a cause of action, which motion was denied, and erroneously, as the meager testimony of the plaintiff was not sufficiently eked out by the presumptions attaching to the production of the notes on the trial to establish a cause of action. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">DAVIS, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b283-7\">FREEDMAN, P.
