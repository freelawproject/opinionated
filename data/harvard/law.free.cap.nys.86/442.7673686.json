Between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock in the evening on the 20th day of November,. 1901, a south-bound car of the defendant on Second avenue collided with a vehicle passing westerly on Thirty-Second street across the track upon which plaintiff was riding, precipitating him to the street, and inflicting the injuries of which he complains. The vehicle was a double dumping truck belonging to the firm of Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Daly, and the driver was in their employ. A short time before the accident the plaintiff and other boys were playing in the vicinity of Thirtieth street and Third avenue, and, observing the loaded truck passing easterly on Thirtieth street to the dumping ground at the East river, they asked the driver- for a ride. He stopped and let two of the boys on, and informed the others that, if they would follow, they might ride when he unloaded the truck. Pursuant to this suggestion, the plaintiff and others followed, and when the truck was unloaded the driver permitted them to get aboard; and the plaintiff climbed onto the seat in front, to the driver\u2019s right. The truck then proceeded back through Thirtieth street, up First avenue, and over Thirty-Second street, with the horses on a trot. Evidence was given \" on the part of the plaintiff tending to show that when the horses were passing the easterly curb line of Second avenue the car had reached a point about 100 feet north of the northerly crosswalk, or in the middle of the block, and its speed is variously described as \u201cfast,\u201d \u201crapidly,\u201d and \u201cvery rapidly.\u201d The driver was in a position to observe the car, but there is no direct evidence as to whether he looked or discovered its approach. The evidence indicates that at this time he was in the act of urging his horses with the lines. The evidence is ample to justify, a finding on the part of the jury that the truck continued on at the same or increased speed, and that the car continued with unabated speed\u2014the motorman making no effort to stop\u2014and struck the rear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>end of the wagon after the horses and forward end of the wagon had passed over the track. The crash of the collision was so loud that it was heard by a person in the corner drug \u00a7tore, over 20 feet from the front of the store; and witnesses say that the force of the collision threw the truck over against the elevated pillar in the middle of the street, to the west of the track. Evidence was given on the part of. the defendant tending to show that the horses were proceeding very rapidly, and on a gallop. We are not concerned with the question whether the driver of the truck was negligent, for it does not appear that the plaintiff was in any manner responsible for the conduct of the driver, and the negligence of the latter could not be imputed to him, and would not defeat a recovery. Morris v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 63 App. Div. 78, 71 N. Y. Supp. 321; Brennan v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 60 App. Div. 264, 69 N. Y. Supp. 1025. Nor can it be said that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, as matter of law. He was only nine years of age, and the standard for judging his conduct is not the care that would be exercised by an adult, but only that of one of his age, of courage, intelligence, and ordinary prudence. Lafferty v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 85 App. Div. 592, 83 N. Y. Supp. 405, affirmed in 177 N. Y.-, 68 N. E. 1118. It does not appear that he said anything to the driver, or drew his attention to the car. Whether he should have done so, or should have attempted to jump from the high seat, which would have been perilous in these circumstances, was a question for the jury. Hoag v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 111 N. Y. 199, 18 N. E. 648; Kettle v. Turl, 162 N. Y. 258, 56 N. E. 626. Moreover, there was evidence from which it might fairly be inferred that at this crossing, where the rights of the truck and of the street car were equal, the truck reached the track in time to pass in safety if the motorman had had the car under control, as was his duty; and in such circumstances it cannot be said, as matter of law, that the plaintiff, in view of his age, was not justified in assuming either that the driver was aware of the approach of the car,- or that the truck would pass in safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">We have examined the evidence concerning the injuries sustained by the plaintiff, and are of opinion that the verdict is not excessive. The other expeptions to which our attention has been drawn have been considered, but we are of opinion that they present no error prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">It follows that the judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">VAN BRUNT, P. J\u201e and O\u2019BRIEN and McLAUGHLIN, JJ\u201e concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-10\">INGRAHAM, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AtHT\">I do not concur in the affirmance of this judgment, as I do not think that the evidence is sufficient to justify a finding that the defendant was negligent. So far as appears, the truck upon which the plaintiff was riding drove in front of the car when the car was but a short distance from the truck, and there is nothing to show that the motorman could have stopped the car in tim\u00e9 to avoid the collision. I think it is quite apparent that there is nothing to show that the motorman did not, as soon as it was apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>that the truck would cross in front of the car, do all that he could to avoid the accident, and nothing to show that the collision was not solely caused by the action of the driver, without fault of the defendant. The fact that the truck was at the easterly curb line at Second avenue when the car had reached a point about ioo feet north of the street would not justify a finding of negligence, as there was nothing then to indicate that the driver of the truck intended to cross in front of the car, instead of waiting, as he should have done, until the car had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"AyT0\">I think the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
