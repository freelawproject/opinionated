But this view is impossible in light of the allegation that the defendant spoke maliciously, and meant by the language used to charge the plaintiff with keeping a house of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The defendant further argues that the case is like Brown v. Moore, 90 Hun, 169, 35 N. Y. Supp. 736, where the complaint averred the following words, used in the presence of a third person: \u201cWhat are you? You worked as a cook in Martin Brown\u2019s low hotel. Any one that worked there ain\u2019t much, and I can prove it; and I dare you to arrest meand then followed an innuendo' that the defendant, by the words used, mearit that the plaintiff was a common prostitute, and of bad character. In sustaining a judgment of nonsuit the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">\u201cWe meet upon this appeal the simple question whether the words spoken imputed unchastity to the plaintiff, and whether the words used could be fairly construed in that direction by the jury, even with an innuendo averring that the intent was to charge her with being a prostitute. Innuendoes cannot extend the meaning or words beyond what is justified by the words themselves and the extrinsic facts with which they are connected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The difference between that case and this is obvious. There the words did not clearly state nor warrant the meaning that the plaintiff was guilty of unchastity, a charge slanderous per se. Here the language is specific and unequivocal: \u201cKeeping a house of prostitution\u201d is an offense slanderous per se to charge against a person. 18 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d Ed.) 900, and New York decisions there cited, including Wright v. Paige, 42 N. Y. 581. The only question here is whether the defendant used the words in way of friendly warning or maliciously and with intent to repeat and renew the charge already made elsewhere and by others. A charge may be made by assertions as to reports (Powers v. Skinner, 1 Wend. 451), or, as said by Hatch, J., in Byrnes v. Mathews, 12 N. Y. St. Rep. 74, 80, affirmed 16 N. Y. St. Rep. 993:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">\u201cThe assertion of a libel, either by insinuation, irony, question, or allusion, is the same as if asserted directly in terms. Folkhard\u2019s Starkie on Slander and Libel, 181 and 183. Gibson v. Williams, 4 Wend. 320.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">So, in O\u2019Shaughnessy v. Morning Journal Ass\u2019n, 71 Hun, 49, 24 N. Y. Supp. 610, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-12\">\u201cThe repetition of injurious words as having been spoken by another is a libelous publication as much so, if maliciously published, as if the direct charge had been made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">We therefore think the complaint was sufficient, and that the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with leave to the defendant to answer upon payment of the costs of the demurrer and of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, with leave to the defendant to answer upon payment of the costs of the demurrer and of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
