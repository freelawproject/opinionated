Defendants contradicted plaintiff\u2019s witness Thornton in many essential respects, but this court, in considering the legal question here submitted, must accept the facts as testified to by plaintiff\u2019s witness. \u201cIt is the general rule that, after the dissolution of a partnership, neither of the parties can give notes or accept bills so as to bind the other partners, even when it is done for the purpose of providing for a debt due from the former firm. * * * There is no doubt that where the business is continued by one partner in the firm name after the dissolution of the firm, or-debts are contracted by him with persons who had previous dealings with the firm, all the members of the former firm are liable, in the absence of notice of such dissolution.\u201d Morrison v. Perry, 11 Plun, 33. As the facts in this case show that Thornton had dealings with the firm during its existence, and continued them after the dissolution, without notice of the latter fact, the defendants are liable upon said note.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Nor can the defendants be heard to say that their partnership was fraudulently concocted, and the plaintiff participated in the fraud, because the finding of the court below must be held to have exonerated Thornton, and defendants cannot now be heard to set up their own fraud as a defense'to the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
