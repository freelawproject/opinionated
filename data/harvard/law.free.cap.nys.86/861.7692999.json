The defendant was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $100, or, in default of payment, to imprisonment for <em>20 </em>days. The defendant kept a stable, and the offense proved was that horses therein stamped upon the floor throughout the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">I am of opinion that the judgment of conviction must be reversed for the reason that the section does not apply. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-15\">\u201cNo person owning, occupying or having charge of any stable or other premises, shall keep or allow therein or thereon any dog or other animal which shall by noise disturb the quiet or repose of any person therein or in the vicinity, to the detriment of the life or health of any human being.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">It is to be noted that the ordinance is made first applicable to stables. The words \u201cother premises\u201d must be construed with reference to the word \u201cstable,\u201d for reasons which, being hereinafter given, need not now be stated. Stables are peculiarly for the keep of horses, and almost exclusively so in large cities. If this ordinance, in terms applicable to stables, was intended to apply to horses, why did it not so provide, either in comprehensive general phrase or in specific terms? On the contrary, it primarily prohibits in stables or like places the keep or sufferance of dogs. This specification makes for the exclusion of horses. The offense proved is not within the purview of the ordinance, unless the words \u201cor other animal\u201d apply to horses. I think that the rule, \u201cGeneri per speciem derogatur,\u201d applies. Of course, if the ordinance had simply read \u201canimal,\u201d then horses would have been within its purview, but, when it reads \u201cdog or other animal,\u201d these general words following the specific term must be defined and limited by it. So that the expression \u201cother animal,\u201d used after \u201cdog,\u201d must be read as applying to animals ejusdem generis. See Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, \u00a7 405; Sutherland on Statutory Construction, \u00a7 268, where a curious and apt decision per Bayley, J., in Ex parte Hill, 3 C. &amp; P. 225, is cited; Chegaray v. Mayor, 13 N. Y. 220, 229; People ex rel. Davidson v. Gilon, 126 N. Y. 147, 156, 27 N. E. 282; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Blaschko v. Wurster, 156 N. Y. 437, 443, 51 N. E. 303. I think, then, that the ordinance is aimed at the keep of dogs in stables or like places, which by their noise (e. g., howls, baying, or barking) disturb quiet or repose, to the detriment of life or health, or of such other animals, for whose keep stables are not primarily provided, as by their noise do the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The judgment of conviction should be reversed, and the proceeding dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
