Trial\u2014Directing Verdict.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-9\">In an action for wages, where there was some evidence to sustain plaintiff\u2019s claim, the case should have been submitted to the jury, even though the trial justice was of the opinion that a verdict for plaintiff should be set aside.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, First District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-11\">Action by Patrick McCrystal against Mary O\u2019Neill. From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals. Reversed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b104-12\">Argued before FREEDMAN, P.

O\u2019Neill had been present once when John spoke of the dollar, and had promised it would be paid. It was not so clear, upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, that the defendant, if any one, was the promisor, particularly as he said he was engaged by James O\u2019Neill; but there was enough to submit to the jury, even if the learned justice were of opinion that any verdict for the plaintiff should be set aside (Pierce v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 21 App. Div. 427, 47 N. Y. Supp. 540), and the judgment of dismissal must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-18\">DAVIS, J. concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b104-19\">FREEDMAN, P. J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was sufficient to carry the case to the jury, and it should have been submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>to them. The dismissal of the complaint was not authorized, and this would have been so even if the trial had taken place without a jury. Schlesinger v. Jud, 61 App. Div. 453, 70 N. Y. Supp. 616. I therefore concur that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
