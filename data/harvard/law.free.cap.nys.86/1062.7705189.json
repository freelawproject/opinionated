The affidavit of the plaintiff states that the purpose for which the company was organized was to further a patent invented by him for a cap on bottles, and that in his opinion the invention is of great value; that the individual defendants induced him to turn over to them certain capital stock upon representations that they would interest capitalists in the company, which they have not done; that it was recognized by all that the company was in need of capital, and, with that end in view, it was agreed that the board of directors should be increased from five to seven, substantially as stated in the complaint; that it was his understanding\u2014but he does not say from what he derived the understanding\u2014that the company would not be interfered with until the special meeting of the stockholders for the purpose of increasing the directors, \u201cbut I am now informed that, in utter disregard of said understanding, and with the deliberate purpose of injuring the company, and disposing of its treasury stock, assets, patents, and property holdings,\u201d the individual defendants, as stockholders and directors, have called a special meeting of the board, as stated in the complaint, \u201cat which they intended to dispose of the said treasury stock and the assets of the said corporation before the special meeting of the stockholders can be held.\u201d The plaintiff also presented a joint affidavit, made by three individuals, to the effect that the matters alleged in the complaint and in his affidavit are true, and that they have had numerous interviews and conferences with two of the individual defendants, \u201cand, from what they told us, we believe and know that they intend to transfer, without any consideration, the treasury stock of the said corporation, as well as to injure the said com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>pany, at the special meetings of the directors they have illegally called.\u201d An affidavit made by each individual defendant was presented in opposition to the motion, showing that the special meeting of the board of directors was called for the sole purpose of considering the advisability of retaining in the employ of the company a brother of the plaintiff, whose term of service expired on the day for which the meeting was called; that, at the time for which the meeting was held, a conference was held, without a formal meeting of the board, and a satisfactory arrangement was made with reference to continuing the services of the plaintiff\u2019s brother, which rendered it unnecessary to hold the meeting, although no injunction had been served, and the individual defendants had no knowledge that it had been obtained; that the entire capital stock of the company was issued to the plaintiff in consideration of a transfer of certain letters patent, upon the understanding, however, that he was to turn over to the corporation capital stock of the par value of $200,000, which was to be sold by the corporation to provide funds for the purpose of promoting the patent, and that he was also to turn over capital stock of the par value of $200,000 to the defendant Noyes, and a like amount to the defendant Horace G. Stripe, and retain capital stock of the par value of $400,000 for himself; that this agreement for tne distribution of stock was consummated; that the company\u2019s only means of raising funds at present is by a sale of this treasury stock; that part of the treasury stock has been sold from time to time, but that the company is now in pressing need of funds for the purpose of completing and perfecting a machine for the purpose of demonstrating the practicability of the patent, to enable them to make contracts with brewers for the use of the machine; that it is the custom of brewers to make their contracts on or about the 1st of January. Bach of the individual defendants denies any intention to sell any property of the corporation, other than its treasury stock, which they deem it necessary to sell, as heretofore, for the purpose aforesaid.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1084-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 603. The allegations of the complaint and the statements contained in his affidavit, so far as they set forth facts charging any improper management on the part of the directors, are either made upon his understanding or upon information or belief, and neither the basis of his understanding, nor the sources of his information, nor the grounds of his belief are stated. This defect is not cured by the joint affidavit, which, when applied to the allegations of the complaint and to the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, merely is to the effect, so far as these matters are concerned, that it is true that plaintiff\u2019s understanding, information, and belief are as alleged and stated. The injunction order has had the effect of completely tying the hands of the board of directors, and it appears, as might be expected, that the business of the company is at a standstill in consequence thereof. The provision of the order enjoining special and annual meetings of the stockholders, of which the plaintiff complains, is drastic, but it was evidently imposed as a condition of awarding that part of the injunction which the plaintiff desired. It is evident that there is a serious disagreement between the plaintiff, who owns or controls a majority of the outstanding stock, and the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>defendants, who, although minority stockholders, constitute a majority of the board of directors. It is manifest that the plaintiff\u2019s object in bringing the action was not to obtain a permanent injunction, but to temporarily enjoin the board of directors from selling sufficient treasury stock to render him a minority holder of the outstanding stock, and prevent his controlling the next election of directors. This would be accomplished by the temporary injunction order restraining further sales of stock until after the special meeting of the stockholders to increase the number of directors, at which, by reason of his controlling interest in the outstanding stock, he could secure the election of two individual directors -friendly to his interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">We are of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to the temporary injunction order, and that the order, in so far as it is appealed from by the plaintiff, should be reversed, and, in so far as it is appealed from by the defendants, should be reversed, thus vacating the entire order, without costs of the appeal to either party, and that the motion should be denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
