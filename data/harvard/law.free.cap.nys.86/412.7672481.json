Reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\">The cause of action stated in the complaint is one to restrain the defendants from unlawfully laying water pipes upon and over a highway bridge across the Mohawk river, which is the boundary line between the towns of Palatine and Canajoharie, and for damages to said bridge and its approaches by reason of laying said pipes thereon. There were joined as plaintiffs each of said towns and the commissioners of highways of such towns. It is alleged in the complaint that \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 commissioners are given control of said bridge and the approaches thereto by virtue of chapter 7, p. 7, Laws 1889.\u201d The demurrer interposed is as follows: \u201cThe defendants demur to the complaint of the plaintiffs herein, and allege as the ground of their demurrer that there is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff; that neither Henry C. Miller, as commissioner of highways of the town of Canajoharie, Montgomery county, N. Y\u201e John H. Van Wie, Adam A. Saltsman, or Charles Bander, as commissioners of highways of the town of Palatine, Montgomery county, N. Y., should have been a party plaintiff; neither one has any legal capacity to sue.\u201d From the judgment overruling this demurrer the defendants have appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b433-9\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Proc. \u00a7 490), and that has not been done in this demurrer, unless the statement as to the first ground, that neither of the commissioners should have1 been a party, amounts to a compliance with that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">The appellants insist, however, that there is but one ground of demurrer alleged, and that is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff, and that the demurrer specifically points out the particular defect relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>where it states that neither of the commissioners named should have been a party plaintiff, as-neither of them has any legal capacity to sue;that is, as is claimed, no legal capacity to sue for the cause of action stated in this complaint. Viewed in that light, it would appear that there has been a sufficient compliance with the provision requiring the defect relied upon to be pointed out to raise the question of a misjoinder of parties plaintiff. The defect is that under the law these commissioners have no right to sue in their names as commissioners for the cause of action stated in the complaint, and therefore they should not have been joined with their respective towns as plaintiffs, and that, having been so joined, there is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff. When the allegation of want of capacity is regarded as a reason for the misjoinder, and not as a separate ground of demurrer, the pleading as a whole is sufficiently specific, we think, in pointing out the particular defect relied upon, to require us to consider the question of misjoinder on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">It is alleged in the complaint that the plaintiffs\u2019 commissioners are given control of the bridge in question and the approaches thereto by virtue of Laws 1889, p. 7, c. 7. That act was an amendment to Laws 1867, p. 534, c. 280, and the last-named act was one to amend Laws 1859, p. 359, c. 143, entitled \u201cAn act for a free bridge over the Mohawk river.\u201d The amendment of 1889 provided that \"hereafter the said free bridge and the approaches thereto shall be under the control and direction of the commissioners of highways' of the towns of Canajoharie and Palatine, * * * and the costs and expenses of maintaining said bridge and approaches and keeping the same in repair shall be borne equally by said towns of Canajoharie and Palatine.\u201d. Prior to that amendment, as a reference to the legislation referred to shows, the bridge had been in control of the trustees of the villages of Canajoharie and Palatine Bridge. The former village is at one end of the bridge, in the town of Canajoharie, and the latter village is at the other end of the bridge, in the town of Palatine. Prior to- the amendment, as well as afterwards, the expenses of maintaining the bridge and approaches and keeping the same in repair were borne by the towns of Palatine and Canajoharie. It is clear that the only purpose and effect of the amendment of 1889 was to take the control of the bridge in question from the trustees of the two villages, respectively, and to place such control in the commissioners of highways of the respective towns of Canajoharie and Palatine. The bridge formed a part of the highway between these two towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Among the general powers of highway commissioners in towns under the highway law (Laws 1890, p. 1177, c. 568) is \u201cto have the care and superintendence of the highways and bridges therein\u201d (section 4, p. 1178). That law also provides that \u201cwhen such bridges are constructed over streams or other waters forming the boundary line of towns, either in the same or adjoining counties, such towns shall be jointly liable to pay such expenses.\u201d (Section 130, page 1201.) The words \u201ccontrol and direction\u201d in the amendment of 1889 to the local law have, I think, no broader significance with reference to the duties and. powers of the commissioners of highways of the two towns in question than have the words \u201ccare and superintendence\u201d in the high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>way law with reference to the duties and powers of commissioners of highways in the towns of the state. In either case the commissioners of highways are officers or agents of the towns, charged with the duties and clothed with the power specified under these laws, and the commissioners, who are plaintiffs, were vested by the amendment of 1889 to the local law only with like powers and duties as were conferred by the general law upon commissioners of highways with respect to highways and bridges , in towns. The bridge in question was maintained by the two towns at their joint expense, and the plaintiff commissioners, as officers of these towns, respectively, were simply their agents under the law in the control and direction thereof, and any suit which they were required to bring with relation to an encroachment upon the bridge should, therefore, be brought in the same way as any suit in relation to highways under the care and superintendence of commissioners of highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">A town is now a municipal corporation (Town Laws, Laws 1890, p. 1211, c. 569), and the town law (section 182, p. 1237) provides that actions or special proceedings for the benefit of a town, including an action to recover damages for injury to the property or rights of a town, shall be in the name of the town. More than this, the highway law in section 15, page 1181, in relation to actions for injuries to highways, provides that \"the commissioners of highways may bring an action in the name of the town against any person or corporation to sustain the rights of the public in and to any highway in the town, and to enforce the performance- of any duty enjoined upon any person or corporation in relation thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Regardless of what the law formerly was, which permitted commissioners of highways to prosecute certain actions in their own name of office, the cause of action stated in this complaint can, as the law now stands, only be prosecuted by the commissioners of highways in the name of the towns of which they are officers. That an action to recover damages for the destruction of a bridge was properly brought in the name of the town was decided by this court in Town of Fort Covington v. U. S. &amp; C. R. R. Co., 8 App. Div. 223, 40 N. Y. Supp. 313, and which decision was affirmed in the Court of Appeals (156 N. Y. 702, 51 N. E. 1094).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The judgment overruling the demurrer should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs. All concur, except SMITH and HOUGHTON, JJ\u201e who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
