The defendant testified that he had used the balance for a season or more, that he had never tested it, and that he had never used it after the inspection. The court dismissed the complaint. It is quite evident that the court did not thus adjudge upon the determination that the plaintiff had failed in its case, for the learned justice writes: \u201cThere does not appear to have been any \"intentional alteration of the scale in question, \"and therefore I do not wish to impose the penalty.\u201d Thus the court, in effect, says that it may impose the penalty, i. e., the plaintiff is entitled to recover, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>that the court does not give judgment for the plaintiff because the case does not show that there was any intentional alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The judgment must be reversed. First, there is no question of alteration, whether intentional or unintentional, involved, for the statute is aimed at the use, in weighing, of a balance out of order or incorrect, or which shall, not balance. Second, the ordinance is presumed to be reasonable. Mayor v. D. D., E. B. &amp; B. R. R. Co., 133 N. Y. 104, 30 N. E. 563, 28 Am. St. Rep. 609. And the element of intent or willfulness of any kind is not in this case. As the penalty prescribed is founded upon the use of a false balance, without requirement of proof of intent or guilty knowledge, proof thereof is not essential. People v. Kibler, 106 N. Y. 321, 12 N. E. 795; People v. West, 106 N. Y. 293, 297, 12 N. E. 610, 60 Am. Rep. 452; People v. Schaeffer, 41 Hun, 23. The ordinance is aimed against him who, using the false balance, holds it out to be true by representing that it properly determines the price which he requires for the commodity. If, then, this judgment can be sustained at all, it must be upon the ground that the court may, as matter of benignity, suspend the operation of the statute against an individual. The court had no power of dispensation. Mayor v. Bruns, 23 Misc. Rep. 635, 51 N. Y. Supp. 1120. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
