The complaint alleges the giving of a notice of the time, place, and cause of the injuries to plaintiff, in the manner and within the time provided by the employers\u2019 liability act (Laws 1902, p. 1748, c. 600), and that defendant was negligent in omitting its duty of seeing that its \u201cways, works, and machinery\u201d were proper and in proper condition. There is a further allegation that the \u201cgarnet machine,\u201d by which plaintiff was injured, was insufficiently protected, and was improper and insufficient for the purposes for which it was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The injury occurred in November, 1902, after the employers\u2019 liability act became a law, and the complaint must, we think, be construed as stating a cause of action founded upon that act. The plaintiff failed to prove the cause of action which he alleged. A \u201cgarnet machine\u201d is one used for picking and cleaning wool, and consists of a series of picking cylinders standing about 22 inches from the floor. It was the custom in defendant\u2019s mill for an employ\u00e9 to crawl under the machine and lie on his back, and clean these cylinders from underneath while they slowly revolved. It was while doing this that the plaintiff\u2019s foot was caught between the cylinders and he was injured. There was no proof that this machine was not in proper repair, or that it was improper or insufficient for the purpose for which it was designed, or that the plaintiff was injured because it' was insufficiently protected. There was no obligation on the part of the defendant to guard these cylinders against an employ\u00e9, contact with which could be had only by crawling under the machine. The negligence of the defendant, if there was any negligence at all, consisted in its failure to prescribe a safer mode of cleaning the cylinders, or in failing to warn the plaintiff, who was under 15 years of age, of the danger in the work, or in permitting an employ\u00e9 of such immature years to engage in such hazardous business. And this was the theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>against defendant\u2019s objection that such a cause of action was not alleged in the complaint, upon which the case was tried and submitted to the jury. No amendment of the complaint that it conform to the proof, or that it be amended by appropriate allegations to permit such proofs, was asked for upon the trial. Whether such amendment would have been proper, or whether, since the employers\u2019 liability act, an employ\u00e9 must bring his action for injuries under that act, or whether that act takes away from him his common-law right of action, we do not now decide. It is sufficient for the present case that against the defendant\u2019s objection, duly taken, the plaintiff recovered a judgment upon a common-law cause of action when his complaint set forth a cause of action wholly under the statute. His judgment is founded on a cause of action wholly separate and distinct from that alleged in his complaint, and cannot be sustained on appeal. Southwick v. First National Bank of Memphis, 84 N. Y. 420; Truesdell v. Sarles, 104 N. Y. 167, 10 N. E. 139; Reed v. McConnell, 133 N. Y. 426, 31 N. E. 22. Irrespective of whether or not an employ\u00e9 still retains his right to bring a common-law action for injuries against his employer notwithstanding the employers\u2019 liability act, if he chooses to bring his action under that act his proofs must establish a cause of action thereunder. He cannot plead within the precise terms of the act, and then be permitted to prove, if seasonable objection be made, acts of negligence wholly outside his complaint. Smith v. Lockwood, 13 Barb. 209; Woolsey v. Trustees of Ellenville, 69 Hun, 489, 23 N. Y. Supp. 410; Hoffman v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 45 App. Div. 587, 61 N. Y. Supp. 590; Coyle v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 18 Misc. Rep. 9, 40 N. Y. Supp. 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
