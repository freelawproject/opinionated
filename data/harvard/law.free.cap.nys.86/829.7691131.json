Crane, the executor named in the will, qualified, and took possession of the estate, which consisted entirely of personal property. In his lifetime he paid to the plaintiff in this action the sum of $1,400. Upon the 26th of August, 1900, the said Crane died. Thereafter Josiah C. Salisbury was appointed by the surrogate of Saratoga county administrator with the will annexed of Sarah J. Davis, and also the trustee under the will in the place of said John W. Crane. He duly qualified as such administrator and trustee, and received the sum of about $2,700 from the estate of John W. Crane as the estate of said Sarah J. Davis undisposed of during the lifetime of said Crane. The said Salisbury, doubting his power, as administrator with the will annexed, to pay over to the plaintiff these moneys, refused to pay to him any part thereof, and this action was brought against the said Salisbury and others, including Mildred Hemmens, a niece and one of the next of kin of Sarah J. Davis, to compel the said administrator to pay over the full amount remaining unpaid of said estate to the plaintiff. The trial court directed the said administrator to pay over to the plaintiff the full amount of said estate, and from the judgment entered upon this decision Mildred Hemmens, one of the next of kin \u00f3f Sarah J. Davis, here appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b851-7\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Davis did not terminate upon the death of the trustee. It then vested in the Supreme Court, to be exercised through its appointee, or the administrator with the will annexed, the substituted trustee. Matter of Valentine, 3 Dem. Sur. 563; In re Hecht, 71 Hun, 63, 24 N. Y. Supp. 540. After the death of Crane, therefore, this substituted trustee was required to pay the income of the said fund yearly to the plaintiff, and so much of the principal as the court, in its discretion, should say was proper and necessary for his support. This discretion of the court, however, is not an arbitrary discretion, and can only be exercised upon evidence showing the circumstances and necessities of the cestui que trust. Upon the trial of this action there was no evidence whatever upon which could be based a finding that the plaintiff was in need of any more than the income of the trust fund, and the direction of the court therefore to pay over the principal thereof as well as the income was clearly unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant in this court and in the court below, to be paid out of the estate of Sarah J. Davis. All concur; Parker, P. J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
