The appellant, Beckwith, had been a partner with Lewis in the installation of a water system at Mt. Kisco. During the continuance of that partnership, letter heads were printed and used, reading as follows: \u201cR. B. Lewis &amp; Company, Herkimer, N. Y., General Contractors, Waterworks, Sewers, Dams, Foundations, &amp;c. R. B. Lewis, Clinton Beckwith.\u201d After the completion of the Mt. Kisco contract, Lewis opened an account with plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and directed that the goods be shipped to him at another place. The first installment was shipped to him individually, and thereafter they were shipped to R. B. Lewis &amp; Co., but it was not shown that Beckwith knew that the goods were so consigned. The only evidence tending to charge appellant, Beckwith, as copartner was that he knew that Lewis was using the old stationery in his correspondence, and permitted him to do so. The plaintiff\u2019s assignor had not dealt with the old partnership, but opened its account after it was in fact closed. The permitting of the use of the stationery was not such an act as estopped the appellant from denying the partnership, or constituted him a partner as to the vendors. Nor was there any other evidence in the case which had that effect. The defendant\u2019s motion for a nonsuit should have been granted, and, failing to do this, the court should have granted his motion for a new trial..</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
