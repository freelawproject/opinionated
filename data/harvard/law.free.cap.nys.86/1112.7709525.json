It appears that the word \u201ctomate\u201d is an Italian word for the tomato, only used in a small territory situated in the north of Italy, and is not the Italian name for tomatoes except in that locality; that the Italian word for tomato is \u201cpomidora,\u201d but that in the United States the word \u201ctomate\u201d has been generally understood by- Italians to refer to the tomato and that the phrase \u201cConserva Di Tomate,\u201d adopted by the plaintiff to designate the contents of the cans manufactured and sold by him, would indicate that the article was a preserved tomato. The defendants originally produced and sold the article manufactured by them under the name of \u201cConserva Di Pomidoro,\u201d and some time before the commencement of this action changed the name to \u201cConserva Di Tomate,\u201d the same name under which the plaintiff\u2019s product had been manufactured and sold in the market. It would seem to be clear that, as this name adopted by the plaintiff was Italian for \"preserved tomato,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>plaintiff could not acquire by its use in describing articles manufactured and sold by him a trade-mark, so that others could not use the same phrase as describing the articles manufactured and sold by them. It is the Italian for the article that the plaintiff manufactured and sold, and it is now well settled that no one can acquire a trade-mark by the use of words of a foreign language which correctly describes the article manufactured any more than a trade-mark can be acquired in the words of the English language which properly describe such product. It is quite clear that the plaintiff could not, by calling this article \u201cpreserved tomatoes,\u201d acquire the exclusive right to use that phrase, nor could he, by adopting the Italian words which are a translation of the English words describing the character of what he manufactures, acquire a trade-mark in the Italian words. Caswell v. Davis, 58 N. Y. 223, 17 Am. Rep. 233; Barrett Chemical Co. v. Stern, 176 N. Y. 27, 68 N. E. 65. The words used by the plaintiff are descriptive. They are the Italian for \u201cpreserved tomatoes\u201d used in a portion of Italy and among Italians in the United States; and, though there is another Italian name for tomato in more general use than that adopted by the plaintiff, still the word \u201ctomate,\u201d more closely resembling the English name of the vegetable, is none the less a name which describes the vegetable from which the plaintiff\u2019s product is manufactured; and the name, taken as a whole, is a fair description of the manufactured article. This is not the case where an entirely arbitrary name, having no relation to the quality or, nature of the article manufactured, has been invented by the plaintiff, but is an Italian phrase, which fairly describes the manufactured article, and I think the plaintiff can obtain no exclusive right to-call the manufactured article by this name. The affidavits, however, disclose a clear attempt by the defendants to imitate the plaintiff\u2019s label, which entitled the plaintiff to an injunction restraining the defendants from such imitation as will induce the public to believe that they are purchasing the plaintiff\u2019s goods, when in reality they are purchasing goods prepared and manufactured by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-3\">The order must be modified by striking out the provision restraining the defendants from using the words \u201cConserva Di Tomate\u201d as descriptive of the product sold, but continuing the injunction so as to restrain the defendants from using the label a copy of which is annexed to the complaint, or any other label in imitation of that of the plaintiff, and the order appealed from, as thus modified, is affirmed, without costs to either party on this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
