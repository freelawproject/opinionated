Upon that appeal the Court of Appeals has held that the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>the question whether, under the circumstances, there should be a temporary injunction before final judgment, is now presented. The opinion of the Court of Appeals, not yet officially reported, appears in 69 N. E. 1107, and the New York Eaw Journal of Friday, March 4, 1904. The demurrer was overruled upon the ground that the agreement under which the defendants are acting is a combination in violation of section 1 of chapter 690, p. 1514, Laws 1899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">In answer to an allegation in the affidavit upon which the motion is made that the American Publishers\u2019 Association, through its manager, established a system of espionage upon the manager of the book department of the plaintiffs\u2019 business, and caused her to be followed and shadowed by detectives, both at her home and at the plaintiffs\u2019 place of business, and that employ\u00e9s of the plaintiffs were bribed to give information concerning the sources of plaintiffs\u2019 supply, the president of the association stated, without denying this allegation, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-6\">\u201cAny steps taken by the Publishers\u2019 Association to watch transactions in the plaintiffs\u2019 store have been wholly for the purpose of detecting these false and fraudulent purchases on behalf of the plaintiffs and their agents, and to enable the different members of the Publishers\u2019 Association to enforce the contract made by them with the purchasers of copyright books that such copyright books shall be sold to the public only at the net prices affixed to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">And the manager of the Publishers\u2019 Association, while not denying this allegation of the manager of the plaintiffs\u2019 departments, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-8\">\u201cAs none of the members of the association sell their copyrighted books to the plaintiffs, it is certain, when the plaintiffs advertised such books for sale, that they have obtained them either by false representations, or by a breach of contract with some of the persons who have bought them from the publishers. In either case the publishers have the right to ascertain how the plaintiffs have obtained the books.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">The defendant the American Publishers\u2019 Association is a corporation organized under the laws of this state. It has entered into a combination to prevent the plaintiffs from purchasing books with which they can carry on their business, except upon such terms as are imposed by the corporation. To carry out this object, it has established a system of espionage upon the plaintiffs\u2019 business, causing the plaintiffs\u2019 manager to. be followed by detectives, and publishing to the world that any book dealer who sells any books to the plaintiffs will not be allowed to purchase any books from any member of the Publishers\u2019 Association, or from any dealer to whom the members of the Publishers\u2019 Association have supplied books; and the combination having been declared to be a violation of law, and it appearing that those acting in pursuance of this combination have caused serious injury to the plaintiffs, it would seem to follow that the defendants should be prohibited from carrying out the illegal- combination. We accept the statement of the defendants that they believed the combination which they adopted was legal and did not violate the statute, and that they acted under the advice of counsel and in entire good faith; but, the highest court of the state having declared the agreement to be an illegal combination, further proceeding under it should be restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>It follows that the order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the temporary injunction granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">PATTERSON, McLAUGHRIN, and LAUGHRIN, JJ., concur. VAN BRUNT, P. J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
