It is sufficient to say that the requirement of the charter is merely directory, and not mandatory. The failure to follow it is a loss merely to the city, and does not damage the defendant; and it does not vitiate the tax. People ex rel. Rome, W., etc., v. Haupt, 104 N. Y. 377, 10 N. E. 871; Bradley, Supervisor, v. Ward, 58 N. Y. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">The interlocutory judgment overruling the demurrer should accordingly be affirmed, with costs, with leave to defendant to. withdraw demurrer, and to answer on payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
