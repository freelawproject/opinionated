Haslett died seised of premises described in the complaint, leaving a last will and testament, which was duly admitted to probate on the 16th day of November, 1887; that under the residuary clause thereof the premises in question were given to his widow, Esther Haslett, for life, for the use and benefit of herself and children, with the remainder over to the children; that he appointed his wife and daughters, Rebecca and Janet, executrices of his will; that his wife survived him, and died on the 15th day of May, 1903, and the other defendants are their children. In subdivision 4 of the complaint it is alleged that on .the 20th day of April, 1900, testator\u2019s widow, \u201cacting under the power given her in said will, and in the presence of her children, the above-named defendants, they being the beneficiaries and remaindermen under said will, as hereinbefore shown, executed an agreement in writing with the plaintiff, as her own act and as the act of said defendants, and with the intention that it should be both her and their act, and with the express consent, authorization, acquiescence, and participation of the defendants, whereby they leased to the plaintiff for a term of ten years from the 1st day of May, 1900,\u201d part of the premises so devised to them, which are also particularly described, for a specified annual rental; that \u201cthe defendants derived benefits from, accepted, ratified, and affirmed, said agreement or lease.\u201d In the fifth subdivision plaintiff alleges that he thereupon executed \u201csaid lease or agreement, being ignorant of the fact that said Esther Haslett was only a tenant for life and not the owner in fee of said premises, and, believing that the said lease, executed as in the preceding paragraph herein set forth, insured to him the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of said premises for the term aforesaid, took possession of and occupied the same, for the purpose of conducting a drug store, from about the 1st day of May, 1900, to the date of his eviction hereinafter mentioned, performed all the conditions therein on his part, and for three years paid the stipulated rent as aforesaid to said Esther Haslett and the defendants.\u201d In the eighth subdivision it is alleged that the widow, \u201cacting for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>herself and for the defendants herein, in said lease agreed with the plaintiff that he should peaceably and quietly occupy and enjoy the said described premises for the said term ten years\u201d; and in the ninth subdivision it is alleged that on or about the 31st day of July, 1903, \u201cthe defendants, the owners under said will, and as such owners, entered upon the same, and ousted the plaintiff therefrom,\u201d and still own and are in possession of the premises without plaintiff\u2019s consent, and have unlawfully withheld possession from him, to his damage in the sum of $40,000.

The appellant was therefore entitled to have these causes of action separately stated and numbered.' Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The complaint should also be made more definite and certain. This was a lease for 10 years, which would be void if not in writing. The allegations of subdivision 4 of the complaint are indefinite, in that they do not definitely show whether the lease was executed by the widow as executrix, or by virtue of a power granted by the will, or individually, or in form as the agent or attorney in fact for the other defendants as well as individually, or whether the alleged consent, authorization, and acquiescence on the part of the other defendants was in writing or parol. These are fa.cts which the appellant is entitled to have specifically stated in the complaint. A bill of particulars concerning them might not suffice. They are facts which the appellant is entitled to have alleged, that she may avail herself of the remedy by demurrer or answer, and thus raise any question that may arise thereon. These observations are equally applicable to subdivision 8 of the complaint, and the allegations thereof should also be amended'so as to show whether the widow, in form, made the' covenant individually, or as agent or attorney in fact for the other defendants, and whether her authority to act in that regard for the other defendants was in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted for the relief as indicated in this opinion, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
