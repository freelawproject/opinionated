The defendants set up a counterclaim alleged to consist of a certain promissory note, which was disallowed by the court below, but, as there must be a new trial for the reasons hereinafter stated, the counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>claim need not be considered. The answer was a general denial. The defendant Louis Gossett was called as a witness for the plaintiff, and upon his examination testimony was elicited showing that up to January 2, 1903, there was a balance due to plaintiff\u2019s assignor for goods sold to this defendant of the sum of $3.27. This witness also testified that \u201cthe book\u201d calls for goods sold \u201cfrom February 17th' to April 28th,\u201d but such book was not offered in evidence, and in what amounts or of what value such goods were does not appear. One Edward Levy, a son of plaintiff\u2019s assignor, was then sworn for the plaintiff. His testimony is to the effect that he had charge of part of the transactions between his father and the defendants, that he saw goods delivered to defendants between January 21 and June 4, 1903, and that he went to defendants to collect bills several times. The record then states that the witness was then shown a bill (what such bill was does not appear), and was asked, \u201cAre those the goods you sold the defendants? Ans. I sold part of them, and my father made the rest.\u201d He further testified that he made up the balance on the account, amounting to the sum of $79.03. This was all the testimony given on the part of the plaintiff to establish liability on the part of the defendants. What the correct balance was, or from whom due, or for what goods sold, or their value, was not shown. Not an item of plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars was proven to have been sold or delivered, or the value thereof. The record is barren of the slightest testimony showing or tending to show that defendants were indebted to plaintiff\u2019s assignor in the sum of $197.62, for which plaintiff had judgment. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
