The complaint charges that he was negligent (x) in removing two teeth which did not require removal, (2) in allowing portions thereof to remain in the gum, and (3) in putting in bridgework which was defective and improperly fitted. These several acts are alleged to have resulted in the production of abscesses on the gum and necrosis of the jawbone. They are obviously stated as the details or steps in a course of negligent professional treatment terminating in a single injury, and, thus regarded, they do not constitute separate causes of action, and may properly be set forth in one count. Dickens v. N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 13 How. Prac. 228. The motion, therefore, so far .as it was based, upon\u2019 section 483 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which requires \u2022 separate causes of action in a complaint to be separately stated and numbered, was properly denied. Nor is there any adequate basis for the suggestion that the complaint is indefinite and uncertain, within the meaning of section 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
