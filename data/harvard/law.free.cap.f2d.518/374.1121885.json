The district judge granted the Government\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, and appellant pursued this appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Appellant is the owner of the G &amp; D Grocery, which participates in the federally supervised food stamp program. A substantial portion of appellant\u2019s grocery business consists of food stamp customers. Appellant\u2019s participation in the food stamp program began in 1963, and he has since been the subject of administrative scrutiny numerous times. On two occasions in 1969, appellant received \u201cconfirming letters\u201d from food stamp officials expressing concern over what appeared to be an excessive amount of coupon redemptions. On two other occasions, one in 1967 and one in 1968, appellant received \u201cwarning letters\u201d regarding admitted violations of food stamp regulations. These violations involved the use of coupons for ineligible items (imported foods) and improper change procedures. In April 1971, investigators using food stamps made numerous purchases at appellant\u2019s store of ineligible items such as beer, razor blades, hosiery, light bulbs, crayons and mouse traps. In light of these violations and prior dealings with appellant, the Food and Nutrition Service sought to disqualify appellant from participation in the food stamp program for violations which were claimed to have been \u201caccomplished deliberately and with flagrant disregard for the program regulations.\u201d Record at 96. Appellant was subsequently suspended from participation in the program for a period of six months. Appellant and two of his cashiers were charged with violations of food stamp regulations; the cashiers pled guilty and were fined $100 each, and charges against appellant were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">After the six-month suspension was announced, appellant immediately sought a hearing before an administrative review officer pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022. Appellant and witnesses in his behalf spoke of his strong support for the food stamp program, the importance of food stamp customers to his business, the high repute in which the community held appellant, and the disastrous consequences which would result from disqualification. At no point did appellant deny the charges against him or the improper actions of his employees. Rather, the violations were classified as unintentional, unavoidable and <em>de minimis. </em>The six-month disqualification sanction was upheld. Appellant then commenced this action and, after proceedings not relevant to this appeal, requested the district court to review the administrative decision pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022. Section 2022 provides that administrative sanctions under the food stamp program can be reviewed by means of a \u201ctrial de novo by the court in which the court shall determine the validity of the questioned administrative action in issue,\u201d and also allows the court to set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>agency action upon determining that it is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The Government moved for summary judgment, relying on the extensive administrative record, appellant\u2019s admissions therein, and the convictions for violations of the applicable regulations entered upon the cashiers\u2019 guilty pleas. In opposition to the Government\u2019s motion, appellant filed an affidavit stating that he was \u201ccompletely unaware of any violations\u201d of the program regulations and denying that such violations had occurred. Further, the affidavit stated that if such violations had occurred, they were in derogation of his specific instructions to employees to abide by all regulations and were \u201cinconsequential and insignificant.\u201d In a considered 11-page memorandum opinion, the district court concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the Government was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The sole issue before this court is appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in granting the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The trial de novo provision of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022 is clearly broader than the review standard provided for under the Administrative Procedure Act. It requires the district court to examine the entire range of issues raised, and not merely to determine whether the administrative findings are supported by substantial evidence. Saunders v. United States, 6 Cir., 1974, 507 F.2d 33, 36; Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. United States, S.D.N.Y., 1972, 342 F.Supp. 492, 493; J.C.B. Super Markets, Inc. v. United States, W.D.N.Y., 1972, 57 F.R.D. 500, 502-03. When a case is properly before the court for a trial de novo, the court must reach its own factual and legal conclusions based on the preponderance of the evidence, and should not limit its consideration to matters previously appraised in the administrative proceedings. Redmond v. United States, 5 Cir., 1975, 507 F.2d 1007, 1011; Saunders v. United States, <em>supra, </em>507 F.2d at 36; J.C.B. Super Markets, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>57 F.R.D. at 502-03. The party seeking judicial review has the burden of proving facts to establish that he was entitled to relief from the disqualification determination, and must establish the invalidity of the agency action by a preponderance of the evidence. Redmond v. United States, <em>supra, </em>507 F.2d at 1011-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\"> Despite the trial de novo provision, it is clear that summary judgment is a proper means of disposing of requests for review under section 2022 where there are presented no genuine issues of material fact. United States v. Saunders, <em>supra, </em>507 F.2d at 36; Save More of Gary, Inc. v. United States, 7 Cir., 1971, 442 F.2d 36, cert. dismissed, 404 U.S. 987, 92 S.Ct. 535, 30 L.Ed.2d 549; J.C.B. Super Markets, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The issue we must decide is whether the grant of summary judgment in this case was proper. Such a decision turns, of course, on the specif ic facts of the case. Here, appellant has admitted, implicitly and explicitly, his store\u2019s wrongdoing in the extensive prior administrative proceedings. Two of his employees, for whose conduct as employees he is responsible, have admitted and been adjudged guilty of the violations for which appellant has been cited. But appellant asserts that his denial by way of affidavit of any wrongdoing created a disputed issue of fact sufficient to require a trial on the merits. But we reiterate that appellant had previously admitted the violations throughout the course of this matter through administrative proceedings, and that the guilty pleas of his employees are incontestible. These facts are determinative. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that while' a sworn denial of this sort would ordinarily create an issue of disputed fact, this \u201celeventh-hour denial of facts admitted over a three-year period\u201d is not a sufficient basis in this case for denying summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>of the record in this case, the court below had good reason for questioning the good faith of appellant\u2019s affidavit. See Record at 49.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the district court properly concluded that summary judgment was warranted. The stay of disqualification pending appeal granted by the district court is hereby vacated. Appellant will be taxed with the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">. The facts of this case should be compared with Saunders v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and Miller v. United States Department of Agriculture, W.D.Pa., 1972, 54 F.R.D. 471, cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>which it was found improper to grant summary judgment in a section 2022 proceeding because there had been no admission of guilt in the administrative proceedings and the courts were presented with conflicting affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-17\">. In questioning the. good faith of appellant\u2019s affidavit, the district court referred to Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(g), which provides that when affidavits are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the' court may order the offending party to pay the reasonable expenses thereby incurred by the opposing party or hold the offending party of attorney in contempt. Three days after entering summary judgment for the Government, the district judge amended his order so as to tax all costs of the action against appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
