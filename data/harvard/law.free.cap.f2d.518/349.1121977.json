S. Kresge Co., a Michigan Corporation, in the Western District of Texas, alleging various tortiously caused injuries. Kresge\u2019s registered agent was served and mailed the papers to Kresge\u2019s Michigan home office. The home office, in turn, mailed the papers back to Texas so local counsel could conduct the litigation. It was one mailing too many, as the papers were lost until it was too late to prevent entry of a default judgment for Baez. Since finally recovering the papers, Kresge has done everything it can to get the judgment withdrawn, but we sustain the District Court\u2019s refusal to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">First, Kresge argues it was entitled to notice before the judgment was entered, because it had \u201cappeared\u201d in the case. F.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2). H. F. Livermore Corp. v. Aktiengesellschaft Gebruder Loepfe, 1970, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 432 F.2d 689, is cited for the proposition, which we might accept, that a 55(b)(2) \u201cappearance\u201d need not have been a formal Court appearance. In that case, however, the \u201cappearance\u201d was <em>responsive </em>to a formal action on plaintiff\u2019s part \u2014 namely, filing the complaint. Kresge would have us extend the rule to <em>any </em>case in which plaintiff knew defendant planned to contest the suit. We decline to do that, and hold\u2014 at least \u2014 that a 55(b)(2) \u201cappearance\u201d must be responsive to plaintiff\u2019s formal Court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">Second, we are urged to overturn the District Court\u2019s declination to relieve Kresge under F.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Kresge argues it is entitled to relief under sub-paragraph (6), but we disagree. Because the Postal Service \u2014 not Kresge \u2014 was responsible, it says, that provision should be invoked. But that ignores the fact that both Kresge\u2019s registered agent, and its home office, possessed the papers in ample time to prevent its own injury. The Postal Service, therefore, cannot be burdened with the full blame. We think rather minimal internal procedural safeguards could and should have been established which would have prevented this loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">Since Kresge\u2019s neglect was at least a partial cause, it must convince the Court that neglect was excusable before it can prevail. While the basic purpose of the default judgment is to protect parties from undue delay-harassment, of which Kresge might not appear to be guilty were we considering the question in the first instance, the District Court is vested with a substantial amount of discretion we will not lightly overturn. Since no abuse of that discretion has been demonstrated to us, we are constrained to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\">. We have withheld this opinion pending a ruling by the district court on Kresge\u2019s motion to correct the record. The district court denied the motion as \u201cwithout merit and we fully agree with this determination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
