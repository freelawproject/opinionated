BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">In a spirited Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc, the Appellant principally argues that <em>United States v. Northside Realty Associates, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 501 F.2d 181 <em>(Northside II) </em>and <em>United States v. Northside Realty Associates, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 1164 <em>(Northside I) </em>conflict with the intervening decision of this Court in <em>United States v. Pelzer Realty Co., 5 </em>Cir., 1973, 484 F.2d 438. But in no sense does the Petition for Rehearing \u2014 and more important the supporting brief \u2014 stop there.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">While we understand Appellant\u2019s concern regarding the disposition of this case, we are struck by counsel\u2019s excessive language in Appellant\u2019s brief on petition for rehearing, riddled as it is with inaccuracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">First, Appellant asks that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-17\"><em>somebody </em>examine the facts of this case and make a considered judgment on the question whether there has been a denial of rights raising an issue ' of general public importance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-19\">district court did not do it; this Court did not do it; and no Attorney General has done it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-20\">(Petition for Rehearing Brief for Appellant at 2, <em>Northside II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-21\">Contrary to Appellant\u2019s statement above, the Government did in fact claim a \u201cpattern and practice of resistance\u201d and therefore asks for an injunction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the District Court\u2019s Order of December 30, 1971 specifically held that a group of people had been denied the protection of the Fair Housing Act as claimed by the Government and an injunction was appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-22\">This Court also recognized that the Government sought injunctive relief and claimed a pattern and practice of resist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>anee to the Fair Housing Act, thus raising an issue of general public importance. <em>Northside </em>1, 474 F.2d at 1165. And, except for the infection of the unconstitutional \u201cpenalty\u201d on the realtor for obdurate opposition to the Act, we stated that the finding was amply supported, and we remanded for a further explanation of the reasons for a finding of discrimination and whether they were tainted by this impermissible burden.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">On remand the District Court clarified its original opinion to specifically hold that Northside\u2019s Vice-President Isakson\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the Fair Housing Act was not a consideration in its finding of a violation of the Act, and that its decision stood on more than the single incident with Bowers\u2014 that the Bowers pre-Act incident was used to highlight the similarity to other discriminatory incidents that followed. Supplemental Appendix at 14, <em>Northside II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">When appealed to this Court for the second time, we reviewed the District Court\u2019s new order and determined that the District Court had complied with the guidelines in our earlier opinion, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>and therefore affirmed the decision. <em>Northside II, supra, </em>501 F.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">In language reflecting an unfortunate absence of professionalism, counsel for appellant next inveighs against our failing to mention and follow a Fourth Circuit opinion holding that the Government must prove discrimination of general public importance before granting injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Perhaps counsel is not aware that this Court is bound only by decisions of this Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, in this instance, counsel has been doubly wrong since we have in fact even complied with the standards of the Fourth Circuit for the District Court recognized that the Government had the burden of proof in showing a violation of the Fair Housing Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Hunter </em>is of little help to appellant\u2019s argument. In that case, the Fourth Circuit held two isolated, allegedly discriminatory acts insufficient to establish a pattern or practice of resistance. 459 F.2d at 217. Nonetheless, the <em>Hunter </em>Court held that, under the same facts, the Government \u201cclearly\u201d had established its right to bring the case as raising an issue of general public importance. 459 F.2d at 217-218. <em>Hunter </em>thus is of little solace to a party arguing that even though a violation of the Fair Housing Act has been established, the issue is still not one the Attorney General might deem to be of public impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>tance. After an examination of the facts, the District Court then determined that the burden had been met and held that this \u201cdenial is of sufficient public importance to authorize the relief herein granted.\u201d Supplemental Appendix at 17, <em>Northside II. </em>And one relief specifically listed for violations of the Fair Housing Act is an injunction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Appellant next asserts that inconsistencies exist in our final opinion in <em>Northside II, </em>asserting that in one breath we state that what is an issue of public importance is within the discretion of the Attorney General, and in the other that it did not matter that the Attorney General had failed to make such a determination here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The only inconsistency, however, seems to be in counsel\u2019s misreading of what is actually there. We stated in both <em>Northside I &amp; II </em>that the determination of what is an issue of public importance in order to bring an action under the Fair Housing Act is within the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. <em>Northside, supra, </em>501 F.2d at 182, 474 F.2d at 1168. Appellant urges that whenever a new Attorney General is appointed, that person must re-examine every case for a fresh determination of public importance. As the District Court so ably reasoned,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> such a position is without merit. Once a determination of public importance has been made by <em>an </em>Attorney General, the <em>Government </em>is the party and the case proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Here, a determination of public importance was made, a new Attorney General was appointed and the District Court found a violation of the Act. To ask for a fresh determination of probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>by a new Attorney General after the District Court has already found a violation of the Act would be entirely superfluous. Accordingly, we said in our former opinion that in \u201cview of our holding that the district court found facts sufficient to support a violation of the Act, we find no merit in defendants\u2019 final contention.\u201d <em>Northside II, supra, </em>501 F.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Finally, counsel, obviously piqued, begs <em>somebody </em>to look at the facts of the case and discover that the wholly innocent employees at Northside have been unjustly marred by having an injunction placed on them against violating the Fair Housing Act. Such an unfounded holding, Appellant goes on, supports a \u201cbelief\u201d that the Court is so overburdened and overworked that it cannot properly dispense justice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is akin to another litigant\u2019s contention, labelled by us as \u201cintemperate,\u201d that his case had not received careful consideration and scrutiny by the Judges of the Court. See <em>George W. Bennett Bryson &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Norton Lilly &amp; Co., Inc., 5 </em>Cir., 1974, 502 F.2d 1045, 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">But contrary to these charges this Court, while undoubtedly one of the Nation\u2019s busiest Courts, gives earnest consideration to every case, and certainly, as its history reflects, in the field of civil rights and race discrimination. Of course, in this travail we rely heavily on the quality of the briefs and arguments submitted by the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">We have twice looked at the evidence but to assure that no slight has been done either to the realtor or the law, we now review it a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Northside has sold more than 3,000 homes since the effective date of the Fair Housing Act \u2014 none to a black person. And before this action was filed, no single family dwellings were sold to black persons. As we once said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-12\">\u201c . . . figures of this kind, while not necessarily satisfying the whole case, have critical, if not decisive, significance \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-14\"><em>Rowe v. General Motors Corporation, 5 </em>Cir., 1972, 457 P.2d 348, 358. But the zero does not stand alone in the evidence box.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">Prior to the effective date of the Fair Housing Act, a Mr. Bowers \u2014 a black person \u2014 was turned away from Northside Realty by Vice-President Isakson with the statement that Mr. Bowers could not afford a house in a certain price range. Without showing housing in a price range he could afford, Mr. Isakson referred Mr. Bowers to a Negro-owned real estate firm in Atlanta.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Post-Fair Housing Act, Mr. Isakson indicated to a black college professor that he could not help him in finding a house and referred him to another agency. Further, Mr. Isakson\u2019s statements to black realtor Harold Dawson indicated Mr. Isakson\u2019s unwillingness to cooperate or deal with black realtors and their clients. The record contains further evidence \u2014 detailed by the District Court\u2014 that Northside and its employees and agents have created an image and unwillingness to help black clients. The District Court had ample basis for concluding that Northside Realty, far from having \u201cspotless records of compliance with the law,\u201d has violated the Fair Housing Act so as to require enjoining Northside from further violations of the Act. Moreover, the District Court could reasonably have determined that only by ordering compliance with the Act at all levels of Northside\u2019s operations could the Act\u2019s goals (and the injunction\u2019s aim) be effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">The District Court\u2019s detailed order of January 19, 1972, this Court\u2019s detailed opinion of March 4, 1973 <em>(Northside </em>I), the District Court\u2019s meticulous findings and order of September 27, 1973, and finally this Court\u2019s opinion of September 23, 1974 <em>(Northside II), </em>demonstrate that not only has <em>somebody </em>examined the facts of this case, but that two panels of this Court as well as a District Judge have carefully examined the record and all appellant\u2019s contentions. We repeat what Judge Ainsworth stated for us in outlining the review procedure of this Court, \u201cFull and meticulous consideration is given to all cases, whether summarily decided or orally argued.\u201d <em>George W. Bennett Bryson &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Norton Lilly &amp; Co., </em>5 Cir., 1974, 502 F.2d 1045, 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">With the facts thus so thoroughly considered, we turn to the question of whether <em>Northside I </em>and <em>II </em>conflict with <em>Pelzer. </em>In <em>Pelzer </em>the Court recognized that when there is a judicial testing of whether a pattern or practice actually exists and that before relief is actually granted, the Court must <em>of course </em>\u201cexercise independent judgment\u201d to determine whether the Government has proved its case. Based on these statements, Appellants argue that the Court\u2019s opinions are inconsistent \u2014 that in the <em>Northside </em>opinions the Attorney General is given the very broad and independent power to bring the suit, while in <em>Pelzer </em>the Court suggests that that authority is not so independent and thus subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Appellants fail to appreciate the nature of the cause of action pursued in the different cases, however, and based on that distinction, their arguments are unfounded. <em>Pelzer </em>was decided as a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on the issue of the review of the Attorney General\u2019s determination. <em>Northside, </em>on the other hand, is primarily a \u201cdenial of rights raising an issue of general public importance\u201d case. Whatever the validity in pattern or practice cases of the distinction between (1) review of the Attorney General\u2019s decision to sue and (2) review of the sufficiency of the evidence on the merits, it makes little sense in this context. First, the same evidence will likely be used to demonstrate the Attorney General\u2019s reasonable cause to believe that a denial has taken place and to establish the actual denial. But that is also true, of course, in the pattern or practice cases. More importantly, the existence of a pattern or practice of discrimination may be discoverable using traditional judicial standards, but what constitutes an issue of general public importance is hardly susceptible of \u201cproof\u201d in the normal legal sense at all. Hence, the latter decision seems classically suit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>ed to the discretion of prosecuting authorities in the Executive Branch.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In any event, the dicta in <em>Pelzer </em>concerning our type of case suggests only that courts might review the Attorney General\u2019s determination of \u201cwhether there was reason to believe that a group of persons had been denied rights guaranteed by the Fair Housing Act.\u201d But it says nothing about reviewing his decision on the public importance of the alleged denial. Hence, our reaffirmation of <em>Northside I </em>creates no conflict with <em>Pelzer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">We continue to hold that under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613 what is an issue of general public importance is within the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>To the extent that the issue of pattern or practice is in the case, we continue to hold that our review of the matter shows that the District Court did not err in finding that the Attorney General could have reasonable cause to believe that a person or group of persons was engaged in a pattern or practice of violating the Fair Housing Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-18\"> No claim is made that there was a \u201cpattern or practice of resistance\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613) which could justify issuance of an injunction against the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-11\">.

We held, with Judge Goldberg writing for the Court, that the record could support findings and conclusions of law that justify equitable relief, but we must be able to read such findings clearly and distinctly. The trial court\u2019s findings are only clearly erroneous if they were based (1) on a belief that Isakson\u2019s claimed intention to test the constitutionality of the Fair Housing Act showed an intent to violate the Act, or (2) on the finding that the Bowers incident standing alone evidenced a pre-Act pattern or practice. We must be absolutely certain that the trial court\u2019s findings were not tainted by a belief that Isakson\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the Act was probative of an intent to violate the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\"><em>Northside I, supra, </em>474 F.2d at 1171.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b946-8\">. Petition for Rehearing Brief at 3, <em>Northside II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANLf\">In <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>459 F.2d 205 (4th Cir. 1972), the court held that the Government must <em>prove </em>a denial raising an issue of general public importance as a <em>predicate </em>for the grant of injunctive relief (459 F.2d at 217). * * * We have, at every opportunity, brought <em>Hunter </em>to the Court\u2019s attention. It is not important that counsel, in our frustration, are edged near the belief that one could practice in this Circuit without a library; it is important, however, that the defendants are unlawfully put upon by the failure to examine the facts in the light of the law and, for that reason, rehearing should be granted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b946-12\">.

We are reminded of Justice Stewart\u2019s remark in <em>United States v. Von\u2019s Grocery Company, </em>384 U.S. 270 [86 S.Ct. 1478, 16 L.Ed.2d 555] (1966), \u201cThe sole consistency that I can find is that in litigation under Section 7, the government always wins.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b947-14\">. Supplemental Appendix at 5, <em>Northside II, supra, </em>501 F.2d 181:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-15\">The basis for the request of the defendants is due to the appointment of a new Attorney General. At the time the case was filed, the Attorney General of the United States was John Mitchell, whereas, at this time, the Attorney General of the United States is Elliot Richardson, As will be noted, the Attorney General himself is not a party to this litigation. The plaintiff is the United States of America, represented by the Attorney General. The action is filed only pursuant to a determination of reasonable cause made by the Attorney General. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3613. The Attorney General who made that determination was the one then in office. That determination having been made, there is no further necessity for re-referral to the Attorney General for a new determination of reasonable cause, nor is there a necessity for a substitution of parties.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\">. Petition for Rehearing Brief at 5, <em>Northside II:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Defendants\u2019 second plea is that <em>somebody, </em>preferably this Court, but if not, the district court on remand, look at the facts as found by the district court and determine whether the two ancient incidents of alleged violation of the Fair Housing Act found by that court actually justify the issuance of any injunction, and particularly an injunction running against \u201cofficers, employees, brokers, agents\u201d of North-side, several hundreds in number, who have spotless records of compliance with the law. Ordinarily, courts make findings as to the reasons why an injunction should issue. <em>United States v. W. T. Grant Co., </em>345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953). Here no such findings have been made by anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">This Court apparently does not appreciate the consequences of the injunction\u2019s effect on wholly innocent people. For example, if the injunction stands, how does a Northside Realty salesperson answer questions about this litigation when applying for a new job, or for credit, or for insurance? How does she explain -that she is subject to a court order restraining her from violation of the Fair Housing Act? Who would believe that such orders are issued against innocent people? Who would believe her when she said the order ran against all associated salespersons even though not a single one of them had ever violated the law? This Court was created to correct errors adversely affecting innocent persons. Its inaction here reinforces the belief of many that the Court is so overworked and overburdened that it cannot effectively dispense justice and that the Circuit should be split into two circuits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b949-8\">.
