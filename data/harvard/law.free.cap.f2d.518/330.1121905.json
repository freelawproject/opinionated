II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq., the District Court held that she failed to carry her burden of proving that she was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">Initially claimant claimed disabilities of a physical nature. Hearing before the Administrative Law Judge was set for September 19, 1973. On August 29, 1973, claimant obtained from the staff physician at the Baton Rouge Mental Health Center a \u201cReport on Individual With Mental Impairment,\u201d entered on an HEW form. This report shows admission of claimant in April 1972 with a diagnosis of \u201cinvolutional melancholia\u201d with a prognosis of \u201cfair.\u201d It shows that claimant was being seen monthly for medication regulation. It describes her medication, and says that chemotherapy is to continue indefinitely. It shows that at her last visit, July 26, 1973, she was \u201cmore depressed.\u201d On September 4, 1973, counsel for claimant sent this report to the ALJ with a request that a consultative psychiatric examination at government expense be ordered since claimant was financially unable to. pay for such an examination. No action was taken on this request before the hearing. When the hearing began claimant was permitted to amend her claim to include an impairment described as a nervous condition diagnosed as involutional melancholia.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-21\">In the hearing the report of the staff physician at the mental health center, previously described, was admitted as an exhibit. In oral testimony claimant described her \u201cbad nerves\u201d and headaches so severe that two to three days was required to recover from each episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-22\">She stated that she had given up driving an automobile because of the headaches. She described her medication prescribed by the Mental Health Center \u2014 an unnamed medication twice daily and Thorazine once a day. She had been taking the latter more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-23\">Both medical and lay evidence described claimant as suffering from edema (swelling). A lay witness described the swelling as occurring at irregular inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>vals and as causing claimant\u2019s face, hands and arms to swell, with hard knots in her arms, back and chest. The witness stated that, on orders of claimant\u2019s doctor, it was necessary to have available a spoon or a stick [presumably a tongue depressor] to hold claimant\u2019s tongue down when it swelled. She described a recent incident in which Mrs. McGee\u2019s badly swollen tongue almost \u201cwent back in her, down in her throat.\u201d She testified that claimant was helpless during the attacks of edema, necessitating \u201ceverything being done for her\u201d and that it was best that she \u201cstay within distance of somebody who knows her case.\u201d The witness stated that after an attack claimant would be drowsy and sick, unable to eat, and suffering pain when touched as though bruised, with the result that no one could touch her. Claimant\u2019s witnesses described the edema as occurring from as often as two or three times a week to periods of several weeks. A treating doctor reported them as occurring every month or so. Claimant\u2019s doctor described the edema and stated he had been unable to establish the cause. An examining physician referred to claimant\u2019s nervousness and discussed, in a manner implying that they are related, hypertension and swelling of the arms, face, hands, forearms and feet. A pathologist, who made a consultative examination, referred to \u201chypertensive vascular disease.\u201d A report from still another doctor, who treated claimant for several years, refers repeatedly to \u201cangioneurotic edema.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The ALJ did not act upon the request for psychiatric examination. The defendant errs in his contention to us that the ALJ made a factual determination that the request was not sufficiently supported to require that an examination be ordered, and indeed that he found the request was frivolous. No such findings were entered with respect to the request for psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">A consultative examination is not required by statute. The regulations, \u00a7 404.1527, provide for consultative examinations where warranted. HEW\u2019s own standards, however, require the ALJ in carrying out his responsibility for \u201cfull inquiry\u201d to obtain such medical evidence through consultative services as he deems warranted. If the ALJ does not have before him sufficient facts on which to make an informed decision, his decision is not supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Long v. Richardson, </em>334 F.Supp. 305 (W.D.Va., 1971). Under the circumstances of this case it must be remanded, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) for additional evidence which should include the results of a consultative psychiatric examination inquiring, inter alia, into possible psychiatric causes for the edema.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Because of the disposition which we make it is unnecessary that we reach the contention of claimant that as an indigent she is constitutionally entitled to a consultative psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
