This is a case to be decided under CPLR 301, since CPLR 302 is, on its face, inapplicable. <em>(Tausa </em>v. <em>Susquehanna Coal Co., </em>220 N. Y. 259; <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Finnish Nat. Airline, </em>15 N Y 2d 426; <em>Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank, </em>14 N Y 2d 281; <em>Feathers </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em>15 N Y 2d 443; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Chemie Grunenthal, G.m.b.H., </em>354 F. 2d 428.) II. None of the factors relied upon by the Appellate Division, either singly or collectively, form a sufficient basis for jurisdiction under CPLR 301. <em>(Frummer </em>v. <em>Hilton Hotels Int., </em>19 NY 2d 533, 389 U. S. 923; <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Finnish Nat. Airline, </em>15 N Y 2d 426; <em>Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank, </em>14 N Y 2d 281; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Surf Props., </em>4 N Y 2d 475; <em>Tausa </em>v. <em>Susquehanna Coal Co., </em>220 N. Y. 259; <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Peerless Chems. </em>[P.R.], 316 F. 2d 695, 375 U. S. 831.) III. VWAG is not and jcannot be present in New York because of the out-of-State activities of its subsidiary, VWoA, or the in-State activities of wholly unrelated enterprises such as World-Wide and its dealers. <em>(Taca Int.

IV, The Appellate Division\u2019s reliance on supposed financial benefit as a basis for jurisdiction under CPLR 301 is misplaced. <em>(Ferrante Equip. Co. </em>v. <em>Lasker-Goldman Corp., </em>26 N Y 2d 280.) V. The decision of the Appellate Division would subject every nonresident to suit on every cause of action in every jurisdiction where products manufactured by it are sold. This result must be rejected as a matter of public policy and because it violates due process. <em>(Millner Co. </em>v. <em>Noudar, Lda., </em>24 A D 2d 326.) VI. Factual recitals made by the Appellate Division in support of its conclusions have no foundation in the record. To the extent the Appellate Division felt factual issues existed, it was error not to order an immediate trial under CPLR 3211. <em>(Noble </em>v. <em>Singapore Resort Motel of Miami Beach, </em>21 N Y 2d 1006; <em>Vantage S.

VWAG (defendant) is engaged in a systematic and regular course of business in New York which subjects it to our jurisdiction. For the protection of New York and American residents, this court should adopt the jurisdictional test of <em>\u201c </em>doing business \u201d to the extent that it is constitutionally permissible. <em>(Bryant </em>v. <em>Finnish Nat.

The activities of VWAG constitute \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>minimum contacts \u2019 \u2019 sufficient to sustain jurisdiction. Litigation is part of the price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>properly demanded for the benefits received by defendant-respondent for its widespread activities in New York. <em>(Rietsch </em>v. <em>Societe Anonymes des Autos.

In the broadest sense, a piece of business is transacted within this State when an individual or corporation is within or enters this State in person or by agent and, through dealing herein with another, effectuates or attempts to effectuate herein a purpose directly related to his economic affairs or, if a corporation, to its corporate ends. <em>(Millner Co. </em>v. <em>Noudar, Lda., </em>24 A D 2d 326; <em>de la Bouillerie </em>v. <em>de Vienne, </em>300 N.

VWAG, by becoming an actor in this litigation seeking orders to enjoin and vacate third-party subpoenas duces tecum, made a \u201c general appearance \u2019 \u2019 and thereby submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court. <em>(Farmer </em>v. <em>National Life Assn. of Hartford, </em>138 N.

While operating said vehicle in Germany, plaintiff claims that <em>\u201c </em>the front wheel suspension and its appurtenant parts broke and collapsed, causing the front wheels to cave in and the motor vehicle to run out of control and hit a bridge abutment with such force as to cause [him] serious injuries \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Upon his return to the United States, plaintiff brought suit in New York against VWAG, alleging that <em>\u201c </em>the defendant transacted sufficient of its business within the State of New York to subject itself to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Service of process was made on the defendant, pursuant to CPLR 313, in Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The following facts are not in dispute. Defendant, VWAG, a German corporation, manufactures and sells, in Germany, Volkswagen automobiles and parts. VWAG has never qualified to do business in New York and has no office or place of business here. VWAG exports its automobiles into the United States through Volkswagen of America, Inc. (VWoA), a New Jersey corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of VWAG<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the exclusive American importer of Volkswagen automobiles. Likewise, VWoA has never qualified to do business in New York and has no office or place of business here. After these cars arrive in the United States at various ports, none of which are in New York, they are resold to 14 wholesale distributors franchised by VWoA. These distributors take title to the vehicles at the delivery point and, in turn, reship the cars to local independent franchised dealers. In New York State, the franchised wholesale distributor is World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. (WorldWide). The entire capital stock of World-Wide and its New York franchised dealers is owned by United States investors unrelated to either VWoA or VWAG.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Plaintiff does not claim that his cause of action arose from the German corporation\u2019s direct transaction of any business in New York in order to bring the defendant within the jurisdiction of our courts pursuant to CPLR 302 (subd. [a], par. 1), but argues that jurisdiction was properly acquired over the defendant VWAG because it is \u201c engaged in a systematic and regular course of business \u201d in New York which subjects it to our jurisdiction pursuant to CPLR 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Our most recent pronouncement in this area of the law, <em>Frummer </em>v. <em>Hilton Hotels Int. </em>(19 N Y 2d 533), reiterated the rule that a foreign corporation is amenable to suit in our courts if it is engaged in such a continuous and systematic course of</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u201c doing business \u201d in New York as to warrant a finding of its <em>\u201c </em>presence \u2019 \u2019 in this jurisdiction. <em>Frummer </em>held that Hilton (U. K.) was \u201c doing business \u201d in New York in the \u201c traditional sense\u201d because of services performed\u2014specifically publicity work and the making of final room reservations \u2014 by the Hilton Reservation Service as agent for Hilton (U. K.). The affiliate relationship existing between the Reservation Service and Hilton (U. K.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was significant only as it gave rise to an inference of an agency relationship. This \u201c valid inference \u2019 \u2019 may not, however, extend the actual scope of the agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>\u201c </em>The ' presence \u2019 of Hilton (U. K.) in New York,\u201d Chief Judge Fuld wrote, \u201c for purposes of jurisdiction, is established by the activities conducted here on its behalf by its agent, the Hilton Reservation Service, and the fact that the two are commonly owned is significant only because it gives rise to a valid inference as to the broad scope of the agency in the absence of an express agency agreement such as the one which existed in the <em>Berner </em>case (3 NY 2d 1003, <em>supra).\u201d (Frummer </em>v. <em>Hilton Hotels Int., supra, </em>at p. 538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In the case before us, however, the undisputed facts do not give rise to a valid inference of agency. Concededly, WorldWide is an independently owned corporation, in no way directly related to VWAG-, and related to VWoA only by way of a \u201c Distributor Agreement \u201d, Under this agreement, World-Wide purchases Volkswagen automobiles and parts outright from VWoA, takes possession at dock in Newark, New Jersey, and resells same to local Volkswagen dealers in its franchise area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Where, as here, there exists truly separate corporate entities, not commonly owned, a valid inference of agency cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">One point remains \u2014 whether jurisdiction was properly acquired over VWAG by reason of the \u201ccontrol \u201d the foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>corporation exerts over World-Wide and the franchise dealers in the State. Specifically, plaintiff asserts that VWAG maintains a rigid control over World-Wide and its dealers by requiring\": (1) sale by each dealer of a minimum number of automobiles upon penalty of forfeiture of their dealer franchise; (2) uniform design for dealer service departments; (3) service personnel to be trained in Germany; (4) uniform purchase and sales prices, and (5) prior approval of prospective dealers. In substance, plaintiff asserts that such control by the defendant manufacturer over its representatives in the State constitutes <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>doing business \u2019 \u2019 sufficient to warrant the inference of \u201c presence \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Aside from the fact that these assertions are seriously disputed by the foreign corporation, this court has never held a foreign corporation present on the basis of control, unless there was in existence at least a parent-subsidiary relationship. <em>(Taca Int. Airlines, S. A. </em>v. <em>Rolls-Royce of England, </em>15 N Y 2d 97; <em>Public Administrator of County of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Royal Bank of Canada, </em>19 N Y 2d 127.) The control over the subsidiary\u2019s activities, we held, must be so complete that the subsidiary is, in fact, merely a department of the parent. (See <em>Public Administrator of County of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Royal Bank of Canada, supra.) </em>Even if World-Wide were a subsidiary of VWAG, which it is not, the alleged control activities of VWAG would not be sufficient to make World-Wide a mere department of VWAG. (See, e. g., <em>Fergus Motors </em>v. <em>Standard-Triumph Motor Co., </em>130 F. Supp. 780.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Nor does advertising in New York media by VWoA permit a different result. Even if these activities by VWoA were to be found attributable to VWAG, they still would constitute no more than \u201c mere solicitation \u201d. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Surf Props., </em>4 N Y 2d 475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The court\u2019s attention has been directed to <em>Qelfand </em>v. <em>Tanner Motor Tours </em>(385 F. 2d 116), where the plaintiffs, New York residents, were injured in the course of defendants\u2019 package tours to the Grand Canyon. The only contact of defendant corporations to New York State was membership in a nonprofit corporation organized under Maryland law which, in turn, generated publicity and contracted with a New York travel agent who \u2018 \u2018 Until informed * * * that space was no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>available * * * confirmed reservations, except group reservations, without obtaining Las Vegas\u2019 approval.\u201d <em>(Gelfand </em>v. <em>Tanner Motor Tours, sufra, </em>at p. 119.) The nature of the agency relationship was clear in <em>Gelfand, </em>since the New York agent was authorized to make final reservations, rather than merely confirming availabilities, and the additional factor was present that the purchase of the tour tickets took place in New York. We would only add that mere sales of a manufacturer\u2019s product in New York, however substantial, have never made the foreign corporation manufacturer amenable to suit in this jurisdiction. Thus, we conclude that VWAG- was not <em>\u201c </em>doing business \u201d in New York in the traditional sense and, therefore, our courts did not acquire personal jurisdiction over the foreign corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Order reversed, without costs, and the complaint dismissed. Question certified answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\">. The relationship between VWAG and VWoA is governed by a written agreement, designated \u201cExclusive Importer Agreement\u201d, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">\u201cExclusive Importer [VWoA] will transact all business pursuant to this Agreement on its own behalf and for its own account; it has no power or authority whatsoever to act as agent or otherwise for or on account or on behalf of VW [VWAG].?\u2019</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. Hilton (U. K.) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hilton Hotels Int., Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was, in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hilton Hotels Corporation, also a Delaware corporation. Hilton Hotels International and Hilton Hotels Corporation jointly owned the Hilton Credit Corp., a Delaware corporation, one branch of which was the Hilton Reservation Service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">.
