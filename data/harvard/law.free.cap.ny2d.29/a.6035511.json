Stevens, <em>Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division -of the Supreme Court, First Judicial Department, under the authority vested in him by section 22 of article VI of the State Constitution, requested Chief Judge </em>Stanley H. Fuld <em>to convene a Court on the Judiciary \u201c to consider matters involving the conduct of </em>Mitchell D. Schweitzer, <em>a Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New Yorh, First Judicial District\u201d. A letter of that date from Presiding Justice </em>Stevens <em>to the Chief Judge regd as folloivs:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">\u201c The New York State Joint Legislative Committee on Crime, Its Causes, Control and Effect on Society, of which the Honorable John H. Hughes is Chairman, has conducted Legislative Hearings involving the Honorable Mitchell D. Schweitzer, a Justice of the Supreme Court in this Department. Recently, a more complete transcript of the hearings were sent to me and, I am informed, to you also as Chief Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Initially, upon receiving a digest of the testimony and with the consent of the Joint Legislative Committee to its release, I referred the matter to the Judiciary Relations Committee of this Department, of which the Honorable William C. Heoht, Jr. is chairman. This Committee was to investigate, study and make a report of its findings to this court. Within the past week an extensive transcript and digest of the legislative hearings was released by the Legislative Committee to the press. Because of the extensive publication of the charges as contained in the transcripts, it has been concluded, after consultation with my Associates, that the effectiveness of any action by the Judiciary Relations Committee has been impaired and that a wider forum is desirable in fairness to the Justice involved and for the protection of the integrity of the courts as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Therefore, pursuant to Article 6, section 22, subdivision d, of the Constitution of the State of New York, I respectfully request that you as Chief Judge convene a Court on the Judiciary to consider the charges contained in the Legislative Report against the Honorable Mitchell D. Schweitzer, and make such disposition as in the opinion of such court is warranted. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b997-2\"><em>On January 21,1971, pursuant to Presiding Justice </em>Steven\u2019s <em>request and in accordance with section 22 (subd. d) of article VI of the New York State Constitution, Chief Judge </em>Stanley H. Fuld <em>convened the Court on the Judiciary. The Court on the Judiciary is composed of Hon. </em>Stanley H. Fuld, <em>Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, who is Presiding Officer of the Court on the Judiciary; Hon. </em>John F. Scileppi, <em>Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals; Hon. </em>Louis J. Capozzoli, <em>Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Department; Hon. </em>James D. Hopkins, <em>Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Second Department; Hon. J. </em>Clarence Herlihy, <em>Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Department, and Hon. </em>Frank Del Vecchio, <em>Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Fourth Department. Associate Judge </em>John F. Scileppi <em>was designated by order of the Court of Appeals to sit in the place of the Senior Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals due to the latter\u2019s absence at the time. Each of these Justices of the Appellate Division was designated as a member of the Court on the Judiciary by a concurrence of a majority of the Justices of his respective Appellate Division.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-3\"><em>On February 12, 1971 the court sat, appointed Raymond J. Cannon as Clerk of the Court, and designated Lawrence E. Walsh of New York, New York, an attorney at law, to act as counsel to conduct the proceeding entitled: \u201c In the Matter of the Proceedings pursuant to Section 22 of Article VI of the Constitution of the State of New York in Relation to </em>Mitchell D. Schweitzer, <em>Justice of the Supreme Court, First Judicial District \u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">\n<em>Three subsequent sessions of the court were held at Albany on March 4, June 11 and September 2, 1971 at which Rules of Procedure were adopted, assistant counsel were appointed, counsel designated to conduct the proceeding was authorized to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents and upon motion therefor an order was entered granting immunity to and directing two witnesses to testify after they had refused to answer questions on the ground that their testimony might incriminate them.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b998-2\">Rules of Procedure of Court on Judiciary</p>\n<p id=\"AqUK\">Rule I</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\">The Chief Judge of the State of New York shall act as the presiding officer of this court.

Schweitzer <em>and are in a form fairly permitting an answer, it was directed that said charges be preferred against </em>Mitchell D. Schweitzer, <em>Justice of the Supreme Court, First Judicial District, by the service upon him of the Notice of Charges and Charges, with opportunity for him to answer within 20 days.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-3\">\n<em>Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">I. Justice Schweitzer suffered his conduct to justify THE IMPRESSION THAT NATHAN VOLOSHEN COULD IMPROPERLY INFLUENCE HIM AND UNDULY ENJOY HIS FAVOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">1. From 1960 through 1969, Justice Schweitzer openly and publicly accepted the entertainment and close friendship of Nathan Voloshen. During this period and prior thereto Voloshen\u2019s primary occupation was that of a professional influence-peddler.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">2. Justice Schweitzer knew, or with the exercise of care should have known, the true nature of Voloshen\u2019s business and activities, in that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">(a) Voloshen intensified his cultivation of Justice Schweitzer after Justice Schweitzer became a Judge of the Court of General Sessions. After Justice Schweitzer became a Justice of the Supreme Court, Voloshen entertained him publicly almost weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">(b) As early as 1960, Voloshen disclosed the illicit nature of his activities when he, with Justice Schweitzer\u2019s knowledge, arranged for Justice Schweitzer to receive a substantial gift of shrubs from Theodore Kordus, a nurseryman who Justice Schweitzer knew was seeking, with Voloshen\u2019s assistance, improper governmental influence in connection with a State condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-2\">(c) Justice Schweitzer knew that Voloshen\u2019s \u201c public relations \u201d business consisted of getting favorable action for his clients from governmental agencies and, in connection therewith, cultivating friendship with influential persons in government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\">(d) In 1966 and thereafter, Voloshen, who Justice Schweitzer knew was not a practicing attorney in the State of New York, arranged meetings between Justice Schweitzer and lawyers who had matters pending before him and before other Justices of the Supreme Court of the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">3. Notwithstanding his knowledge of the aforesaid facts, Justice. Schweitzer continued his relationship with Voloshen and continued to be his public guest for restaurant dinners and other entertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">4. After Voloshen came under investigation for influence-peddling by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and by a Grand Jury of that District, Justice Schweitzer continued to dine with him publicly, to counsel with him, and, on at least one occasion, to participate with him in questioning a witness who was about to testify before the Grand Jury about Voloshen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">5. Between September 1, 1968 and March 11, 1969, after the intercession of Voloshen, Justice Schweitzer intervened with various New York State officials on behalf of Manuel Bello, a prisoner reputed to be an agent of an organized criminal syndicate. After these efforts proved unsuccessful, Justice Schweitzer released the prisoner on specious legal and humanitarian grounds. In order to do this he knowingly misled an Assistant District Attorney by withholding facts in order to get his consent to part of his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">6. After a meeting arranged by Voloshen between Justice Schweitzer and defense counsel, Stanley Reiben, Justice Schweitzer on May 12,1969, without any presentence investigation, resentenced and released from prison Raymond Freda, who was serving consecutive sentences for several misdemeanors. Freda had been previously convicted of separate and successive charges of robbery from the person, burglary and bank robbery. Freda was believed by the FBI to be \u201c the most notorious criminal in New Jersey \u201d, and was believed by other law enforcement authorities to be implicated in several bank burglaries and armed robberies in addition to those for which he was convicted and in schooling young persons in criminal practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-3\">7. By his relationship with Voloshen and by the acts heretofore described:</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">(a) Justice Schweitzer failed to keep his official conduct free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety and failed to maintain his personal behavior beyond reproach, in violation of Canon 4 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">(b) Justice Schweitzer suffered his conduct to justify the impression that certain persons could improperly influence him and unduly enjoy his favor, in violation of Canon 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">(c) Justice Schweitzer permitted private interviews, arguments and communications designed to influhis judicial action, in violation of Canon 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">(d) Justice Schweitzer used the power of his office and the influence of his name to promote the business interests of others, in violation of Canon 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">(e) Justice Schweitzer failed to refrain from relations which would normally tend to arouse the suspicion that these relations warped and biased his judgment and prevented his impartial attitude of mind in the administration of his judicial duties, in violation of Canon 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">(f) Justice Schweitzer accepted presents and favors from a person directly or indirectly practicing before him, in violation of Canon 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-2\">(g) Justice Schweitzer was not careful to avoid action which might tend to awaken the suspicion that his social relations and friendships constitute an element influencing his judicial conduct, in violation of Canon 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\">(h) Justice Schweitzer did not maintain his conduct above reproach; he did not administer justice according to law; and he allowed his private interests and those of his friends to interfere with the performance of his judicial duties, in violation of Canon 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">II. In the case oe People v. Manuel Bello, Justice Schweitzer conspired with Nathan Voloshen to OBSTRUCT JUSTICE AND, IN EURTHERANCE OE THAT CONSPIRACY, DID OBSTRUCT JUSTICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">8. On October 25, 1967, Manuel Bello pleaded guilty before Justice Schweitzer to the crime of attempted concealment and withholding of stolen securities. On December 11, 1967, he was sentenced by Justice Schweitzer to State prison for a term of from one year and three months minimum to two years and six months maximum. Under, such a sentence he was eligible for parole consideration in ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">9. On July 5, 1968, Bello\u2019s counsel moved for resentence on the ground that the defendant had been suffering from a chronic coronary ailment, that this fact had not been brought to the attention of Justice Schweitzer at time of sentence and that the defendant was currently suffering from this disease in prison. On July 22, 1968, Justice Schweitzer summarily denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">10. In late August, 19.68, Voloshen first became active on behalf of Bello. On and after that date he and Justice Schweitzer, with intent to obstruct justice and to obstruct the proper administration of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the Office of the District Attorney of New York County, and the New York State Division of Parole, and with intent to obstruct and interfere with the administration of law and the proper performance by public servants of their official functions, agreed and conspired to secure Bello\u2019s release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-2\">11. Thereafter and in pursuance of that agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-3\">(a) In the months of September through November, 1968, Justice Schweitzer, on the basis of substantially the same information submitted to him on Bello\u2019s motion for resentence, which he had summarily denied, interceded on behalf of Bello with the Division of Parole and the Commissioner of Correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">(b) In December, 1968, after having been paid a substantial sum of money on behalf of Bello, Yoloshen retained Henry Blumenthal to represent Bello in bringing a motion <em>coram nobis </em>to set aside his plea of guilty on the claim that Bello had not realized that he had pleaded to a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">(c) In mid-January, 1969, Yoloshen arranged a meeting between Justice Schweitzer, Henry Blumenthal and Yoloshen in order to discuss the <em>coram nobis </em>motion to be made before Justice Schweitzer. At this meeting or a subsequent meeting, Justice Schweitzer told Blumenthal that there were no valid grounds for permitting the withdrawal of the plea of guilty, but that Bello might prevail on <em>\u201c </em>humanitarian \u201d grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">(d) The motion was submitted by Blumenthal on February 5, 1969 and Bello was ordered to be produced in New York for a hearing on March 11,1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">(e) While Bello was in New York awaiting his hearing, Bello complained of the subjective symptoms of a heart attack and was sent to Bellevue Hospital, where he was examined and treated by its staff. Blumenthal and Yoloshen arranged to have the prisoner there examined by Yoloshen\u2019s personal physician, pursuant to an ex parte order of Justice Schweitzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">(f) On March 11,1969, the date of the motion, Justice Schweitzer prevailed upon an Assistant District Attorney unfamiliar with the case to undertake to consent to the motion for the withdrawal of Bello\u2019s plea of guilty by disclosing to him only those facts favorable to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-2\">(g) After Bello\u2019s plea was withdrawn, he again pleaded guilty to the same crime. Although Justice Schweitzer could have reimposed the same sentence or a longer sentence, he resentenced Bello to time already served and released him forthwith. He did this on specious \u2018 \u2018 humanitarian \u2019 \u2019 grounds without any presentence investigation, solely on the basis of the report of Voloshen\u2019s personal physician and without questioning any treating physician or examining the records of Bellevue Hospital, which contradicted Bello\u2019s medical claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\">12. In his conduct of this case, Justice Schweitzer, pursuant to his agreement with Voloshen, knowingly released a person previously reported to him by the Probation Department and the State Division of Parole to be a reputed member of a criminal syndicate and the operator of a cocktail lounge at which liquor and narcotics were sold to minors. By so doing, he obstructed justice as administered by his own court, obstructed and interfered with the proper administration of law and obstructed and interfered with the administration of the New York State Division of Parole, which had denied parole after a review of Bello\u2019s criminal background and medical claims. In so doing, he dealt deceitfully with the Assistant District Attorney who was relying on his candor and obstructed and interfered with the administration of the Office of the District Attorney of New York County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">13. By these acts Justice Schweitzer, with intent to obtain. a benefit for Bello and Voloshen, committed acts relating to his office which constituted an unauthorized exercise of his official functions, knowing that these acts were unauthorized, and refrained from performing a duty which was imposed upon him by law and which was inherent in the nature of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">14. By his agreement with Voloshen and by the acts heretofore described:</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">(a) Justice Schweitzer failed to avoid infractions of law (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 105.00, 195.00 and 195.05), in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-2\">(b) Justice Schweitzer failed to keep his official conduct free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety and failed to maintain his personal behavior beyond reproach, in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-3\">(c) Justice Schweitzer suffered his conduct to justify the impression that certain persons could improperly influence him and unduly enjoy his favor, in violation of Canon 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">(d) Justice Schweitzer permitted private interviews, arguments and communications designed to influence his judicial action, in violation of Canon 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">(e) Justice Schweitzer used the power of his office and the influence of his name to promote the business interests of others, in violation of Canon 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">(f) Justice Schweitzer was not careful to avoid action which might tend to awaken the suspicion that his social relations and friendships constitute an element influencing his judicial conduct, in violation of Canon 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">(g) Justice Schweitzer did not maintain his conduct above reproach; he- did not administer justice according to law; and he allowed his private interests and those of his friends to interfere with the performance of his judicial duties, in violation of Canon 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">III. In the case of People v. Michael Raymond, Justice Schweitzer and Stanley Polley conspired to OBSTRUCT JUSTICE AND, IN FURTHERANCE OF THAT CONSPIRACY, DID OBSTRUCT JUSTICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">15. On October 26, 1956 Michael Raymond pleaded guilty before Justice Schweitzer to three counts of grand larceny in the first degree. The amount of the larceny was over $80,000. In order to permit Raymond to make restitution, sentence was adjourned to May 20, 1957 and Raymond was placed under probation supervision. Raymond had submitted securities worth approximately $25,000 to his attorney as part of the restitution and had also deposited with the Probation Department $11,000, part of which consisted of two checks each in the amount of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\">16. In a series of reports submitted by the Probation Department during February, March and May of 1957, Justice Schweitzer was informed that Raymond had only superficially complied with the reporting requirements of the Probation Department, that he had failed to comply with the restitution order that required monthly payments; that he had failed to give credible evidence of legitimate employment, and that while under probation supervision he had been arrested for the issuance of three checks forged under an assumed name. The Probation Department also reported to Justice Schweitzer that the two $5,000 checks given to commence restitution had both been returned for lack of funds. In February the Department requested advice from Justice Schweitzer as to whether Raymond\u2019s appearance for sentence should be accelerated and subsequently requested a warrant for Raymond\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">17. In early March, 1957 Raymond met with Stanley Polley, a nonlawyer and personal friend of Justice Schweitzer. On that occasion Raymond agreed to pay Polley to exert improper influence on Justice Schweitzer in order to delay Raymond\u2019s commitment and in order to secure a light sentence. Thereafter Raymond did in fact pay Polley $25,000 for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">18. In early March, 1957 Justice Schweitzer, Stanley Polley and Michael Raymond, with intent to obstruct justice and the due administration of the laws of the State of New York, agreed and conspired to delay Raymond\u2019s sentence and to obtain for Raymond a lenient sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">19. In pursuance of said agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">(a) In early March, 1957, Stanley Polley spoke with Justice Schweitzer by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">(b) In early March, 1957, Stanley Polley and Michael Raymond drove to the Concourse Plaza Hotel at which time Stanley Polley spoke with Justice Schweitzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-2\">(c) On or about March 11, 1957, Justice Schweitzer granted Michael Raymond a 60-day adjournment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-3\">(d) From on or about May 13, 1957 to May 23, 1958, Justice Schweitzer granted successive adjournments of the sentence of Michael Raymond in disregard of consistent reports by the Probation Department that Raymond had refused to give them credible evidence of legitimate employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">(e) On June 25, 1958, notwithstanding consistent adverse reports concerning the activities of Michael Raymond as well as a criminal indictment returned against Raymond for crimes committed during the period of his probation supervision, Justice Schweitzer imposed on Raymond concurrent sentences of only eight months on each of the three counts of grand larceny in the original case and on one count of petty larceny in the subsequent separate indictment, thus enabling Raymond to be paroled in four and a half months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">20. By his agreement with Stanley Polley and Michael Raymond and by the acts heretofore described:</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">(a) Justice Schweitzer failed to avoid infractions of law (former Penal Law, \u00a7 580), in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">(b) Justice Schweitzer in his official conduct failed to keep himself free of impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">(c) Justice Schweitzer suffered his conduct to justify the impression that certain persons could improperly influence him and unduly enjoy his favor, in violation of Canon 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">(d) Justice Schweitzer failed to refrain from relations which would normally tend to arouse the suspicion that these relations warped and biased his judgment and prevented his impartial attitude of mind in the administration of his judicial duties, in violation of Canon 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-2\">(e) Justice Schweitzer was not careful to avoid action which might tend to awaken the suspicion that his social relations and friendships constitute an element influencing his judicial conduct, in violation of Canon 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\">(f) Justice Schweitzer did not maintain his conduct above reproach; he did not administer justice according to law; and he allowed his private interests and those of his friends to interfere with the performance of his judicial duties, in violation of Canon 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">IV. In the case op Schine v. Schine, Justice Schweitzer ATTEMPTED TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">21. <em>Schine </em>v. <em>Schine, </em>a matrimonial case, was pending in the Supreme Court of New York County in April, 1968, but not before Justice Schweitzer. Mrs. Schine was represented by Jacob Rappoport, a close friend of Justice Schweitzer ; Mr. Schine was represented by Richard Weis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">22. Immediately before trial was to commence, at the request of his friends Jacob Rappoport and Nathan Voloshen, Justice Schweitzer appeared at a restaurant meeting of Weis, Rappoport and Voloshen and attempted to coerce a settlement favorable to Rappoport\u2019s client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">23. On April 29, 1968, Justice Schweitzer, in a restaurant and in full view of the parties and their attorneys, made a public display of meeting privately with the Justice assigned to the case, thereby giving the appearance that he was interceding further in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">24. By his relationship with Jacob Rappoport and Nathan Voloshen and the acts heretofore described:</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">(a) Justice Schweitzer in his official conduct failed to keep himself free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">(b) Justice Schweitzer suffered his conduct to justify the impression that certain persons could improperly influence him and unduly enjoy his favor, in violation of Canon 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-2\">(e) Justice Schweitzer used the power of his office and the influence of his name to promote the business interests of others, in violation of Canon 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-3\">V. Justice Schweitzer improperly interceded with STATE AGENCIES ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">25. In the case of Manuel Bello, Justice Schweitzer, at the request of Nathan Voloshen, interceded both with the Correction Department to assist Bello to develop evidence favorable to his release and with the Division of Parole to obtain favorable consideration for Bello\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">26. In the case of Leo D\u2019Angelo, Justice Schweitzer, at the request of his friends William Levine and Henry Garfinkle, interceded with the Division of Parole in order to relax the supervision of D\u2019Angelo\u2019s parole contrary to the accepted practice of said Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">27. In the case of Corey Feldman, who was sentenced in Nassau County by another Judge, Justice Schweitzer, at the request of his friend Samuel Goldberg, interceded with the Correction Department to arrange Feldman\u2019s transfer from Elmira Reformatory to Greenhaven Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">28. By the acts heretofore described:</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">(a) Justice Schweitzer failed to keep his official conduct free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">(b) Justice Schweitzer suffered his conduct to justify the impression that certain persons could improperly influence him and unduly enjoy his favor, in violation of Canon 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">(c) Justice Schweitzer was not careful to avoid action which might tend to awaken the suspicion that his social relationships and friendships constitute an element influencing his judicial conduct, in violation of Canon 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">(d) Justice Schweitzer did not maintain his conduct above reproach, in violation of Canon 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-2\">VI. Justice Schweitzer\u2019s private business activities WERE INCONSISTENT WITH HIS JUDICIAL DUTIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">A. Justice Schweitzer Acted Inconsistently With His Judicial Office by Engaging in Money Lending Activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">29. At least since 1963, Justice Schweitzer was extended substantial unsecured loans by the Royal National Bank, at the prime interest rate or below it, and from time to time reloaned this money at substantially higher interest rates to money lenders, for second mortgages and for taxicab chattel mortgages. He also used the proceeds of these loans to buy securities. In order to borrow for these purposes he made false statements as to the purpose of these loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">30. By the acts heretofore described :</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">(a) Justice Schweitzer failed to keep his official conduct free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety and failed to maintain his personal behavior beyond reproach, in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">(b) Justice Schweitzer incurred obligations which appeared to interfere and be inconsistent with the proper administration of his judicial functions, in violation of Canon 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">(c) Justice Schweitzer used the power of his office and the influence of his name to promote his own private interests and the private interests of others, in violation of Canon 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">(d) Justice Schweitzer was not careful to avoid action which might tend to awaken suspicion that his social and business relations and friendships constitute an element influencing his judicial conduct, in violation of Canon 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">(e) Justice Schweitzer did not maintain his conduct above reproach, in violation of Canon 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">B. Justice Schweitzer\u2019s Substantial Interests in Taxicab and Finance Companies Were Incompatible With Membership in a Court Before Which Such Enterprises Were Frequent Litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-2\">31. Prior to becoming a Judge, Justice Schweitzer was an active taxicab fleet operator. He continued his beneficial interest in a sizeable fleet during the first five years of his service on the Municipal Court. Thereafter, he continued to hold chattel mortgages on a substantial number of taxicabs from time to time. In addition, while on the Supreme Court, he made substantial loans to local finance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-3\">32. By the acts heretofore described:</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">(a) Justice Schweitzer failed to keep his official conduct free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, in violation of Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">(b) Justice Schweitzer incurred obligations which appeared to interfere and be inconsistent with the proper administration of his judicial functions, in violation of Canon 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">(c) Justice Schweitzer made personal investments in enterprises which were apt to be involved in litigation in the court of which he was a member, in violation of Canon 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">(d) Justice Schweitzer did not maintain his conduct above reproach, in violation of Canon 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">VII. Although afforded the opportunity to explain his conduct, Justice Schweitzer has failed to do so AND HE HAS NOT BEEN CANDID IN HIS SWORN TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CRIME, BEFORE THE GrRAND JURY OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT Court for the Southern District of New York, and BEFORE COUNSEL DESIGNATED BY THIS COURT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">33. With respect to Nathan Voloshen:</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">(a) Justice Schwitzer claims that although he had dinner with him almost weekly for over five years he never once inquired as to what Voloshen actually did for his \u201c public relations \u201d clients or for any one of them and that Voloshen never told him what he actually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">(b) Justice Schweitzer has given conflicting and evasive testimony as to Theodore Kordus \u2019 desire for his assistance, the size of Kordus\u2019 gift and the implicit purpose of the gift.</p>\n<p id=\"A8DT\">(c) Justice Schweitzer has given conflicting and evasive testimony as to his conversations with Voloshen regarding the case of Manuel Bello in an effort to exclude or minimize his participation with Voloshen in conversations with Bello\u2019s lawyer, Henry Blumenthal, and his prior knowledge of the desire of certain Massachusetts Congressmen to obtain favorable consideration for Bello.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">(d) In May, 1971, while being examined by the Grand Jury of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Justice Schweitzer caused Elmer Reeves, Chief Probation Officer of New York County, to prepare and file an exculpatory statement of Justice Schweitzer\u2019s handling of the resentence of Raymond Freda, even though Justice Schweitzer knew that the Probation Department had made no investigation of Freda and that Reeves had no knowledge regarding Freda which would support the statement or the impression intended to be created by the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">(e) Justice Schweitzer has given conflicting and evasive testimony in order to minimize his participation with Voloshen in the preparation of Voloshen\u2019s attempted defense when under investigation by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Grand Jury of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">(f) Justice Schweitzer has,_ given conflicting and \u2022 evasive testimony with respect to the size and frequency of gifts from Nathan Voloshen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">34. With respect to Stanley Polley and Michael Raymond, Justice Schweitzer has denied any recollection whatever of the Michael Raymond case, although it was pending before him for approximately two full years, from June 25, 1956 to June 25, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-2\">35. With respect to Jacob Rappoport, Justice Schweitzer has given conflicting and evasive testimony in an effort to minimize and distort his participation in Rappoport\u2019s effort to use Justice Schweitzer\u2019s judicial power and prestige to coerce a settlement from Rappoport\u2019s opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-3\">36. Justice Schweitzer has given evasive testimony with respect to the extent of his efforts to relax the supervision of Leo D\u2019Angelo\u2019s parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">Lawrence E.

Harold A. Stevens, Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Judicial Department, under the authority vested in him by section 22 (d) of the Constitution requested me as Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals to convene the Court on the Judiciary to consider matters involving the conduct of Mitchell D.

Stanley H. Fuld, Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, who is Presiding Officer of the Court on the Judiciary; Hon. John F. Scileppi, Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals; Hon. Louis J. Capozzoli, Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Department; Hon. James D. Hopkins, Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Second Department; Hon. J. Clarence Herlihy, Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Department, and Hon. Frank Del Vecchio, Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Fourth Department. Associate Judge F. Scileppi was designated by order of the Court of Appeals to sit in the place of the Senior Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals due to the latter\u2019s absence at the time. Each of these Justices of the Appellate Division was designated as a member of the Court on the Judiciary by a concurrence of a majority of the Justices of his respective Appellate Division;</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\">\u201c (4) The court sat on February 12,1971, appointed Raymond J. Cannon, Clerk of the Court, and designated Lawrence E. Walsh of New York, New York, an attorney at law, to act as counsel to conduct proceedings entitled: \u2018 In the Matter of the Proceedings pursuant to Section 22 of Article 6 of the Constitution in relation to Mitchell D. Schweitzer, Justice of the Supreme Court, First Judicial District \u2019;</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">\u201c (5) Three subsequent sessions of the Court were held at Albany on March 4, June 11 and September 2, 1971 at which Rules of Procedure were adopted, Assistant Counsel were appointed, Counsel Designated to Conduct the Proceeding was authorized to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents and upon motion therefor an order was entered granting immunity to and directing two witnesses to testify after they had refused to answer questions on the ground that their testimony might incriminate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">\u201c (6) Thereafter, and on September 23, 1971 the said Court on the Judiciary met in Albany at which session Charges were presented to the Court by Counsel Designated to Conduct the Proceedings based upon his investigation and, the Court having determined preliminarily, pursuant to Rule VII of the Rules heretofore adopted, that said Charges state facts sufficient, if true, to constitute cause for removal of respondent Mitchell D. Schweitzer and are in a form fairly permitting an answer, it was directed that said Charges be preferred against Mitchell D. Schweitzer, Justice of the Supreme Court, First Judicial District by the service upon him of the Notice of Charges and Charges, a copy of each of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, with opportunity for him to answer within twenty (20) days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-3\"><em>\u201c </em>(7) Pursuant to the authority conferred on the Court on the Judiciary by section 22 (d) of the Constitution and, in accordance with Bule X of the Buies of Procedure adopted herein, it was ordered that said Mitchell D.

Schweitzer <em>for reconsideration of the court\u2019s decision and order entered September 23,1971 and upon such consideration adhered to the original decision. The order of the court read as follows:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">A motion having been made on behalf of Mitchell D. Schweitzer, the respondent herein, for reconsideration of the court\u2019s decision and order entered September 23, 1971 insofar as respondent is therein suspended without pay from the exercise of his office of Justice of the Supreme Court, First Judicial District, pending the conclusion of these proceedings, subject to his right to receive the salary of his office during the period of this suspension in the event of the ultimate dismissal of the charges herein preferred or to be preferred, and, upon such reconsideration, for an order striking the provision suspending respondent without pay, and, papers having been submitted in support of the motion and in opposition thereto, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Ordered, that the motion for reconsideration be, and the same hereby is, granted and, upon such reconsideration, the original decision is adhered to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">\n<em>The court\u2019s decision Per Curiam read:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b1022-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZT\">In its order of September 23, 1971, this court, having found, \u201c preliminarily,\u201d that the charges of misconduct filed against the respondent \u201c state fact sufficient, if true, to constitute cause for removal,\u201d ordered that he be suspended without pay. The respondent now moves for reconsideration of that order. In our view, section 22 of article VI of the State Constitution, as well as the rules of this court, authorizes the Court on the Judiciary to suspend without pay a Judge or Justice following the filing of charges of misconduct against him. The court does, .of course, have discretion to provide for the payment of salary during the period of suspension on a proper showing. We would only add that, if the facts adduced upon the hearing do not establish cause for removal of the respondent, he will be entitled to his salary from the date of his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">The motion for reconsideration should be granted and, upon such reconsideration, the original decision adhered to.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-10\"> This reference and all subsequent reference to the Canons are references to the Canons of Judicial Ethics adopted by the New York State Bar Association, January 29, 1909, as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1023-2\">Capozzoli, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ARj\">The Court on the Judiciary was created by section 22 of article VI of the New York State Constitution as a court of limited jurisdiction with such powers as specifically spelled out. Subdivision d of the quoted section provides, amongst other things, \u2018 \u2018 The court in its discretion may suspend the judge or justice from the exercise of his office pending the determination of the removal or retirement proceedings before the court \u201d. Subdivision g of the same section provides that the Court of the Judiciary shall have such further powers as may be provided by law. It is conceded that there is no precedent for the action of this court in suspending this respondent without pay. Therefore, it is necessary to look into the general law which has been heretofore applied in the suspension of public officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-3\">In <em>Matter of Skinkle </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(221 App. Div. 301), the court construed the meaning of the word \u201c suspension\u201d as used in the rule under which the petitioner was suspended by his superior. This was done in order to arrive at a determination as to whether the suspension could be without salary. It held that the pay could not be withheld pending trial. At pages 303-304 the court said: \u201c There is not in this section authority for the order withholding Skinkle\u2019s pay * * * the chief of police is authorized to suspend from duty any patrolman until the commissioner takes action upon the charges pending against the officer suspended. The chief is not authorized, however, to withhold his pay pending trial of the charges * * *. Had it been intended to confer authority to withhold pay pending charges we think it would have been so expressed in the rule or the charter and thus we cannot think that the authority to withhold pay may be implied from the authority to suspend from duties \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">In the absence of a specific statutory authorization, the pay of a government employee cannot be withheld while under suspension pending trial. <em>(Matter of Gould </em>v. <em>Looney, </em>60 Misc 2d 973.) In the last-cited case at page 978, the court said: \u201c There is good reason to be chary of pay-withholding power where there is no specific statutory grant. Just as the courts would not infer a power to suspend simply from a power to remove [citing case] this court will not infer a power to withhold pay from the naked power to suspend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-2\">Under the State Constitution in article VI (\u00a7 25, subd. a) it is provided that \u201c The compensation of a judge * * * shall not be diminished during the term of office for which he was elected \u2019 This provides an additional reason why the respondent should not be deprived of his salary during suspension. He has not vacated his office. While it is true that he cannot function as a Justice of the Supreme Court because of the suspension, he is nevertheless still a Justice of the Supreme Court until he is dismissed or resigns. He is entitled to a trial on the charges filed against him, and to take away his salary before his trial is tantamount to punishing him as though he were already found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Scileppi, Hopimsrs, Herlihy and Del Vecchio concur; Judge Capozzoli dissents and votes to eliminate from the original order the provision that such suspension be without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Motion for reconsideration granted and, upon reconsideration, the original decision is adhered to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-2\">Motion for Bill of Particulars</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-3\"><em>Also on November 22,1971 the court granted in part a motion made on behalf of </em>Mitchell D. Schweitzer <em>for a bill of particulars. The order of the court read:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><em>A </em>motion having been made on behalf of Mitchell D.
