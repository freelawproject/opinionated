After a fact-finding hearing was held, a determination was made that he had committed acts which, if done by an adult, would have constituted the crimes of sodomy in the first degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 130.50) and robbery in the third degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 160.05). A dispositional hearing followed\u2014in which the respondent was assigned a law guardian\u2014and he was subsequently committed to a New York State training school for an initial period of 18 months, subject, as provided for by statute (Family Ct. Act, \u00a7 756), to yearly extensions until he reached 18 years of age. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the Family Court decision, and the appeal is before us as of right on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Upon the fact-finding hearing, during which Lawrence was present with his mother, the judge informed the mother that the boy was entitled to counsel and would be assigned an attorney if she could not afford one. To her question, <em>\u201c </em>do you really think that he needs a lawyer? \u201d the judge responded, \u201c I do not know \u2019 \u2019. When the mother then said that her son had \u2018 \u2018 pleaded guilty \u201d and that she <em>\u201c </em>would like for him to have psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>treatment \u201d, the judge declared that he would \u201c accept that \u201d if she did not wish a lawyer and if the child would admit the charges. He then asked the boy, \u201c What do you say, son, yes? \u201d to which the boy replied, \u201c Yes, your Honor \u201d. The judge thereupon announced, \u2018 \u2018 Counsel is waived \u2019 \u2019 and, following a short interrogation, concluded, \u201c The boy admits allegations. Finding of fact is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The respondent urges that a child charged with juvenile delinquency cannot constitutionally waive his right to counsel and, in effect, plead guilty. We find it unnecessary to reach or consider that question since the present record demonstrates that there was no intelligent or understanding waiver of such right by either mother or son.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Although one accused of crime, and that includes a minor, may \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>intelligently and knowingly waive his * * * right to counsel either at a pretrial stage or at the trial \u201d <em>(Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478, 490, n. 14; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>R. N., </em>23 N Y 2d 963; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>38 Ill. 2d 559; but cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephen J. B., </em>23 N Y 2d 611, conditional habeas corpus writ issued <em>sub nom. United States ex rel. B. </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>430 F. 2d 215, modfg. and affg. 305 F. Supp. 55), the courts have become increasingly reluctant to accept such waivers unless made with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and probable consequences. (See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>355 U. S. 155, 161-162; <em>Von Moltke </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>332 U. S. 708, 724; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mulligan, </em>24 N Y 2d 948, 949; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>21 N Y 2d 338, 344-345; <em>People </em>v. <em>Seaton, </em>19 N Y 2d 404, 406.) \u201cTo be valid \u201d, the Supreme Court declared in the <em>Von Molthe </em>case (332 U. S. 708, 724, <em>supra), \u2018 \u2018 </em>such waiver must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.\u201d And, with respect to a juvenile charged as a delinquent, the courts have imposed particularly strict requirements before permitting a waiver of his right to counsel. In such cases, a \u201c <em>\u2018 </em>heavy burden \u2019 rests uppn the state to show a genuine waiver. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(United States ex rel. B. </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>430 F. 2d 215, 218, supra; see, also, <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>247 F. 2d 595, 596; <em>Shioutahon </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>236 F. 2d 666, 670; <em>United States ex rel. Brown </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>242 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Supp. 273, 278; cf. <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U. S. 1; <em>Matter of D. [Daniel], </em>27 N Y 2d 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In the present case, the hearing judge made no attempt to ascertain whether the 13-year-old respondent understood, or was capable of understanding, the nature of the charges against him, the importance of having a lawyer or, indeed, what a waiver of an attorney entailed. More, he did not endeavor to find out whether either mother or son realized the penalty that might be imposed\u2014institutionalization for upwards of five years\u2014nor did he alert them to possible defenses, other mitigating factors or the desirability of having counsel. (Cf., e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Plattner, </em>330 F. 2d 271, 276.) Under these circumstances, we may only conclude that, where one found to be a juvenile delinquent has not intelligently and understandingly waived the benefit of counsel and where the circumstances show that his rights could not have been fairly protected without counsel, the Due Process Clause invalidates the finding of delinquency. (See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>355 U. S. 155, 161, <em>supra, </em>involving a 17-year-old accused of crime.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the matter remitted to the Family Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Judges Burke, Scideppi, Bergan, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
