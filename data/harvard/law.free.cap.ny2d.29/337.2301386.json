There was no error when the People called a prospective witness who refused to take the stand on the ground that he knew nothing about the case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>La Bello, </em>24 N Y 2d 598, <em>sub nom. Piccirillo </em>v. <em>New York, </em>400 U. S. 548; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pollock, </em>21 N Y 2d 206.) IX.

The Statute of Limitations did not bar prosecution of Wheatman for conspiracy under section 580 of the former Penal Law, nor is the charge of conspiracy under section 581-a an ex post facto law as applied to appellant. <em>(Matter of Doyle, </em>257 N.

The People took an appeal to our court, following a grant of leave but, before that appeal was perfected, the Appellate Division, upon the District Attorney\u2019s application, granted a reargument with respect to the defendant Wheatman (33 A D 2d 1107). Upon the reargument, the court reversed itself and affirmed that defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that he lacked standing to challenge the validity of the warrants or the lawfulness of the subsequent search and seizure (34 A D 2d 3). Thus, we have before us an appeal by the People as to six of the defendants and an appeal by the seventh defendant, Wheatman. Since the People\u2019s appeal poses the central issue to be decided\u2014 namely, the sufficiency of the District Attorney\u2019s affidavit and the admissibility of documents introduced into evidence\u2014we consider that appeal first.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The People\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In 1965, the District Attorney of New York County undertook an investigation of an alleged bid-rigging conspiracy to prevent competitive bidding on publicly advertised contracts for painting at city housing projects. Involved, among others, were three painting contractor firms, an individual representative from each of them and Wheatman, who was an official of the New York City Housing Authority. In brief, the People claim that the painting contractors, acting together and in concert, reached a decision in each instance as to who would win the various advertised contracts as well as the prices to be bid. To succeed in their scheme, they required inside information concerning Housing Authority estimates for bidding, and this, it was asserted, they obtained, for a price, from Wheatman and other officials who headed the Authority\u2019s paint sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">During the course of the ensuing Grand Jury investigation, the Assistant District Attorney who was in charge of the inquiry, Mr. Joseph A. Phillips, applied to Supreme Court Justice Pine for the issuance of warrants to search the offices of the three corporate defendants and eleven other contracting companies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>He submitted in support of Ms application only Ms own affidavit, based in all important respects, according to Mm, upon testimony given before the Grand Jury. As indicated, it is the adequacy of this affidavit which is here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Mr. PMllips first stated what he personally knew about the contractors\u2014that is, that they had been doing business with the Housing Authority for a period of years and that the Authority had their addresses on file. He then went on to aver that he \u2018 \u2018 has heard the sworn testimony of a number of witnesses before the * * * Grand Jury who have stated that they were parties to an agreement to rig bids at the City Housing Authority \u201d and that such sworn testimony \u201c further reveals that each of the * * * contracting firms [listed in the' affidavit] has been identified as a party to the agreement to rig bids \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Phillips followed this with a summary of the testimony given by the witnesses which described the operation of the conspiracy: that Housing Authority employees prepared \u201c estimates of the man-days\u201d required on certain projects; that such estimates were solely for the internal use of the Authority; that the parties to the bid-rigging agreement obtained those estimates and \u2018 \u2018 utilized the information \u2019 \u2019 contained in them \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>to submit false bids \u201d; that Jerry Jerome, president of Jered Contracting Corp., was the person who obtained the estimate information and then passed copies of it on to the other parties to the agreement. Mr. PMllips concluded with the statement that, \u2018 \u2018 based upon the foregoing reliable information and upon my personal knowledge there is probable cause to believe that the estimate information has been wrongfully obtained from the Housing Authority, that it has been utilized by the parties to the agreement to submit false bids to the Housing Authority and that copies of the estimate information may be found in the files of each of the parties to the corrupt agreement at the addresses set forth [in the affidavit].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">On the strength of this affidavit, Judge Fine issued the warrants in question. They authorized the police to search the offices of the companies listed and to seize certain \u201c handwritten and typewritten copies of New York City Housing Authority painting estimate forms \u2019 \u2019. The search wMch followed turned up a number of forms, and the defendants, prior to trial, moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to suppress this evidence. The motion was denied on the ground that the affidavit \u2018 \u2018 spelled out in detail the circumstances from which a \u2018 neutral and detached magistrate could independently determine that probable cause existed for the warrant to issue.\u2019 \u201d Upon the trial, those forms were offered and received in evidence on the People\u2019s case to corroborate the testimony given by the witnesses who acknowledged being parties to the bid-rigging agreement. Although the jury found the defendants guilty, a sharply divided Appellate Division reversed the judgments of conviction and ordered a new trial (33 A D 2d 67). It was the view of the majority that Phillips\u2019 affidavit failed to inform the judge who issued the warrant <em>\u201c </em>of the underlying circumstances which support the conclusion and belief of the affiant that his informant was credible and his information reliable <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>25 N Y 2d [129], at p. 139) \u201d (33 A D 2d, at p. 69). It was the view of the two dissenting justices that \u2018 \u2018 the search warrant in this case conforms not only to the general principles applicable to all search warrants but more particularly to the test set forth in <em>Hendricks </em>\u2019 \u2019 (33 A D 2d, at p. 73).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">We agree with Appellate Division dissenters that Phillips\u2019 affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause and that, consequently, the warrants were valid, the search lawful and the evidence seized admissible. More specifically, the affidavit satisfied the test formulated by the Supreme Court (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573; <em>Whiteley </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>401 U. S. 560; <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S. 410; <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108) and, of course, by our court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bumper, </em>28 N Y 2d 296; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>25 N Y 2d 129.) It is settled, as those cases indicate, that, where the affidavit is based upon hearsay and not solely on the personal knowledge of the affiant, it must, in order to satisfy the law\u2019s requirements, set forth facts which will enable a magistrate to judge for himself (1) the reliability (or credibility) of the informant and (2) the reliability of his information. Only then can a reviewing court be satisfied that the magistrate has discharged his \u201c constitutional duty\u201d of reaching a neutral and independent determination that probable cause exists <em>(Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 415, <em>supra), </em>instead of serving merely as \u201ca rubber stamp\u201d for police or prosecution. <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 111, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Since the Appellate Division declared that the affidavit submitted by the District Attorney <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>fails to meet the two-pronged test \u201d (33 A D 2d, at p. 69), laid down in the decisions referred to, we treat, first, the question of the reliability of the so-called informants \u2014 the witnesses before the Grand Jury-\u2014whose \u201cinformation\u201d\u2014testimony in this case \u2014 Mr. Phillips relied upon and, second, the question whether \u201c the informant[s] had gained [their] information in a reliable way.\u201d <em>(Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S., at p. 417.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Although the informant\u2019s reliability is frequently established by a statement from the affiant that the informant is known to him and has in the past furnished information leading to the arrest and conviction of others or by a separate objective checking of the informant\u2019s story (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>25 N Y 2d 129, 133-134, <em>supra), </em>there are, of course, other circumstances demonstrating his probable reliability. For instance, our court, as well as others, have noted that a magistrate may rely upon the fact that the information was given under oath, that the statements were against the informant\u2019s penal interest and that two or more informants tended to confirm the information which each gave. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Montague, </em>19 N Y 2d 121, 125; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573, 583-584, <em>supra; Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 423, <em>supra </em>[per White, J., concurring] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fein, </em>4 Cal. 3d 747, 753; <em>Skelton </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>1 Cal. 3d 144, 151, 153; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>2 Cal. App. 3d 483, 488; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>488 P. 2d 565 [Col.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In the present case, not only did the informants furnish their information under oath before a Grand Jury but each testified against his penal interest as well \u2014 that is, each admitted that he was a party to a bid-rigging agreement \u2014 and at least two informants substantiated each other\u2019s testimony. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Fein, </em>4 Cal. 3d 747, 753, <em>supra; People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>488 P. 2d 565 [Col.], <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">This brings us to a discussion of the reliability of the information\u2014 the second \u201cprong\u201d of the test \u2014 and actually the crux of the controversy in the case before us. To satisfy this requirement, there must be sufficient information before the magistrate to enable him to deduce that the informant gained his information in a reliable manner, that is, that his conclusion that a crime has been committed rests on \u201c something more sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>stantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld * * * [or] * * * an offhand remark heard at a neighborhood bar. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 416-417, <em>supra.) </em>Here, the magistrate\u2019s finding of reliability depended not upon rumor but upon a sworn summary of testimony, from grand jury witnesses who had firsthand knowledge of the matters involved \u2014 a circumstance regarded as significant. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>25 N Y 2d 129, 134, supra; <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, 393 </em>U. S. 410, 416, <em>supra; People </em>v. <em>Hunger, </em>24 N Y 2d 445, 451; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montague, </em>19 N Y 2d 121, 125, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The firsthand character of the informants\u2019 information is evi- \u25a0 dent from the recital in the affidavit that a number of Grand Jury witnesses testified that \u201c <em>they </em>were parties to an agreement to rig bids that the companies named in the affidavit, including the corporate defendants, were also \u201c part[ies] to the agreement and that one of the defendants, Jerry Jerome, was the conspirator who obtained from the Housing Authority the bid estimate information necessary in the preparation of the rigged bids and that it was he who passed it on to the other parties to the conspiracy. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Munger, </em>24 N Y 2d 445, 451, <em>supra; People </em>v. <em>Montague, </em>19 N Y 2d 121, 125, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U. S., at p. 425 [per White, J., concurring].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The .defendants contend, however, that the affidavit is defective in that it fails to furnish the requisite \u2018 \u2018 substantial basis \u2019 \u2019 \u2014demanded by the cases (see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 271; see, also, <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 114, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 for concluding that the material sought, i.e., the bid estimate forms, would \u201c probably \u201d be found in the offices of the contractor firms named in the affidavit. The argument is without merit. Since the bid estimate information was essential to the preparation of the false bids and the carrying on of the conspiracy, it was entirely reasonable to deduce that the forms would be in the offices of the conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">We would but add that the defendants were not entitled to the names of the witnesses before the grand jury, since that body was still carrying on its investigation and had not as yet returned any indictments. In such a case, it was particularly important \u2014 as this court had occasion to point out in a somewhat different context (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Di Napoli, </em>27 N Y 2d 229, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>235) \u2014that the identity of the witnesses be not revealed in order (1) to protect them <em>\u201c </em>from interference from those under investigation \u201d, (2) to prevent <em>\u201c </em>subornation of perjury and tampering with prospective [trial] witnesses\u201d and (3) to assure \u201c prospective witnesses [before the Grand Jury] that their testimony will be kept secret \u2019 \u2019 to induce them to testify freely. (See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>\u201cDoe </em>\u201d, 47 Misc 2d 975, 977-979, affd. 24 A D 2d 843; <em>People </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>27 Misc 2d 557; 8 Wigmore, Evidence [McNaughton Rev., 1961], \u00a7\u00a7 2360-2362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In short, then, the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrants was sufficient to establish probable cause. Accordingly, the order appealed from by the People should be reversed and the case remitted to the Appellate Division so that it may pass upon the facts and the contentions advanced by the defendants for reversal. (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 543-b [now GPL 470.40, subd. 2, par. (b)]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>22 N Y 2d 288, 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Defendant Wheatman\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">There remains for disposition the appeal taken by the defendant Wheatman. The Appellate Division, deciding on reargument that he had no standing to challenge the validity of the warrants or the lawfulness of the search and seizure, affirmed his conviction. Concluding, as we have, that the prosecutor\u2019s affidavit is sufficient and the warrants valid, it becomes unnecessary to consider Wheatman\u2019s standing. However, since only that question was orally argued in our court, he should, before we finally decide his appeal, be afforded an opportunity to present an oral argument on the other points contained in his brief. The determination of the appeal taken by Wheatman should, therefore, be withheld and the case set down for oral argument or submission in this court during its February, 1972 session.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Upon the appeal by the People: Order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Upon the appeal by defendant Wheatman: Determination of appeal withheld and case set down for oral argument or submission during the February, 1972 session of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">. In deciding the ease as it originally did, the Appellate Division expressly noted that it did not consider the question of the defendants\u2019 guilt or the other points advanced by them (33 A D 2d, at p. 69).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
