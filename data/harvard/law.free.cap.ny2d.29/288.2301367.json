Every component of the master plan, including the proposed Lehman Pavilion, requires approval by the Board of Estimate because the master plan modifies or nullifies an extensive prior museum improvement on which substantial public funds were spent. II. The Lehman Pavilion, essentially an architectural monument conceived as a personal memorial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Robert Lehman, does not constitute a legitimate use of park land. <em>(795 Fifth Ave. Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>40 Misc 2d 183, 15 N Y 2d 221.) III. The Lehman Pavilion, essentially an architectural monument conceived as a personal memorial to Robert Lehman, is not an acceptable project for the publicly supported Metropolitan Museum to undertake without public approval. IV. Construction of the Lehman Pavilion must have Board of Estimate approval because it would impose a greater financial burden on the City of New York which now heavily subsidizes the museum and would result in a diminution of the services which the museum now provides to the public. V.

We are called upon to decide whether its construction requires the authorization of New York City\u2019s Board of Estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">By legislation, enacted in 1876 (L. 1876, ch. 139), the Department of Public Parks of the City of New York was <em>\u201c </em>authorized and directed \u201d to enter into a lease with the Metropolitan Museum of Art under which the museum would occupy <em>\u201c buildings erected or to be erected </em>on that portion of the Central park, in the city of New York * * * bounded on the west by the [park] drive, on the east by the Fifth avenue, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>south by a continuation of Eightieth street, and on the north by a continuation of Eighty-fifth street\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) Two years later, in 1878, acting pursuant to that enabling statute, the Park Department signed a lease with the museum. After reciting, first, the Park Department\u2019s authorization to enter into a lease with the museum \u201cfor [its] occupation * * * of the <em>buildings erected, or to be erected </em>on that portion of Central Park described in the statute and, second, the near completion of \u201c [a] building contemplated\u201d by the statute, the document went on to provide that the department \u2018 \u2018 has granted and demised and let * * * unto the- [museum] the said buildings and the appurtenances thereunto belonging, to have and to hold the same, as long as the [museum] shall continue to carry out the objects and purposes defined in its charter\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">As already indicated, the Metropolitan Museum now desires to erect an addition, to be called the Lehman Wing, to house a priceless treasury of art, collected by Robert Lehman during his lifetime. Described as \u201c One of the * * * finest private collections of European art\u201d and sought by almost every museum in the world, it is valued at 100 million dollars. Intent on keeping the collection intact and available to the widest possible public, Mr. Lehman decided in 1967 to leave it to the Metropolitan Museum provided that it build an addition to hold it and accept certain other conditions to insure its being kept together \u201cforever.\u201d In January of 1970, a year after his death, the museum and the Robert Lehman Foundation by its president, Edwin L. Weisl, Esq.\u2014 who had been Mr. Lehman\u2019s lawyer and close friend\u2014executed an agreement. By its terms, the gift was conditioned upon the erection of a separate wing, to be known as the Lehman Wing and used solely to house the collecttion. It was to be built with private funds, chiefly those of the Foundation, which was also to pay for most of the operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The City Art Commission approved the contemplated addition and the mayor accepted it as a gift to the city. The respondent Heckscher then announced the approval of his department, the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Administration, noting that it was part and parcel of a long-needed comprehensive architectural plan for the museum and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>was prepared to <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>approve \u2019 \u2019 a permit for the construction of the Lehman Wing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The two petitioners\u2014presidents, respectively, of the Parks Council and of the Municipal Art Society\u2014thereupon objected to the addition as an encroachment upon park land and instituted the present article 78 proceeding to enjoin the respondent from issuing the permit without prior authorization of the Board of Estimate. The court at Special Term, on application of the respondent, dismissed the petition, and its judgment has been affirmed by the Appellate Division. It was Special Term\u2019s view that, since the enabling legislation of 1876 established that the museum was a proper park use and since the addition to it, the Lehman Wing, must likewise be deemed such a use, it followed that \u201cit is within the power of respondent, as Administrator, to permit its construction \u201d (65 Misc 2d 1059, 1063). Moreover, added the court, since the contemplated expansion \u201c does not constitute a disposition of city property * * * [it] does not require Board of Estimate or City Planning Commission approval\u201d (p. 1065).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">It is manifest from the lease entered into in 1878 that it was the Department of Public Parks, as lessor, and not the Board of Estimate, which was to decide whether the museum\u2019s expansion upon the portion of park land designated would carry out the museum\u2019s \u201c objects and purposes \u201d. Indeed, this understanding was reinforced, four years later, by a statute which recited that the \u201c department of public parks is hereby authorized and directed to continue the contract with the Metropolitan Museum of Art for [its] occupation * * * of the <em>buildings erected or to be erected </em>\u201d on the land described in the lease (L 1882, ch. 410, \u00a7 697).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Thus, nearly 100 years ago, the site on which the Lehman Wing is to stand was, as it were, conveyed and set aside for buildings to be erected for museum purposes\u2014unquestionably a proper park use\u2014pursuant to State legislation. More particularly, the land was, in so many words, reserved not only for the first museum building to be constructed but also for \u2018 \u2018 buildings * * * to be erected on that portion of the Central park \u2019 \u2019, bounded on the west by Park Drive, on the east by Fifth Avenue, on the south by 80th Street and on the north by 85th Street. The Lehman Wing, to be located in the area of 82nd Street, between the museum\u2019s west facade and Park Drive, is well within those boundaries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It follows, therefore, that there is no substance to the petitioner\u2019s argument either that the city did not intend the museum to occupy any park land other than that upon which the original building was constructed or that acceptance of the Foundation\u2019s offer entailed a \u2018 \u2018 disposition \u2019 \u2019 of city-owned property requiring Board of Estimate approval. The land having been set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>for museum purposes in the 1870s, the Foundation\u2019s offer, subject to acceptance and approval by the appropriate city officials, constitutes a gift to the city of the Lehman Wing. In short, as the courts below concluded, the expansion of the museum, by the erection of an addition to it, does not constitute a disposition of city property and, accordingly, Board of Estimate approval is not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The petitioners also contend that the many conditions which the Foundation attached to its offer of the collection and of the wing make it \u201cmore than a mere \u2018gift\u2019\u201d. In view of that, they urge that Board of Estimate approval is required because \u201c the consequence of the transaction is to give the donor use and control over a portion of parkland.\u201d For instance, they declare, even though the Lehman Wing will be a city-owned building on public land, it may not be altered without the consent of the Foundation and must continue to house only the Lehman collection <em>\u201cin solido </em>and in perpetuity \u2019 \u2019. The argument lacks merit. As we have already indicated <em>(supra, </em>p. 293, n. 2), the Parks Administrator may accept \u2018 \u2018 conditions * * * prescribed by the grantors or donors \u2019 \u2019 of real property, including museums (City Charter, \u00a7 2003, subd. 2, par. [i]), and this is precisely what he has done here. Moreover, although it is true that the agreement affects the Foundation\u2019s gift of the art collection to the museum, it does not affect the museum\u2019s gift of the Lehman Wing to the city, since the latter, not being a party to the agreement, is not bound by its provisions. Its interests, however, will be fully protected, once the wing is built, by the terms of the lease between it and the museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The gift of the Lehman Wing required the approval of only those agencies concerned with its appropriateness and suitability for the use contemplated\u2014in this instance, the City Art Commission and the Parks Administrator whose approval had already been given. Although no particular official or body is expressly designated as the party with power to accept gifts on the city\u2019s behalf, study of the relevant provisions of the city charter, as well as its legislative history, indicates that such power \u2014 previously vested in the Board of Estimate by the 1936 charter (see <em>795 Fifth Ave. Gorp. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>15 N Y 2d 221, affg. 20 A D 2d 850, affg. 40 Misc 2d 183, 184) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u2014 is now vested in the mayor (City Charter, \u00a7 8, subd. a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since he accepted the gift, the respondent, requiring no further approval and acting under the powers vested in him by charter (\u00a7 2003, subd. 2, par. [j]) and regulation (Park Rules and Regulations,- July 15, 1970, \u00a7 11a), was fully authorized to issue the permit for the construction of the Lehman Wing.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">This leaves for consideration the petitioners\u2019 reliance on several provisions of the charter \u2014 sections 67, 199, 229 and 384\u2014to support their position that there must be Board of Estimate approval. We may dispose of sections 67 and 384 by noting that they relate solely to city property not previously committed or set aside for a public purpose and that the city in this case is acquiring a building on land actually leased more than 90 years ago to the museum, pursuant to legislation, for museum purposes. As to section 199\u2014which provides that \u201cno * * * change in the city map shall be authorized \u201d without Board of Estimate approval\u2014it is enough to say that it has nothing to do with this case; since it will not be necessary to show the Lehman Wing on the map, its erection will not require a map change. And, finally, with respect to section 229\u2014which provides for application to the Board of Estimate for authorization to improve certain specified property\u2014we need but point out that, quite apart from the fact that the provision is explicitly permissive in its wording, it may not be read to preclude other methods of making improvements, such as by way of a gift from its citizens or others. Furthermore, as the court at Special Term observed (65 Misc 2d, at p. 1062), the statute\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that its provisions were not designed \u201c to deal with \u2018 improvements \u2019 and construction such as that contemplated here by the museum <em>(which are intended to be of benefit to the entire city).\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breeder, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">. In the course of his statement, the respondent pointed out that the collection represents an \u201c invaluable gift to [the] museum \u201d, including as it does \u201c paintings, drawings and bronzes beyond price, and on a scale which perhaps no private collector will ever duplicate. * * * It should be a matter for common rejoicing that so splendid a collection has been made available and will now be appropriately housed, cared for and displayed through private generosity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\">. The power formerly vested in the Public Parks Department is now reposed in the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Administration. The New York City Charter lists among its functions the maintenance of <em>\u201c </em>buildings and institutions now or hereafter erected or established in any park \u201d and the performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of \u201cexisting contracts with corporations or institutions for the construction and maintenance of such buildings and institutions\u201d ('\u00a7 2003, subd. 2, par. [f]), as well as the \u201c management, direction and control of all real or personal property granted, devised, bequeathed or conveyed to the city for the * * * establishment or maintenance * * * of * * * museums * * * and upon such trusts and conditions as may be prescribed by the grantors or donors thereof and accepted by the administrator \u201d (\u00a7 2003, subd. 2, par. [i]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">. The following diagram, which does not purport to be precise, illumines the situation.
