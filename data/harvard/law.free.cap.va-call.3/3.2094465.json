For, although there was no <em>just </em>cause, if the defendant had <em>probable </em>cause, it was sufficient to excuse him. To say that it was maliciously done, is not enough; for, if there was probable cause, it justified the defendant. Accordingly the constant practice is, to aver that there was no <em>probable </em>cause. [<em>Warren </em>v. <em>Matthews,</em>] 6 Mod. 25, 73; <em>[Farmer </em>v. Darling,] 4 Burr. 1974; [<em>Johnstone </em>v. Sutton,] 1 T. R. 544; <em>[Morgan v. Hughes,] </em>2 T. R. 226.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-6\"><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\">The allegation that there was no <em>just </em>cause, necessarily excludes the idea of any circumstance of justification. For, if there was a probable cause, it could not be affirmed that there was no <em>just </em>cause. Just cause <em>ex vi termini </em>means proper cause; and, if there was a <em>probable </em>cause, there was proper cause; that is, a just cause. Consequently, when the verdict finds that there was no just cause, and that it was maliciously done, it, in substance, finds that there was no <em>probable </em>cause. <em>[Chambers </em>v. <em>Robinson,] Stra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>691; [Wicks </em>v. <em>Fentham </em>et al.] 4 T.
