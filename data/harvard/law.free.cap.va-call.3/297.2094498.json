That <em>Thomas Hill </em>entered on the lands; and, in <em>February, </em>1779, conveyed them to <em>Wilburne. </em>That the. said <em>Thomas Hill </em>died in 1795, <em>without having been married, and leaving at the time of his death no lawfully begotten child, or children. </em>That the plaintiffs are the heirs of the said <em>Richard Hill, </em>the, younger, the devisee, in the said recited clause of the will mentioned. That the defendant holds under the said <em>William Wilburne. </em>The District Court gave judgment for the defendants; and the plaintiffs appealed to this Court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-7\"><em>G. K. Taylor, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-8\">The question is, whether the devise over was good, and took effect, upon the death of the first devisee without issue? The words, <em>a. lawful heir, </em>confine the contingency to the time of the death of the first devisee: which is a reasonable period, and within the rules concerning executory devises. The law has undergone a considerable change upon subjects of this kind. After the statute of <em>Hen. </em>8, concerning wills, the Judges, for the sake of alienation, usually inclined to construe the bequest to be an entail, instead of an executory devise; but, not having the same motive for it in personals, they soon established.\u00bb different rule, with regard to them. <em>Fearne </em>on Rem. 182; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>and, therefore, in <em>Pinbury </em>v. <em>Elcan, </em>[1 P. Wms. <em>563;] Atkinson </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, 3 </em>P. <em>Wms. 258; and </em>various other cases, the slightest expressions, as the word <em>leaving, </em>&amp;c. were held sufficient to confine the devise to a period which the law would endure, notwithstanding the old doctrine, that there could be no limitation over of a chattel, after a precedent gift of it for life. The same doctrine was recognized and supported in <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>1 Call, 328. It is true, that for along time, a distinction prevailed between cases where the words were applied to personal estate, and where they were applied to lands. In the first, the limitation over would be supported, but not in the last. <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>[1 P. Wms. 663;] and <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Sayer, </em>[1 P. Wms. 534.] This distinction, however, is now exploded; and, at this day, the same construction prevails, whether the words relate to lands, or personal estate. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>et al. 3 T. R. 143; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Jeffery, </em>7 T. R. 589. These cases prove, that the doctrine is clearly so in <em>England: </em>and there is the same reason for it in this country: Perhaps, the reason is even stronger for it here, than there; because, there, the entail supports the devise, and effectuates the intent to a degree throughout, inasmuch as the remainder will be good after the entail is spent; but, here, if it be not taken as an executory devise, the remainder fails altogether. There is, in reason, no distinction between <em>dying without a lawful heir, </em>and <em>dying without </em>leaving <em>a lawful heir. </em>But, the cases just read shew, clearly, that, in the latter ease, the limitation would be good; and, therefore, it is so in the former. The words in the present case are equivalent to <em>dying without a child. </em>For, the limitation is to <em>Richard Hill, </em>the brother; so that <em>Thomas </em>could never die without an heir, whilst <em>Richard, </em>or his descendants were living. This proves that <em>an heir </em>of the body, that is, <em>a child, </em>was clearly meant: Which brings it within the influence of <em>Higgenbotham </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>2 Call, 313. The case is not stronger than that of <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Opie, </em>1 Call, 212; for, there, the words were <em>lawful heir, </em>only; which were more indefinite than the expression made use of here; as that seems to tie it up to an individual who had come into existence at the time of the death, of the first devisee. The same kind of expression is used in the succeeding clause, relative to the devise of the slaves; in which, all the cases agree that the limitation over is clearly good; and, therefore, it is fair to infer that the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>meant the same thing, with regard to the devise of the lands.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-4\"><em>Robertson, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">The devise, according to the existing law at the time of making the will, created an estate tail clearly. The authorities in support of this position are numerous; but I shall content myself with referring the Court to a few distinct examples. <em>Fearne </em>on Rem. 322, 350, 170, old ed.; 1 Wash. 71. <em>[Carters </em>v. Haynes.] These cases appear to me to establish the doctrine uniformly to be, that a limitation upon a general dying without an heir, which is the same as dying <em>without heirs, </em>creates an estate tail: and of course <em>Thomas Hill, </em>the first devisee here, only took an estate tail: Which, by the operation of the act of 1776, [9 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>226,] for docking entails, was turned into a fee simple, and the remainder to <em>Richard </em>destroyed. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>1 Call, 165. The cases cited in opposition to this doctrine, do not impeach it. The passage quoted from <em>2 Fearne, </em>182, related to personal estate only, and consequently, does not apply: Besides, there were restrictive words in that case; which tied up the devise to a reasonable period. In <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>et al. 3 T. R. 143, the word <em>leaving </em>had the same effect. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Jeffery, </em>7 T. R. 589, differs essentially from this in many circumstances; particularly the word <em>leave </em>was decisive. The eases of <em>Higgenbotham </em>v. <em>Rucker, 2 </em>Call, 313, and <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Opie, </em>1 Call, 212, are not like that before the Court; and, therefore, afford no argument in favor of the appellant. It is not true, that the same words applied to real and personal property will receive the same construction; for, the contrary has been expressly held. <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 P. Wms. 667. The judgment is, therefore, right; and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-6\"><em>Hay, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">Cases upon wills are not material, unless precisely similar. [K<em>ennon </em>v. <em>M\u2019Roberts </em>et ux.] 1 Wash. 103: And in the present case, I may fairly say, in the language of Judge [in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lyde,] </em>1 T. R. 596, \u201cnothing can raise a doubt about the construction, except overwhelming it with a multitude of cases.\u201d I shall, therefore, consider the case upon principle only: And my first proposition is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that the intention of the testator is alone to be consulted, and be carried into effect, unless he wishes to create an estate, or to annex a condition which cannot legally exist. 1 <em>Wash. </em>102; 2 <em>Black. </em>Com. 381; 1 <em>T. R. </em>597. Here the intention is clear, even beyond controversy; for, it is not controverted. The testator intended to make a provision for <em>Thomas </em>and his family, but, if he had no child, then to give his estate to <em>Richard, [Pinbury </em>v. <em>Elkin,] </em>1 P. Wms. 565; where the expression is not stronger, than in the case before the Court. This intention of the testator may be carried into effect, without violating any principle of public policy, or creating an estate forbidden by law. And, therefore, it ought to be done. The second proposition which I assume is, that where words in a deed or will are susceptible of two constructions, that shall be preferred, which tends, to make it good, <em>[Atkinson </em>v. <em>Hutchinson,] </em>3 P. Wms. 260. Admit then, that the words, \u201c if my son <em>Thomas </em>dies without a lawful heir,\u201d are susceptible of two constructions, one an immediate, the other a future failure of issue, the first ought to be preferred; because, under that construction, the intention of the testator, as to both the devisees, is fulfilled. For, <em>Thomas </em>would have a fee simple, and, if he died without an heir, <em>Richard </em>would take the property. Whereas, if the second construction be adopted, <em>Thomas </em>will have an estate tail, which the testator never meant to, create. But, the words do not admit of two constructions: For, the words, \u201cif <em>Thomas </em>dies without a lawful heir,\u201d mean if he has no child living at his death. 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>565. The third proposition which I shall contend for is, that real and personal property, as to limitations of this kind, stand upon the same footing; and that words of limitation applied to real property, will have the same construction, as if applied to personal estate. The case of <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>is objected ; but the doctrine there laid down is contrary to common sense. 3 T. R. 146; <em>[Hockley </em>et ux. v. Maw<em>bery,] </em>3 Bro. C. C. 82.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGT\">The progress of the Judiciary, upon subjects of this kind, is worthy of notice. Originally there could be no limitation over of a chattel. 2 <em>Black. Com. </em>397. After this, a distinction was taken between the devise of the use, and a devise of the thing itself. This, however, was afterwards exploded. But still, if words of inheritance were applied to the first devise, the absolute property vested in <em>the </em>first devisee. This, at length also began to .give way; and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the limitation was to take effect within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years afterwards, it was held to be good. Finally, it was settled, that as to chattels, the. Court would catch at any circumstance to support the limitation over, 2 <em>Fearne </em>on Rem. 239; <em>[Dunn </em>et ux. v. <em>Bray,] </em>1 Call, 338; and why not in the ease of land ? A clistinctiou is impossible. The words are now taken according to common parlance: <em>[Nichols </em>v. <em>Hooper,</em>] 1 P. Wms. 199, 565; and <em>[Lyde v. Lyde,] </em>1 T. R. 593, 596; <em>[Atkinson v. </em>Hutchinson,] 3 P. Wms. <em>260; [Goodtitle </em>dem. <em>Peake </em>v. Pegden,] 2 T. R. 720; <em>[Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>et al.] 3 T. R. 143, are decisive of the liberality of the law, at the present day.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-8\">\n<em>Robertson.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ0H\">All the cases prove that a limitation, after an indefinito dying without heirs, is void, as an executory deviso; and that there must be some circumstances to tie u.p the limitation to a reasonable period of time, otherwise the first estate will <em>he </em>either construed an entail, or the limitation over will fail on account of the remoteness of it. The cases cited on the other side, do not disprove this proposition. 1 <em>P. Wms. 565, </em>was the case of personal property; and, therefore, has no application. 3 <em>T. R. </em>146, instead of opposing, admits the principle contended for by me. 7 <em>T. R. </em>589, had the words <em>leave no issue, </em>which tied it up; and that was corroborated by the direction that it should <em>be and return to the </em>survivor or survivors. 3 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>82, was influenced by the words to <em>divide, SfC. </em>which confined it to a definitive period. The cases in 2 <em>Fearne, </em>339, and that of <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>1 Call, 338, related to personal estate; besides, in the latter, the word <em>leave </em>tied up the limitation. It is not material that the word <em>heir </em>is' used instead of <em>heirs; </em>for, there is no distinction between them. <em>King v. Burchell, </em>[Amb. 378; 1 Eden, 424;] <em>Fearne, </em>124, To this I add, that the doctrine contended for, leads to the establishment of perpetuities; and, therefore, ought to be rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-13\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b321-14\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AjQ\">This is an action of ejectment, and the question depends upon the construction of the will of <em>Richard Hill, </em>(dated 3d <em>October, </em>1774,) who died in the year 1775.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">The clause on which the question turns, is to tho following effect; <em>\"</em>I give to my son <em>T Hill, </em>all my lands on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the north side of <em>Nottoway </em>river, in <em>Sussex, </em>to him and his heirs and assigns forever, as also my lands in <em>Brunswick </em>to him and his heirs forever; but, in case he dies without a lawful heir, my will is, my lands in <em>Brunswick </em>only, <em>(the premises in question,) </em>should descend to my son <em>Richard Hill </em>and his <em>heirs forever, </em>as also the following slaves, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Similar dispositions are also made to his two sons, <em>Green Hill </em>and <em>Richard Hill, </em>with precisely the same limitations over to <em>Thomas Hill </em>and his heirs forever in both cases. I infer from this latter circumstance, that <em>Thomas Hill </em>and his family were rather favorites of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Another disposition is made to his daughter <em>Rebecca, </em>of slaves, &amp;c. and if she died without a lawful heir, or under twenty-one, her slaves, &amp;c. to be equally divided among the remaining children.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">. <em>Thomas Hill, </em>having died in 1795, without having been married, or leaving lawful issue at the time of his death, the question arises under the clause just stated, what estate the said <em>Thomas Hill </em>took in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The counsel for the appellants, finding their cause desperate in any other view of the subject, relied strongly upon a supposed decision of Lord Kenyon, shaking the authority of <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman. </em>That they could have found any grounds for such an attempt, I confess, surprized me. Not fully acquainted with the merits and character of that Judge, I yet thought it strange, that he who has been profuse in his admiration of Lord Holt; who has diverged from the liberal decisions of Lord Mansfield; who has declared, in appropriate and emphatical terms, the duty of a Judge to be <em>dicere et non dare jus, </em>should be prompt at innovation upon the settled rules of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">But, in fact, the case relied on by the gentlemen does not bear them out: The determination, therein imputed to that Judge, is afterwards disavowed by him, as a Judicial opinion, in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Jeffery, </em>7 T. R. 595; and the distinction taken in <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>is admitted, and acted upon by him in a subsequent <em>case </em>of <em>Daintry </em>v. <em>Daintry, </em>[6 T. R. 307.]</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">This supposed, and single, deviation from that case, being thus removed, it is unnecessary for me to quote instances from the books, wherein its authority has been often and solemnly recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In <em>Forth </em>v. Chapman, it was decided, that if freehold and leasehold lands be devised to A. and if he die leaving no issue of his body, <em>then </em>to the daughter of his brother, and children of his sister, this devise should be expounded to imply an indefinite failure of issue as to the freehold lands, and be restricted to issue, living at the death, as to the leasehold, and the words be considered as if they had been repeated by two several clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The object of the gentlemen was to explode the distinction, as relative to freehold lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The reason of this distinction is, that the words are so understood in relation to real estate, in order to create an estate-tail in favor of the issue, who are capable of taking an inheritance, but, with respect to a term, that construction cannot benefit them; for a term cannot descend to them. 2 <em>Fearne </em>on Rem. 231: Notwithstanding, however, this diversity, from whence may be inferred a general difference of intention, as relative to the two subjects, yet it has never been held that a restrictive construction shall take place, even in relation to chattels, unless there be a particular intention inferrable from the will favoring such construction. Slight circumstances, indeed, have been laid hold of to produce this effect, such as the words, <em>\u201c leaving,\u201d \u201cthen,\u201d \u201ca </em>limitation to a person <em>in </em>esse for life, &amp;c.\u201d but yet there must he some such.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">I lay it down, then, as an incontrovertible position, that words importing a limitation in tail are taken in their <em>legal sense, </em>as to real estate, under circumstances in which they would be taken in their <em>vulgar </em>sense as applying to chattels;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and, that when they are taken in the latter sense, as applying to the latter subject, it is not from the general intention of the testator inferrable from the diversity just stated; but, from a particular intention appearing in the will itself, coming in aid of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Bearing in. mind this distinction, and the ground of it, let us examine the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">If the subject of the devise in question had even been personal estate, I see no grounds whereon we could restrict the limitation to mean issue' living at the death. The words of the devise are appropriate and emphatical, to import an estate-tail, and there is an absence of all words, such as <em>leave, then, fyc. </em>which have frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>been resorted to, for the purpose of inferring a particular intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Great stress is, however, laid upon the expression <em>if he die without a lawful heir, </em>as indicative of an intention to restrict: But, there is nothing in it. Those words standing singly, are fully <em>competent to </em>convey an estate in fee, or tail, with reference, as the case may bo, to the person in remainder; that is, whether he can be a collateral heir or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The word <em>heirs </em>or <em>heir </em>is <em>nomen colleclivum. No </em>case is recollected, where the distinction now set up was taken. The case of <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Pegden, </em>2 T. R. 720, was as to this point, substantially like that before us. \u201cLawful heir,\u201d was there construed to mean, <em>issue of his body; </em>and it is believed that, if <em>issue </em>were substituted in this will, the objection would not have been made. In that case, it is true, the words were considered as restricted, and the limitation over good: But, the word <em>leaving, </em>was also there, and the Court in their opinion laid no stress upon the word <em>heir </em>being in the singular number.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">If it be said, that the expression in our case is tantamount to the words <em>not leaving: </em>I answer, that it is equipollent, at most, to the expression <em>not having: </em>which is considered by Lord Kenvon in <em>Weakley </em>v. <em>Rugg, </em>7 T. R. 326, as essentially different from <em>not leaving.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">It is observable also, that in the devise of slaves to <em>Rebecca, </em>the testator not only omits the words <em>to her and her heirs for ever, </em>but adds the contingency of her dying under 21, a circumstance <em>denoting </em>restriction, and limits the remainder to be equally divided among the remaining children: Thereby, perhaps, throwing .the case of this bequest within the reason on which the cases of <em>Hughes </em>v. Sayer; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Skinner; Higgenbotham </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>and others, are decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">But, the subject of the present devise is not personal estate, but land. As to this subject, the general intention is in favor of an estate tail.\u2019 The words used are entirely adequate to.that purpose; and, there are no grounds whereon to infer a particular contrary intention, but the converse; such as the different phraseology used in the bequest to his daughter <em>Rebecca, </em>and the circumstances before stated, shewing <em>Thomas Hill </em>and his family, to have been favorites of the testator. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment ought to be affirmed</p>\n<author id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"APj\">The first part of the devise to <em>Trio's Hill </em>and his heirs was turned into an estate tail by the subsequent words <em>in case my said son </em>Tiio\u2019s Hill <em>dies without a lawful heir; </em>for, the latter words plainly mean an heir of his body, as he could not die without an heir whilst his brother <em>Richard </em>was living. But, it is said, that the words <em>dies 'without a lawful heir, </em>meant if he died without <em>leaving </em>issue at the time of his death. There is, however, a distinction in this respect between lands and personal estate: In the latter, the words are taken in the vulgar sense, but in the former, the legal sense prevails; that is <em>to </em>say, they are construed to mean a failure of issue generally. <em>[Denn </em>v. <em>Shenton,] </em>Cowp. 410. It is true that Lord Kenyon in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>3 T. R. 143, appears to have hesitated at the distinction; but, the doctrine is too fully established to be overturned by a single decision. The rule is inflexible, that a limitation after a dying without issue generally, creates an estate-tail, unless it be controled by restrictive words clearly manifesting an intention to coniine it to a dying without issue living at the death of the devisee, or some other reasonable period: And, as there are no such words in the present case, I am of opinion that the legal sense must be adhered to, and that <em>Thomas </em>took an estate-tail; which was turned into a fee-simple by the act of 1776, for docking entails. The result is, that the judgment of the District Court is right, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b325-9\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A8L\">The Judges who have preceded me have exhausted the subject; and, therefore, I have only to add, that I concur in the opinion that <em>Thomas Hill took </em>an estate-tail; which, by the act of 1776, was turned into a fee-simple: Of course, the judgment of the District Court is right, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b325-10\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AdF\">I have always thought the distinction between lands and personal estate to have been settled by the case of <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman; </em>and that it was certain that a limitation over of lands after a general dying without issue, created an estate-tail. <em>Fearne </em>on Rem. 363. It is to no purpose to be arguing about the intention, unless the words will authorise a, restricted construction; for, mere intention cannot prevail against a settled rule of interpretation, which has iixed an appropriate sense to particular words; because, when the sense is once imposed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>they become the <em>indicia </em>of the testator\u2019s mind, until the, contrary is shewn by countervailing expressions. <em>Harg. </em>L. Tracts, 508. It is better that it should be so too: For, the law ought to be certain; and, when the rule is once laid down, it should be adhered to: Otherwise, what is called liberality, at the bar, will degenerate into arbitrary discretion, and all must depend upon the will of the Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> None of the cases cited by the counsel for the appellant, contravene the settled doctrine. That of <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Brad</em>ley, which was most relied on, evidently does not; for, the words <em>leaving </em>issue, there, essentially varies it from this case: And, all the other decisions, both before and since, have so firmly established the construction in favor of the entail, that it has now become a canon of property, which it would be dangerous for the Court to alter. The Legislature, by the act for docking entails, plainly understood it in this manner; and, therefore, they left the construction as it was before, but turned the entail, when created, into a fee simple. An infringement of the rule, then, instead of supporting the Legislative intention, would go directly to defeat it; and would tend, under the notion of executory devises, to introduce that very clog to alienation, which the statute meant to abolish. Consequently, finding nothing in this ease to take it out of the general rule, I think that <em>Thomas Hill </em>took an estate-tail, which, by virtue of the act of 1776, was turned into a fee simple, and, therefore, that the judgment of the District Court is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-12\">[* <em>Benn </em>v. <em>Shenton, </em>Cowp. 410; <em>Crooke </em>v. <em>De Vanders, </em>9 Ves. <em>jun. </em>197; <em>Anderson v.
