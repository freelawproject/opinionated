For, the emblements, standing on the land at the testator\u2019s death, belonged to <em>Robert. </em>This was clearly the rule at common law; and the act of Assembly makes them assets for payment of debts only. For, the true meaning of the woi'd <em>assets </em>is, a fund for payment of debts. <em>Terms de la Ley, </em>Tit. <em>Assets, </em>p. <em>63, [Kinaston v. Clark,] </em>2 Atk. 206; <em>[Anony.] </em>Cro. Eliz. 61; <em>[Knevett v. Pool, </em>et al., Ibid,] 463. It is like the case of an estate <em>pur autre vie, </em>which, by the statute 29 <em>Car. </em>2, is made assets; and yet it has been held, that, it was not distributable among the next of kin. <em>[Oldham v. </em>Pickering,] 2 Salk. 464; <em>[Oldison </em>v. <em>Pickering,] </em>3 Salk. 137.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-9\">Upon the same principle, then, as the act of Assembly in our case merely declares, that the crops shall he assets, they will be assets only for payment of debts,\u2019 and will not be liable for payment of legacies, or subject to distribution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-10\"><em>Robert </em>was entitled to all the outstanding debts by virtue of the devise of the <em>Book, </em>&amp;c. for he was chargeable with the debts, which might be more or less; and be had a right to receive all that the <em>Rook </em>would command, in order that he might he enabled to do it. Of course, he was not accountable to <em>Archibald for his own </em>debt; for, it <em>belonged </em>to himself, unless it was wanted for the payment of the testator\u2019s debts; which it was not; and therefore he was entitled to the benefit of it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-11\"><em>Wickham </em>and <em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-12\">The rule of the common law, as to emblements, is admitted: but the act of Assembly has 'wholly reversed it, and declares that they shall bo assets; that is, personal estate, to every intent and purpose. The case, from <em>Salk. </em>of the estate <em>piar autre vie, </em>does not apply; because, in that, ease, the nature of the property was not changed; hut it was merely declared to he assets; and its qualities of realty, remained the same as before: So that it was not. chattels. But, as none but chattels are distributable, it was properly decided, that the next of kin could not claim a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>distribution of the subject. <em>Robert </em>was created an executor by virtue of the devise of the <em>Book, </em>&amp;c. and therefore, he became a trustee of the surplus, which included his own debt, for the residuary legatee; because making him executor did not release the debt. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Selwin, </em>Cas. Temp, Talb. 240; <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Goodinge, 3 </em>Bro. C. C. 110; <em>Toller </em>[on Ex. and Adm\u2019rs.] 274, [350, 2nd <em>Am. </em>ed.] This is the stronger, because there is a residuary bequest of every thing, which destroys the presumption, that the testator intended the executor should be discharged from his own debt. It is therefore like a lapsed legacy, which sinks into the residuum, for the benefit of the residuary devisee, or the next of kin.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-5\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">The devise to <em>Robert, </em>was a devise of the beneficial interest in the testator\u2019s credits, subject to the payment of his debts. 1. Because he gives him his <em>Book; </em>which expressly denotes property. For, directing the book to be given up to him, was substantially directing that he should take it to his own use. 2. Because he was to receive and pay the debts; which condition, as the debts were uncertain, and might exhaust the whole proceeds, is evidence of property. For, it is like a devise of lands, with a charge to pay the testator\u2019s debts; which has been constantly held to carry a fee. But, as in that case he is only liable to the value of <em>the land, so, in this, he is only </em>liable to the amount of the money collected from the book. For, in fact, it is no more in equity, than charging the subject, and not the person, with payment of the debts. It is expressly like the case of an executor in general, who takes the estate subject to the payment of debts; but then he is-only liable, as far as the estate extends. In other words, the testator, as to this, has only declared what the law would have implied; but he prevents the ulterior application of it to the claims of legatees and distributees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmK\">If <em>Robert </em>was executor, as they on the other side will have it, then the appointment of him to be executor was a release of his own debt, unless it be wanting to pay the demands, of the testator\u2019s creditors. This was the rule of the common law expressly. <em>Swinb. </em>298, 299. At first it was considered as inflexible, and admitting of no qualification: But this was a mistake, grounded upon technical arguments, which were soon found to be absurd; and there-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>lore the notion has boon long abandoned. For, it was very early decided, that it could not. be supported against creditors. <em>Swinb. ub. sup. </em>But as to the legacies, the rule <em>re</em>inaincd longer, and it was thought that the exception, even in favor of creditors, depended upon the liberality of Courts of Equity, who disregarded the technical conceit, relative to the suspense of the action; which for a long time was supposed to be the true ground why the debts due from executors were extinguished, by appointing them to the oilice. This, however, is a mistake; and the difference between debts and legacies, depends upon a different reason altogether: Which I will endeavour to shew, by explaining the real principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\">It never was true, that the reason why the debt was extinguished, was, that the action was gone; but; the actual grouud is, that, as the executor is appointed universal representative of the personalty, it is, impliedly a devise to him of his own debt. This will be evident from the following considerations. I. Because the <em>argument, </em>that the action is suspended, has no meaning when applied to a creditor; for his action never was in suspense. <em>Swinb. </em>299; <em>Roll. </em>Abr. 920, 921. [Holt, C. J. in <em>Wankford v. Wankford,] </em>Salk. 306. 2. Because, if two bo jointly and severally bound, and the creditor makes one executor, this releases the debt as to both; and yet the action never was suspended, as to him who was not executor. 3. Because, if the debtor administers, it does not release the debt; and yet the action is as much suspended, in that case, as if he were executor. lienee it was soon h\u00e9ld, that the debt, oven at law, was liable to creditors. For, the executor had it in his hands; and, therefore, might truly be said to have assets sufficient to satisfy the demand. But, as to legacies, the point, was more uncertain for a long time. It was often put upon parol testimony of the intent, instead of considering principles: A circumstance which necessarily led to uncertainty; and, therefore, it becomes important to consider the principle: which is evidently this, that the appointment of the debtor to be executor, does not operate as a release, <em>but is an </em>implied devise of the debt to himself. <em>Salk. </em>306. Therefore, being a legacy, the legatee is entitled to as much favor as auy other legatee; and consequently, is not to be deprived of the benefit of the devise, without a clear intent to that effect, be manifested. So <em>that prima facie, </em>the debt is given to the executor as a legatary, <em>unless a </em>contrary intention appeal's <em>by </em>express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>words, or necessary inference. But there are no such exPress words here; and therefore, the question is, whether be any necessary inference ? ' It is said, that the residuary devise amounts to such an inference, and shews that the testator intended it should not be extinguished. But, in answer to this, it is to be observed, that the executor, having the law on his side, has no favor to ask of the Court; and therefore, any presumption, from that circumstance, is. liable to be rebutted by others. Such as, 1. The extraordinary affection which the testator always manifested for his brother Robert: 2. The testator\u2019s credits being charged with the payment of his debts; which might have exhausted them- 3. The giving the <em>Booh; </em>which was a gift of its contents. 4. The residue being coupled with enumerated articles; which shews that the testator meant those.of the same kind. 5. The devise of the residue to <em>Archibald, </em>being only what he had not before given: which did not include <em>Robert\u2019s </em>debt; because the devise of the <em>Booh, </em>which is supposed to have constituted him executor, was inserted before: And therefore, as according to the rule of law, it.had been already given, it could not be included in the residuary devise; which could only be intended of things, not expressly, or impliedly, given before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbG\">Hence, it appears, that if the ease be considered upon principle and legal grounds, the appointment of <em>Robert </em>to be executor extinguished the debt which he owed, and that it did not pass over to <em>Archibald, </em>by virtue of the residuary devise. Because, every presumption arising from that circumstance, is amply rebutted by others more powerful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al0\">If, however, it be taken, that the debt is not released, but the action for it lost, which is provided against by a Court of Equity, still the same consequence will take place. No case, except those of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Selwin, </em>and <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Goodinge, </em>is recollected to have said the contrary. But, with regard to the first, the <em>Chancellor </em>merely expresses his thoughts upon the question now before the Court, without giving any decision. So, that it cannot be considered as an authority in this case. And with respect to the second, it is a loose note of a case which does not appear to have been laboriously argued, and probably, depended on circumstances. Besides, it was only an interlocutory decree; and might have been afterwards changed at the final hearing. Therefore, that case also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>is not to bo considered as an authority in the present. The passage from <em>Toller </em>is bottomed on it, however; and, of course, as the prop fails, the authority of that passage fails too. Besides, it is observable, that <em>Fonblanque, </em>who is a most excellent commentator, says nothing about It, although he has occasion once to mention the case of <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Goodinge: </em>which looks as if he did not consider it as settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-4\">If it be said, that here a particular estate is devised to the executor, which is inconsistent with the notion of his taking what is undevised; and, therefore, as his own debt is not particularly devised to him, it remained undisposed of, and consequently passed under the residuary devise to <em>Archibald, </em>I answer, that as, by the rule of law the appointment of an executor, is a bequest to him of his own debt, the further devise is unimportant; and docs not affect the case. For, the rule mentioned by Lord Lououboeocgii, [in <em>Hornsby v. </em>Finch,] 2 Ves. <em>jun. </em>80, is universal, namely, <em>\u201c </em>that for a legacy to take away the right of the executor, it is not sufficient simply to say there is a legacy: but it, must be so qualified, that the giving of it is inconsistent with the supposition that the executor is to take the whole.\u201d According to which doctrine, it is not sufficient for the appellee to say, that there was a devise to <em>Robert </em>of other things in particular, and that the residue was given to himself; but, he must shew, the testator intended to overthrow the rule of law, and to give this debt to the residuary devisee. This, however, he cannot do; for, there is no inconsistency in <em>Robert\u2019s </em>retaining his debt, and <em>Archibald\u2019s </em>taking the residuary estate; of which there was amply enough to satisfy the words of the will. Therefore, <em>Archibald </em>is not entitled to this debt; but, it is extinguished for the benefit of <em>Robert\u2019s </em>estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">The devise of the lauds to <em>Robert </em>carried the emblements growing at his death. Ac to which, the case cited from <em>Salk, </em>by Mr. <em>Warden, </em>expressly applies. For, tins estate <em>pur autre vie, </em>and the emblements, are exactly alike, as both equally partake of the realty; and both are declared assets: Which declaration has no greater effect on the emblements than on tlib life-estate. Therefore, one is just as distributable as the other; being equally capable of division, and distribution; for both may\" lie sold, or separate interests given, in the subject itself, to the distributees. But, independent of this, the testator\u2019s meaning, to that effect, is collectable from the will. For, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>devises plantations in the same manner to all his brothers; an&lt;*\u2019 theref011\u00ae\u00bb the fair presuriiption is, that he intended eacli should reap the emblements growing on his own; and, not that the executor only should be accountable for his.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-4\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AYWk\">The case is as follows: <em>Edward </em>Bolling, having by will devised lands and some slaves to his four brothers, and made some other bequests, among which is a legacy of 100/. to Ms-sister <em>Sarah Tazloell, </em>adds this clause: \u201c It is my will and desire that my <em>Booh </em>be given up to my brother <em>Robert Bolling, </em>and that he receive all the debts due to me, and pay all that I owe. The rest of my estate, negroes, horses, clothes, and every other part of my estate, not already given, I give to my brother <em>Archibald, </em>for him and his heirs forever.\u201d The testator died in <em>Jlugust, </em>1770, and probat of his will was granted to <em>Robert, </em>as appointed executor, by the above clause relative to the book: In which character he acted, until his death'in 1775. The appellant being appointed executor of his will, this suit is brought by <em>Archibald Bolling, </em>to have an account of the executorship settled, and what shall appear due to him of the residuary estate, decreed. He particularly requires an account of the crops made, on the several plantations devised, the year the testator died; and whether he was entitled to such profits ? Or, whether they passed to the several devisees of the land ? is the first question to be decided by the Court. It was truly said by the counsel, that by the common law of <em>England, </em>emblements upon lands devised, go with the lands; but, our act of Assembly has controlled that common law, by declaring that when a testator dies, at the season of the year in which Mr. <em>Bolling </em>died, they shall not so pass (I mean the growing crop;) but, that such crop shall he finished, and after easing the lands of the quit rents of that year, and the slaves of levies and cloathing out of those crops, the surplus shall be assets in the hands of the executor, placing this devise upon the same ground as if it had been directed to take effect in <em>December. </em>But, we have had learned discussions upon the derivation and meaning of this term <em>assets; </em>and, from thence, it was attempted to shew, that the executor was only to take it for the purpose of paying debts, if necessary; and as that necessity did not occur in the present case, the law did not operate, but the surplus of those crops passed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>devisees of the land. This argument the Court thinks has no loree, and that under the act, they are personal estate in the hands of the executor to every purpose of paying debts, subject, to the disposition of the will, and, if there he none such, the question occurs, whether the executor sir all take them as undisposed of, or they shall be distributable to the next of kin, as was fully settled by the Court, on mature deliberation, in the case <em>of Shelton </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>1 Wash. <em>53, </em>64. In that case, there was no disposition of the surplus, and the Court determined upon that will, and the <em>English </em>authorities, that the surplus belonged to the executors: A question, however, which cannot arise in the present case; since the sweeping residuary clause passes every thing undisposed of to <em>Jlrchihald. </em>Upon this point, therefore, the Court is of opinion, that the decree is right. The next, question discussed was, whether <em>Robert Bolling, </em>under the devise respecting the booh, was entitled to the surplus of the debts due to the testator, after paying his debts? Upon this point, the Courtis of opinion, that no beneficial interest in the debts, passed to <em>Robert, </em>hut it was merely an appointment of him to perform the office of executor, to receive and pay debts. That use has been of the words as constituting him executor; and, although, probably, his appointment ought to have been confined to that particular duty, yet, since he was admitted to the office generally, at his request, by the County Court, who had jurisdiction on the subject, and that sentence remains unreversed, the propriety of it is not now to he questioned: especially, as <em>Robert </em>acted under it, as giving him a general authority. That the testator intended to devise this surplus, cannot he inferred from the words of the will; and, although, the answer says, that the defendant hopes to prove that such was his intention, yet no proof to that purpose, if admissible, is brought, forth. The words, <em>\u201c the book be given tip,\" </em>relate to the possession, and not to the property in the book, so as to make it apply to the argument, that by giving the book all its benefits passed, like the case of a devise of a bond. <em>Robert Bolling\u2019s </em>power, under this devise, was merely, that of an executor, giving him neither a right to the surplus of the debts, if there was any, nor subjecting him to the payment \u00f3f more than he received, 'flic decree, therefore, in this point is also right. The third question is, whether the debt due from <em>Robert </em>to the testator was extinguished by the appointment of <em>Robert </em>executor ? There are no words in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the devise to shew that this debt was not to be collected, or accounted for, altho\u2019 the same hand was to pay and receive, as well as all others; so, that it depends upon the general rule. That the debt was extinguished at law, is indisputable; and, though Judges differ as to the reason on which the rule is founded, that seems immaterial; since we are to consider what is the equitable rule on the subject. Many cases were cited to favor the executor\u2019s interest; but, they were generally on questions between the executor and next of kin, whether an <em>undisposed </em>of surplus should be distributed; and, do not apply to this case, where the residuary clause prevents the existence of any such surplus. It seems to be settled in equity, partly in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Selwin, </em>Cas. Temp. Talb. <em>240, </em>and in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Goodinge, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 110, that the debt is not extinguished, but is to be accounted for as assets; subject to debts, and legacies, and distributable, except in cases where the executor is entitled to the surplus. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The appellee is a legatee, and the decree in his favor on this point also is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The other questions being only provisional, in case of a contrary decision of the second question, are, by the decision of that, rendered unimportant, since they will be regulated in the account of administration, which will shew what the residuary legatee is entitled to. Upon the whole, the decree of the Court of Chancery is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">[* See act <em>Oct. </em>1785, c. 61, \u00a7 67, 12 Stat.
