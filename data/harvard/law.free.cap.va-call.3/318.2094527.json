That <em>M\u2019Leod </em>entered, and died seised in the year 1770, intestate, leaving <em>Robert M\u2019Leod-, </em>his s.on, and heir at law: who, by deed of the 15th of <em>September, </em>1784, conveyed to <em>Richard Arrell, </em>deceased; which was recorded on the 20th of the same month. That the said <em>Richard Arrell </em>died intestate about the- year 1795, and the plaintiffs are his representatives and heirs at law. That the said <em>Robert M\u2019Leod </em>made a deed of feoffment, and memorandum of livery of seisin, to <em>James Kirk, </em>(under whom the defendant claims,) on the 24th of <em>December, </em>1783; which deed and memorandum were recorded on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>23d <em>September, </em>1784. That <em>Robert M\u2019Leod </em>was a citizen and inhabitant, of <em>Maryland; but that the deed was executed by him in Alexandria, and ivas attested by witnesses residing there. </em>That <em>Arrell, </em>before the conveyanee to him, had notice of <em>Kirk\u2019s </em>deed. That <em>Arrell </em>gave a bond to <em>Robert M\u2019Leod, </em>conditioned for the payment of 300/., if <em>Kirk, </em>or his representatives should not recover the land of <em>Arrell; </em>which is dated the 15th <em>September, </em>1784, and recorded 20th <em>January, </em>1791. That <em>Robert M\u2019Leod, </em>when he conveyed to <em>Kirk, </em>was not in possession. <em>That James M\u2019Leod had made a verbal sale to Watson, who entered, and was possessed; and, being so possessed, sold to Rigdon, 14th September, </em>1770, <em>and gave bond to make a title. That Rigdon, by will, on 22d April, </em>1772, after some specific bequests, devised to his wife, <em>Elizabeth Rigdon, </em>in fee, <em>all the rest of his estate, both real and personal, </em>and died 19 th <em>May, </em>1772. That the said <em>Elizabeth Rigdon, on 28th February, </em>1775, <em>assigned the said bond to Arrell, </em>who entered on the said land in consequence thereof, enclosed it, and peaceably and quietly held it till his death. <em>That Kirk, on 24th December, </em>1783, <em>gave a bond to Robert M\u2019Leod, for payment of </em>130/. <em>on being put into possession of the lot, which Robert M\u2019Leod, on 19th March, </em>1787, <em>assigned to Arrell. </em>That <em>Kirk, </em>at the time of giving said bond, knew that <em>Arrell </em>was in possession, and would dispute the title to the lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs; and the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>for <em>the </em>appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-8\">We have a regular title, which can be objected to upon two grounds only; that is to say: 1. That the deed was not recorded within eight months. <em>2. </em>That <em>Kirk </em>knew of <em>Arrell\u2019s </em>title when he took the deed. As to the latter, it is not a proper subject of enquiry in a Court of Law; but, if the plaintiff could have supported his case at all, it must have been in a Court of Equity. And, as to the first, the act of 1784, [c. <em>62, </em>12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>155,] speaks of persons resident in <em>Virginia, </em>which <em>M\u2019Leod </em>was not; for, the verdict finds that he was a citizen and inhabitant of <em>Maryland. </em>Of course, his having accidentally come into <em>Virginia, </em>will not satisfy the act, which ought to be construed strictly. A third objection perhaps will foe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that <em>M\u2019Leod, </em>at the time of making the deed, was out of possession. But, as to this, the Court is referred to the argument in <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>(ante, 362.) Besides, livery of seisin was made in this case; which necessarily supposes possession. And, therefore, as the verdict only finds that <em>Arrell </em>was possessed when the deed was made, the Court will intend that the livery was made, at another time; which will remove the objection. <em>Co. Litt. </em>48, 266. The plaintiff\u2019s title is liable to this exception, that the verdict finds <em>Arrell </em>knew of our deed at the time of taking his.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-4\"><em>Lee, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">It is clear that <em>Kirk </em>knew of <em>Arrell\u2019s </em>right before his purchase; and the notice affects the appellant. 2 <em>Pow. </em>on Mortg. 296. <em>M\u2019Leod </em>was out of possession at the time of making the deed to <em>Kirk; </em>which, therefore, is wholly void. <em>Co. Litt. </em>369; 2 <em>Black. </em>Com. 314; <em>[Partridge </em>v. <em>Strange </em>et al.] Plowd 88. But as <em>Arrell </em>was in possession, the deed to him was effectual, and perfected his title, as the same books prove. It is not material, that <em>M\u2019Leod </em>was a citizen of <em>Maryland. </em>For, the deed was executed in <em>Virginia; </em>and the witnesses might have been compelled to attend at Court, and prove it. Of course, as the act of <em>Assembly </em>is express, the failure to record it within the eight months, avoids it against a purchaser for valuable consideration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AE2\"><em>Call, on </em>the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXJ\">The act uses the word <em>resident </em>in the State at the time of making the deed; which expression is fully satisfied by the grantors being within the limits of the State; and, therefore, recording within the eight months, could not be dispensed with. There was no fraud in <em>Arrell </em>in taking a deed, because he had a prior equity. For, the verbal sale to <em>Watson </em>was good; and Bie title from him is regularly deduced. But, the converse of this doctrine holds against <em>Kirk; </em>because, finding another in possession, he ought to have enquired before he purchased; for, the possession was notice of our equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-8\">The verdict does not find the facts with precision. It does not appear whether livery was actually made or not, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>leaves it wholly uncertain. It is material, that <em>M\u2019Leod </em>was not a citizen of <em>Virginia; </em>because, the buyer has a right 1o two modes of probat, that by witnesses, and that by acknowledgment of the party in Court. But the argu'ment, on the other side, tends to deprive him of the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-3\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vvlt.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b341-4\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A-F\">delivered the resolution of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">This is an appeal from the District Court of <em>Dumfries, </em>where the appellees brought an ejectment against the appellant for a lot and half an acre of land in the town of <em>Alexandria, </em>in which there was a special verdict, stating, that the trustees of that town, being seised of the lot in question, by deed dated the 30th <em>May, </em>1765, conveyed it to <em>James M\u2019Leod, </em>who died seised in 1770, leaving <em>Robert M' Lead </em>his son and heir. That <em>James </em>the father, in his life-time, made a verbal sale of the lot to <em>Joseph Watson, </em>who entered and was in possession thereof; and <em>September </em>14th, 1770, gave a bond to <em>Edward R-igdon, </em>in the penalty of 100/., conditioned for making a good right to the lot, and defending it against all persons whatsoever. That <em>Rigdon </em>by his will dated <em>April </em>22d, 1762, devised the lot as part of his residuary estate, to his wife <em>Elizabeth, </em>in fee. That <em>Elizabeth, </em>on the 28th of <em>Feb</em>ruary1775, in consideration of 15/. assigned the bond and her right to the lot, to <em>Richard Arrc.lt, </em>who in 1776 entered into possession of the lot, enclosed if, and quietly <em>held it </em>till his death, and for the greatest part of the. time, occupied it as a <em>grass </em>lot. That on the 24th of <em>Decem</em>ber, 1783, <em>Robert M\u2019Leod </em>of <em>Frederick </em>county, in <em>Maryland, </em>by feoffment, in consideration of 170/. specie, conveyed the lot to <em>James Kirk </em>of <em>Alexandria, </em>in fee with a general warranty, on which deed there is a memorandum, that on the same day peaceable possession of the lot was given by <em>M\u2019Leod </em>to <em>Kirk, </em>in presence of the subscribing witnesses; also, a receipt for the consideration money; and, there is a certificate of the Clerk of the Corporation Court of <em>Alexandria, </em>that this deed, memorandum, and receipt, were proved by the witness and ordered to be re corded, on the 23d <em>September, </em>1784, more than eight monlhs, but less than two years from the date of the deed, which the jury find was executed in Alexandria, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the witnesses also resided. On the same <em>24th </em>of Decem<em>ber </em>1783, <em>James Kirk </em>entered, into a bond to <em>Robert M\u2019Leod, </em>in the penalty of 250/. reciting the conveyance him, but that the lot is yet in possession of <em>Richard Jlrrell </em>and others, who dispute the title, and the condition is, that <em>Kirk </em>shall pay 130/. without interest after his being put into possession of the lot, and an undeniable title in fee made, which bond <em>M\u2019Leod </em>on the 19th of <em>March, </em>1787, for 112/. <em>8s. 6d. </em>assigned to <em>Richard Jlrrell. </em>They find that <em>Robert </em>at the time of his conveyance to <em>Kirk, </em>was out of possession, and that <em>Kirk </em>knew at the time, that <em>Jlrrell </em>was in possession, and would dispute the title. That <em>Robert M\u2019Leod </em>by bargain and sale, dated the 15th of September, 1784, and duly recorded, conveyed the lot to <em>Richard Jlrrell </em>in fee, with a general warranty. That <em>Richard Jlrrell </em>at the time, had notice of <em>M\u2019Leod\u2019s </em>deed to <em>Kirk. </em>On the same day, <em>Jlrrell </em>executed a bond to <em>M'Leod, </em>in the penalty of 600/. reciting that conveyance, and the former one to <em>Kirk; </em>and the condition is, that, if <em>Kirk </em>recovered the lot, the bond was to be void; and if <em>Kirk </em>failed, and <em>Jlrrell\u2019s </em>title was established, and <em>Jlrrell </em>should in that case, pay 300/. to <em>M\u2019Leod, </em>by three several instalments, the bond was also to be void. That <em>Richard Jlrrell </em>died intestate in possession of the lot, in 1795, and that the plaintiffs are his heirs; how or when they lost the possession, so as to become plaintiffs, is not stated. The equitable title supposed to be derived from the verbal sale of <em>James M\u2019Leod </em>the father, to <em>Watson, </em>may be placed out of the question: since it has no effect upon the legal title; and, if the plaintiffs go into a Court of Equity, circumstances may be opposed of weight, sufficient to prevent relief: As may also the dispute, whether <em>Robert\u2019s </em>deed to <em>Kirk </em>was recorded within time; since the act only declares a conveyance, not recorded, to be void as to subsequent purchasers without notice, and <em>Jlrrell </em>is found to, have had notice: And we come to the question on the legal title. From, this special verdict, it appears that both parties claim under <em>Robert M\u2019Leod; </em>the defendants by a prior deed in <em>December, </em>1783, and the plaintiffs by a subsequent deed in <em>September </em>1784; and the prior deed must prevail, unless its operation is prevented by the adverse possession at the time of making it; as to which fact, the special verdict is uncertain, if not contradictory, for it states, that <em>Jlrrell </em>in 1776, entered into possession of the lot, and quietly held it till his death in 1795, and that <em>Ro~ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>bert, </em>at the time of his conveyance to <em>Kirie, </em>was out of possession; which might bo true, and yet it might also be true, that <em>Robert, </em>after the conveyance, might peaceably enter into the lot, so as to make livery of seisin, if no person, claiming under <em>Mrrell, </em>was then upon the lot; of which the memorandum endorsed on the deed and proved by the witnesses, is a very strong evidence, and which is rendered probable also, by the nature of <em>,/lrre.IPs </em>occupation as stated, since he occupied it as a grass lot; but still, however strong, this is only evidence; and the fact, whether there was an actual and peaceable entry, so as to make the livery effectual, ought to have been decided by the jury; especially as they state an adverse possession, with notice. The Court is therefore of opinion, that they cannot proceed to judgment upon this verdict, it being uncertain, if not contradictory, as to the material facts of <em>Pirre. IPs </em>continual possession from 1776 to 1795, and <em>Robert JM\u2019 hood\u2019s </em>peaceable entry to make livery to <em>Kirk </em>in 1783. The <em>judgment is therefore reversed with </em>costs, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
