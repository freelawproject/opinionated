In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and affixed my seal, this 20th day of <em>September, </em>1776.\u201d That the testator died in 1778, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>issue, leaving <em>William Watson </em>his brother and heir at law. That the said <em>William Watson </em>also died the same year, intestate, leaving the plaintiff, his son, and heir at law. That the said <em>Rosy Watson </em>entered on the lands, by virtue of the said <em>will, </em>and was seised as the law requires. That she married <em>Littleton Addison, </em>and together with him conveyed the said lands, on the 26th day of <em>March, </em>1782, to <em>Underhill. </em>That she died in 1795. That <em>Underhill </em>conveyed to <em>Henry, </em>who devised it to <em>Susanna Henry, </em>who intermarried with <em>Straiten ; </em>and with him conveyed to <em>James Powell, </em>who devised it to the defendants. The District Court gave judgment for the defendants; and the plaintiff obtained a writ of <em>supo'sedeas </em>thereto from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-8\"><em>Call, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANP\">contended that the devise to <em>Rosy Watson </em>carried only an estate for life; that the reversion, after her death, descended on <em>William Watson </em>the heir at law; and that the plaintiff claiming under him, became entitled to the land, on the death of the devisee for life.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-9\"><em>George K.

That he died without issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and the plaintiff is his nephew and heir at law. That <em>Rosy Watson, </em>the devisee, intermarried with <em>Littleton dlddison, </em>and with her husband, by deed in 1782, conveyed the land to <em>dimos Underhill, </em>under whom the defendant claims. Upon this verdict the District Court gave judgment for the defendants, and to that judgment there is a <em>supersedeas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">Although there are no words of limitation\" in the devise, yet it has been decided in this Court, conformably to modern decisions in <em>England, </em>that the word <em>estate </em>in the preamble, shall be incorporated in the devise, and pass a fee. In <em>Kennon v. M\u2019Roberts </em>et ux. [1 Wash. 96,] I delivered my opinion fully on this point, the other Judges suspended theirs as unnecessary, all concurring in opinion that the residuary clause in that will did not comprehend the reversions, if there were any; but subsequent judgments have confirmed the opinion I then delivered, on that point; which is considered as settled; and on that ground, there is no error in the judgment. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">We discover an apparent defect in the defendant\u2019s title, as Rosy <em>dlddison </em>does not appear to have been privily examined. This, however, may not be real, (since the Clerk\u2019s certificate of the probat is not annexed to the deed;) but whether so or not, is of no importance, upon this verdict, as the lessor of the plaintiff, who must recover upon the strength of his own title, is not stated to be heir at law to <em>Rosy; </em>who, for any thing which appears to the contrary, may have left children. Upon the whole, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\">[* See <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Miller </em>et al. <em>1 </em>Call, 127, and cases there cited.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
