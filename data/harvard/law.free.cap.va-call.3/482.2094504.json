E. Application was made to the <em>President </em>and <em>Masters </em>of the College, for a lease to each, for his part, which they refused giying, as it was a rule with them, that no lot should be divided: But, they agreed to give a lease to either of them, and that they might divide the possession as they pleased. A lease was given to <em>Richard Johnston, </em>\u00e1nd they divided the lot between them by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>courses of Gravelly run, leaving to <em>Johnston </em>385, and to <em>Gaines </em>685 acres. It was a condition of the College leases, that the lessee should not give, grant, alienate, sell, assign, or set over his interest or title, without having first obtained, in writing, the assent of the <em>President </em>and <em>Masters </em>for the time being, except only by last will and testament, whereby only the whole premises together, and not any part of the same, shall be demised and bequeathed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-4\"><em>Richard </em>Johnston, by his will dated in <em>September, </em>1771, devised, that his College leases should be sold on <em>twelve </em>months\u2019 credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">In 1781, his executors proceeded to <em>sell </em>the said lands at public sale; and <em>John Syme, </em>jun. who was the proprietor of some adjoining fee simple lands, being the highest bidder, became the purchaser, at the price of 115,000 weight of tobacco. No bond having been given, an action on the case was instituted by the executors in the General Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">When this suit was for trial, <em>John Syme </em>and <em>William Johnston </em>met at the house of <em>Richard Chapman, </em>and after much altercation, and a comparison of several College leases, <em>Syme </em>declared himself perfectly satisfied, admitted that he had the quantity of land he had purchased, and agreed to confess a judgment for such a sum of money as the tobacco, by a person fixed on between them, should be estimated at. The tobacco was estimated at twenty-eight \u00a1shillings j\u00bbe?* hundred, and for that sum judgment was given. After an execution had issued, <em>Syme </em>applied to and obtained an injunction from the Court of Chancery, in <em>October, </em>1786, having stated in a bill bis equity, which, he alleged, was unknown to him, at the time the judgment was confessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">It appeared, that the division of the lot C. E. between <em>Johnston </em>and <em>Gaines, </em>was known in the neighborhood; that at the sale of the lots, the executors declared that they sold them as their father held them, and that there were 4325 acres. During the sale, notice was given by an agent for <em>Walker Tomlin, </em>that he claimed a part of the land held under one of the leases, as belonging to an adjoining tract, which was his property. <em>Mordecai Jlbraham, </em>who was one of the bidders, asked the acting executor, <em>TViliiam Johnston, </em>particularly the terms of sale, and he said that he sold the lots as his father held them, except the part north of the Gravelly run, which was the part of O. E. assigned to <em>Gaines; </em>and, on being further asked by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Jlbraham, </em>whether he would make good to the purchaser the land which <em>Tomlin </em>might recover, he said he would not. There was no public information given by the executors, or by the crier, that any part of the ground sold was a divided lot, or that <em>Tomlin </em>had a claim to any part of it. <em>John Syme, </em>the purchaser, had resided in distant parts of Virginia, so as to exclude a presumption that he knew one of the lots had been divided. Though not entirely deaf, his sense of hearing was very obtuse; and those who saw him when <em>Tomlin's </em>agent gave notice of his title, declared their belief that he did not hear the notification. His father, <em>John Syme, </em>appeared to be a partner in the purchase; but he did not interfere in any- manner, and was not present when <em>Tomlin's </em>title was announced. There was some proof that the property would not command half the price given for it. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">The <em>President </em>and <em>Professors </em>gave the following certificate :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-9\">We, the <em>President </em>and <em>Masters </em>of <em>William &amp;? Mary College, </em>do hereby consent to, and approve of the sale, made by the executors of <em>Richard Johnston, </em>of certain leases, to <em>John Syme </em>the younger, which leases bear date the first day of <em>February, </em>1765; retaining, however, the said <em>Johnston's </em>representatives still bound for the rents, and responsible for all breaches of the covenants contained in the said leases, until the said <em>Syme </em>shall take new leases from us, or otherwise bind himself, by accepting an assignment of the said leases in due form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-10\">On the 27th day of <em>February, </em>1789, <em>Thomas Fox, </em>collector for the College, certified on the back of the lease C. E., that he would hold the lessee <em>Johnston, </em>or his assignee only, responsible for half the rent reserved on the lease. And on the 27th of <em>March, </em>1789, the <em>President </em>and two of the <em>Professors, </em>ratified this agreement. On the 11th of <em>May, </em>1789, the executors of <em>Richard Johnston </em>assigned that part of the lease C. E. which lay south of the Gravelly run, to <em>John Syme, </em>jun.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-11\">In <em>October, </em>1789, the cause came on to be heard before the <em>Chancellor, </em>who gave the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-12\">\u201cThis cause came on to be heard, &amp;c. on consideration whereof, &amp;c. The Court is of opinion, not only that in the sale of the College lots mentioned in the proceedings, the defendants do not appear to have been guilty of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>concealment, or other malversation, for which the contract ought to be avoided; but that the plaintiff, after notice, as seemeth to the Court, of what he allegeth to have been concealed from him, and after his title to the said lots might he and were offered to bo confirmed to him, liad tho less just pretence to apply for relief; more especially, as by his intromission at the sale, he hindered a sale to some other, at a price nearly as advantageous as that offered by himself:\u2018The Court doth, therefore, order, adjudge and decree, that the injunction obtained by the plaintiff be dissolved, and his bill dismissed, and that he pay unto the defendants their costs; but this dismission is to bo without prejudice to any relief, which the plaintiff may seek in case of eviction, without collusion, of any part of the 4322-acres of land sold by the defendants to the plaintiff. And the Court doth further order, that the assigned leases, and two papers subscribed by the <em>President </em>and <em>Professors </em>of <em>William 8? Mary College, </em>which are among the exhibits, be delivered the plaintiff, if he will accept them. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">From this decree, the plaintiff prayed an appeal to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-5\">The cause was argued by <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Duval, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">For the appellant, it was insisted, that the decree was founded on the idea of notice to <em>Syme </em>of the incumbrances on his title, and depended on that fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-7\">That there was no proof of notice except from the answer, which does not assert it, since the declaration of satisfaction, which <em>the </em>answer states the appellant to have made, and which <em>Chapman </em>proves him to have made, relates merely to the quantity of land, and does not prove that any other ground of objection to the transaction was then known to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-8\">The answer itself will show, that the appellant had no notice of <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-9\">Nor is any notice, not expressly proved, to be inferred from the circumstances of the case and of the parties. The circumstances from which notice is to be inferred, are, that the division of the lot C. E. was known in the neighborhood, and that <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>agent did, on the day of sale, declare his title to a part of the property sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-10\">The information of the neighborhood cannot affect Mr. <em>Syme, </em>who was a stranger; nor can it be presumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>he </em>heal\u2019d the declaration concerning <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>title, as lie was velT deaf; and the declaration was not addressed to him. The conversation between <em>Mraham </em>and <em>Johnston, </em>was a private conversation, not heard by <em>Syme; </em>and, so far <em>from affording </em>a pj\u2019esumption of notice to <em>Syme, </em>it <em>serves </em>to shew, that the public declarations of <em>Johnston </em>did not reach those points concerning which <em>Mraham </em>enquij\u2019ed. The confession of judgment ought not to affect the case; as he does not appear, at that time, to have had any other objection, than to the quantity of land purchased; and, consequently, that confession can amount in equity only to a waiver of that objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-6\"><em>Syme\u2019s </em>equity then, whatever it may be, remains unaffected by notice, either expressly proved, or to be implied from circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-7\">Enquire into that equity. It consists of two points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-8\">1. The division of the lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-9\">2. <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-10\">1. As to the division <em>of </em>the lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4J\">When a pai\u2019ticular tract of land is exposed to sale, and no incumbi\u2019ances are stated, the purchaser has a right to believe that no incumbrances exist. If the seller knows of these incumbrances, and yet conceals them, it is a suppression of truth, which a Coui\u2019t of Conscience considers an d treats as a fraud. On purchasing these lands, Mr. <em>Syme </em>had a right <em>to </em>expect a clear and complete title to <em>the </em>particular lands purchased, unmingled with the title or possession of any other person. Can he ever now obtain such a tillo ? More than half of one of the lots is the property of another person. It may be true, that notwithstanding this, Mr. <em>Syme </em>has his quantity; but, the mere quantity is not the only important consideration in such a purchase. The College leases are subject to a certain rent, and are subject to forfeiture, unless certain improvements be made. To the whole of the rent, Mr. <em>Syme, </em>as the legal proprietor of the lease, was liable, until so late as March, 1789; and is yet liable for the half of it, although he holds but little more' than a third of the lot; and for the whole improvements, he appears, from the expression of the paper given by <em>Fox, </em>and assented to by the College, to be still liable. The lease is forfeitable by alienation otherwise than by devise. It is true, that the <em>President </em>and two of the <em>Professors, </em>who are not a majority, for there are six Professors, have sanctioned the sale to <em>Syme; </em>but, the lease may be forfeited by a sale of the holders of the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>moiety. As the legal proprietor of the land, <em>Syme </em>is liable for all the taxes which may be imposed on it. It is true, he has recourse to the proprietor of the other part of the lot; but, he did not consider himself as purchasing property, which subjected him to the payment of money, which ho might afterwards recover from another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-4\">These are serious inconveniences, a knowledge of which might have had considerable influence with Mr. Syme, in making the purchase. They are inconveniences to which 'he has not consented to subject himself, and to which Mr. <em>Johnston </em>has no right to subject him; but, they are inseparable from a complete and full establishment of the contract. Nor can those objections be got over by establishing the contract, except as to the lot C. E., and annulling it as to 1ha.t lot; because, the Court can never split a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-5\"><em>3. </em>His title is threatened by <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-6\">Whatever this may be, <em>Johnston </em>had knowledge of it, and ought to have proclaimed it. The .necessity for this was the stronger, as he did not mean to warrant the title of the land sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-7\">That no suit has been brought docs not protect Mr. <em>Syme, </em>because the possession being social, no length of time will guard him from the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-8\">This is in the nature of a bill of <em>quia timet, </em>and the Court will direct <em>Syme, </em>to be secured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-9\">From the price given for the lands, and the price at which they could now be sold, being less than half what was given, one of two things must be obvious. Either the contract was at first a very hard one, or the lands, before <em>Syme, </em>could get even the title which the certificates of the College now give him, had fallen very much in their price. This will <em>induce the </em>Court to lay hold of circumstances which might not otherwise be deemed material, to set aside the contract. That <em>Johnston </em>might have sold the land to another for nearly the same money, if <em>Syme </em>had not overbid him, and that it is not now in his power to make a similar sale, ought not to affect the case, because the loss ought to fall where the fault has been; and in this case the fault is in <em>Johnston, </em>who did not openly and publicly proclaim the state of his title to the property sold. <em>[Heath </em>v. Heath,] Bro. C. C. 148; <em>[Marlow </em>v. <em>Smith,</em>] 2 P. Wms. 201; [Colton v. <em>Wilson </em>et al.] 3 P. Wms. 190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>For the appellees, it was urged:</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">That there were circumstances in the case which raised against Mr. <em>Syme </em>a strong presumption of notice at the time of the sale. Having come to a public sale determined to purchase the land which was contiguous to his own estate, he must be considered as having made enquiries concerning the property he designed to acquire. The whole neighborhood knew that the lease was divided, and a part of it was in the actual possession of the person entitled to it. In addition to this, his father was a joint purchaser .with him, who might be supposed to be informed of the state of the property. If he did not hear <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>claim announced, he was in a circle of his friends bidding for the land, and it was not likely that no one of them should inform him of it. Declarations of that sort at a sale are always the subject of general conversation, and are certain to be mentioned to a bidder, especially one known to be deaf. <em>Johnston </em>could not have supposed it necessary for him to proclaim <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>title, since <em>Tomlin </em>had proclaimed it himself, and <em>Syme </em>might as well <em>be </em>supposed not to have heard <em>Johnston, </em>as not to have heard <em>Tomlin\u2019s </em>agent. The nature of the sale should have put every purchaser on his guard. The sale was made by an executor, who only professed to sell the right of his testator. <em>Syme </em>then ought to have made particular enquiries into the nature of the property, and there is no reason to suppose that <em>Johnston </em>considered him as not hearing what others heard, because <em>Johnston </em>did not know him, and could not know that he was deaf. But, certainly in <em>October, </em>1785, when <em>Syme </em>confessed a judgment, he ought to have been acquainted with the property he had purchased. Every defence which is made in this <em>Court, </em>could have been made at law; and, therefore, the confession of judgment will bind Mr. <em>Syme, </em>unless he shews that at that time he was unacquainted with circumstances, which, from the time that had elapsed, he must be supposed to have known.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-9\">But, if he had not notice, still under the circumstances of the case, there is no ground of application to this Court. <em>Johnston </em>does not appear to have intentionally concealed any thing. No fraud, therefore, is ascribable to him. There is in the case no fact, which, with that degree of usual enquiry which common prudence dictates to purchasers, Mr. <em>Syme </em>might not have been possessed of. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>this case, as the sale was made by an executor, who sold, as he said, only the right of his testator, the principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies with peculiar force. Under this impression, the incumbrances on the land ought to be examined. The clause in the leases would probably authorise a sale made in pursuance of a will. If it will not, still the <em>President </em>and Professors have sanctioned it by their after-act. The division of the lease is also sanctioned. The certificate in <em>March, </em>1789, amounts in substance to a complete separation of the lease, and would certainly disable the College from resorting to the possessor of the ground on one sideof Gravelly run, for any thing whatever, on account of the ground on the other side. The proportion of taxes may be made payable in the \u2019first instance by the holder of the other part of the lot by entries on the books of the Commissioners, and should the proprietor re-, fuse so to do, Mr. <em>Syme </em>having the legal title, may eject him, and hold him out till he shall comply with such conditions as a Court of <em>Chancery </em>shall deem equitable. There is now, then, a complete title, and if a complete title can be made at the time of the decree, it is sufficient. 2 <em>Pow. </em>on Cont. 630.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-8\">Gravelly run must be considered as dividing the lot equally in point of value, though unequally in point of quantity, as it is a division made by consent, and there is no proof or allegation of inequality of value.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-12\">[* See <em>Sugd. </em>on Vend. ch. 8, sec. 2, p. 282, <em>2 Am. </em>ed.; <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>7 Ves. <em>jun. </em>202; <em>Hepburn </em>et al. v. <em>Dunlop </em>&amp; Co. 1 Wheat. 179; <em>Brashier </em>v. <em>Gratz, </em>6 Wheat. 528.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-9\">LYONS Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASc\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">After stating the case, he said, that the Court considered the declaration of the executor, that ho sold only as his testator <em>held, </em>as imposing <em>on </em>the purchaser the necessity of enquiring into the state of the property.
