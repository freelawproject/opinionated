That <em>Graves, </em>on the 28th of <em>November, </em>1793, convoyed to <em>Dvval </em>and <em>Younghusband. </em>That there was no proof <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>that <em>Graves </em>was ever in actual possession, or ever entered upon the premises, for the purpose of executing the last mentioned deed; but that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>fendant now, and always hath had adverse possession of ple premises against the said <em>Graves, </em>and all holding by or under him, except as to the operation of the deeds aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-4\">The District Court gave judgment for the defendant; because <em>\u201c lhe. demise and ouster laid in the plaintiff \u2019s declaration is precedent to the accruing of his title.\u201d </em>To which judgment the plaintiffs obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from a Judge of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-5\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b334-6\">The objection made by the District Court, is expressly cured by the act of <em>Jeofails. </em>[R.C. c. 128, \u00a7 102, ed. 1819.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"AJ_\">If the District Court erred upon the ground they mention, which is not admitted, still, if they were right on any ground it will be sufficient; and it does not appear that the plaintiff ever was in possession within twenty years next before the suit.

On that point the Court have no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">The objection on which the District Court founded its judgment, if any thing in it, is cured expressly by our statute of <em>Jeofails. </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">That question depends upon the common doctrine relative to ehoses in action, which has of late years undergone very great alterations. <em>[Master </em>v. <em>Miller,] 4 </em>T. R. 340. It was formerly held that a mere possibility was not assignable; but that doctrine is now completely reversed. [Roe v. <em>Jones </em>et al.] 1 H. Black. 30; and if such a contingent and uncertain estate as that could be granted, it would seem much more reasonable in such a case as the present: Otherwise, innumerable inconveniences would follow; for, then a man in debt, but out of possession, could not dispose of his lands to relieve himself from difficulties; and trustees could not sell under a deed of trust, unless the debtor would consent to give them possession. Reason and public convenience are, therefore, strongly in favor of the conveyance, unless the act of Assembly against buying and selling pretensed titles, shall be thought to make a difference. But it would be extraordinary, if a man were to be received to say, against his own deed, that his own vendee obtained a pretensed title only; and it is scarcely- credible, that the Legislature could have intended that a purchase under a deed of record, whieh is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a complete title, should be rendered void by the possession of the vendor.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b335-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The verdict finds that <em>Graves </em>never was in possession, and at common law, there must, have been a junction of both right and seisin, in order to enable the latter to eonvey. 2 <em>Black. </em>Com. 314, 290; <em>Co. Litt. </em>214, 266. The same rule holds good with regard to conveyances under the statute: Which unites the use with the possession; but that necessarily supposes the bargainor to he in possession; or else the statute could not transfer his possession to the use. A seisin in law is not enough: for, that is not suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>cient for any purpose but a descent. 1 <em>Inst. 49; Plowd. 139, </em>Besides, the contrary doctrine is expressly against the act concerning buying and selling pretensed titles; and a conveyance against a rule of law or statute cannot be supported. [Per Holt, C. J. in <em>Bartlett </em>v. Vinor,] Carth. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Bibb </em>being in possession when he conveyed to <em>Graves, </em>ihere can be no doubt of the legal operation of that deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">But <em>Graves </em>being out of possession, and that stated to be adverse in <em>Bibb, </em>when the bargain and sale to the plaintiffs was made by <em>Graves, </em>the counsel are permitted, as they desired, to argue the question, whether any title passed to the plaintiffs by that deed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b336-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The tenant of the freehold may convey; and the act of Assembly, <em>Rev. Code, </em>167, made <em>Graves </em>tenant of the freehold, immediately, on the execution of the deed to him. But, aman once seised continues seised, until he is actually disseised. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Atkyns, </em>1 Burr. 110, <em>[Smartle </em>v. Williams,] 1 Salls. 245; <em>[Blunden </em>v. Baugh,] Cro. Car. 302; <em>[Powsely </em>v. Blackman,] Cro. Jac. 660; which likewise shews that the owner may elect to consider himself disseised, or not, at his pleasure. The jury have not found an adverse possession positively, but conditionally; and, therefore, according to the doctrine, <em>Graves </em>had a right to consider himself disseised, or not, as he pleased; and, consequently, had a right to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. milt.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b336-9\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"AAB\">delivered the resolution of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">This is a <em>supersedeas </em>to a judgment of the District Court of <em>Charlottesville, </em>in ejectment, commenced there by the appellants against the appellee; in which the jury find a special verdict, stating, that the defendant <em>Robert Bibb, </em>by deed of bargain and sale, dated <em>December </em>13, 178S, which was duly recorded, conveyed the lands in question to <em>Francis Graves </em>in fee, and covenants <em>to </em>warrant and defend the land to <em>Graves, </em>his heirs and assigns, against himself and all others. That <em>Graves, </em>by a like deed, dated <em>November </em>28, 1793, also duly recorded, conveyed the lands to the plaintiffs in fee, with a general warranty. That, at the time of the first conveyance, the defendant <em>Robert </em>was in possession, and had been for upwards of twenty years. That no proof was made that <em>Graves </em>was ever in actual possession, or ever entered into the land, for the purpose of executing his deed to the plaintiffs; but, that the defendant <em>Robert </em>has now, and always has had, adverse possession of it, against <em>Graves, </em>and all holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>under him, except as to the operation of the deeds. On this verdict, judgment was given for the defendants; because, as the record states, the demise and ouster, as laid in the declaration, appear to be prior to the commencement of the plaintiff\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The first question arises on the reason given by the Court for their judgment; hut, this is plainly decided by a clause in the act. of Assembly of 1792, p. 119 of the <em>R. C. </em>[c. 128, \u00a7 102, ed. 1819,] that, after issue joined on the title only, in ejectment, no exception of form or substance shall be taken to the declaration in any Court whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">As to the twenty years possession in <em>Robert, </em>prior to his conveyance to <em>Graves, </em>it only proves that he had a good title in ejectment, and a right to make that conveyance, and cannot operate as a bar by the act of limitation to the plaintiffs claiming under <em>Graves, </em>whoso right of entry accrued only eight years before suit brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The third, and principal question is, whether the bargain and sale of <em>Graves </em>(then out of possession) to the plaintiffs, passed his title to them ? As an objection to its passing the title, the statute and act, of Assembly against buying pretensed titles, were relied on, as having, in addition to the severe penalty on the buyer and seller of the land, made the conveyance void. It is unnecessary to consider whether those laws produced the effect contended for, since we are all of opinion that the purchase of the plaintiffs is not within the act of Assembly, which has this exception: <em>\u201c </em>unless the person conveying, or <em>those under whom he claims, </em>shall have been in possession one whole year next before.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Here, <em>Graves </em>was the person conveying, and <em>Bibb, </em>the person in possession, was him under whom <em>Graves </em>claimed; so that, literally, <em>Bibb </em>is excluded from making the objection: and, if it depended upon construction, could the plaintiffs possibly suppose, when they purchased, that. <em>Bibb\u2019s </em>possession was adverse to the title of <em>Graves, </em>to whom he had conveyed the land, with a general warranty ? <em>Whether </em>a person out of possession can convey his title by bargain and sale, or any other statutory conveyance, seems settled by the decisions in <em>England, </em>under their statute of uses; and our act of Assembly, <em>R. C. </em>167, [c. 99, \u00a7 29, R. C. <em>ed. </em>1819,] in conformity to those decisions, has added a clause, not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the statute of uses, that those conveyances shall transfer qlc possession to the use, as perfectly as if the bargainee had been enfeoffed with livery of seisin of the land <em>conveyed.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court are, therefore, of opinion, upon this point, that the title of <em>Graves </em>passed to the plaintiffs by the bargain and sale, and gave them a good title against <em>Bibb: </em>And, upon the whole, that there is error in the judgment of the District Court; which is to be reversed with costs, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-14\">[* <em>Whittington </em>et al. v. <em>Christian </em>et al. 2 Rand. 353.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\"><em>[* R. </em>C. c. 103, \u00a7 1, ed. 1819.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">[* See <em>Tabb </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>post, p. 484.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A_G\">[\u2020 See H. &amp; M. 113.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
