We, the arbitrators afore-mentioned, have met and considered the lease or agreement aforesaid, and we find that in the said lease or agreement the following stipulations are contained: After the said <em>Ross </em>accepts of alease of the land adjoining <em>Richmond, </em>a grist-mill thereon, canal, fishery, &amp;c. and all other advantages and convenien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ces of what kind soever attendant thereon, he covenants as follows: Thai he will make the improvements herein-after named, to wit, a convenient bake-house, two stories high, with three ovens, a miller\u2019s house, 32 hy 16, one story high with two chimneys of stone or brick, lathed and plaistercd and finished in a workman-like manner, a kitchen, 16 by 16, with a stone or brick chimney, a stable of convenient size, and also a cooper\u2019s shop: That he will open the canal, extend and improve it, so as to admit a plentiful supply of water, as far as the situation and plan of the said mill will admit with convenience, to pay taxes, and to deliver the said mill, together with the improvements aforesaid at the expiration of the said term of seven years, in proper tenantable repair, ft appears by the admission of each party, that in January, 1781, by an extraordinary and unexpected movement of the ice, the mill-house was entirely demolished, and the said <em>Tloss </em>had it not in his power to prevent the same. In pursuance of the submission aforesaid, we the said <em>Joseph Jones, James Madison </em>and <em>Henry Tazewell, </em>do award and determine, that the said <em>David Ross </em>shall pay the rents reserved in the said lease or agreement, notwithstanding the accident aforesaid, and that the said <em>David Ross </em>shall comply with and perform the other covenants contained iu the said lease.\u201d Pleas, <em>conditions performed; </em>and no <em>award: </em>Issue on. both; and then the record, after stating that the jury were sworn, proceeds thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\">\u201cThe declaration on which the said issues were joined, stated the date of the bond to be the 25th day of. \u2014 \u2014, 1784; and after the jury were sworn to try the said issues, the counsel for the plaintiff with the assent of the defendant\u2019s counsel, amended the said date at the bar, so as to be the 22d day of <em>May, </em>1784; but the counsel for the plaintiffs, having thereupon suggested that the amendment was made through mistake, moved that the date of the said bond should bo restored to what it originally was when tlie jury were sworn, to wit, the 25th day of \u2014 1784; which motion was opposed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, but granted by the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">Verdict for the plaintiffs upon both issues; and the defendant moved to arrest the judgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">1st.

This misrecital is fatal. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>2 Wash. 70. <em>For, </em>the declaration states the breach in not performing an award made upon another bond, than that stated in the declaration: Which latter, according to this record, is not alledged to be violated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-12\"><em>Duval, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0z\">The award states the facts; and it is evident, that the arbitrators have drawn an inference, from those facts, erroneous in point of law. For, the injury done to the premises was owing to the act of God, which excused the covenant. Thus, if a house fall by tempest, it is not waste in the tenant. So, if there be a contract for the purchase of a house, which is burnt before a conveyance, the purchaser will not bo bound to pay the purchase money, <em>Stent </em>v. <em>Baily, </em>2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 689;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and, there are various instances where it has been held that inevitable accidents will excuse the tenant. <em>[Mingay, </em>argo. in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Sandham, </em>citing <em>Brown </em>v. Quitler,] 1 T. R. 708. It is like the case of a common earner, who, though generally held to stand insurer, is yet excused by the act of God. <em>[Forward </em>v. Pittard,] 1 T. R. 28. The arbitrators, therefoi'e, were clearly mistaken in their inference from the facts; and the Court may relieve against it. <em>Jerdone </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>[Saturday, <em>Dec. </em>18, 1790,] in this Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-13\"><em>Wickham, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7q\">The Court may correct the ei'ror in the opinion of the arbitrators, as it appears from the face of the award. <em>[Pleasants </em>et al. v. <em>Ross,] </em>1 Wash. 158.

Because it is true: For, the defendant, does not show any other bond; and, therefore, it must necessarily apply to this, as the Court will not presume any other. 2. Because, the substance of the bond and award agree; which proves the reference was to this very bond, and to no other: And it is enough if by reference it can he ascertained. <em>Deane </em>v. <em>Cunliffe, </em>in this Court,. M. S. [Thursday, Apiril <em>20th, </em>17<em>97.</em>] The names of the parties, the sums, and the principal matters of the bond appear in the award; which sufficiently identifies the bond referred to. 3. Because, the arbitrators have found the true date of making a bond, which boro an uncertain date: thus rendering that certain, which was uncertain before: And they clearly had a power to do so. For, arbitrators may find the true date, in the same manner as a jury; who are noi, bound down to the date expressed in the instrument, but may find the actual date: which is the day of the delivery'. For, wherever the dale <em>is </em>uncertain, void, or omitted, it may be supplied by pleading, or finding. <em>[Cromwell </em>v. <em>Grumsden,] </em>1 Ld. Raym. 335, <em>6 </em>Mod. <em>214; Goddard's </em>Case, 2 Co. 4; 1 <em>Nels. </em>Abr. 388. 4. Because, there is no repugnancy, between the date expressed in the bond, and that recited in the award. For, it, states, that the bond was <em>dated, </em>and not that it <em>bore date., </em>on the <em>22d </em>of <em>May, </em>1784: But, it is the delivery which constitutes the da to, and not the expression in the bond: So, that, the dat\u00e9 is independent of the words; and, therefore, as it is a substantive fact, it may he found, without assailing the bond <em>itself. </em>Consequently, <em>the stating the </em>actual dale did not. produce any inconsistency. 5. Because, in cases of this kind, (.he question is not, when the deed was made, but, whether the party actually did make it? <em>Goddard's </em>Case, 2 Co. 4. 6. Because, the bond bears date in 1784, and the arbitrators merely add the time of the year: So, that they cannot bo said to misrecite; for, the year, which is all the date contained in the bond, is truly recited; and the addition of the month will not prejudice; because, if. comports with the bond, and does not produce a variance: Which is the only ground upon which misreeilals are held to vitiate. 7. Because, the pleas admit the award. \u2019 For, the plea of conditions performed goes to the award staled in the declaration: because, when he says he has per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>formed the conditions of the bond, he virtually affirms, that he has performed the award, which is alledged to proceed from it. The same observation applies to the other plea, of no <em>such award </em>as that stated in the declaration. For, there the plea goes to the award, which is alledged expressly: <em>After </em>which, it is too late to object a variance between that, and the bond. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>and <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>M. S. in this Court. In this respect it differs from <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>2 Wash. 70: Because, there was no subsequent plea, or admission <em>of the fact </em>in that case. 8. Because, it has been expressly decided, that it does not vitiate. <em>Style </em>87; <em>Allen </em>87; 1 <em>Ventr. </em>184: Which are conclusive as to bonds: and, therefore, even if <em>Turner v. Moffett </em>is to prevail in <em>cases </em>of reference, still in the case of a bond, the award will not be avoided, by such a misrecital as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-8\">The defendant was bound to pay the rents, and perform the covenants, notwithstanding the act of providence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">A distinction has been sometimes taken, between a case, where the soil itself is carried away; and where the buildings and conveniences are destroyed, but the soil is left. In the former case, <em>the </em>rent is said not to be demandable, (as no act of the tenant could enable him to enjoy the property;) but, in the other it is: Because, the tenant still has the use of the soil, and may restore the conveniences with labor and pains. This distinction clearly operates in favour of the appellee in the present case; because, the tenant might re-build the mill, and he has the benefit of the residue of the demise. Besides, the rule is inflexible, that wherever there is an express covenant to pay the rents, put repairs, or restore in tenantable order, there the tenant is bound by his covenant, and must perform <em>it, </em>at all events: And the want of enjoyment is not material; because, a man may covenant under seal, without a consideration. [Para<em>dine </em>v. <em>Jane,] </em>Allen 27; <em>[Monk </em>v. Cooper,] 2 Stra. 763; <em>[Shubrick </em>v. Salmond,] 3 Burr. <em>1638, </em>1640; <em>[Balfour, adm'r. </em>v. Wesson,] 1 T. R. 310.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-10\"><em>Nicholas, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aig\">Courts are more liberal in construing awards now, than formerly; and the subject matter plainly shews, that the award, in this case, was made upon the bond stated in the declaration; for, that is certain, which can be rendered so. 2 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 218, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the date might be averred. The defendant cannot be received to object the variance at this time. For, the award is stated in the declaration; the plea goes to it; and the jury have found it. If the defendant had chosen to have drawn the variance into question, he should have pFad it. The case of <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>2 Wash. 70, is not like this; 1st. because, there was no plea over in that case, as there is in this. 2d. Because, the award there contradicted a record. The issue in this case was, whether the award was made in pursuance of the bond declared on ? And the jury have found that it was; which is conclusive. It is not clear that the Court can correct a mistake of the arbitrators, if in fact they had drawn an erroneous inference in point of law. The ease of <em>Jerdon </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>I am not acquainted with; and, that of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Pleasants, </em>(Chancery Decisions,) was the case of a mistake in facts. But, if the Court can make such a correction, there is no ground for it in the present ease. For, the award does not state the facts certainly enough to enable the Court to do it. However, upon the merits, the law is in our favor; for, the express stipulations bound the defendant both at law, and in equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auq\">The variance is not material. The old authorities are clearly so; and they are approved of in <em>Kyd </em>on Awd. 159. The case of <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>2 Wash. 70, does not apply; because, the award there contradicted a record; whereas, this is merely a bond, which is matter <em>in pais </em>only. Besides, the case appears to have passed <em>sub silenlio; </em>and the jury here, have found the fact. The arbitrators were not mistaken in the legal inference. There were several other advantages besides the mills, as the fishery, &amp;c.; which the defendant might have enjoyed, notwithstanding the ice; and, therefore, the partial inconvenience ought not to excuse him. Besides, we are in a Court of Haw, where the legal covenants must prevail: For, equitable circumstances are of no weight in the present action. If the defendant supposes they are of any avail, he must apply to a Court of Equity. But, even there, he, perhaps, would not be relieved. For, although Ld. Nobthixg-tos, in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Quilter, </em>speaks very liberally, yet he hints something concerning the cross action of tho party, which would not apply here. The accident was a probable one, and yet no provision is made for it; which looks as if it was not considered, at the time, that he was to he relieved.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Warden, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">There is a plain variance between the bond declared on, and that recited by the referees; which is sufficient to avoid the award. The arbitrators were clearly mistaken, in the inference, which they drew from the facts. The parties did not intend it; and the law does not support their deduction. <em>Landlord\u2019s Law, 222; </em>1 <em>Inst. 53. </em>This is a mistake which ought to be corrected; and the Court have the power to do it. <em>Kyd </em>on Awd. 239.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY6\">There was a variance between the bond declared on, and that produced in evidence. It is not true, that you may declare on one bond, and give another in evidence. The difference is, where the declaration states, that the bond <em>bears date </em>on such a day, and where it states \u201cthat it is <em>dated\u201d </em>on that day: In the first case, you may prove, and the jury may find, a different date: But, not so in the latter; because, the plaintiff; by stating the date in his declaration, admits it. Here the award recites a distinct bond, from that declared on; which is expressly within the case of <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Moffett. </em>And it ought to be so; for, suppose the arbitrators had awarded on matters not in this, but another bond, ought their award to have bound? The pleas do not admit the award to have been made, in pursuance of this bond. The declaration does not say so; and, therefore, the plea cannot be construed into an admission of it. In the case of <em>Deans </em>v. <em>Cunliffe, </em>the Court had the notice before them; and, therefore, could see that the award pursued the reference. Under every view, then, the misrecital is an incurable defect. But, upon the merits, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. The accident could not have been prevented by <em>Loss. </em>The covenants could not be enforced upon the principle of natural law; and a Court of Equity would relieve against it, as is clearly proved by the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Quilter, </em>Ambl. 619. Besides, if the strict letter of the covenant is urged, we may insist that the plaintiff covenanted for our quiet enjoyment against all interruption or molestation; which includes the accident, that has happened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-11\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-14\">[* But see <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Ves. <em>jun. </em>349.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\">[* <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Dommitt, 6 </em>T.

That there is a variance between the award and the bond of submission stated in the declaration, the former referring to a bond .dated the 22d of <em>May, </em>1784, and the declaration, stating the bond in suit to he dated the 25th of , 1784. In support of this objection, the counsel principally relied on the case of <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>in this Court, reported in 2 Wash. 71. But, that case does not apply; since the variance was apparent on record, against which no averment is admissible; and it was truly observed, by the <em>.attorney General, </em>that that case was distinguishable from the present; which, being a bond for the submission, was a matter <em>in pais, </em>and the supposed variance might be corrected by averment. The declaration states, that the defendant, on the 25th day of , 1784, by obligation, the date whereof is the same day and year, bound himself to the plaintiffs: In the breaches assigned, annexed to the declaration, after reciting the lease to the defendant, and its essential covenants on his part, and that differences had arisen, which the parties had mutually agreed to refer to arbitration, the plaintiffs aver that they entered into a bond, similar to that entered into by the defendant, to abide by the award; and that the defendant, <em>on the same day, </em>t.o wit: the day of , 1784, executed the bond in the declaration mentioned. It is obvious, from the award, that the arbitrators had before them, not <em>Ross\u2019s </em>bond, hut that entered into by the plaintiffs; which they say is dated the 22d of <em>May, </em>1784. Without going over the several cases cited, the rule laid down, in 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>335, seems to have run through them all; that is, that, if a bond had either <em>none, </em>or an impossible date, the plaintiff may aver any day, which he can prove, the bond to have been delivered on. The present ease is that of no date to the bond; (for, the counsel\u2019s curious criticism, referring the 25th day of something to the day of the year, was calculated only to occasion the mirth it produced.) We consider that, as well as the blank date averment, to be no date: and, of course, there is no variance between that and the true date mentioned in the award; in every oilier thing, in parties, controversy, and arbitrators, they agree. And, on this point, there is no error in the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The second objection is to the award itself. On this point, it was argued by Mr. <em>Wickham, </em>that, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>covenant for quiet enjoyment, the <em>Overtons </em>were the insurers of the property against all accidents; but, surely, that covenant which does not differ essentially from others of a like kind, only obliges the lessor to defend the enjoyment of the lessee against <em>legal </em>claims, and not against a <em>separation of </em>continuity, robbers, thieves, trespasses, or the ice, as was said by the counsel. But, it was argued that where it is apparent in the award, that the arbitrators decided upon principles, in which they were mistaken, either in law or fact, the Court will set aside the award: And that they were so upon the present case; since, it being stated that the mill-house was entirely demolished, by an extraordinary, and unexpected movement of the ic\u00e9, which <em>Ross </em>had it not in' his power to prevent, they mistook the law, when they awarded that he should pay the rent, and perform his other covenants in the lease, notwithstanding the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">For the sake of precedent, the Court first considered how far they ought to interfere with awards, upon this ground; and are of opinion, that they ought not to consider themselyes as an appellate Court from the judgment of the arbitrators, and reverse it, merely because we differ in opinion from them, on a doubtful question ;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but ought to place ourselves in the state of a Court applied to, to grant a new trial, because the verdict is contrary to evidence; which ought to be granted only in case of a plain deviation, and not in a doubtful one, merely because the Court, if on the jury, would have given a different verdict;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> since that would be to assume the province of the jury, whom the law has appointed the triers. This rational distinction between <em>plain </em>and <em>doubtful </em>cases, is observed in the books which justify the Courts in setting aside awards for mistaken principles: That this was, at least, a doubtful question, is evinced, not only by the number of counsel employed to discuss it, but from the <em>English </em>decisions on the subject; and on this ground we think the District Court did not err on this second point; at the same time observing, that stating it as a doubtful case, cannot be complained of by the appellant; since, on the merits, it is our present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>opinion, that the arbitrators did not mistake the law.
