That he devised the same to his sons <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Joseph, </em>for life, with remainder to their eldest sons and their heirs, but, if no male issue, to their eldest daughters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-12\">That the said <em>William Hall </em>died on the 10th of <em>November, </em>1764, leaving seven sons, to wit, <em>William, </em>the eldest, <em>James, Richard, John, Jlnthony, Thomas </em>and <em>Joseph; </em>and four daughters, <em>Elizabeth, Ruth, Hannah </em>and <em>Sarah. </em>That, <em>at </em>the <em>time of making the will, </em>neither the said <em>Thomas </em>or <em>Joseph </em>were married, or had issue. That <em>Joseph </em>died on the 1st of <em>January, </em>1797, \u2019without issue, but leaving a will, whereby he devised an estate for life in 396 acres of the said land to his wife, who entered, and has been ever since possessed thereof. That <em>William Hall, </em>the eldest son and heir at law as aforesaid, by deed of bargain and sale, dated the 17th of <em>October, </em>1797, granted to his son <em>William Hall, </em>the said tract of land, <em>and the undivided, or divided moiety thereof. </em>That, after the death of <em>William Hall </em>the elder, his sons <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Joseph </em>divided the said lands, and they and those claiming under them have held their respective allotments ever since. And if upon the whole matter, the law was for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tiff, judgment was to be entered for him as to <em>one moiety of the land, devised to Joseph and Thomas, being the lands in the declaration mentioned; </em>otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the defendant. The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; and thereupon, the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-9\">\n<em>Randolph.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlY\">The special verdict does not shew that a partition was ever made; for, there can be no partition between joint-tenants, without deed, <em>Co. Litt. 169: </em>and the verdict does not find that any deed was actually made. The testator could not have contemplated the remainder-man\u2019s coming into possession, earlier than the death of both joint-tenants; and he had a right to give his estate as he pleased.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-10\"><em>Steuart, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_7\">The verdict finds a partition; and, that must, necessarily, be taken to mean a legal partition. Besides, by the act of 1786, [ch. <em>98, R. C. </em>ed. 1819,] joint-tenants are made tenants in common; and of course, the plaintiff represented his <em>ancestor. The title could </em>not be in abeyance, but must have been in the heir at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-11\">\n<em>Randolph.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgK\">The verdict only finds that there was a <em>division, </em>and not a partition. Of course, the answer given on the other side, does not avail. The estate ought to be considered as an estate <em>pur autre vie; </em>and, then the doctrine of occupancy takes place. This construction may be made, as it is the ease of a will, although it might have been otherwise in the case of a deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-12\">\n<em>Cur. adv. melt.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-13\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFp\">In this case <em>William Hall </em>the bargainor, in the deed of <em>October, </em>1797, had either a right to recover the premises, in the event which has happened of <em>Joseph Hall\u2019s </em>having died without children, or he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">If he could recover, it would be as heir to old <em>William Hall, </em>and as a reversioner of the estate in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">If he could not recover, then judgment should have been given for the defendants, upon the merits of the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">But, if he himself could recover, it still remains to en-quire, whether his bargainee, the lessor of the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>can recover, the bargainor not having entered after <em>Joscp/i\u2019s </em>death; but, on the contrary, the appellant being found to have been in possession ever since his death ?</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">This question then, is that, decided in <em>Tabb </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>ante 471, unless a difference shall be supposed to arise from the difference of the ouster in the two cases: The ouster, there, being a <em>disseisin, </em>and in this case, I conceive an intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">An intrusion is defined to be <em>\u201c </em>an entry of a stranger after a particular estate of freehold is determined, before him in remainder or reversion,\u201d 3 <em>Black. </em>Com. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">I presume in this case, the appellant is considered as a stranger, although she claims (and entered) under the will of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">But, in this species of ouster, as well as disseisin am* abatement, an actual entry is necessary on the part of the desseised.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">That entry not having preceded (he conveyance in the present case, that conveyance is not valid according to the decision of <em>Tabb v. Baird. </em>The conveyance was of a. mere right of entry. During the life of the particular tenant, his possession was the possession of the reversioner; but, upon his death, and the intervention of the possession of a stranger, the case was altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">I must, therefore, in this point, give judgment in this case, against the present appellee, although T think at present, that the merits of the title are in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">1 am of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b443-12\"><em>PER C</em>UR.</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">Reverse the judgment. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-13\">[* See Birthright, lessee of <em>Hall, </em>v <em>Hall, 3 </em>Munf. 536.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
