The bill charged that <em>the </em>goods were over-priced, and that the plaintiff, who is illiterate and cannot read, had been imposed upon. The answer denies the imposition; and states, that the plaintiff solicited the defendant, to furnish him with goods; that lie purchased them in <em>Philadelphia, </em>and shewed the real invoice to the plaintiff, who took such as he liked only, at agreed prices. The Court of Chancery referred the account between the partios to a Commissioner, who reported, that the prices charged were agreeable to the invoice. There are several depositions taken relative to the terms of the contract, and the prices of the goods. The Court of Chancery dismissed the bill; and <em>Harris </em>appealed io this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-7\">The contract between <em>Hands </em>and <em>Magee </em>ought to be set aside upon the ground of fraud. <em>Harris </em>was illiterate and forced into the execution of the agreement. The latter states the contract perhaps truly; but, it contains other assertions which are disproved by the x\u2019ecord; and threats are held out in it in order to intimidate him. The prices of the goods are so enormous as to carry internal evidence of fraud. Coarse woolens are charged at <em>150per cent., </em>although <em>87i, </em>or 100 <em>per cent., </em>at the highest, is the most ever given for them. Mere inadequacy of price may not be sufficient, of itself, to avoid the contract, but inadequacy, combined with other circumstances will. <em>Heathcote </em>v. <em>Paignon </em>et al. 2 Bro. C. C. 174. The real agreement was for the invoice price, and a reasonable advance for the purchase; but, this was departed from, and he was threatened, by the letter, in order to procure a compliance. A great part of the goods Were old, and there were a good many remnants. It is, in principle, like the case of <em>Broddus </em>v. <em>M\u2019Call, </em>in this Court. <em>[Post, 546.] The </em>answer is disproved by <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Harris; </em>but, independent of that, its credit is destroyed by the conduct of the defendant. <em>Harris </em>was interested, and privy to a fraud: therefore his testimony is of no weight. It does not appear that the invoice is genuine, except from the answer; for, it is not signed by the merchants, who sold the goods. The contract ought to be set aside, and the value only given. <em>Magee </em>prevented <em>Harris </em>from selling the cattle, whereby he sustained an injury, which ought to be compensated; and, for that purpose, an issue ought to be directed. Upon the whole, the fraud is not only apparent fi\u2019om the circumstances, but the conti-act carnes internal evidence of the deception along with it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-9\">The plaintiff executed a deed, which closed the whole transactions, and was a deliberate act, not subject to any reasonable exception; for, there is nothing which proves that any fraud was used in order to obtain it. Most of the allegations of the answer are responsive to those in the bill; and, therefore, they must be disproved according to the usual course, or the general rule of evidence, relative to the weight of an answer, must prevail. Besides, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>are supported by the statements in the report of the Commissioner. There is no proof of fraud; and the plaintiff must prove it, before he protends to draw any relief from that source. Mere ignorance, if it exists, is no ground of relief, unless there is proof that advantage has been taken of it. The threats spoken of, are nothing more than a mere demand of justice, which certainly is no ground of objection. There is no internal evidence of fraud. The advance upon the invoice is not unreasonable; for, calculation will shew, that 100 <em>per cent, </em>was given by <em>'Magee; </em>and, therefore, the compensation which ho demands, considering the risque and expense of transportation, is not extravagant. The supposed inadequacy has no influence. The case of <em>Heathcote </em>v. <em>Paignon, </em>does not apply against the defendant; for, no over-reaching or fraudulent conduct was used there: much less any distress or force. No exception to the old goods was taken in the bill, or any other proceedings in the Court of Chancpry, nor is any testimony taken in order to disprove the invoice. There is no evidence that <em>Harris </em>was interested: nor that he was privy to a fraud; for, no fraud is proved; and, consequently, there is no ground for exception to the weight and credit of his testimony. The idea of the issue is wholly untenable; for, <em>Magee </em>had a right to interpose and forbid the sale. Exceptions, not taken in the Chancery, as to matters of fact, ought not to be allowed to be taken here; because, it tends to surprise the adversary party. The decree, therefore, is right in all its parts, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-5\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">The plaintiff could not read; and, therefore, shewing him the invoice was useless, and proves nothing in favour of the defendant, even were the fact itself established. The Commissioner\u2019s report is not testimony, any further than it is supported by the proofs in the cause; and, therefore, the argument drawn from that source, is not sustainable. The advance of 150 <em>per cent, </em>was altogether unconscionable; it ought to have been the usual advance, which would have been 25 <em>per cent, </em>only, as the <em>Philadelphia </em>wholesale dealers buy of the manufacturers instead of the merchant; and, therefore, can sell them at an advance of <em>Virginia </em>currency for <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency. The invoice prices were actually excepted to in the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Chancery; and, therefore, according to the opposite counsel\u2019s own argument, he ought to have proved them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b456-9\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">The first objection to the decree is, that no deduction is made from the price of the goods; which, it is alledged, ought to have been done, as the plaintiff was imposed upon, and the goods were over-priced. But, both charges are expressly denied by the answer; which is supported by the report, and the acknowledgments of the plaintiff that the debt was just; against which, the plaintiff has nothing to oppose, except loose conversations, and. conjectures; which certainly cannot outweigh the united force of the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">The next objection is, that no allowance is made for the injury done the appellant, by <em>Magee\u2019s </em>forbidding the sale of his estate;, which is certainly a novel idea: for, if there had been any ground for the supposed injury, when was it ever heard that the execution of a contract was to be suspended, until an issue relative to a tort could be tried, so that the damages might be opposed as a discount against the debt ? Upon this ground, the Court discover no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">But, for another reason, they are of opinion, that the decree is erroneous; namely, that although there were several payments, and some misapplications of credits, and the order of reference to the Commissioner embraces all accounts between the parties, yet the Commissioner has only settled the accounts relative to the deed of trust; whereas he ought, agreeably to the order of reference, to have settled all accounts between them, so that the-injunction might have been dissolved, as to the true balance only. Upon this ground, therefore, the decree is to be reversed, and a direction given that a settlement of all their accounts should be made by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">\"This day came as well the appellant as the appellee, <em>John Magee, </em>by their counsel, and on consideration of the transcript of the record of the said decree, and the arguments of the counsel, aforesaid; it appealing by the report of the Master Commissioner made in this cause, that payments had been made by . the appellant to the appellee, <em>John Magee, </em>towards discharging the debt due to the said appellee; for the securing whereof, the deed of trust in the proceedings mentioned, was made to the other appellees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Thomas Hatton </em>and <em>Micqfah Crew; </em>and it also appearing by the receipts and other evidence in the cause, that further and other payments had been made to the appellee, <em>John Magee, </em>which are not credited in the account so stated by the Master Commissioner: This Court is of opinion, that all accounts between the parties shall be fully stated and settled by the Master Commissioner before a final decree: That then the injunction should be dissolved for the balance only, that shall appear on such settlement to be due to the appellee, <em>Magee, </em>from the appellant, with interest until paid, and the injunction to be made perpetual, as to the residue; and that the costs in the Court of Chancery be borne equally by the parties, <em>Harris </em>and <em>Ma-gee. </em>Therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the decree aforesaid be reversed and annulled, and that the appellee, <em>John Magee, </em>pay to the appellant his costs by him expended, in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here.\u2019</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
