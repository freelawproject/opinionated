This presumption will be the rather made, because I am informed at the Treasury, that they keep no account of these warrants, when paid in by the Sheriffs and public officers, by which they can specifically know them; but the same are destroyed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Wickham,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al\">stated, that he had been employed by the Commissioners to argue the general question, whether they were entitled to the money or not; and, if the Court should be of opinion against the defendant on the point, already made, thav. he wished to be heard as to the right to the money.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-6\">Nicholas, Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\">The question is, whether the appellee was entitled to the compensation of the 20l.? He clearly was not: for; although the act of 1790, c. 16, [13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>126,] states that doubts had arisen concerning it, yet a fair exposition of the law will prove, that the Commissioners had no right to the money. The act of 1782, <em>Ch. Rev. </em>178, [c. 19, 10 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>144,] gave the 20l. as a compensation to the old Commissioners for copying and delivering of the book to the Auditors; but, the act of 1786, page 9, [c. 4, 12 <em>Stat. Larg. 248,] </em>constituted a now officer, and gave him no other reward than the six shillings per day.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">The Auditor and the Commissioners always acted upon the idea that the Commissioners were entitled to the 20/.; and, therefore, a motion, which is in nature of an action <em>fur money had and received, </em>will not lie; because it was not against conscience that the defendant retained the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ney. The various acts ought to be considered as one system, That of 1786 was intended to give a compensation in addition to what was given under the act of 1782, which allow-e(j f0\u00a1, COpyjng an(j returning the book, making out lists, &amp;c.: whereas the six shillings is given by the act of 1786, for a different duty altogether. For, the Commissioners appointed under that act were merely substituted in the room of the old ones; and were not new officers to every purpose, as the Attorney General would have it. Consequently, the defendant, in receiving the <em>20L, </em>did not get a double compensation; as he received it for different duties, and not for the same.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">I think that the Court would have been justifiable in presuming the payment; as the defendant did not appear and rebut the presumption, by producing the warrant, or otherwise discharging himself from the receipt: especially, as the Treasurer said he had no means of distinguishing the warrants so as to ascertain the payment expressly.</p>\n<author id=\"b27-4\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">I can never bring my mind to let all the Commissioners shelter themselves under such a defence as this, if they are not entitled to the money. Therefore, I think the other point should be gone into.</p>\n<author id=\"b27-5\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ARW\">I suppose it must lie over to he argued on the other point; but, aman might have lost his warrant, and <em>not </em>drawn <em>the </em>money.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The Judgment was as .follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ATy\">\u201c The Court is of opinion, that the warrant for thirty pounds, in the proceedings mentioned, was by mistake of the Auditor, erroneously issued, and delivered to the appellee as a Commissioner in the county of <em>Mbemarle, for </em>services performed in the years 1787, 1788, and 1789; and that, as the appellee hath not returned the said warrant, it is presumed that the amount thereof has been paid by the Treasurer, and that the said judgment is erroneous. Therefore, it is considered that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the Commonwealth recover against the appellee the costs expended, in the prosecution of the appeal aforesaid here, and the Court proceeding to give such judgment as the said General Court ought to have given; it is further considered, that the Commonwealth recover against the appellee the thirty pounds aforesaid, and the charge of the notice, and the costs of the motion in the General Court.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
