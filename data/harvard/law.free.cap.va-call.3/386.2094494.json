The declaration is, \u201cfor that the said defendants, at <em>Dunkirk, </em>which is within the jurisdiction of the Court of the <em>Borough </em>aforesaid, did, maliciously, and <em>ivithout any legal orjtis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>/ijiabtc cause, </em>attach or arrest, or causo to be attached or arrested, fifty hogsheads of tobacco, or the proceeds thereof, the property of the plaintiff, and the same so attached, or arrested, did detain or cause to be detained; wherefore, he saith that he is injured, and hath sustained damage to the amount of two thousand pounds; wherefore, he brings suit, &amp;c.\u201d Plea, <em>not guilty, </em>and issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">The plaintiff upon the trial, did not produce any copy of the attachment and proceedings under it, but offered depositions and letters to prove it: Which the Court allowing to go in evidence to the jury, the defendants filed a bill of exceptions to their opinion. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed to the District Court, where the judgment was reversed, because the <em>\u201c Borough </em>Court gave it as their opinion, that the evidence, in the bill of exceptions mentioned, was proper to go to the jury; whereas, it was improper, being hearsay evidence, except what was derived from the appellant\u2019s own letter; and because the attachment in the proceedings mentioned, or an authenticated copy thereof, was the best evidence, and ought to have been produced.\u201d To which judgment of reversal, <em>Young </em>obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-9\">The question was, whether the evidence was proper for the jury, or not? Two objections may, perhaps, be raised: !. That the record spoken of was not produced. 2. That letters from the plaintiff aud others were offered to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-11\">The copy of the record was not necessary; as it was a <em>thing </em>spoken olj and admitted, on both sides. Independent of that circumstance, however, it does not appear, that it was a matter of record: For, all countries have not Courts of record; and there was no proof made of any such, in the present case. But, if there was, yet, as it happened in a foreign country, the plaintiff was at liberty to prove it by-other means. <em>[Walker et </em>al. v. Witter,] Dougl. 1. A judgment of a foreign Court has no higher dignity than a debt, by simple contract. And it would be very inconvenient, if the plaintiff must, in all cases, produce the records of a foreign country; as it, frequently, might not be possible for him to procure copies, from a variety of causes over which he could have no control. For instance, the garnishee might refuse to inform him of the Court in which the proceedings were instituted, or the country might be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>such a situation, from revolution or otherwise, that it would not bo possible to obtain them. The matter of the suit was certainly actionable; for, although done in a foreign country, the slander necessarily spread itself, which is a proper foundation of an action. <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Thomas, 2 </em>Wash. 167. The letters were proper evidence, as leading to the introduction of this testimony, and tending to shew its effect abroad.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-8\"><em>Hay, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-9\">The declaration does not state positively, whether, the defendants arrested the tobacco, or the proceeds, but merely that he. did one, or the other. Neither does it state, that the defendants took the property by legal process; of course, it was only trespass; and therefore, trespass, and not case, was the proper action. The words are, <em>attached, </em>or <em>arrested </em>the property: which latter word, <em>arrest, </em>when applied to the person, may be without process; and, therefore, when applied to property, may be the same, although the word <em>attach </em>might mean more. The declaration, as before observed, does not state precisely what was done, which is a great defect; for, it ought to have been precise, in order that the defendant might know the exact charge meant to be urged against him. It was important to say, whether the attachment was of the tobacco, or its proceeds; for, the first might have been more injurious than the latter. However, let these points be as they may, still no cause of action is shewn; for, it is not stated that the attachment was at an end. But, there could be no cause of action, until the event of that proceeding was known. <em>[Waterer </em>v. Freeman,] Hob. 267; <em>[Morgan </em>v. Hughes,] 2 T. R. 231; 2 Esp. 527; <em>[Fisher v. Bristow et </em>al.] Dougl. 215; <em>[Robins </em>v. Robins,] Salk. 15. Besides, the declaration does not aver the want of <em>probable cause, </em>without which there could be no action for a malicious prosecution. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thilman, </em>ante, 3. Improper evidence was admitted iipon the trial of the cause. In the first place, parol evidence of the attachment was received; whereas a copy of the record ought to have been produced; as all civilized nations grant them: And, the act of Assembly supposes <em>it R. C. </em>160. But, there is another objection to the evidence, namely, that the plaintiff was allowed to read his own letters to the jury; and, it is not important, whether they were pertinent to the matter in dispute, or not; for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>still, they ought not to have been read. <em>[Lee v. Tapscott,] 2 </em>Wash. 281. jlut, this is not all; for, a letter from <em>Gregorie </em>and sou was allowed to go in evidence to the jury, altliough it dons not appear, by the record, that 1 here was any conaexion or agency to justify it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-6\">Case, was the proper action; for, it appears that the seizure of the goods was by legal process. The word <em>attachment </em>necessarily implies it; and <em>arrest </em>niay signify \u00fcis same thing: It is like the ordinary phrase of the <em>arrest of a ship; </em>which is introduced into all policies of insurance. Besides, it is a legal word, appropriated to legal proceedings; and is not used in any other way, unless it be figuratively. The distinction, contended for, is not sustainable: for, <em>printu facie, </em>the common meaning will prevail; that is to say, the word will be taken to mean, that <em>it </em>was done by legal process. It is immaterial, however, whether <em>it ho so or not: for, </em>the charge in the declaration will suit either action, and, therefore, the want of form will be cured by the act, of <em>Jeofails.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-8\">The declaration is certain enough; for, it comprehends a.u actual seizure of our property, whether that property, at the time, consisted in the tobacco or its proceeds. The Court will presume, after a verdict, that evidence was given 1,o the jury, that the suit was ended; and then the act of <em>Jeofails </em>will cure the supposed want of the allegation. There is no proof of the existence of a record of the attachment; and, therefore, it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to produce a copy of it. The introduction of the plaintiff\u2019s letters was not improper. It is frequently done in mercantile causes; and it was necessary in order to shew, that the plaintiff had drawn on <em>Dunkirk </em>for the money, and was disappointed: Which proves, that the letter from <em>Gregorie </em>and his son was also necessary, in order to shew that they refused to pay, when called upon to do so. As to the case of <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thilman, </em>it was not like this: For, the words used there, were <em>just cause; </em>which might he true, and the party not to blame either, as he might have had a <em>probable cause, </em>lhit, the words here are <em>justifiable cause: </em>Which are sufficient; for, it implies <em>probable cause; </em>since there could be no <em>justifiable, cause, </em>without a <em>probable, cause. </em>The one necessarily involves the oilier.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-7\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\n<em>Hay.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiBO\">The action should have been trespass; and, if so, there is nothing in the declaration which will make it trespass instead of case. <em>Contra pacem et vi et armis </em>may be omitted; but, in other respects, it must have the character of trespass. If it be doubtful whether it be case or trespass, that alone is fatal. [<em>Tarlton </em>v. Fisher,] Dougl. 674. The want of <em>probable </em>cause, should have been stated in the declaration; and it is not supplied by the words <em>justifiable cause. For, justifiable </em>means the same thing with <em>legal, </em>and amounts to a plea in bar. 3 <em>Black. </em>Com. 306; 4 <em>Black. </em>Com. 178; <em>Law Grammar, </em>356. But, it is admitted that the want of <em>legal cause </em>is not sufficient; therefore, neither will <em>justifiable cause. Probable cause </em>is ground for a suit of malicious prosecution. <em>[Morgan </em>v. Hughes,] 2 T. R. 231; <em>[Reynolds </em>v. Kennedy,] 1 Wils. 233; <em>[Goslin </em>v. Wilcock,] 2 Wils. 307; <em>[Farmer </em>v. Darling,] 4 Burr. 1974. Of course, those words must be inserted in the declaration, or else there is no cause of action. And the verdict will not cure the want of them. <em>[Tarlton </em>v. Fisher,] Dougl. 683; <em>[Winston\u2019s </em>ex\u2019r. v. Francisco,] 2 Wash. 187.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-8\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAL\">If the declaration alleges a direct injury, it is trespass; if consequential, it is case. The present is of the latter kind: For, it is plainly inferrible that the injury was done through the intervention of the officers of justice. The attachment operated either on the effects, or on their proceeds; with this distinction only, that it does not hinder the sale, but merely prevents the paying over the proceeds. It is not like the case of <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thilman, </em>which only had the words <em>just cause. </em>But, here, the words are <em>justifiable cause; </em>which are equal <em>to probable cause: </em>And, it is not necessary to insert the very words <em>probable cause; </em>for, any which are tantamount will do as well: It was impossible to have sustained the suit, without shewing, on the trial, that the attachment was at an end; and, therefore, the omission to insert that fact in the declaration, is cured by the verdict. The cases cited on the other side, are not important. That from <em>Hob. </em>was decided before the statute of <em>Jeofails </em>was made. That from <em>Salk, </em>is a loose note of a <em>diet-urn </em>of Lord Holt, not entitled to much respect. And those from <em>Dougl. </em>and 2 <em>T. R. </em>were upon demurrers. But, independent of this, there are express authorities to shew, that it is cured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the verdict, 2 <em>Vin. </em>Abr. 30, 35; 10 <em>Mod. </em>145, 210; <em>Esp. N. P. 279, 280.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASYJ\">\n<em>Cur. uao. vull.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-7\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Atvm\">In this case I am compelled to yield my impressions, relative to the real justice of the appellant\u2019s cause, to the established principles of the law, as settled by successive and long existing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">It is an action on the case for maliciously and without a <em>justifiable cause, </em>arresting or attaching the plaintiiF\u2019s goods at <em>Dunkirk </em>in <em>France.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Tribunals of justice being instituted for <em>the </em>convenience and benefit of the people, it is a <em>claim of right to </em>prosecute a civil action, or proceeding; whatsoever the ultimate decision on it may be. It then only becomes culpable and actionable, when the party has instituted such proceedings from a corrupt motive, and without any ground or cause therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Such is the general principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">The decisions upon this principle have settled the law to be, that there must be an averment in the declaration of both malice, and the want of probable cause. Without the first, the motive is not corrupt, however mistaken the parly suing, may be: And where there is a probable cause for suing, the ingredient of malice cannot convert the act of suing into a culpable offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">There, is no position of the law more settled than this; and the existence of the one, and the want of the other, must be expressly averred, or supplied by <em>equipollent, </em>expressions. The word justifiable, is not synonymous with <em>proba,ble. </em>The latter refers to a standard within the reach of the person at <em>the time, </em>and determining the purity of his motives. The. former refers to another criterion within his reach, and carrying with it no certain <em>datum, </em>from which we can decide upon the corruptness or purity of the motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">I (piole no particular cases justifying this result; but it has not been delivered without an attention to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">The want of a statement, in the declaration, that the civil proceeding <em>was terminated, </em>is cured by the verdict:<footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but the averment of the want of <em>probable cause </em>is of the very <em>gist </em>of the action, and the omission of it must over throw the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>I therefore concur in opinion with the District Court, bin upon a different ground. The evidence by them supposed to <em>be hearsay, is </em>clearly admissible and relevant. But, I give no opinion, whether we should presume the attachment to have been in a Court of record? Or, upon the necessity of producing a record, shewing its termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">I think the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b412-9\">FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFtg\">The judgment of the <em>Borough </em>Court is certainly erroneous, but, for a reason different from that assigned by the District Court; because, I think the evidence was admissible, as it related to proceedings in a foreign country; which, often times, can bo proved in no other way, than by depositions and testimony <em>da hors </em>the proceedings; of which it is not always in the power of the party to procure copies. The real ground of error is, the want of an averment in the declaration, that there was no <em>probable cause </em>for tho attachment; without which the plaintiff could have no cause of action; <em>[Johnstone </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>in error,] 1 T. R. 544; because, a man is not liable <em>to </em>be sued for a malicious prosecution, unless the plaintiff shews that there was no probable ground for instituting the process. <em>Probable cause, </em>therefore, is the very <em>gist </em>of the action; and, being absolutely necessary to sustain the suit, it must be averred. The words, <em>justifiable cause, </em>do not supply the omission; because, there may not be a justifiable cause, and yet there may be aprobable one; which must depend upon the complexion of things at the time the prosecution was commenced. Consequently, I am of opinion, that the District Court did right in reversing the judgment, but, the plaintiff should be allowed <em>to </em>amend bis declaration.</p>\n<author id=\"b412-10\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1t\">I think the evidence ivas admissible, to shew the injury which the plaintiff had sustained, and that the attachment was commenced without cause: For, as the proceedings took place in a foreign country, it would be too rigid to insist upon copies, which perhaps could not have been procured. Therefore, the judgment of the District Court is not sustainable, upon the reasons assigned by them. But, for another reason, I think it ought to be affirmed. The judgment of the <em>Borough </em>Court was certainly erroneous, on account of the insufficiency of the declaration. It is completely settled, that, in a suit for a malicious prosecution, it must appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that there was no probable ground for the prosecution; since the want of <em>probable anise </em>is the very <em>gist </em>of the action; and, therefore, it must be averred. This averment is not supplied, in the present case, by the words <em>justifiable cause; </em>for, the latter mean no more than legal cause. And there might have been a probable, though not a legal cause. The first might depend upon appearances at the time; the last, upon the real state of the case. The essential ground of the action, then, being omitted, the plaintiff cannot recover upon this declaration; for, it has been often deciden', that if the <em>gis/ </em>of the action bo not laid, a verdict will not cure the defect. <em>[Rushton </em>v. <em>Aspinall,] </em>Doug. 679; <em>[Winston\u2019s ex\u2019r. </em>v. <em>Francisco,] </em>2 Wash. 187; <em>[Chichester v. Vass,] </em>1 Call, 83. The declaration would have, been bad, upon demurrer, for another reason; namely, the omission to charge that the allaehmoiit was ended. <em>[Fisher </em>v. <em>Bristow </em>et al.] Dougl. 215. But, that perhaps is aided by the verdict. However, the failure to lay the want of <em>probable cause </em>is decisive; <em>and, </em>therefore, I am <em>of </em>opinion, that the judgment of both Courts ought to be reversed, and judgment entered for the defendants.</p>\n<author id=\"b413-4\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AT5\">Although there must, in order to ground this action, be a want of <em>probable cause </em>for the prosecution; and, although it is usual to say in the declaration, that there was no <em>probable, cause, </em>yet. 1 do not think it indispensably uocessary, that those very words, and none other, should be used; for, any which are tantamount, and calculated to bring the probable cause fairly into issue, would be sufficient. And I rather incline to think the words <em>justifiable cause, </em>are of that kind: as they clearly admit of the evidence as to the want of <em>probable cause. </em>However, it is unnecessary to decide that point now; because, I am of opinion, that the declaration is defective for another reason; namely, that it does not shew, whether the attachment has been determined, or not; without which, it does not, appear, whether the process issued without probable cause, or not; for, if the attachment should be finally supported by the Court in <em>France, </em>it would negative the idea, that it issued without a cause. It is, therefore, one of the main ingredients in the action. Of course, it ought to be shewn; and until that is done, the injury cannot be established. <em>Bull. </em>N. P. 12, 13; <em>Dough </em>215. For these reasons, 1 am of opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that the judgment of the <em>Borough </em>Court was erroneous; and not for those stated by the District Court; with whom I differ, as to the admissibility of the evidence. For, I think the evidence was proper, as it related to transactions, with respect to a civil suit in a foreign country; where the party might not have had it in his power to obtain copies, and the defendant\u2019s letters had acknowledged the attachment. However, on account of the defect in the declaration, I concur that judgment should be entered for the defendants. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-15\">[* <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Gunton </em>et al. 1 Saund. 228.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-5\">[* See <em>Kirtley </em>v. <em>Deck </em>et al. 2 Munf. 10; <em>Marshall </em>v.
