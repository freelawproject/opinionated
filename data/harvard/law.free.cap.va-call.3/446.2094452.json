The declaration being in the usual form, an issue was made up on the plea of <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the following verdict was found by the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">We find for the plaintiff 61/. lS.s. if the express <em>assumpsit </em>of the defendant, on the 10th day of <em>March, </em>1783, to pay for the goods, wares and merchandize, in the declaration mentioned, which were delivered on the 20th day of <em>July, </em>1781, takes the debt out of the act entitled, \u201cAn act for discouraging extensive credits and repealing the act prescribing the method of proving book debts:\u201d otherwise, we find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">The cause was adjourned<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-9\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-10\">The act of 1779, [c. 3, 10 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>133,] is, in fact, nothing more than an act of limitations. The act of 1705, [c. 35, 3 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>381,] which is the general act of limitations, declares, \u201cthat all actions of trespass, &amp;c. shall be brought within the time therein after expressed, and not after; that is to say, the said actions upon the case, &amp;c. within five years next after the cause of such action has accrued, and not after:\u201d And the act of 1779 declares, that all actions or suits, founded upon account for goods, wares and merchandize, sold and delivered, or for any articles charged in any store account, shall be commenced and sued within <em>six months </em>next after the cause of such action or suit, or the delivery of such goods, wares and merchandize, and not after; except that, in case of the death of the creditors or debtors before the expiration of the said term of six months, the further time of twelve months, from the death of such creditor or debtor, shall be allowed for the commencement of any such action or suit. The object and effect of each act is, to prevent the institution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>suits in certain cases after a time, limited by the wisdom of the legislature, shall have elapsed. In the operative words of the two principal clauses which have been cited, there is little other distinction than the difference of time allowed for bringing the action. It will not bo contended that a longer, or a shorter time, makes the act more or less an act of limitations. The leading and important distinction between the two laws is, that the first must be pleaded, whereas the second is to be noticed by the Court and <em>jury, </em>although the defendant should not seek to avail himself of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-4\">The latter law does not, for this reason, cease to be an act of limitations. If a similar clause had been introduced into the first la.w, it would have been an act of limitations, notwithstanding. That clause does not aifect the right of action: it only relates to the manner in which the subject, to he decided on, is to be brought before the Court; but the decision of the Court will be the same, in the one case as in the other. In a cause, depending on the latter law, which comes before the Court without pleading the act, the Court must decide precisely in the same manner as it would decide the same case brought before it by pleading, if the act had required that it should he pleaded. This clause in the act, therefore, does not change its character, or make it less an act of limitations. If it be, in essence, an act of limitations, then it will be admitted that the fresh assumpsit rescues this case from the operation of the act, as the suit was brought immediately after the new assumpsit was made: But, whatever may be the opinion of the Court on this point, the action is clearly maintainable on other ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-5\">The suit is instituted, not on the contract raised by the delivery of the goods, but on a new contract, for which the delivery of the goods was a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-6\">Although the declaration is in the usual form, yet the assumpsit laid in it, may be considered, either as an implied, or an actual assumpsit. Upon demurrer to 'the declaration, or after a general verdict, it would be considered as founded on an express assumpsit, if it was necessary so to consider it, in order to support it:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, <em>a fortiori, .\\ha </em>declaration, in this case, where the verdict shews a special assumpsit, will be considered as charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>that special assumpsit. The suit, then, being instituted, not on the delivery of the goods, but on a subsequent agreement to pay for them; the only question is, whether the consideration, on which that agreement was made, be sufficient to support it?</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-8\">A moral obligation to do a thing, is a sufficient consideration for an assumpsit. <em>Bull. </em>N. P. 147. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-9\">Can a stronger moral obligation exist, than to pay for property purchased ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-10\">No clause in the act does, or can destroy this moral obligation; nor does any clause make it an unfit consideration for a new contract. The act designed to prevent the inconsiderate incurment of debt, by taking up goods without enquiry; not to disable the individual from making a contract upon a conscientious consideration. The act goes no further than to absolve the debtor from the legal obligation created by the original purchaser of the goods: It does not disable him from making a subsequent contract concerning them. Cases innumerable might be adduced, where a promise will bind a man to do that, which he was not bound by law to do before the promise was made. Money advanced to a son, without request on the part of the father, is yet a sufficient consideration to give validity to a promise of the father to re-pay it. A debt barred by the act of limitations, is a sufficient consideration for an assumpsit: A bankrupt, whose legal discharge is as complete as it would have been bad he never owed a shilling, will yet be bound by his promise, made after the bankruptcy, to pay a debt contracted before it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AgE\"><em>J. Taylor, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-14\">The only question is, whether this assumpsit revives the claim, as in cases under the act of limitations? It cannot revive the claim in like manner, because the two acts are totally dissimilar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-15\">They differ, 1. In title. <em>2. </em>In the motives which induced their passage. 3. In expression. 4. In the mode of being carried into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-16\">1. The title of the first is \u201can act for limitations of actions and avoiding of suits.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Tin: title of the second is \u201can act for discouraging extensive credits, and repealing the act prescribing the method of proving book debts. \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-4\"><em>2. </em>The object of the first act is to prevent the bringing of suits, when time had devoured the defence. The object of the second is to prevent extensive credit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-5\">In the first ease, a fresh promise does away the mischief. In the second, a fresh promise does not diminish it. The act will have made an immaterial change in the nature of the evidence required, without affording in any degree, a remedy for the evil designed to be removed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-7\">9. The expressions vary essentially. What is this suit founded upon ? Is it not on goods, wares and merchandize sold and delivered? The act. proceeds further, and says, \u201cfor any articles charged in any store account.\u201d This is a suit brought for articles in a store account, which articles form the consideration of the promise. The act of limitations goes to the promise: This to the consideration of the promise. There is a difference, too, shewn by the exception in favor of executors and administrators, proving that, in the contemplation of the Legislature, the act embraced every ease not excepted. The penalty, for postdating the items of the account, shews, likewise, the intention of the Legislature to reach the cause of the action: So too, the expelling from the account every article not delivered within six months.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-11\">4. The laws differ in their mode of execution. The act of limitations must fie pleaded: This act need not be pleaded. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The act of limitations does not destroy the debt, but may, or may not, bar its recovery: This act destroys the debt <em>itself; </em>and, therefore, need not be pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-13\">The object of <em>the act </em>would <em>be </em>defeated, if the plaintiff' may dudo it by proving a special promise. When must this promise be made? Suppose, a day after the delivery of the goods, promise of payment be made: If a suit be maintainable on it, the act will be of no avail, as it would be no discouragement to extensive credit. Such promises might always be obtained. The purchaser would never fail to give them on the delivery of the goods. No person purchasing goods would, if asked whether he would pay for them, answer otherwise, than in the affirmative. This might be proved as readily as the delivery of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>goods; .and the act would be forever evaded. Casual hi' advertent expressions would not fail to be seized on, as assumpsits, on which to found the suits.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aod\">[* See act Nov. 19, 1789, c. 17 \u00a7 1, 13 Stat.

Larg. </em>53,] and repealed by the act of 1779, will aid the Court in the construction of the latter act. The act of 1748 begins\u2018by explaining the cases to which it applies, to wit, \u201call actions founded on <em>emisset, </em>&amp;c.\u201d If, in such a case, the plaintiff could support his action without his book, that act would have no application to it. But, if he could swear that the matter in dispute was a store account, and that he had no means to prove the delivery of the articles therein contained, or any of them, but by his store-book, in that case the book, or a copy of the account, might be given in evidence. Thus was a store account admitted; and this forms the subject of the act of 1779. There were two evils to be removed by that act. The first, the act of 1748, which was to be repealed: The second, extensive credit, which was to be prevented. The first evil was cured by repealing the law: See, then, the means which were used to cure the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The act of 1748 brings the account into Court, as necessary to support the action; and the act of 1779 supposes it there. What are the words ?' \u201c All suits founded on account for goods, wares and merchandize sold and delivered, or for any articles charged in any store account.\u201d What is a suit founded on an account ? Is it a suit on simple contract in opposition to bonds ? Or is the suit properly founded on an account, according to the true-meaning of the act, when the plaintiff cannot support it without producing bis account, which when produced appears to be a store account ? The latter seems to be the just construction: And this construction establishes the distinction between an express and implied promise. In the one case, the account must be produced, and the law-will operate upon it; in the other, the suit is maintainable without the account. The subsequent parts of the law support this exposition. The penalty for post-dating an article, and the clause for rejecting such articles as shall have been delivered more than six months, suppose the-account before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>It is objected that this construction would defeat the law; as merchants would, on all occasions, bring in witnesses to prove assumpsits. If the proof be <em>untrue, </em>eve-l\u2019y ease, as well as this, must be subject to the inconvenienee: If <em>true, </em>where is the mischief? It is said the act will be evaded. But the act relates only to suits upon the account; and not more to actions on a special contract, than to those on a bond, where the germ is a store account. The special verdict shews the case to have been one comprehended in the act of 1779; and the question of law referred to the Court, is, whether, after the action has been barred on the account, it may be maintained on a special promise? The case of a bankrupt is extremely apposite. He is as completely discharged by law, as was the purchaser in this case: But, if though so discharged, ho yet thinks himself under a moral obligation to pay a debt, that moral obligation supports the promise. So in this case, a promise in consideration of the moral obligation, will support the action, it not being necessary to bring the account before the Court. <em>We </em>are therefore of opinion, that it is to be certified, that the law upon the verdict is for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">[* See <em>Brooke\u2019s adm'rs. </em>v. <em>Shelly, 4 </em>H.
