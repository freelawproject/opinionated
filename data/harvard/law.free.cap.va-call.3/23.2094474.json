'The bill states, that <em>James Underwood, </em>the father of the plaintiffs <em>Jinn Starke </em>and <em>Martha Underwood, </em>who live in the City of <em>Richmond, </em>died in 1773, haying first mads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>his will, and thereby devised, as follows: \"I lend to my loving wife <em>Ann, </em>the use, labour, and profits of one third of my slaves, during her natural life; my will and desire is that the dower slaves of my loving wife <em>Ann </em>(meaning the third lent to her as aforesaid) may be equally divided at her decease amongst all my children.\u201d That, the said <em>Ann </em>took possession of a third part of the slaves, which have greatly increased; but, through the severity of her, and her second husband, <em>William Richardson, </em>(of <em>Hanover </em>county,) they are reduced to three: That the said <em>Ann </em>is consumptive, and <em>Richardson </em>in danger of insolvency; and that, conscious thereof, he has frequently endeavored to sell the slaves as his absolute property. In pursuance of which, he empowered <em>Burnett </em>to sell one, by the name of <em>Judy. </em>That <em>Burnett </em>sold her to <em>Chisholm, </em>who lives at a great distance up the country, for 50/. the estimated value of the full property of such a slave. That <em>Richardson </em>has attempted to sell others; and pretends, that the increase of the slaves is his. The bill, therefore, prays, that <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Chisholm </em>may give security for the forthcoming of the slaves, at the death of the said <em>Ann; </em>and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">The answer of <em>Richardson </em>and wife, admits the will, but denies the severity; states, that the defendants thought, until now, that the increase was their\u2019s, as part of the profits of the slaves; but submits the construction of the will to the Court. Admits the sale of <em>Judy; </em>but it was only meant to sell the right of the defendants; and, if more was done through mistake, the plaintiffs cannot complain, as after this discovery, they may recover of <em>Chisholm: </em>Insists, that no security ought to be decreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-9\">The answer of <em>Chisholm </em>states, That, in <em>April, </em>1796, <em>Burnett </em>came into the defendant\u2019s neighborhood, (about 40 miles from <em>Richardson\u2019s,) </em>and sold the slave <em>Judy </em>for 50/. (which is her full value, to the defendant, under a power from <em>Richardson; </em>whom, the defendant then supposed to be the true owner. That afterwards, and before the defendant had the least intimation of the suit, (if it were then commenced,) he sold the said slave to <em>Peebles, </em>for 60/.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-10\">There' are in the record, <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>power of attorney; <em>Burnett\u2019s </em>bill of sale; and a copy of <em>Underwood\u2019s </em>will, which contains the above recited clause exactly, but in a latter part thereof, the testator devises the slaves to be equally divided, at his wife\u2019s death, among all his children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and <em>\u00bfInna Underwood. </em>The cause was heard, by consent, on the bill, answers, and exhibits; but the replication does not appear to have been withdrawn.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\">The, <em>Chancellor </em>decreed, that <em>Richardson </em>should give bond in the penalty of 500/.; conditioned for delivering to the plaintiffs, the slaves in his possession, and their increase, living at the death of the defendant, <em>\u00bfJnn </em>his wife. And that <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Chisholm </em>should give bond, in the penalty of 500/. for delivering <em>Judy and </em>her increase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">From this decree, <em>Chisholm </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-7\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-8\"><em>Peebles </em>ought to have been a party; because his title was drawn into question, and it was in his power to have produced the slave, but <em>Chisholm </em>could not. <em>Chisholm </em>acted innocently, and committed no fault; for he did not know of the plaintiff\u2019s claim at the time of his own purchase, or of the sale, which ho afterwards made to <em>Peebles; </em>and, therefore, he ought not to be put to unreasonable inconvenience. Under the circumstances, he is liable for nothing; but, at most, it can only be for the value at the time of the sale.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-9\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-10\">There was danger that the property might be eloigned; and, therefore, the bill was proper. The notice is not positively denied; and the will was recorded, which was constructive notice. If a man once had possession of another\u2019s property, he is liable to detinue. <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>1 Wash. 308; And, therefore, equity, where detinue cannot be immediately brought, will oblige him to give security for the. forthcoming of the property. The argument on the other side, would lead to an infinity of suits.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-12\">[* See <em>Leeds </em>v. <em>Mari. </em>Ins. <em>Co. </em>2 <em>Wheat. </em>380; <em>Wiser </em>v. <em>Blackley, </em>1 Johns.
