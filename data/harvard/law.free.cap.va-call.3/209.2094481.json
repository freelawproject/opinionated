That, the defendants moved the Court to instruct the jury, that no more land was conveyed to the said <em>John Ball, </em>than the quantity contained within the metes and bounds expressed in the said deed to him from <em>.Robert Brent, </em>executor of <em>Nicholas Brent: </em>and that the Court instructed the jury accordingly.

This was abse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>lutely necessary in the present case; because, there was an eXpress reference, in the deed itself, to the other patents and conveyances; which, therefore, were clearly admissi]3]e. It is not like the case of <em>Gatewood </em>v. <em>Burrus, </em>(ante, 194,) at the last term; because, there was no such reference in that case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-5\">The Court were to decide on the deed itself; and they might instruct the jury upon the effect of it. There is nothing to shew, that this precluded the other testimony, and the presumption is, that he had none to offer, as it is not stated in the bill of exceptions; but, if the party had other testimony, it was inadmissible, as-the deed itself was the only rule: for, there is no difference between this case and that of <em>Gatewood </em>v. <em>Burrus. </em>The Court only declared its opinion on the deed, and there is nothing to shew that the metes and bounds differ from the patent, although the evidence is stated: in which respect, the case is less liable to exception, than that of <em>Gatewood </em>v. <em>Burrus; </em>for, there, the parol evidence was not stated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJ5\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeA\">The reference to the other deeds and patents, introduced the right to the extraneous evidence. The jury may explain the quantity which is included within the boundaries described in the deed, and evidence may be given, in order to enable them to do so. It is said, that there is nothing to shew that we had other evidence; and, therefore, that we had no ground of exception. But, we could not have offered it after the Court\u2019s opinion had been so decidedly given. <em>Gatewood </em>v. <em>Burrus, </em>was a different question, altogether.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b230-9\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"AE3\">delivered the resolution of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">This was an ejectment, in the District Court of <em>Dumfries, </em>for 1320 acres of land, in <em>Fairfax </em>county. Upon the trial, the plaintiffs, in order to prove their title, gave in evidence a patent to <em>George Brent, </em>dated in 1677, for 1143 acres of land on <em>Hunting </em>Greek; the will of <em>George Brent, </em>in 1694, by which he devised that land to his son, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>George Brent, </em>jun. who, by his will in 1700, devised 400 acres of that tract, to be first laid off, to his brother <em>Henry; </em>other 400 acres to his brother <em>Robert; </em>and, to his brother <em>Nicholas Brent, </em>the plantation, the residue of the said land, whereon <em>Robert Williams </em>was tenant, being 343 acres: The will of <em>Nicholas Brent, </em>in 1711, by which ho devises this land, called, by him, 400 acres, to be sold for the payment of his debts: And a deed, in 1715, from <em>Robert Brent, </em>executor of <em>Nicholas, </em>to <em>John- Ball; </em>wherein, after reciting the will of <em>Nicholas, </em>he, in pursuance thereof, conveys to <em>Ball </em>a certain parcel or tract of land, on <em>Hunting </em>Creek, being 343 acres, part of a tract of 1143 acres, patented to <em>George Brent </em>the elder, given by him to <em>George Brent, </em>jun., whose devises, to his three brothers, are literally copied; the said 343 acres being bounded as followeth, and the bounds are inserted. Here the counsel for the defendant interposed, and moved for the direction of the Court to the jury, <em>\u201c </em>that no more land passed <em>to John Ball </em>under the patent, wills and deed, than was comprehended in the metes and bounds mentioned in the deed:\u201d Which direction being given accordingly, a verdict passed for the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019 filed exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, and appeals; and the question now is, whether that opinion was a misdirection? To pursue the proper descriptions of our land boundaries, would render men\u2019s titles very precarious, not only from the variations of the compass, but that old surveys were often inaccurate; and mistakes often made, in copying their descriptions into the palents; leaving out lines, and putting north for south, and east for west; and in copying those descriptions into subsequent conveyances: Whereas, the marked trees upon the land remain invariable, according to which neighbours hold their distinct, lands. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On this ground, our juries have uniformly, and wisely, never suffered such lines, when proved, to be departed from, because they do not agree exactly with descriptions in conveyances. However, when a question arises, what passes by a written instrument, it is proper for the Court to decide that question;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and we proceed to consider, whether the opinion given by the District Court upon this deed, was legal and proper? And we think not; for, that by the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>will of <em>George Brent, </em>jun. his brother <em>Nicholas </em>wa;, euti. a[[ ^he <em>Hunting </em>Creek tract, besides the. 800 do-vised t.o <em>Henry </em>and <em>Robert, </em>whatever was the quantity, |jie wordSj residue of the tract, controling the supposition of the quantity; that the will of <em>Nicholas </em>authorised the sale of his whole right, and that the deed to <em>Ball </em>was intended to be, and was a conveyance of the whole; being of the parcel or tract supposed to be 343 acres; from the recital of the patent and wills, and the same terms used essentially, as are in the devise by <em>George Brent </em>to his brother <em>Nicholas. </em>We are, therefore, of opinion, that it was a misdiroetion in the Court, and that the plaintiffs ought to have been permitted to proceed, and shew, if they could, that they had the same title as <em>Ball </em>had. The judgment is, therefore, to bo reversed with costs, and a new trial ordered, on which the plaintiffs are to be permitted to shew, if they can, that they have the same title that <em>Ball </em>had .</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><em>[* Shaw </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>1 Call, 438; <em>Preston's heirs </em>v. <em>Bowmar, </em>6 Wheat. 582; <em>Newsom </em>v. <em>Pryor, 7 </em>Wheat. 10.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">[\u2020 See Ante, 1 vol.
