This argument is the stronger, on account of the note\u2019s being made negotiable at the Bank of <em>Alexandria; </em>which made the assignors liable like the endorsers of an inland bill.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-4\"><em>Botts, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">The defendants were not entitled to the discount, without having, previously, sued the maker, <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Love &amp; Co. </em>in this Court. 1 Call, 497.
