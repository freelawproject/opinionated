Plea, <em>non assumpsit, </em>and issue. Upon trial of the cause, the defendant filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, whereby it appeared, that <em>Martin, </em>a mariner, entered on board the ship <em>Polly Nancy, </em>on a voyage from <em>Alexandria, </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>to <em>Rotterdam, </em>and from <em>Rotterdam </em>to <em>St. Ubes, </em>and from <em>St. Ubes, </em>back again to <em>Alexandria. </em>That the vessel went to <em>Rotterdam, </em>where she discharged her cargo, took in ballast, and went to <em>St. Ubes, </em>where she took on board a cargo of salt, fruit and wine, for <em>Alexandria; </em>but, on her passage, was captured by a <em>French </em>privateer, re-captured by an <em>English </em>ship of war, and carried into Cape <em>Nicholas Mole, </em>where, after, laying three months, she was cleared, on paying salvage, and afterwards arrived at <em>Alexandria. </em>That the plaintiff left the ship on her being captured by the <em>French </em>privateer. That the defen\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>dants prayed the opinion of the Court whether the evidenee was sufficient to charge the defendants with the plaintiff\u2019s wages from <em>Rotterdam </em>to the time of the capture by the <em>French </em>privateer; and, that the Court gave it as their opinion, that the evidence was sufficient to charge the defendants with the wages aforesaid. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendants appealed to the District Court, where the judgment was affirmed; and thereupon the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">The vessel was captured before the voyage was ended, and the plaintiff left her without the assent of the owners, or having been forced to do so by the captors. Of course, he was not entitled to his wages; for, they are never allowed, unless the voyage is finished, or prevented by the act of the owners themselves, or the government. 4 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 617, <em>Gwil. </em>ed. Thus, in the case of the vessel being seized for debt, or forfeited by some violation of the law, it is the act of the owner that interrupts the voyage; and, in the case of an impressment, in T. R. [<em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Ingleton, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 1211,] it is the act of the government. But, where there is no act of the owner or interference of the government, the mariner must serve out the voyage, or he loses his wages. Again, the Court erred in instructing the jury, that the plaintiff could recover wages to the time of the capture; for, they could not, consistently with the decisions of this Court, instruct the jury upon the evidence; but ought to have left the cause to their determination, without any opinion from the Court. <em>Keele, </em>&amp;c. v. <em>Herbert, </em>1 Wash. 138.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vu 'lt.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-7\">\n<em>PER.
