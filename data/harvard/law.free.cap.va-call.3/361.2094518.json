In 1770, surveyed and took a patent for a tract of 160 acres of land, the lines of which were all surveyed, except two, which were the lines of A. If. under a former patent, and which formed a small angle, containing 26 acres. These two lines, in the survey and patent of G., were thus described:\u2014 \"Thence along <em>Andrew Henry's </em>line 188 poles, to the beginning.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b381-9\">This survey and patent are good; and entitled G. to a pre-emption in the 26 acres.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-10\"><em>John Stever </em>entered a <em>caveat </em>against a patent for 184 acres of land, on <em>Looning\u2019s </em>creek, in <em>Botetourt </em>county, surveyed for <em>Gillis, </em>the 16th of <em>May, </em>1797.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">The jury find, that the caveator made an entry of <em>26 </em>acres in <em>September, </em>1794 ; and obtained a patent for it in 1796: That, <em>Gillis\u2019s </em>original survey of 160 acres, (whereon his patent issued,) was made the 16th <em>May, </em>1770: That one of the lines was not run by the Surveyor; and that one of the angles is not laid down in the plat: That the <em>26 </em>acres are within the bounds of <em>Gillis\u2019s </em>said patent for 160 acres, dated <em>June </em>20th, 1772, provided the expression in the patent will warrant <em>Gillis </em>in passing <em>Henry\u2019s </em>line: <em>That. Gillis made an entry for </em>50 <em>acres, June 14th, </em>1789, <em>(which covers the said </em>26 <em>acres claimed by Stever;) </em>and, in pursuance of an order of <em>Botetourt </em>Court, re-surveyed his lands, including therein his old patent of 160 aeres, and 26 acres, part of an entry for 50 acres; which 26 acres he claimed as surplus lands, within the hounds of his old patent. <em>But they do not find that Gillis entered for </em>50 <em>acres, June 14th, </em>1789, <em>as above mentioned.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-12\"><em>The District </em>Court gave judgment in favor of <em>Gillis, </em>and <em>Stever </em>appealed <em>to </em>this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-13\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-14\">The last line in <em>Gillis\u2019s </em>patent was a straight one; and, therefore, did not comprehend the land in controversy: for, the length of the two lines upon <em>Henry\u2019s </em>tract is greater than a straight line; besides, the courses are different. A general reference to <em>Henry\u2019s </em>lines was uncertain; and, therefore, objectionable, upon a supposition that a straight line was to be run: but it is clear that <em>Gillis </em>meant a straight line at the time of his survey, because it answered his purpose better.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-8\"><em>Gillis\u2019s </em>patent was founded on an actual survey, except as to the last line, which is only referred to. But that was enough; because, it-had been surveyed before, when <em>Henry\u2019s </em>survey was made: So, that the course was completely ascertained, and might be known by recurrence to the Surveyor\u2019s books. It was, therefore, unnecessary to run it, as a general reference was sufficient. Supposing, then, that the reference had been to <em>Henry\u2019s </em>lines, there could have been no difficulty; for, it would be evident, that both were comprehended: but, the omission of a single letter at the end of the word, will never be held sufficient to defeat the justice of the case. On the contrary, the Court will supply the omission; especially, as it is obvious that the word ought to have been <em>lines, </em>or the figure never could have beeu completed; because, one line only would not have proceeded along <em>Henry\u2019s </em>line, but would have led another course altogether: Nor is there any reason to suppose that <em>Gillis </em>meant a straight line. Indeed, a contrary intention is obvious: for, it is clear, from the whole view of the figure, that he meant to comprehend all the vacant land in those parts up to <em>Henry\u2019s </em>lines, which he intended to make his boundaries: An intention, which there was nothing to impede; for, at that time, no previous warrant from government was necessary, as there is now; but the party made his entry and survey without; and, upon exhibiting them at the public office, claimed the patent, on payment of the composition. Of course, there is no reason to conclude, that he was obstructed in his views from the want of money, or a larger warrant; because he might have taken leisure to procure the necessary sums. The reference to <em>Henry\u2019s </em>lines was not uncertain; for, they might have been ascertained by record: and that is certain, which may be rendered so. The only objection, therefore, seems to resolve itself into the length of the line; for, the two lines, united, are about 143 yards longer than the straight line. But that circumstance will make no difference; 1. Because the whole of those two lines was to be gone over; for, the patent says they are to go along <em>Henry\u2019s </em>line to the <em>beginning: </em>So, that they must get to the beginning; and, therefore, the mistake is only a mistake of calculation, or of measure; neither of which ought to vitiate. 2. Because the locator was not privy to it, but depended on the public officer, whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>iaw obliged him to employ; and, therefore, it would be unreasonable, if he was to be affected by the officer\u2019s acts, as he had no choice. 3. Because the act of Assembly de- , dares such acts shall not prejudice; for, it expressly saves the right of pre-emption, where a mistake has been committed, either through the <em>ignorance, mistake, </em>or <em>fraud </em>of the Surveyor. <em>R. C. </em>156, \u00a7 46. But, one of these it must have been; and which ever it was, the act provides for it. Under this act, the plaintiff ought to have given notice to the defendant of the surplus, and should have obtained a warrant to survey, from the Register; which he was bound to have waited a year for, in order to have given the defendant an opportunity of asserting his rights of preemption; but nothing of all this appears. On the contrary, the plaintiff has hurried on, without the least regard to the law. Nor is this all; for, by the act, the defendant had a right to have assigned the surplus in any part of the tract: whereas, the plaintiff arbitrarily claims a particular spot. Again, the defendant had a right to re-survey; and, for that purpose, obtained an order from the County Court, which he carried into effect, and returned the plat to the Register\u2019s office, but was improperly arrested in his progress to a patent. In this respect, too, the provisions of the law were violated by the plaintiff; and, therefore, upon that ground, also, the law is for the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\">The question arises on the last line, which ought to have been a straight, and not a crooked line. It was not run; and that proves that a straight line was meant at the time: for, the usual course is to omit to run the last line, which can be done as well by platting, as by actual survey. So, that the inference is inevitable, that a straight line only was intended: A straight line leads, as necessarily, to the beginning, as the course along the other two: So, that there is no objection upon the supposed ground that the figure would not have been closed, according to that idea. There was no mistake of the Surveyor, in the manner contended for on the other side: but, the presumption is, that the survey was made in pursuance of the directions of <em>Gillis, </em>who acquiesced therein; and, therefore, adopted the act. <em>Gillis </em>could not take more than his patent lines covered: the rest was necessarily vacant land, and not affected by the patent. The act of Assembly, cited for the ap= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>pellant, makes no difference; because, this land was not comprehended within the boundaries of <em>Gill is\u2019s </em>patent; and, therefore, the doctrine concerning pre-emption does <em>not </em>apply. <em>The Surveyor did </em>not, necessarily, know the courses of <em>Henry\u2019s </em>lines; and, therefore, he could not mean to rely on them. He thought <em>Henry\u2019s </em>line a straight one; and, therefore, did not run it, but protracted the straight line as <em>Henry\u2019s; </em>which answers the objection that the patent calls for <em>Henry\u2019s </em>line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aeih\">\n<em>Cur. adv. mill.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b384-7\">LYONS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Afs\">delivered the resolution of the Court. That there was no error in the judgment of the District Court, and, therefore, that it was to be affirmed: He added, that <em>speaking for himself only,he </em>saw no foundation for the appeal. That a single letter at the end of a word was omitted in the survey and patent, which ought not to affect the case; because it could make no difference, in substance, whether <em>line </em>or <em>lines </em>was used; for, still the same course was intended, and necessarily to be pursued, in order to complete the figure. Consequently, that he concurred with the rest of the Court, that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
