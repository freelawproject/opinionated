That the grantees entered, and were seised until <em>Oct. </em>15, 1792; when <em>Edward </em>died, leaving the plaintiff <em>Moran, his heir </em>at law\u2019; and <em>Blair </em>continued in possession of the premises, until the 16th of the month; when no rent having ever been paid, and no effects to distrain found upon the premises, <em>Prather </em>entered thereon, and demanded the rent, and for failure in .the payment thereof, and for want of goods whereof distress could be made, he made an actual entry on the premises, and continued possessed until the 1st of <em>June, </em>1795; when he conveyed to <em>Robins, </em>who entered, and was possessed, until <em>July </em>6, 1795, when he conveyed to <em>Wartenby, </em>the defendant; who entered and was possessed until the lease, entry and ouster, in th\u00e9 declaration mentioned. That upon <em>the </em>11th of <em>December, </em>1796, the plaintiff <em>Moran </em>conveyed, in fee, to the plaintiff <em>Richard Wells. </em>That <em>Prather </em>obtained a patent for 451 acres, (of which the lot in the declaration mentioned is part;) and on the 10th of <em>March, </em>1798, the said <em>Richard Wells </em>entered on the premises, and made a lease for ten years to <em>Tibbs, </em>who entered on the 11th of that month, and was possessed until the 18th, when he was ejected by the defendant. The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs; and, thereupon, the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-4\"><em>Prather's </em>title is not found; but, it is stated in the verdict, that he obtained a patent from the Commonwealth. The suit is brought by two persons claiming different rights; which cannot be supported. The entry of <em>Prather </em>for non-payment, renders all title under <em>Moran </em>void. The distinction, in the <em>English </em>books, is grounded on the non-payment, of the rent absolutely: but here he may enter, first, to distrain; secondly, to hold, if he cannot find property to distrain: and, as it is found that there is no property to distrain, the title under <em>Moran </em>is necessarily void. Although it be generally true, that where both parties claim under the same person, neither shall attempt to impeach his title; yet, that cannot be insisted on now, as the point is not left open, after the verdict. <em>Wells </em>never was in possession, <em>and Moran </em>was disseised: of course, it is not like the ease of <em>Duval v. Bibb, </em>ante, 362, where there was a constructive possession. The verdict does not find <em>the lease, </em>entry, and ouster as to both, but as to <em>Wells </em>only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-5\"><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\"><em>Wells </em>is entirely out of the question, and his claim does not affect the case. <em>Moran </em>is the person, who claims title In the land; and the jury have found that the deed of bargain and sale was in fee; of course, the condition in the deed avails nothing, as the jury have taken the law of the case upon themselves. The estate was turned into a tenancy in common, and descended according to the act of Assembly. <em>The entry is not </em>found to have been for the purpose of making distress: for, it is only that he entered to demand the rent; and it was all done <em>uno Jlatu. </em>No previous notice was given; and, therefore, the grantee had no right to enter for the breach, at that time. Both parties claim from <em>Prather, </em>and, consequently, neither ought to be allowed to impeach his title. The result is, that judgment ought to be entered in favor of <em>Moran.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-7\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-8\"><em>Moran </em>was out of possession; and, therefore, the deed from him to <em>Wells </em>is void. The declaration is upon two different titles, which cannot be maintained. The finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of the jury is confined to <em>Wells, </em>and does not extend to <em>Moran; </em>for, the verdict is taken upon the second count, which relates only to <em>Wells\u2019s </em>lease. The finding that <em>Moran </em>took a fee, makes no difference; for still, the whole deed is found, and the Court are to decide upon the deed itself. But, the finding is true; for, <em>Prather </em>did <em>convey </em>a fee; but it was a fee upon condition, only. There was. no occasion for any previous notice of the entry for distress. It is never done, and there is nothing in the law which makes it necessary. The objection, that both claim from <em>Prather, </em>ought to have been insisted on before the jury; and is unimpoi\u2019tant now. '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-4\">\n<em>Warden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEC\">The entry was for the purpose of re-possessing himself of the estate; and, therefore, notice was necessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b446-5\">FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AZm3\">There is certainly nothing in the argument of the appellee\u2019s counsel, that the jury have found that the conveyance, from <em>Prather </em>to <em>Moran, </em>was without any condition; because the deed is found <em>in hsec verba, </em>and contains the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">The question then is, whether the re-entry was lawful ? The verdict expressly finds, that no rent had ever been paid; that <em>Prather </em>made a demand; and that, there being no property on the' land whereof distress could be made, he entered for the non-payment; which brings it exactly within the terms of the condition; and, therefore, the grantor had clearly aright to re-enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">There is.no ground for the objection, that notice ought to have been given that a re-entry would be made; because, the law requires no such notice to be given; for, upon the demand of the rent, and no property found to distrainj the right of re-entry attached. 6 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 29, <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.;] 2 <em>Roll. </em>Abr. 427; 7 <em>Co. </em>29; <em>Litt. </em>\u00a7 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">As both parties claim under the same title, unless the plaintiff shews a better right, there is no ground to impeach the'possession of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">And, upon the whole, I am of opinion that <em>Prather </em>had a right to re-enter and possess himself of his former estate, and that his deed to <em>Robins </em>was valid: of course, <em>Wartenby, </em>who claims under him, and is now in possession, has the better title; and, therefore, the judgment of the District Court ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ARo0\">The verdict finds that the rent was not paid; that it was demanded, and that, there was no goods upon the premises, whereot itistress could he made: Of course, by the express terms of the condition, the bargainor had a right to re-enter. There is nothing iu the objection that no title in <em>Prather </em>is found; for, as both parties claim under him, the one in possession ought not to be disturbed, unless the other can shew a better right. 1 am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment of <em>the </em>District Court ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b447-6\">EYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AzF\">The demand of the rent, with the non-payment, and want of property on the premises, whereof distress could be made, are expressly found by the jury: Of course, the right, of entry accrued by the express terms of the deed; and, therefore, the judgment of (he District Court ought to be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
