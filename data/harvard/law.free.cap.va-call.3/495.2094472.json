He was removed by the statute of the 4th of <em>December, </em>1779, and, in <em>October, </em>1787, a rule was made in the General Court, on the Governors or Visitors of the College, to show cause on the third Saturday of the following term, why a writ of <em>mandamus </em>should not be awarded, to cause them to restore Mr. <em>Bracken </em>to his place and office of grammar master, and professor of humanity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-11\">Counsel having been heard, the case was adjourned, on account of difficulty, to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-12\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the College.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afc9\">Contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-13\">1st.

If 1lie Court could take jurisdiction, still a <em>mandamus </em>ought not to be granted, because the Visitors or Governors had not exceeded the powers given them by the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-15\">The Court have no jurisdiction of the subject in the form the case now wears, because this is a mere Eleemosynary institution, with Visitors appointed for its government and direction. <em>[Philips </em>v. <em>Bury,] </em>1 Ld. Raym. 8, [Skinner, 447,] Comb. 143; [<em>The King </em>v. The Bishop <em>of Ely,] </em>3 <em>Wm. Black. </em>Rep. 82; <em>Sir T.

(Mr. <em>Marshall </em>was here stopped, and the position that a <em>mandamus </em>will not lie in the case of a private Eleemosynary institution, where Visitors were appointed, was admitted to be law.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFM\">This is an Eleemosynary institution. It comes completely within the description of Chief Justice Holt, in the case of <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Bury, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 8. It is founded on charity. That the donations proceeded from the King and from the government, is perfectly immaterial, as Visitors are appointed. Colleges are considered as mere Eleemosynary institutions, as entirely as hospitals. <em>Comb. 268.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-5\">But, if the Court have jurisdiction, it ought not to issue a <em>mandamus, </em>because the Visitors have not exceeded the powers given them in the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alkt\">The charter establishes one president and six masters or professors for divinity, philosophy, languages and other good arts. It is not necessary, under the charter, that a grammar master should form a part of the system. The professor of modern languages satisfies its requisitions. The Visitors or Governors have power to make such laws for the government of the College, from time to time, <em>according to their various occasion and circumstances, </em>as to them should seem most fit and expedient. The restraining clause annexed, serves to shew the extent of the grant: \u00a3\u00a3 Provided that the said laws, &amp;c. be no way contrary to our prerogative royal, <em>See.\u201d </em>Their power of legislation, then, extended to the modification of the schools, in any manner they should deem proper, provided they did not depart from the great outlines marked in the charter; which are divinity, philosophy, and the languages. It was proper, that this discretion should be given to the Visitors, because a particular branch of science, which at one period of time would be deemed all important, might at another, be thought not worth acquiring. In institutions, therefore, which are to be durable, only great leading and general principles, ought to be immutable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-7\">If, then, the Visitors have only legislated on a subject upon which they had a right to legislate, it is not for this Court to enquire, whether they have legislated wisely, or not, and if the change should even be considered as not being for the better, still it is a change; still the grammar school is lawfully put down; and there can be no <em>mandamus </em>to restore a man to an office, which no longer exists. One of the statutes, enacted by the trustees themselves, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>authorises the Visitors to change even those very statutes, one of which creates the grammar school.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-5\"><em>John </em>Taylor, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">The merits of the case arise out of the charter of <em>William &amp; Mary College; </em>and I shall endeavor <em>to prove, </em>1st. That the College is a corporation for purposes of further government. 2d. That the visitorial \u00a1lower is defined and limited by, and subordinate to, the charter, transfer, and original statutes. 3d. That this visitorial act exceeded their power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\">1. The charier is the magnet, from whence every part of this business must take its direction. It is the constitution of the College, and, like all other constitutions, ought to be preserved inviolate. In this instance it must be preserved inviolate for the benefit of all parties, because its destruction will take from both sides the subject of controversy. A nation may violate its constitution, and erect another; but a subordinate body politic can do no such thing. These have particular members possessed of rights, in the enjoyment of which every member is protected, in every kind of government. What such rights are, in this case, is to be learnt from the charter. This charter is addressed to <em>Francis Nicholson </em>and seventeen other persons. It states its intention to be, \u201cto make, found and establish, a certain place of universal study, or perpetual College of <em>divinity, </em>philosophy, and other arts and sciences, consisting of a president, six <em>masters </em>or professors, &amp;c.\u201d When we go into the charter, we shall find it drawn with peculiar care, and worded with the most exact precision; we shall find, that it fixes some things unalterably; that it delegates the fixing of other things, to the said <em>Nicholson </em>and others, or the <em>survivor, </em>excluding successors: And that it delegates a power of forming regulations from time to time, as to things not absolutely determined, to the said <em>Nicholson </em>and others, and their <em>successors.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-12\">2. From these materials, I am to prove that the visitorial power is defined and limited by, and subordinate to, the charter, transfer, and original statutes: And it must be so, if there is any thing fundamental in the College constitution. This charter erected three branches of government, for the body politic and corporate, to which it gave, existence, whose rights were separate and distinct, and in most instances independent of each other; 1st. The trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tees. 2d. The Visitors and Governors. 3d. The pres\u00eddent and masters. These three estates are, in fact, created by the same instrument; for, although the masters were not nominated in it, yet the trustees could have been compelled in Chancery, by a process in the name of the Attorney General, to have proceeded to a nomination. In this, as in all other things relating to their trust, they had a bare and naked power, which they were obliged to pursue strictly, and so soon as they had executed it, the masters were erected into a body politic and corporate, and derived their rights .from the charter itself, and not from the trustees: The charter then creates three collateral branches; and to suppose that one creature of a political regulation, has a Tight to destroy another creature of the same political regulation, is a doctrine diametrically opposite to the fundamental maxims of our present and former government. A house of commons or a house of delegates, may impeach a member of their own, or other orders, as a master might be tried and deprived before <em>the </em>order of Visitors, but the order of Visitors are no more entitled to annihilate the order of masters, because they can try a member of that order, by virtue of their special visitorial powers, than the house of lords could abolish the house of commons, because they can try a member of that order, in virtue of the powers annexed to their own order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-4\">The Visitors, as to the nomination of the masters, so as to keep up the succession of that body politic and corporate, were also trustees, and might have been compelled, either by mandamus, or in Chancery, to proceed to such nominations. Otherwise, it would be in their power to destroy this incorporated society at any time, although all the powers entrusted to them, were intended to support it. Whence do the Visitors derive any authority to act at all in that character ? From the charter. If, therefore, their acts are not warranted by that charter, they are void; because they can derive their obligation from no other source. This observation is conclusive: As the Visitors could not create, neither could they annihilat\u00e9. In the creation, the Crown used the medium of trustees. It was necessary that the work of the trustees should be completed, before the visitors could act at all. The very term <em>visitors </em>implies so much: Something was to be visited. This.something was the College establishment, as fixed by the charter and the trustees. It was to be visited, for the purpose of supporting it, according to the laws of the founder, not for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the purpose of subverting those laws. I am, therefore, clear, that the visitorial authority, deriving its existence from, is limited by, and subordinate to, the charter, trans-for, and original statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-4\">3. The next question is, whether ihe visitorial act of 1779, exceeds their powers as limited by the charter?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\">Every word of this instrument proves, that it was intended to be, as, if valid, it would be, an utter and entire abolition and abrogation of the College constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-6\">The preamble gives the reasons for granting this new charter; one of which, \u201cthat the rarer parts of science are more immediately subordinate to the leading objects of society,\u201d the original founders of the College seem not to have had in contemplation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">This new instrument does, either expressly or virtually, repeal the old charter, or constitution of the College, in a variety of instances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\">1. The old charter has the support of religion for an object. The modern one deserts it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-9\"><em>2. </em>The old constitution appoints a professor of religion. The modern one exchanges it for the \u201crarer parts of science as more immediately subordinate to the leading objects of society.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-11\">3. The old charter established a grammar school to teach the ancient languages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-12\">The modern one barters these for the modern languages and the fine arts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-13\">4. Under the old charter, the masters held large estates, a right of representation in the Legislature, fixed salaries, and were a body corporate: nor could any individual lose these rights, except by \u201cdeath, resignation, or deprivation. \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-14\"><em>By the </em>new, <em>he </em>holds them at the will and pleasure of the Visitors, and may be dismissed without any reason whatsoever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-15\">5. By the old charter, the College, as then established or erected, was to subsist forever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-16\">By the new one, its existence is determined; and if, in the revolution of things, the Visitors should incline to erect it into a Turkish mosque, here is a precedent for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-17\">6. By the old constitution, the trustees only had power to erect schools, or appoint professorships.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-18\">Under the new one, the Visitors <em>assume </em>this power, and exercise it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-19\">Tiie trustees, under the old charter, convey to professors of theology and the master of the grammar school. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>who then, under the <em>charter, </em>are to hold to them and their successors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajlo\">The new regulation breaks this succession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjS\">The College estates were vested in certain professors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">Where are they now ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">This act, then, of the Visitors in 1779, being subversive of the charter, is a nullity; and, of course, cannot deprive the plaintiff of his rights under the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMo\">The Visitors have undertaken to do, what the original trustees could not effect. They had the power of nominating the first masters, as the Visitors have the power of nominating to vacancies. The term nomination, which is used, proves that this was a trust; when nominated, the master became a member of the body corporate, not in virtue \u00b0f the nomination, but under the charter. He held his freehold not from the Visitors, but under the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABgj\">When a nomination was made, either by the trustees or Visitors, they could not rescind this nomination; because, having executed a power, the object of that power was completely effected. The trustees had also a power of receiving donations, and conveying them to the masters. They executed this power, and made the conveyance. Could they have rescinded it, and revoked the execution of this power ? And, if the execution of one power is irrevocable, what differs the execution of another power from it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJi\">I have said, that the master, once nominated, is in under the charter; and the nature of his office shews that he is in an estate for life, 1. Because his office has somewhat the complexion of a judicial one. 2. Because he elects a representative to the <em>General Assembly. </em>3. Because he is a member of a corporation, which is to be perpetual. 4. Because this corporation is to be kept up by succession, and the succession is not to take place, except in case of death, resignation, or deprivation. 5. Because deprivation is a technical term: In all law glossaries it is explained to be, the result of some delinquency, or good cause, after previous summons and trial; without which, deprivation cannot take place. Thus, not only from the nature of (he office, but from the express words of the charter, it is an office during good behavior. 6. Because he is seised, jointly with the other masters, of extensive freehold estates, which are estates for life. 7. Because the masters are, as a corporation, invested with the office of surveyor general, which is an office held for life : Nor are the Visi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tors at liberty to garble the joint possession of that iinportant office, or change the members, without any cause, or any delinquency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-4\">The very right of voting, shews that it is an office for life; not to be lost, except by the party\u2019s own act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1Qe\">The Visitors seem wholly to have mistaken their office. They seem to have considered themselves as the incorporated society; and the president and masters as an appendage depending upon them: Whereas, the president and masters form the body politic, for the government of which, not for its annihilation, the Visitors aro to form rules.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-7\">If it were otherwise, the body politic, consisting of the president and masters, were under a government as completely tyrannical, as human cunning could have formed; in which, not even a sham trial, not even a detestable <em>quo warranto, </em>was necessary to rob the whole body of its rights and privileges. The <em>fiat </em>of the Visitors \u2014 \u201c Let the grammar school be discontinued : Let all the schools be discontinued: Let the grammar masfer be dismissed; Let all the masters be dismissed: Let there be light and there was light:\u201d The <em>fiat </em>of the Visitors, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, was to deprive the whole body politic, not only of their political existence, but, perhaps, of their natural existence, by reducing them to a state o\u00ed' beggary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-9\">.But, the president and masters were a lay corporation, having lights, privileges and emoluments, of which they could not be deprived; at least, without some form of trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-10\">There is one argument to show the nature of the powers possessed <em>by </em>the Visitors, which is very clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-11\"><em>By the </em>constitution of the College, the Visitors were to make statutes for the <em>government </em>of the College; not for its erection or abolition: But these statutes were to be observed under <em>certain penalties. </em>Statutes to be enforced <em>try penalties, </em>were the species of rules, which alone, the Visitors are empowered to enact. Now, fundamental constitutional laws, are never enforced by penalties; the subordinate rules for good order and government, often are.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-12\">The constitution of <em>Virginia </em>has said, \u201cLet there be three branches of government, legislative, executive and judiciary.\u201d But this rule is not enforced by penalty, because it is fundamental; and, therefore, a penalty cannot be inflicted for its breach, as having no individual to operate upon. The subordinate rules for good government, call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>in the aid of penalties. Treason shall be punished by death, and misbehavior before this Court by fine. In like .manner, the constitution of the College has said, \u201clet there be a grammar school; let there be Visitors; and let there be a professor of religion. <em>\u201d </em>These rules being also fundamental, are not enforced by penalties; but the Visitors might have enacted, that a grammar master should <em>not </em>be guilty of inebriation, under the penalty of 51.; or that the professor of religion, should not be guilty of profaneness, under the penalty of five shillings; and this would have been within their province.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-8\">Now the rules of December, 1779, are fundamental in their nature, being laws of annihilation or of establishment. These are, therefore, not enforced by penalties; and being fundamental, and not needing penalties, are not such as the constitution of the College enables the Visitors to enact. In answer to this, it may be argued, that the Visitors are empowered by the original statutes, to make statutes of the same kind, because they could alter them without the consent of the Chancellor, an essential not attended to in the act of December, 1779, and that these statutes are not enforced by penalties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">Although fundamental laws are never enforced by penalties, it does not follow, that all subordinate rules should be. The rules of descents and distribution, are subordinate rules, yet they are not enforced by penalties. These original statutes are not fundamental: They are subordinate. The schools and professorships, were fundamental; and had been previously established. These statutes are rules of government, not of establishment. \u2014 Instance, the grammar school. Mr. <em>Camm </em>was restored in <em>England; </em>which proves that the Visitors may exceed their powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-10\">As to the merits, I will conclude with this observation. That the Visitors can only nominate to professorships, in case of vacancy; and that this vacancy must be by death, resignation, or deprivation. Now, Mr. <em>Bracken </em>is neither dead; nor has he resigned; nor has he been deprived: For, th\u00e9 last term involves a personal summons or trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-11\">If it did not, if this was not the meaning of the term deprivation, yet this proceeding has only said, that the grammar school shall be discontinued. Now, a deprivation, by implication, of an office for life, a freehold, and a considerable salary, would be a phenomenon in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-12\">For these reasons, I conclude that this visitorial act of 1779, so far from being warranted by, is subversive of the College charter, and that it exceeds any visitorial power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The act of 1779, therefore, being void, nothing exists to deprive Mr. <em>Bracken </em>of his salary or his office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-4\">The act is void for other reasons. There was not a sufficient. number of members to form a convocation. Upon every principle of natural justice, Mr. <em>Bracken </em>ought to have had notice that he might have defended himself. They have deprived him of his office without hearing him. This alone would invalidate the act, <em>[The King </em>v. <em>The University of Cambridge,</em>] Stra. 557. It ought to appeal, that every member of the College senate was summoned, <em>[Kynaston </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of Shrewsbury,] 2 </em>Stra. 1051. <em>But, </em>it is contended, that, however improper the conduct of the Visitors may have boca, a <em>mandamus </em>cannot, be resorted to, because this is a mere private Eleemosynary institution, by no means concerning the public, and Visitors are appointed for its government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\">If this be such an institution as those, concerning which the cases have been cited, the law would be admitted, but it is not such an institution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">In this, the public <em>is </em>very materially concerned. Large landed estates are vested in the professors, who have a freehold interest in those estates. It would lie strange indeed, if they could be deprived of them by the mere will of the V isitors, and could have no relief in this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-7\">The acts of Assembfy, which give a revenue to the College arising from certain duties, convert it into an object of public concern.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-8\">It is, in many respects in its origin, a corporation for public government, and whose proceedings must therefore be subject to the control of this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-9\">It has a right to a member of Assembly. This is a political privilege which concerns the nation at large, and partakes nothing of the qualities of a private charity. The masters have a right to vote for this member. Can they be deprived of that vote, and yet this Court have no superintendance over the subject ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-10\">They have the office of the surveyor general; and, having that, office, appoint all the surveyors to the different counties throughout <em>Virginia. </em>This is an office which nearly concerns the public, and gives to the College completely a public character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-11\">In the cases too, which have been cited, there were Visitors with general powers: here the powers of the Visitors are limited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aku\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Marshall, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqb\">It was shewn, in opening the cause, that this Court can have no jurisdiction in a ease of a private Eleemosynary institution, where Visitors, with general powers, are appointed. The authorities in support of this position, were too numerous to be opposed. But the counsel for Mr. <em>Bracken, </em>insists:</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-8\">1st. That this is a public, not a private institution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-9\">2dly. That the Visitors have limited powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-10\">3dly. That, in putting down the grammar school, they have exceeded those powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-11\">I shall answer these in their order. And,</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-12\">1. This is a private, not a public institution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1Y\">In the case of <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Bury, </em>reported by <em>Lord Raymond, </em>and <em>Comberbach, </em>Lord Holt says, <em>\u201c </em>There are two sorts of corporations aggregate: 1st. For public government. 2d. For private charity. That for public government, as Mayor, citizens, &amp;c., is subject to the common law; <em>of such there is neither founder or Visitor, nor </em>patronIn the case before the Court, there is a founder and there are Visitors. It bears no resemblance to a corporation of a Mayor and citizens, which is the case of a public corporation j)ut by Lord Holt. According both to the affirmative and negative parts-of the description, this is a private, and not a public institution. The persons who compose it have no original property of their own, but it belongs to the corporation. Its funds are mere charitable donations. It is, then, completely Eleemosynary. In many of the cases, Colleges and hospitals are classed together as private Eleemosynary corporations, subject to the will of the founder. There would seem to be no principle on which this College should be placed in a different class of corporations from all other Colleges. I will examine the points of difference made by the counsel for Mr. <em>Bracken. </em>It has been urged, that the professors have estates as professors, of which, upon general and correct principles of law, they ought not to be deprived, without a right to resort to this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-14\">But, these estates are the gift of the founder. They are his voluntary gift. To this gift he may annex such conditions as his own will or caprice may dictate. Every individual, to whom it is offered, may accept or reject it; but, if he accepts, he accepts it subject to the conditions annexed by the donor. He must take the gift <em>cum onere. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The condition annexed in private corporations is, that the will of the Visitor is decisive; and, as Lord Holt says, <em>\u201c </em>if the founder directs no appeal, no appeal lyeth.\u201d That the masters have estates, as masters, cannot convert this into a public corporation; for, all masters must have salaries as masters; in all charitable institutions something is given, which the professors, if there be any, receive as professors; and, if this was the criterion of a public institution, there could be none private in their nature. But, that this is not the criterion, I again refer to the cases which have been cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-7\">But, the acts of Assembly giving certain duties to the College are relied on, as giving the government a right, by its Courts, to supervise the disposition of those revenues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-8\">The College was founded by <em>William </em>&amp; <em>Mary. </em>Since its foundation, the bounty of <em>Virginia </em>has been added to that, of the original founders. It is an established principle, that all annexed foundations follow, and are governed by the rules of the old foundation to which they are annexed. <em>[The King v. The Bishop of Ely,] </em>1 Wm. Black. Rep. 77, 87. The gift of any individual, then, to a chartered corporation, is subject to the laws which control the original donation. Thai this gift was made by the public, does not alter the case; because, it is decided, that Colleges of Royal foundation are not different from those of private foundation. Where the King has appointed Visitors, their power is precisely the same as where a private founder has appointed them. Of consequence, a donation to an old foundation, though made by the public, is as subject to the fundamental law of the corporation, as the donation of an individual would be. But, the charter, it is said, gives to the corporation a representative in the <em>General .Assembly, </em>and the office of surveyor general: Which aro subjects of public concern, and would justify the interference of the Courts of Law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-11\">It is true, that these are subjects of public concern; hut, it does not follow, that they totally change the character of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-12\">Their power to elect a member was taken from them by the present Constitution of <em>Virginia, </em>which was before the abolition of the grammar school.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-13\">The office of surveyor general is an emolument given by the founder. Admitting this to he of public concern, It. cannot affect; the case. They have not declined to appoint surveyors. The existence, or non-existence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>grammar school, does not affect those appointments. It is unconnected with them. As this mandamus is not applied for to compel the College to proceed to the election of a member to the General Assembly, or to the appointment of a county surveyor, the argument does not touch the case, unless it be intended to prove, that if a case can exist, in which a mandamus might be awarded to the College, it may be awarded in any case; that if there be a power annexed to the corporation to do any one act which concerns the public, the whole corporation immediately changes its nature, and, from a private, becomes a public corporation. Unless the argument proves this, it proves nothing. It cannot prove this. There is no reason, in the nature of the thing, why the donation of an individual, subjected by him to particular conditions, shall be subjected to other conditions, because a public office is conferred on the corporation, to whom that donation was made. The interference of the Court, so far as concerns the public office, produces no necessity, which I can discern, for their interference in points with which the public have nothing to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-4\">If the argument, which would he drawn from these powers conferred on the College, be unsupported by reason, it will derive no weight from authority. No decision, no <em>dictum </em>\u2018asserting the principle, has been adduced. I believe none can be adduced. The contrary is laid down in 1 <em>Wm. Black. Rep. </em>83, 85, 86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\">Then, though a <em>mandamus </em>might lie to compel the election of a member of Assembly, (had the power to elect one still been retained,) or of a county surveyor, yet it will not lie to compel the establishment of a grammar school, or the restoration of its master.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\"><em>2. </em>The objection, that the power of the Visitors is limited, so that they are to be considered as special, and not general Visitors, is not well founded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-7\">The mere appointment of a Visitor, without any description of his power, creates him a general Visitor, and gives him the power incident to the office. 1 <em>Wm. </em>Black. Rep. 83. There being no set form of words for the appointment of a general Visitor, let us enquire whether those used in the College charter are not sufficient. The 9th section contains the appointment. It ordains and appoints <em>Francis Nicholson, </em>&amp;c., gentlemen, and their successors, <em>\u201cto </em>be true, sole and undoubted Visitors and Governors of the said College for ever.\u201d It gives them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cpower to make such rules, laws, statutes, orders and injunctions, for the good and wholesome government of the Colloge, as to them and their successors shall, from time to time, according to their various occasions and circumstances, seem most fit and expedient.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">Unquestionably, then, they were general visitors, with all the powers incident to that office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-7\">If I have been successful in proving, that the College of <em>William S,- Mary </em>is, so far as concerns the grammar school, like all other colleges, a private corporation, and that its founder has given it general visitors, there is an end of the question concerning the mandamus. This Court has clearly no jurisdiction of the case, and from the acts of the Visitors there is no appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-8\">But, if I should be mistaken in this, it will become necessary to enquire,</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-9\">3. Whether the Visitors have or have not exceeded their authority ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-10\">I contend that they have not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-11\">Much argument has been used to prove, that ihc Visitors are bound by the College charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-12\">That is a position I never designed to controvert.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-13\">If the acts of the Visitors are at all examinable in this Court, none can be supported which transcend the limits prescribed for them in the charter which gives them being, and from which their power is drawn. The enquiry is, What are those limits ? It is unnecessary to examine the whole statute of 1779. It is only material to defend that part of it which puts down the grammar school. With respect to this, the whole operation of the statute is to commute a school for ancient languages into a school for modern languages. Was this within the power of the Visitors ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-14\">The charter gives them the power of making such laws for the government of the College, as to them shall seem proper. Sec. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-15\">But, it is contended, that this gives thorn only the power of making laws for the government of the College as constiluted, and not, in any manner, to change its organization. I admit, that it can give no power to change that which is established by Ihe charier. But, the grammar school is not established by the charter. In its first section, power is given to the trustees \u201c to erect, found and establish a certain place of universal study, or perpetual college for divinity, philosophy, languages and other good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>arts and sciences, consisting of one president, six masters or professors, &amp;c. according to the statutes and orders of the said College to be made, appointed and established upon the place by the said <em>Francis Nicholson, </em>&amp;c. <em>\u201d </em>It is then only made necessary by the charter, that <em>there </em>should be a president and six professors: and, perhaps, that divinity, philosophy and the languages should be taught in the College. This requisition of the charter, if it be one, is as well satisfied by teaching the modern as the ancient languages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">But, it is urged, that the trustees, in forming the statutes which shall regulate the president and masters, act as trustees or founders, and not as Visitors, because the power is given to them only, and not to their successors. This is true; but I cannot admit the inference which is drawn from it. That inference is, that having once executed their power, by constituting the six professorships, and having made to the College, so constituted, a transfer of the property vested in them, the trust was completely executed, and the professorships, thus constituted, remained immutable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-7\">Whatever might be the force of this argument, if the trustees or founders had merely constituted the professorships without any further declaration on the subject, it seems to me to have lost that force in the case which has actually happened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX-S\">The trustees, in the very moment of passing the statute for the organization of the College, declare that the Visitors may entirely cut off some salaries, and that they reserve to the Visitors the power of making new statutes, or of changing those made by the trustees, as their affairs and circumstances shall, from time to time, require. This declaration precedes the transfer, and the property is taken under the operation of this statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-9\">The trustees, it is said, could only have designed a change, as to such offices as did not compose one of the six professorships, required by the charter; but, the expression of the trustees is general, and is not now to be restrained by this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-10\">It is said, that, having executed the trust, they could not transmit to the Visitors the power of altering that, which was established by themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-11\">This deserves a serious consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-12\">The trustees are something more than mere trustees for the conveyance of property to an existing corporation, or to one the Crown was about to create. They are cm-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>powered to found a College, and are entrusted with property with which to endow the College they shall have founded. They have then the power of founders, subject only to that restriction which the charter imposes on them. As founders, they might authorise the Visitors to make any alterations within the limits of the charter. The alteration, I contend, does not exceed those limits, because languages are still taught in the College.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">Let it be true, that a Court of Chancery would have decreed the trustees to have executed their trust by a conveyance of the property to the College, yet, a Court of Equity would not have decreed them to have relinquished any discretion which they possessed as founders, and which was compatible with the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-7\">It cannot be admitted to be true, that the masters are independent of the visitors, because they, as well as the visitors, are ordained by the charter. The charter expressly gives to the Visitors the power of legislating for, and governing the College. They have, with respect to the professors, the power of appointment and the power of deprivation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\">Nor is it to he admitted, that, the masters are appointed for life. This is no where declared in the charier or statutes. The first president, only, is appointed in the charter, and there is no expression which would shew, that the professors are not removable at the will of the Visitors. That they vote on their freehold, is no proof of it; because, an estate which may endure for life, but is subject to bo defeated, draws after it, many of the qualities of a life estate. The estate is attached to the office, not to the person; and, as the office may be held for life, the officer, like one who holds an estate during widowhood, has many of the privileges of a tenant for life. But, it is contended, that, if they have tins power of deprivation, still, Mr. <em>Bracken </em>ought to have been summoned; and for this, <em>Bentley\u2019s </em>Case is cited, as reported in <em>Strange.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-11\">To that corporation, there was no Visitor: But, that is not material as to the point I am now considering. There is, however, a material difference between the act we are now considering, and that of which Doctor <em>Bentley </em>complained. He was deprived of his office by a judicial act: the office of Mr. <em>Bracken </em>is put down by a legislative act. lie was arraigned for misconduct, and, therefore, should have had notice, that he might have defended his conduct: Mr, <em>Bracken </em>has not been complained of; but. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the College Senate have deemed it for the interest of the College to change his office. If the act was within their power, it could not be necessary to give him notice, that they were about to perform it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyQD\">Concerning the case of Mr. <em>Camm, </em>I know nothing certain; but am informed, that the Visitors consented to what was done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\">Mr. <em>Taylor </em>is incorrect in stating, that there were not a sufficient number of members in <em>December, </em>1779, to form a convocation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-6\">I suppose it need not appear, on the proceedings, that every member was summoned, should it even be necessary, (which I do n.ol admit,) that such should be the fact.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>BY THE COURT.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Let it be certified that, <em>on the merits of the case, </em>the General Court ought not to award a writ of mandamus to restore the plaintiff to the office of grammar master and professor of humanity in the said College. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\">[* See <em>Bracken </em>v. <em>Wm. &amp; Mary </em>College, 1 Call, 161; and The Trustees of <em>Dartmouth College </em>v.
