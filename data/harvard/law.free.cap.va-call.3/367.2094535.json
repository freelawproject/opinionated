Replication, that the defendant had not fully administered; nor paid the judgment stated in his plea; and that he had goods and chattels at the lime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>of the institution of the suit, sufficient to pay the plaintiff\u2019s debt; which he prayed might be enquired of by the country, &amp;e. But, no <em>similiter </em>is entered. The jury found a verdict in these words: \u201cWe of the jury find for the plaintiff 124/. 14,s. 64:\u201d But the entry thereof in the order book is thus: <em>\u201c </em>and thereupon came a jury, &amp;c. who upon their oaths do say, that the defendant hath not fully administered all and singular the goods, chattels and credits, which were of the said <em>William Elliott </em>at the time of his death, and that assets to the amount of 124/. 14s. 64, were in the defendant\u2019s hands, at the time of issuing the writ of <em>scire facias </em>aforesaid, as the plaintiff by replying hath alledged.\u201d The <em>Hustings </em>Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; to which judgment the District Court granted a writ of supersedeas, and reversed it, with an order for a new trial in the <em>Hustings </em>Court. At a subsequent trial in the latter Court, the jury found a verdict in these words: \u201cWe of the jury find for the plaintiff according to the former judgment, and that the defendant had at the time of the service of the <em>scire facias </em>in this case, and prior to the first day of <em>.August,, </em>1793, assets in his hands to the value of 124/. 14&lt;y. 64, and we also find for the plaintiff 70/. 4s. 1|, with interest from the 24th of <em>September, </em>1791, subject to the opinion of the Court upon this point, whether an administrator can pay off a debt due by judgment against his intestate, on which said judgment an execution had issued, after a <em>scire facias made </em>known to him to revive a judgment obtained against his intestate in his life.\u201d The <em>Hustings </em>Court now gave judgment for the plaintiff, for the 70/. <em>4s. l i: </em>To which last mentioned judgment, another writ of <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by the District Court: Where the same was reversed; and thereupon, <em>Goosely </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-10\">The plea to the <em>scire facias </em>is fully administered, except certain assets; and the single point was, whether he had assets or not ? To which the verdict of the jury is clearly responsive; because they find a particular sum, which must relate'to the assets, as it would have been unnecessary to have specified the sum, upon any other ground. The verdict ought to be referred to the subject matter in dispute; which, in this case, was only as to the amount of the unadministered assets; for, there was no plea of pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ment, which might have varied the case. The verdict submits a single point only to the Court; but the jury meant to decide all other points fully, and therefore the <em>quantum </em>of assets, necessarily.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-4\">The plaintiff by suing out a <em>scire facias </em>obtained a preference. 11 <em>Vin. </em>Abr. 301: For, the word <em>process, </em>there, must refer to the <em>scire facias; </em>because, there could have been no other process, until the judgment was revived, as an execution could not have been taken out, before. The same doctrine is laid down in 2 <em>Fonbl. </em>Treat. Eq. 405, and in <em>Rich, </em>on Wills, 380: Which is analogous to the legal doctrines in other eases; for, the law always gives a preference to superior diligence. [<em>Waters </em>v. <em>Ogden,] 2 </em>Dougl. 452. The District Court erred, therefore; and their judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-5\"><em>Nicholas, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">The <em>scire facias </em>did not give a preference; for, the executor might pay any other judgment, notwithstanding. 3 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 80, <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.] <em>Ordwey </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>Cro. Eliz. 575; <em>Allen, </em>48; 4 <em>Mod. </em>296. The 11 <em>Vin. </em>301, cited on the other side, is actually in our favor; because, it proves that the executor may pay either judgment at any time before execution; which is supported by <em>Wentworth\u2019s </em>Off. of Ex. <em>8th edit. </em>197; where it is said, that if <em>scire facias\u2019s </em>are issued on both, he may confess judgment to one, and prefer it to the other. The passage cited from <em>Fonbl. </em>Treat. Eq. 405, is not, against us; for, the author means, that he who first sues execution, shall obtain a preference; and the reason is, that the execution binds the property: All which is proved by the case referred to, by him, <em>[Smallcomb </em>v. <em>Cross,] </em>in 1 Ld. Raym. 251. Diligence is not the rule, as the counsel oh the other side insists, hut dignity; for, where the dignity is equal, the executor may prefer wdiielx he pleases. 3 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 81, 82. The case of bonds does not apply; for, that turns upon the notice, which can only be given by suit: whereas, in the ease of judgments, he has notice without. The verdict supposes an execution; which might have been served after the death of the testator; and, therefore, bound the properly. 2 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 716, <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.] <em>Comberb. </em>33, <em>[Anony.</em>] 2 Ventr. 218; <em>[Pennoir v. Brace,] </em>1 Salk. 319; 1 <em>Mod. </em>188; <em>[Houghton </em>v. <em>Rushby,] </em>Skin. 257, 258; 12 <em>Mod. </em>5; <em>Gilb. </em>Ex. 15; 10 <em>Vin. </em>Abr. 568. If it be doubtful when it issued, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>will be a ground for a <em>venire facias denovo. </em>1 <em>Wash. 282. </em>But the fair inference from the finding is, that it issued in the life-time of the testator.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-3\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-4\">There are two questions: 1. Whether an executor can pay after a <em>scire facias </em>issued ? 2. Whether the mere emanation of the writ in the testator\u2019s life-time gives a preference ? As to the first: The cases cited on the other side are like the case of bonds, where payment cannot be made to another bond, not in suit, after an action commenced. Of course, the rule will still hold, that the <em>scire facias </em>gives a preference, unless a <em>scire facias had been </em>issued on the other judgment, and judgment confessed thereto: as to which, the casein 11 <em>Vin. </em>301, is conclusive. The execution, there spoken of, must mean an execution founded on a <em>scire facias; </em>for, no other could issue, after the death of the testator. Indeed, the <em>scire facias </em>itself is an execution; for, it is a writ to shew cause why execution should not issue; that is, it is suing for execution. <em>Bich. </em>on Wills, 380, is express to that effect, and so is <em>Fonbl. 405. </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The passage from <em>Wentworth </em>does not oppose the doctrine, but is consistent with it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">The forms of pleading prove my position. The plea is, that at the time of instituting the suit, <em>he </em>had not <em>assets; </em>and the verdict is, that he had them to a certain amount; which sliews that a payment, afterwards, will not avail, because it is inconsistent with the plea itself. The decisions are all according to the doctrine contended for by me; and that is a sufficient argument, whether the rule is reasonable or not. If there be two bonds, and suit is brought on one, the executor cannot pay the other, without a suit- and judgment. Notice is not the reason of this, but diligence, and the prior suit. The Court will never presume, that the defendant confesses judgment improperly; and, therefore, if the judgment is in fact obtained, that is sufficient; but, it is otherwise, if no such judgment is rendered. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>light of preference in the executor is subject to great abuse, and therefore not to be extended further than the law has already settled. As to the second question: The verdict is certain enough. It states, that an execution issued; and, the omission to say, whether it was delivered to the Sheriff, or not, does not prejudice the ease; because the first fact of the emanation is certain, and there is no room to infer 'that it was delivered, as nothing was said about it; for, it was not necessary to negative it. Pocket executions are usual; and, therefore, if there was a delivery, it should have been shewn. The simple enquiry was, whether the defendant had assets when the <em>scire facias </em>issued? And, therefore, the subsequent payment was irrelevant. The determinations, relative to the delivery of the execution binding the property, do not apply, as the verdict does not present the fact to the Court. The object of the lien is to prevent alienations, before the execution is levied; but, this only applies to tangible objects, and not to <em>dioses in action. </em>Besides, it must be delivered to the Sheriff; for, a pocket execution has no effect. Of course, no lien attaches, until seizure of the property; hut, when seized, then it relates to the <em>teste, </em>as to the executor; and, as to the others, to the time of delivery. If, however, the writ runs out of date, before the properly is taken, the lien expires; for, it is the seizure alone that can preserve it. The plaintiff only, claims the smaller sum found; and, therefore, if it is uncertain which of the two was meant as the quantity of assets in the executor\u2019s hands, there is no ground for \u00e1 <em>venire facias de novo; </em>because, it was one or the other of them; and, when the plaintiff asks the lesser sum only', no possible injury can be produced: which renders the verdict certain enough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-4\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vulf.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">[* <em>\"</em>The judgment creditor, who first sues out a <em>scire </em>facias, must be preferred 5 but, before .such writ be sued out, the executor has it in his election, where there are twojudgment creditors, to pay which of them he pleases first} and if each bring a <em>scire facias </em>on his judgment, yet the executor may confess either action, at his option, and that although the <em>scire fa* das we </em>re brought by the one creditor before the other.\u201d <em>Toller\u2019s </em>Law of Ex. &amp; Adm. 265, 5th ed. citing <em>Off.
