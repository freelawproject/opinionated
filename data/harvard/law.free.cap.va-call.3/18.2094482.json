And moreover, in case the said <em>Joseph Fuqua, </em>junior, and <em>William, Fuqua, </em>shall <em>be </em>cast in the said suits, <em>they </em>shall, as soon as the said suits are determined, pay to the said <em>Thomas 'Mackey </em>executor of <em>Samuel Fuqua </em>deceased, the aforesaid sum of two hundred and eighteen pounds two shillings and two pence farthing, with interest from the date.\u201d The declaration averred that the said <em>Joseph Fuqua, </em>junior, and <em>William Fuqua, </em>junior, were cast in the above mentioned suilr., on the day of in the year 1794, at which time the aforesaid suits were finally determined by the judgment of the District Court of <em>New London, in favour of </em>the said <em>Thomas Mackey </em>executor of <em>Samuel Fuqua </em>deceased; whereby an action hath accrued, <em>See. </em>Pleas, <em>payment </em>and <em>conditions performed </em>\u2014 - Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">On the trial of the cause, the defendants filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, which stated, that the plaintiff offered in evidence, the copies of four non-suits in the District Court of <em>New London, </em>two of which were in suits between the Justices of <em>Charlotte </em>county, for the benefit of <em>William Fuqua, </em>and two, between the same Justices for the <em>benefit of Joseph Fuqua </em>plaintiffs, and <em>Thomas Mackey </em>executor, &amp;c. of <em>Samuel Fuqua </em>deceased, defendant, in debt. That the plaintiff likewise offered in evidence the bond aforesaid. That the defeudants objected to the evidence; but the objection was overruled, and <em>the </em>said copies of the non-suits, and the said bonds permitted to go in evidence to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AhF7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Verdict and judgment, for the plaintiff; to which judgment the defendants obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from the District Court, upon a petition which assigned for error: That the damages laid in the declaration, did not agree with those in the writ, and exceeded the debt. <em>2. </em>That there was a variance between the declaration- and bond, in using the word <em>they </em>instead of <em>the. </em>3. That although there were two issues in the cause, yet the record states that the jury were charged to try the <em>issue. </em>4. That it did not appear by the said copies of the non-suits, that the defendant in the <em>supersedeas </em>had instituted such suits, or that he had failed therein, as the Justices of <em>Charlotte </em>were the plaintiffs, and ordered to pay the costs, and not the defendant in the <em>supersedeas. 5. </em>That the jury have assessed damages to the plaintiff\u2019s testator, and the Court has rendered judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">The District Court reversed the judgment of the County Court, because the suits in <em>New London </em>District Court <em>were not finally determined on the merits, when the present suit </em>was commenced. From which judgment of reversal, the plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq8\">There are two issues in the caus\u00e9; one, <em>conditions performed, </em>the other <em>payment: </em>and the last, has not been tried. Besides, the copies of the repords do not shew that those were the suits mentioned in the condition of the bond; and the defect ought to have been supplied by other evidence. But as this has not been done, there is variance between the evidence offered and the declaration. At least it does not appear that the suits are the same with those referred to in the condition, and stated in the declaration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-9\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-10\">The language in the record, that the jury were charged upon the <em>issue </em>instead of the issues, is a misprision of the Clerk; and the jury, in finding that the-defendants have not performed the conditions of the bond, have in effect found the non-payment of the debt. Besides, the verdict, which is recited in <em>hsec verba </em>in another part of the record, is, that the jury find for the plaintiff, and assess his damages; and .not, that the defendants have not performed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>conditions. This makes the observation relative to the misprision, more manifest. As to the other point, it was matter of demurrer to the evidence, but not a ground of exception. Upon the face of the writs, it appeared that two of the suits were for the benefit of <em>William </em>Fuqua, and two for the benefit of <em>Joseph Fuqua: </em>and that the names of the Justices was matter of form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-4\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b41-5\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Az6\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the judgment of the District Court was erroneous, and that there was no error in the judgment of the County Court. Consequently, that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
