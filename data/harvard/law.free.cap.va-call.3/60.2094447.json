That after <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>death, the plaintiff solicited the defendant to take administration on his <em>estate, </em>and offered to be his security; but this also was declined. The bill, therefore, prays that the bonds may be delivered up. The answer denies any peremptory request to sue: but two witnesses prove the request; and one speaks of the probable ability of <em>Campbell </em>to have paid about that time. The Court of Chancery granted a perpetual injunction to any further proceedings on the said bonds; and <em>Croughton </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Warden, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">It is not proved that <em>Campbell </em>was insolvent: Nor is it even fully established, that <em>Duval </em>requested <em>Croughton </em>to bring suit. But, if both had been shewn in the clearest manner, that, would not have altered the case. The <em>Chancellor's </em>principle is too broad; for, it is not true that one man is bound to do for <em>another, </em>what the latter requests, although it might not prejudice the former, <em>Duval </em>might have paid the. debt and taken an assignment of the bond, which would have enabled him to sue <em>Campbell, </em>or he might have brought a bill iu Chancery, in the nature of a <em>guia timet, </em>and prayed that <em>Campbell </em>might be decreed to pay the debt, and save him harmless. <em>[Bracken </em>v.

Eq. 43, But, having neglected them all, he has no equity against the creditor. <em>Croughton </em>was not bound to administer; he was not next <em>of </em>kin; and, <em>if </em>there was any advantage to have been derived from it, <em>Duval </em>might have taken the administration himself. The act of 1794, <em>[R. C. </em>c. 174, \u00a7 2, ed. 1803; c. 116, \u00a7 <em>6, </em>ed. 1819,] has no influence, on the question; because it relates to future bonds only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-11\"><em>Nicholas, Wickham, Call </em>and <em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-12\">The refusal of <em>Croughton </em>to bring suit, released <em>Duval </em>from his obligation, as payment of the debt might then have been enforced. The answer does not deny the request to sue, and the depositions prove it. The indulgence under these circumstances was unreasonable; and changed the nature of the contract <em>Nisbet </em>v. <em>Smith </em>et al., 2 Bro. C. C. 579; <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Berrington, </em>2 Ves. <em>jun. </em>540; <em>Crompt. Chy. </em>44. Civilians make a distinction between perfect and imperfect obligations; the first is, where, a man is not bound from any circumstance to do a benefit to another, such as to lend him money or other aid; but the second is, where ho is bound, from a prior consideration, to perform some act in order to sayo the other from injury, or to retribute him for something had, or some, wrong sus-\" t,'fined. In the present ease, the obligation to sue was of the, perfect kind; because the circumstances and relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>of the parties required, that indulgence should not be given by one, to the injury of the other. But, for another reason, the request was proper; because it prevented circuity of action; and if <em>Duval </em>could have brought a bill of <em>quia timet, </em>.there is the same reason for relief upon the request; because, there is no magic in the bill, to render that right upon the suit, which would not have been right without it. If the act of Assembly proves nothing for us, it has nothing against us; because it only enacts what was equity before.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-6\"><em>Warden, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASV\">The cases cited on the other side have no influence on the cause. That of <em>Nisbet </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Bro. C. C. 579, was the case of an additional security taken by the creditor; and he had thereby contracted fora future day of payment, which put it out of his power to enforce satisfaction of the debt in the mean time. The same observation applies to that of <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Berrington, </em>2 Ves <em>jun. </em>540, and to the case from <em>Crompt. </em>Therefore, no principle is to be drawn from those cases, which will affect the decision to be given in this. A mere delay to bring suit, clearly does not exonerate the security; for, generally speaking, arecovery can be had against the surety at any time when it can be obtained against the principal; and no case is shewn where a mere .request to sue has been held to alter the law in this respect. <em>Duval </em>has no just cause of complaint; because he might have'paid the debt and pursued <em>Campbell.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-8\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"An40\">delivered the resolution of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">This is an appeal from the decree of the Court of Chancery, where Mr. <em>Duval </em>exhibited his bill, stating that, on the 23d of <em>April, </em>1793, he, as security for Mr. <em>Alexander Campbell, </em>entered into three bonds to Mr. <em>Croughton, </em>for 113?. 4s. <em>4d. </em>each; one payable in <em>October, </em>1793, another in <em>January, </em>1794, and the third in <em>April, </em>1794, all bearing interest from <em>October, </em>1790. That, Mr. <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>circumstances being in a declining state, <em>Duval, </em>in <em>October, </em>1794, when all the bonds had become due, applied to <em>Croughton, </em>who. well knew <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>circumstances, and requested him to bring suits on the bonds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>which lie declined doing, till after Mr. <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>death, insolvent, in 1796; his inducement for which forbearance, was <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>being his counsel in an important suit then depending, and his expectation that <em>Campbell </em>would be able to pay him from the fruits of a suit, then depending m this Court. That., after <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>death, <em>Duval </em>again applied to <em>Croughum </em>to administer on his estate, by which the debts might have been secured; but he refused to do so; and <em>Duval </em>not being a creditor, could not obtain such administration. That, in 1798, he received a letter, from the appellant <em>Sovthcomb, </em>intimating his claim to the bonds; which he answered, assigning reasons against his liability. <em>Crnnghton </em>and <em>Southcomb </em>are made defendants, and required to answer the bill; and the prayer is, that the bonds may he cancelled so far as respects the plaintiff, or that other relief may he afforded. The proofs fix the request to sue in 1794, but go no further. It is not proved that any new arrangements are made between the creditor and the principal, to obtain a forbearance of the suits; for, although it is stated that <em>Campbell </em>expected to pay from the effect of a suit depending, it does not appear that <em>Croughion </em>had <em>bound himself </em>to wait till the event of that suit. It is, therefore, a naked case for the question, whether a creditor, by delaying to commence suit, when requested by a surety, without any thing done on his part, which may amount to a new contract with the principal, shall lose his remedy against the surety ? The question is new, and, indeed, important; as there may, perhaps, he hundreds of bonds, dated prior to the act of <em>[Dec.] </em>1794, <em>[ </em>\u2014 Mar. 1795, R. C. c. 116, \u00a7 6, ed. 1819,] existing in the State, and probably not one of them in which the creditor has not forborne to sue for a considerable time beyond the day of payment; which, it is urged, will amount to a discharge of the surety. It would, indeed, be much more important, if that act of 1794 had not settled the question from that period. The act does not take away any remedy which the surety was entitled to before; and we come to consider what that remedy was ? It is clear, that the plaintiff might have paid the money, and proceeded to a suit himself, or if that was inconvenient, he might have brought his bill of <em>quia </em>timet, to have compelled the principal to pay, and the creditor to receive the money; but, that the creditor should lose his debt, because he was merely passive, in forbearing a suit which the surety requested him to bring, without any thing active between him and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>principal, tending to shew a new contract for forbearance, is not, and the Court believe cannot be, proved by any of the cases produced, or existing. In the case quoted, from <em>2 Bro. C. C. </em>579, the creditor commenced suit, and upon the principal giving a note to confess judgment, agreed to stay execution for three years; which the <em>Chancellor </em>considered as a new contract, and compromise with the principal, without the consent of the surety, and which deprived him of his remedy by the bill of <em>quia timet; </em>and, therefore, that the surety was discharged. In the case in <em>2 Ves. </em>jun. 540, the creditor took from the principal several notes and drafts, which were returned, and new ones given, from time to time, which amounted to a new contract, and all this without consulting <em>the </em>surety, who had this further equity in that case; that while those notes were transacting, considering himself as discharged, he had paid over to the principal, more money than the. amount of the debt, which had come to the surety\u2019s hands, and the <em>Chancellor </em>adjudged that <em>that </em>surety was discharged. The circumstances, discussed in those cases, so far from proving that the surety is discharged by a bare request to sue, not complied with, tend to establish the contrary, that such request and a bare forbearance to sue, does not amount to a discharge. Sureties are so far favored in equity, that the Court will never extend relief against them, further than, by their contract, they are bound at law; but fair creditors are also favorites in that Court, and will not be deprived of their legal rights, without some fraud, or neglect in doing what they were bound to do. It was certainly unkind in <em>Croughton, </em>not to sue when he was requested by the surety, which was so far a breach of his moral duty, but it was truly said, that this duty was such as the Civilians describe as an imperfect obligation, the performance of which was merely voluntary, and could not be enforced by a Court of Justice; many instances of which were mentioned, and many more might have been added. The parties here had plain remedies: the creditor to sue, if he chose it; and, as he did not, Mr. <em>Duval\u2019s </em>remedy is before pointed out; which he, neglecting to pursue, was, at least, as much in fault as the creditor; and where equity is equal, the law must prevail. The decree is, therefore, to be -reversed, with costs, by the unanimous opinion of the Court; and, in consequence of Mr. <em>Duval\u2019s </em>consent, entered in the record, he is decreed to pay the several sums according to the bonds. The costs in that Court to lie equally borne by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the parties, as it seems to have been by con,sent, to settle a now point. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b85-4\">[* See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>Gilmer, 149; <em>Ward </em>v.

J. <em>said, </em>\"the ground of my opinion in this case is. that general rule of the common law, which requires, that the obligation created by an instrument under seal, shall be discharged by fore\u00bb of an instrument of equal validity, The operation of this rule is. indeed, sometimes such, as to make it imperative upon a Court of equity to interpose and grant relief; but it by no means follows'that the rule of law is to be broken down, because a Court having jurisdiction of another kind, will interpose where there is a particular case, in which the rule of lav may be found to operate harshly. There is great objection to a Court of Law talcing upon itself to act as a Court of Equity, because they have not the means of doing that full and ample justice which the particular case may require. * We ought not, therefore, to interpose in a matter which seems peculiarly to belong to the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity. Jf a parol agreement is entered into to give time to the parties, supposing it not the case of a surety, but simply the case of a common bond, conditioned for payment of money at a et*rfain day. it will not prevent the party from proceeding at Law immediately, whatever the consideration for the delay may be. And, if that be so, how can the giving of time to a third person, by such an agreement, prevent the obligee of the bond from proceeding at Law against the surety ? There may, indeed be such a consideration for the agreement, as may induce a Court of Equity to direct that the party shall not proceed to enforce his remedy at Law. But a parol agree\" moot of this nature, can never operate to control the obligation of this bond in a Court of Law. The decisions which have taken place in the Courts of Equity in eases of this nature, have always, as I understand them, proceeded on the notion, that at Law, the thing prayed for could not he done\u00bb Bills of Exchange stand upon a very different footing; there the law merchant operates, and the Courts of Law decide upon them with reference to that law. Guaranties for the payment of debts, <em>[Samuell </em>v. <em>Howarth, </em>was a ease of guaranty,] are not, in general, instruments tinder seal, and there is no strict technical rule which,- as to them, prevents a Court of Law from looking to the real justice of the case.\u201d Holroyt and Best, Just, to same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">And <em>Bultell </em>v. <em>Jarrold, </em>(not reported.) cited by Mr. Maule, in <em>Davey et </em>al. v.
