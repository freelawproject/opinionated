That on the 13th <em>of .November, 1792, </em>the plaintiff sued out a writ of <em>scire facias to </em>revive the judgment against the said <em>Thomas Hubbard., </em>administrator as aforesaid. That the said writ of <em>scire facias </em>was made out by the said <em>Russell, </em>who by mistake, inserted that the judgment was to be discharged by the payment of &lt;56/. 10s. with interest from the 19th <em>July, </em>1773, and costs, instead of <em>1561. 10s. </em>with interest <em>from the </em>19th <em>July, </em>1773, as it ought to have been. That the said writ was returned executed. That the plaintiff appeared by his counsel and judgment was rendered for the said 313/. to be discharged by the payment of 56/. 10,v. and the costs. That an execution issued on the latter judgment, which was replevied. That the plaintiff\u2019 never made any attempt to have the error amended. That there was uo other evidence in the cause except the facts above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\">The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; and <em>Russell </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-10\">Counsel for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-11\">The writ appears to have been delivered to the plaintiff; who ought to have inspected the sum, and- seen that it was right. He might have corrected the mistake, by discontinuing his writ, and bringing a new one, or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>suing out a writ of error to the judgment, or even by moving to amend the proceedings without the form of a writ of error; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Frazier, 2 </em>Wash. 130; but, having neglected to do so, he ought not to be allowed to charge the Clerk for an accidental mistake. Besides, it is found that there was no other evidence than that stated in the verdict; and as special damage is the <em>gist </em>of the action, and none is shewn, it follows that the suit was not maintainable. 1 Ventr. 310; <em>[Russell </em>v.

Of course, it being the duty of the Clerk to issue the writ rightly, if he has done it wrong, he is responsible. Besides, the plaintiff was not bound to correct the error, and perhaps it was prudent in him not to do so: because, that might have l\u2019eleased the Clerk, and before he could have obtained another judgment against the executor, the estate might have become insolvent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVB\">The damage done the plaintiff necessarily appears on the proceedings. It is the difference between the true sum and that for which the writ erroneously issued. If this error had not been committed, it is probable that the plaintiff might have made his whole debt; because, it appears that the sum for which the judgment was obtained in the <em>scire facias, </em>was actually made; and, therefore, the presumption is, that the whole might have been.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-7\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-8\">\n<em>PER C UR.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ADa\">Affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
