That the plaintiff, knowing of <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>authority, sold him 10,000 bushels of corn for 1,588/. sterling, in bills to be drawn by <em>Hunter, </em>and endorsed by <em>Patten Dalrymple, </em>who were also agents of <em>Blanc. </em>That, after 9,400 bushels were delivered on board one of <em>Blanc\u2019s </em>vessels, by the name of the <em>Scipio, Patten </em>&lt;\u00a7* <em>Dalrymple </em>refused to endorse, but assured the plaintiff that <em>Hunter </em>had authority to draw, and shewed him a copy of the orders sent to <em>Hunter. </em>That the plaintiff forwarded the bills of exchange to <em>London </em>in order to receive payment; but the same were, protested. The bill, therefore, prays an attachment against the effects of <em>Blane </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>and for general relief. The answer of <em>Patten </em>admits <em>Patten 8? Dalrymple </em>refused to endorse, but denies that they ever assured the plaintiff <em>Hunter </em>had authority to draw. On the contrary, they expressed doubts whether ho was not exceeding his authority: That they shewed the plaintiff a copy of <em>Blanc\u2019s </em>orders to them, which only authorised them to draw upon actual shipments made; and told him that <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>instructions were of the same nature. The answer of <em>Blane </em>states, that <em>Hunter </em>and others being indebted to him, he chartered vessels and sent them to <em>Virginia </em>to be laden with corn for <em>Europe, </em>if they should judge it proper to undertake such shipments, and gave instructions in the letters of the 20th and 23d of November. 1789, and that t.he plaintiff ought to have demanded and seen that of the 20th, if he meant to bargain with <em>Hunter, </em>in consequence of having seen that of the 23d: Denies that he employed <em>Hunter </em>to purchase grain on bis account, or to draw bills unless warranted to do so by placing funds in his hands; and insists, that his instructions only obliged him to receive any consignments of grain which <em>Hunter </em>might send him, except as to another ship by the name of the <em>Brinkley, </em>which <em>Hunter </em>was ordered to lade. On the contrary, the instructions were limited to particular objects, that the defendant declined receiving the cargo of the <em>Scipio. </em>That-his offer to accept the bills on him, was only for the honor of <em>Hunter, </em>and not upon his own account. That he interfered with the destination of the ship as well for the sake of lessening the freight, as for the benefit of <em>Hunter, </em>and not because he considered the cargo as belonging to himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">The depositions prove the sale and delivery of the corn, nearly as the bill states them, and that the plaintiff, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Pallen S? Dalrymple </em>refused to endorse the bills, had no other alternative than to take an assignment of the bill of lading, as a security, in case <em>Plane </em>would not accept the bills. That the ship was chartered by <em>Plane. </em>That the reason given by <em>Plane </em>for not accepting the bills, was, that hq was afraid he might not receive remittances from <em>Ferrol </em>in Spain, to enable him to pay them. That <em>Plane </em>said he had ensured the cargo to Ferrol, but as the market there was glutted, he had ordered it to <em>London.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-3\">The bills, dated the 6th of <em>May, </em>1790, are drawn by <em>Hunter </em>on <em>Plane, </em>at 60 days\u2019 sight, in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">There is a copy of the charter parly entered into by <em>Plane </em>with <em>Davidson, </em>the owner of the ship, for nine months or a longer time, hut describes no voyage in particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">The letters of the 20th and 23d of <em>November, </em>1789, from <em>Plane </em>to <em>Hunter, </em>and containing the instructions to purchase, are the same with those referred to in the case of <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Plane, </em>1 Call, 362. The letter of 27th of <em>November, </em>178.9, from <em>Plane </em>to <em>Hunter, </em>confirms those of the 20th and 23d of that month, advises him that he, had sent the brig <em>Brinkley, </em>concerning the dispatch and destination of which it would be superfluous to add any thing to what he had already writtenStates that the brig was to be repaired by <em>Hunter, </em>at <em>Plane\u2019s </em>expense; and supposes a few days will suffice for it, while the cargo is preparing, so as not to occasion detention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">Letter of <em>December </em>24th, 1790, from <em>Planeta Huntef, </em>reminds him of non-payment of certain balances, and reproaches him with having drawn further than he had authority to <em>do, </em>which was at the utmost confined to the <em>Brinkley\u2019s </em>cargo; that his drafts had not been accepted, because <em>Hunter </em>had not furnished funds, and he found he had over-accepted before he was aware of the deficiency. For, notwithstanding <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>advices were not satisfactory, yet <em>Blane, </em>through confidence that <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>resources would some how or other justify his drafts and reimburse <em>Plane, </em>had continued to honor his bills longer than was strictly proper. That even the <em>Brinkley\u2019s </em>cargo was purchased under circumstances not warranted by the instructions; and that he might have rejected it for that reason, but had waived the right, taken the cargo and passed it to <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>credit.

That the name of <em>Blane </em>was not mentioned, as the person for whom the purchase was made; that neither he nor any other pei\u2019son was named as in any way interested or concerned in the purchase, or responsible for the payment. That he saw the <em>missives </em>of the bargain exchanged between <em>Proud-fit </em>and <em>Hunter; </em>and that the price of corn then, was about 18 or 20s. <em>Virginia </em>cui'rency <em>per </em>barrel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">The Court of Chancery decreed in favor of the plaintiff, and <em>Blane </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-4\"><em>Hunter </em>plainly went beyond his powers; and therefore, his act was void. For, he was not to buy corn unless the other articles could not be obtained. But, instead of this, he purchased when the others might have been had, and he bought it above the market price too. Added to which, instead of forwarding the bills of lading immediately, as he was bound by his instructions to have done, he endorsed them in blank, and one was afterwards actually filled up to <em>Plunket </em>&amp; <em>Stewart. </em>So that <em>Proudfit </em>was co-operating <em>to </em>prevent <em>Blane\u2019s </em>ability to pay. <em>[Mead </em>v. Ld. Orrery,] 3 Atk. 238; <em>[Ewer </em>v. Corbet,] 2 P. Wms. 148. But <em>Proudfit nevar </em>knew <em>Blane </em>in the business; for his contract was with <em>Hunter: </em>and it does not even appear, that he ever saw or heard of the powers from <em>Blane </em>to <em>Hunter. </em>The correspondence is with <em>Hunter </em>in his own name; and the hills do not specify that they were drawn on account of the agency. <em>[Hopkins </em>v. <em>Blane,] 1 </em>Call, 377;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Pow. </em>on Pow. 118. <em>Blane\u2019s </em>offer to accept, proves nothing; because an offer not accepted, weighs nothing. <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Robb, </em>2 Call, 258.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The same arguments apply to <em>Smith\u2019s </em>case; for the powers were never seen in that case either, and the transaction was personally with <em>Hunter, </em>without reference to his agency. The length of time before the attempt to render <em>Blane </em>liable, is very material, and shews that he was not thought of at the commencement of the transaction. <em>[Hopkins </em>v. <em>Blane,] </em>1 Call, 379. The decrees are therefore both erroneous; and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\"><em>Nicholas, for the </em>appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-6\">The powers given by <em>Blane </em>were the most extensive imaginable, and clearly included the present case. For, he was to use his discretion in purchasing, and was not restricted but. actually authorised to buy corn. If he abused those powers, as it is pretended on the other side, that circumstance does not affect <em>Smith; </em>in whose case the bills were remitted immediately, and, therefore, there is no objection on the ground of delay, as there was in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Blane, </em>1 Call, 361. It is evident, front the circumstances, that the sellers saw the powers before the sales were made; but if they only heard of them, it is sufficient. In <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Blane, </em>there was a strong appearance of credit having been given personally to <em>Hunter; </em>but here no reliance was placed on him. In that case, the bills were not drawn for grain, but for tobacco; but hero they wore drawn for grain, and that was remitted to <em>Blane: </em>which was agreeable to the powers given by him to <em>Hunter, </em>who was his general agent; and therefore, the case is expressly like that of <em>Hooe </em>&amp; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Oxley </em>&amp; <em>Hancock, </em>1 Wash. 19. For, there is nothing to shew that it was a contract by <em>Hunter </em>on his own account, but every circumstance manifestly proves that it was on account of the agency. The argument that the sellers were voluntarily participating in the abuse of the powers, and that the corn was purchased at an exorbitant price, is altogether unfounded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-10\">In <em>Hooe </em>&amp; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Oxley &amp; Hancock, </em>there was an extensive general agency to transact their business, given to <em>Ponsonhy, </em>and that agency was notorious to the whole world: But here the agency was special and not generally known: So that whoever would make a title under it, must shew that the agency was known to him. But this they cannot do. <em>Hunter </em>being a particular agent for special purposes, had no authority to exceed them, and ought not to have drawn beyond the funds advanced by him. The plaintiffs never made any contract with <em>Blane, </em>but with <em>Hunter </em>only, and upon his own account. It is repugnant to the nature of his business to suppose these letters were shewn by Hunter; because secrecy was <em>Blane\u2019s </em>object, to prevent competition in the market; and, therefore, it would have been infidelity in him to have divulged them. It was consequently a transaction in the usual course of trade, that is to say, a purchase by <em>Hunter </em>for bills on <em>London, </em>without any regard to the agency. The extravagant price given for corn, when <em>Blane\u2019s </em>orders were to buy as low as possible, proves that <em>Hunter </em>only was trusted: For, there is no proof that his affiairs were at that time declining. But, be that as it may, the taking of the bonds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>notes, and second bills, were a discharge of the first, and exonerated <em>Blane </em>altogether, if he ever was liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-4\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vail.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">[* Bills drawn by agents, should state on what account they are drawn, so as to shew on whose credit they are drawn s Pendleton J. in delivering op. of Ct. in <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Blane.]</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Aem\">[\u2020 <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>1 Call, 26; W<em>illiams </em>v. <em>Price, 5 </em>Munf. 538.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b203-5\">LYONS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqfx\">after stating the ease, delivered the resolution of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In the present case, the defendant might, with safety, perhaps, have demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s bill. For, although it charges, that the bills of exchange were taken upon the credit of Blane, yet, that is inconsistent with the other facts stated in it; such as the requisition that the bills should be endorsed by <em>Bailen </em>and <em>Dulrymple, </em>and, when that could not be obtained, the taking of an assignment of the hills of lading. These circumstances prove, that the bills were neither drawn, nor taken upon the credit of <em>Blane, </em>but that the plaintiff looked elsewhere for security. Therefore, upon his own shewing, it is probable, that the bill could not have withstood a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Be that as <em>it </em>may, however, the case is clearly, in favour of the defendant, upon the testimony; for the plaintiff does not prove, that he ever saw, or heard of <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>powers before he sold the corn to him. But, if he had, those powers did not authorise <em>Hunter </em>to draw the bills in question: For, it does not appear that, the contract was upon the account of <em>Blane; </em>so far from it, his name is not even mentioned in the agreement, hut the stipulation is for bills on <em>London, </em>generally, to be endorsed by <em>Batten </em>and <em>Dalrytnple, </em>without mentioning on whom they were to be drawn: A circumstance, which plainly shews, that <em>Blane </em>was not considered as the person on whose account the contract was made; otherwise, it is not conceivable, why his name was omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">This, however, is not all. There are other circumstances which have considerable weight in determining, that i! was a transaction between <em>Hunter </em>and the plain tiff, upon the credit of <em>Hunter </em>only. For, it appears that, when <em>Batten </em>\u00bf\u00a1\u2019 <em>Dalrympte </em>refused to endorse, the plaintiff had it in contemplation to stop the delivery of the corn, until the bill of lading was assigned to him; which certainly would not have happened, had he relied upon \u00a1ho credit of <em>Blane. </em>Besides, that charge is exploded by other circumstances; for, in his letter of the 38d of ,LIprfl, 1700, he intimates, that the bills of others, endorsed by Hunter. would be received: which shews, that, his ooufi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>dence was in <em>Hunter </em>himself: And, therefore, after the bills were returned protested, he is found enquiring how he could secure himself, as <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>affairs were deranged.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">These circumstances plainly prove, that the credit was not given to <em>Plane, </em>but to <em>Hunter: </em>and that the plaintiff relied on other securities for indemnity, in case his confidence in <em>Hunter </em>should turn out to have been misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">But the case of <em>Hooe &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Oxley &amp;c. </em>1 Wash. 19, is relied upon by the counsel for the appellee, as establishing <em>Blanc\u2019s </em>responsibility. That case carried the principle far enough, and we are not disposed to push it any further. It is sufficient, therefore, to remark, that the analogy between the two cases is not so great, as the counsel supposes; for, there, the correspondence held out an idea, that <em>Ponsonby\u2019s </em>bills would be honored to any extent; whereas, nothing of that kind appears in the present case: Of course, the authority of that case is not so decisive, as the counsel for the appellee represents.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The general rule is, that to charge the principal, the agency must be proved to be universal, or the power must be explicitly given. For, if the power is limited to a particular object, it is a mere relation between merchant and factor; and the latter must act within the pale of his authority, or the principal is not bound. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Blane, </em>1 Call, 361. But here, the agency is not pretended to be universal, and the power was limited to a particular object, which not being attended to, the correspondent could create no responsibility in the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">A doctrine, contrary to this, would be ruinous to commerce. For, then, if a merchant, in one country, ord\u00e9red goods from another, he would be liable to the manufacturers and shop-keepers, wlio furnished thorn, although he had no communication with them, and there was no confidence existing, or intended to exist between them and him; his engagement being confined to his own correspondent personally, without the least thought of extending it further. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">Upon the whole, the transactions between the plaintiff and <em>Hunter </em>appear to have been of a private nature; and founded on the credit of the latter only. Of course, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>is no ground for charging <em>Rhine; </em>and, therefore, the decree is to be reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-14\">[* See <em>Paterson </em>et al. v.
