The motion was continued from Court to Court until <em>November, </em>1798, when the defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit </em>and the act of limitations; to which the plaintiff replied generally. The County Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; and the defendant appealed to the District Court, where the judgment of the County Court was reversed: From which judgment of reversal, <em>Lee </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-5\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-6\">Under the circumstances of the present case, the act of limitations would not have been a bar in an action; for, there were not five years during which there were proper characters to sue and be sued; and the Sheriff was but a trustee, in whose favor the act of limitations never runs. These objections apply with greater force in the case of a <em>motion.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-8\"><em>Smith, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-9\">There are two questions in this case. 1st. Whether the act of limitations applies to a motion ? 2d. If so, whether there was a sufficient lapse of time in the present instance to bar the motion ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASE\">That the act does apply in the case of a motion, is proved by the decision of the Court in the case of <em>The Auditor </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>1 Call, 475. The Legislature by giving the plaintiff a summary remedy, could never have intended to vary the rights of the defendant, or deprive him of any defence, which he might have set up to the action. It could never have been their intention that what would be a good plea to one suit, should no.t be a good plea to another suit for the same thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Upon calculation it will be found, that there was an aggregate of five years, during which there was a competent person to sue and be sued. On both grounds, therefore, the judgment was right; and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-6\">LYONS, Judge, to <em>Warden. </em>Is there any case where a motion of this kind has been allowed against executors ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-7\">\n<em>Warden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aex\">I do not recollect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-8\">\n<em>Cur. \u00e1dv. mill.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b211-9\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AEA\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the judgment of the District Court was to be reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed; because, this Court considered the act of limitations as not applying, inasmuch as the plaintiff might have sued the Sheriff\u2019s bond; and, as that right of action was still existing, it could not be true that the act of limitations would bar the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
