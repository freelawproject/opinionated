The bill alledges, that the plaintiff gave his bond for the 2,500/.; but, that <em>Willis </em>never paid the 15,000/. or gave his bond for the 10,000/. Notwithstanding which,, he had assigned the plaintiff\u2019s bond to <em>Brachan, </em>who had instituted a suit upon it at common law; and, therefore, the bill prayed an injunction. The answer of <em>\u2022Willis </em>states, that he paid 8,000/. of the 15,000/. to the plaintiff\u2019s order, and the other 7,000/. to the plaintiff himself; who first agreed to take <em>Mayo\u2019s, </em>but afterwards actually accepted <em>Dixon\u2019s </em>bond for the 10,000/. The answer of <em>Brachan </em>says, that the assignment was for a valuable consideration; and that the plaintiff made no objection to the bond for several years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">The Court of Chancery being of opinion, that the plaintiff was only liable for the value of the 10,000/. in <em>May, </em>1781, dissolved the injunction, as to that value, with interest, and made it perpetual as to the residue. From which decree, <em>Brachan </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-7\">There is a difference between a man\u2019s coming into a Court of Equity, as a defendant or a plaintiff, when the object is to set aside, or enforce an agreement. For, the Court will refuse to set aside a contract, when it would not decree a specific performance. <em>Brachan </em>has obtained a judgment at law; and, therefore, his right must prevail, unless the plaintiff in Chancery proves a superior equity. There is nothing in the case which tends to shew, that the parties did not contract on equal terms. <em>Willis </em>is a defendant in equity, and asks nothing. Therefore, the plaintiff must prove a better \u2018title, or he cannot succeed. <em>[Browning </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>] Cowp. 790. No inequality of situation in the parties has ever been insisted on; and, of course, there is no cause to impeach the contract, upon that ground. There was no inequality of price; but, if there was, that would not be sufficient to set aside the contract. [<em>Willis </em>v. Jernegan,] 2 Atk. 251; <em>Fonbl. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Treat. Eq. 116, [127, 2d <em>Am. </em>ed.;] for, if an agreement is fair at first, equity will not set it aside, upon the happening of any future event. <em>[Mortimer </em>v. Capper,] 1 Bro. C. C. 156. Both parties are to be put in the same situation, as if the contract had been fulfilled. The bill charges, that the 15,000/. was not received; but, the answer, which is responsive, expressly alleges that it was; and the receipt is referred to. <em>Griffin </em>was not to execute his bond for the 2,500/. until the 10,000/. was paid; and, therefore, the presumption is, that it was paid, as the bond for 2,500/. was actually given. The answer must either be taken to be true, or not resorted to at all. <em>Brochan </em>is an assignee without notice of any equity, if there was any; and he was suffered to retain it for ton years, without any information relative to it. <em>Willis\u2019s </em>letter, concerning the assignment, must, relate to that, which was made to <em>Brochan. Griffin </em>comes into equity to set aside the contract; and, therefore, he is not entitled to relief, further than the terms of the agreement; that is to say, to set off the value of the 10,000/. against the 2,500/. bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">The contract was not fulfilled by <em>Willis </em>himself; and, therefore, he has no right to insist, upon performance, on the other side. It makes no difference that <em>Griffin </em>is plaintiff; because, he had no other redress. Nothing over was paid for the 2,500/.; and, therefore, <em>Brochan </em>cannot he. entitled to it. The giving the bond is no proof of it; for, the articles of agreement required the bond to be given in <em>May, </em>1780, and the 10,000/. was not to be paid until <em>May, </em>1781. Added <em>to </em>which, it is unquestionably true, that there is no evidence that the 10,000/. was ever paid. <em>Mayo\u2019s </em>bond was never agreed to be taken; and <em>Dixon\u2019s </em>tender docs not establish it. The money never was tendered; but, if it, was, it was not done in time; nor the money kept; so that <em>Willis </em>sustained no injury. The contract was, In feet, a wagering bargain. It makes no difference that <em>Brochan </em>is an assignee; for, ho took the bond, subject to all equity against it. <em>Willis\u2019s </em>letter to <em>Griffin </em>proves nothing; for, <em>Griffin </em>was not bound te\u00bb communicate with <em>Brachan, </em>until the latter applied to him, upon the subject. The guarded answer of <em>Brachan </em>leads to a suspicion, that lie was acquainted with the cir= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>cumstances of the case; especially, as it appears that he had an indemnity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-9\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-10\"><em>Griffin </em>got what he bargained for; and, therefore, cannot complain. The object of the plaintiff is to dissolve the contract, merely on the ground of its being a bad bargain, in event. <em>Griffin </em>agreed to take the money in <em>Dixon\u2019s </em>hands; and he tendered it. Of course, it was <em>Griffin\u2019s </em>own fault if it was not paid. If paper money had appreciated, <em>Griffin </em>would have had the benefit; and, consequently, there is no hardship in obliging him to stand by the depreciation. The silence of <em>Griffin </em>for so long a time after the assignment to <em>Brachan, </em>amounts to a concealment, which operates to his own prejudice, and not to that of <em>Brachan. </em>The answer of <em>Brachan </em>contains nothing, which leads to the suspicion contended for, upon the other side. The indemnity makes no difference: for, that was only to guard against a failure in circumstances, and not of obligation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-11\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b398-12\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AzS\">This was a contract <em>between Griffin </em>and <em>Willis; </em>whereby, the former agreed to give his bond for 2,500/. specie, payable ata distant day; on consideration whereof, the latter agreed to pay him 15,000/. paper money, on or before the 4th of <em>May, </em>1780, and give his bond for the further sum of 10,000/. payable on or before the 4th of <em>May, </em>1781; with a proviso, that the former might declare the bargain void, or not, if the'latter failed in payment on the 4th of <em>May, </em>1780.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The first sum was paid by <em>Willis, </em>shortly after the day; the acceptance whereof, by <em>Griffin, </em>is deemed a renunciation of his power to revoke, reserved by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">As between <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Willis, </em>in the event which has happened of the abolition of the paper currency, the general scale would have been resorted to, as at the time of the contract for the ascertainment of the value of the paper money, had not an agreed rate of depreciation been in the contemplation of the parties. That rate, as evinced by the contract itself, and the testimony, was ten for one. <em>Willis, </em>then, would have been liable to <em>Griffin, </em>under the decisions of this Court, for the very sum in specie, (as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>agreed value of the paper at the time,) which his assignee is now claiming from <em>Griffin </em>upon his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">Where, then, is the inequality of ihis contract ? Rul the matter did not rest here. <em>Willis </em>substituted a bond of <em>Dixon, </em>for the 10,000/. for which he paid the money, and which terminated the business between him and <em>Griffin, </em>by consent of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">If that bond has been paid off to him, in paper or in specie, according to the legal scale, (the agreed one being relinquished by him by the effect of that transaction,) it is nothing to <em>Willis </em>or his assignee, the former having complied with the agreement on his pail.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The,re is, then, certainly no inequality or iniquity in the transaction, which should affect <em>Brachan </em>the assignee for valuable consideration, and without notice of any objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">I think, therefore, that the injunction ought to be dissolved.</p>\n<author id=\"b399-7\">FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AcA\">The contract in this case, was founded upon speculation on both sides. <em>Griffin </em>thought, the present use of the money would be advantageous to him; and <em>Willis, </em>that it would he more beneficial to receive the specie at a distant day. The contract seems to have been fully understood by the parties; and to have been fairly entered into upon both sides. In its origin, then, there was no objection to it; and the only question is, whether it has been performed. The bill states, that the 15,000/. were not paid; nor the bond given for the 10,000/.; although the plaintiff executed his bond for the <em>2,5001. </em>specie.\" To say nothing of the improbability of a man\u2019s giving his bond without the equivalent, the bill is expressly contradicted by the answer and several documents in the cause; which prove a substantial fulfilment upon the part of <em>Willis; </em>who, therefore, was entitled to demand performance from the other party, however unfavourable the contract may have eventually proved to <em>Griffin: </em>Of course, <em>Brachan, </em>who now represents him, has the same right to the specie; and, therefore, there is not the slightest ground for the injunction, which ought f.o be wholly dissolved, and the bill dismissed,</p>\n<author id=\"b399-8\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ATU\">This was a mere speculation upon the paper currency of the country. <em>Griffin </em>attached avalu\u00e9 to the present-use of \u00ab considerable sum of it: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>Willis </em>calculated that it would be better to part with it, and receive specie for it at a more distant period. Both of them acted fairly in making the contract, and, there is nothing to taint or impeach it, if it has been complied with by <em>Willis. </em>The bill alledges, that he did not comply; but the answer contradicts it; and that receives considerable support from the documents in the cause: Which, taken together, very clearly establish, that the contract has been substantially performed, on the part of <em>Willis; </em>and, consequently, no reason can be adduced, why <em>Griffin </em>should not be held to a fulfilment, upon his part also. I am therefore of opinion, that the decree ought to be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b400-9\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ARl\">The case appears to me, to be a very plain one against Griffin, who entered into a fair contract, which has been substantially fulfilled by the other party, and, consequently, he can have no pretext for not performing it himself. I concur, therefore, that the decree ought to be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
