The Court of Chancery decided in favour of the sons, and Read, who had married the widow, appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant..</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">The residuary clause clearly passed the reversion in the slaves given to the testator\u2019s wife for life. The word <em>estate, </em>is <em>genus generalissimum, </em>and passes the whole interest. 19 <em>Vin </em>Abr. 222; <em>Co. Lit. </em>345. If this construction be not adopted, then the reversion will not pass, although the testator has declared his intention to dispose of the whole of his estate. In <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Clayborn, </em>1 Wash. 262, an estate for life, in slaves, was given with a general residuary clause of the remainder of his estate, and it was held that the residuary clause carried the reversion, and this is confirmed by the doctrine in <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>M\u2019Roberts </em>et ux. 1 Wash. 96. That the tenant for life, in the present case, was one of the devisees, will make no difference; because, still the residuary clause is broad enough to embrace the reversion. The affidavit of the subscribing witness will not help the appellee, as it was <em>ex parte, </em>and made when those interested were not present to cross-examine. Besides, if regularly taken, it would be inadmissible to destroy the effect of the words of the will. <em>Pow. </em>on Dev. 518. Which clearly proves that parol evidence cannot be received in a case like this.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-10\"><em>Nicholas, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-11\">The word <em>estate </em>may be confined to the subject of the devise, and does not necessarily, in all cases, include the interest. It is, therefore, an equivocal expression, and, according to Mr. <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>own book, <em>Pow. </em>on Dev., may be explained by parol evidence. Besides, it is intended to supply a clause which was accidentally left out. It appears, from the general complexion of the bill, an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>swcr aud will, that there was other estate to satisfy the residuary clause; and then it falls within the influence of <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>M\u2019Roberts </em>et ux. 1 Wash. 96: Which expressly takes that distinction; for, the residuary clause there was held to be satisfied by the other property. This is confirmed by tlie doctrine in <em>Cole v. Clayborn, </em>1 Wash. 262: Which, rightly understood, is a case in our favour. The devise is of the property he should leave at his death; which means not an ideal reversion, but such as was susceptible of a division. This construction is to be preferred, because it is consistent with the disposition made by the testator of the rest of his slaves; and, because the whole complexion of the will- shews, that the testator only intended a provision for his wife during her life, and that his children should have the residue. The affidavit having been made <em>ex parte, </em>will make no difference; as the witness is dead and could not be examined.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-5\">The reversion is as capable of division as the slaves themselves: Of course, there is no reason for excluding it from the operation of the residuary clause. Besides, there is no proof in the record that there was any other property to satisfy the residuary devise. None of the cases prove, that parol evidence may be received in such a case as this; or, that a new clause may be added to the will, by evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-7\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vull.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-15\">[* See Post, <em>Crump </em>v.
