The caveator states his own claim to Ik: founded upon an entry for 50 acres, made the 7th of <em>February, </em>1797, by virtue of part of two warrants, viz. <em>25 </em>acres, part of a Land Office treasury-warrant of 2,000 acres, issued to Col. <em>William M\u2019 Williams, </em>8th <em>May, </em>1783, and 25 acres, part of a pre-emption warrant of 1,000 acres issued lo <em>John Goodwin, </em>jr. 28lh March, 1782.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-4\">Upon the trial of the cause, in the District Court, the parties agreed a case, which stated: That on the 7th of <em>\u2022dugust, </em>1783, a treasury-warrant issued to <em>Henry Sanies </em>for 58,400 acres, which is set forth in <em>hsec verba. </em>That on the 11 Hi of <em>May, </em>1784, an entry was made with the surveyor of <em>Monongalia, </em>comity, in the words and figures following: \u201c <em>Cap\u00ed. </em>George Jackson, <em>for </em>Henry Banks, <em>enters a Land Office treasury-warrant of </em>58,400 <em>acres, beginning at the mouth of the \u25a0west fork where it empties into the </em>Tyger Valley <em>river, and extending up the fork to </em>Simpson\u2019s <em>creek.\u201d </em>That the laud lying about the confluence of the rivers mentioned in that entry had been appropriated by settlements between the said rivers, and have been patented upon such settlements. That in the year 1785, <em>Henry Banks </em>caused several surveys to be executed upon that entry for upwards of 13,000 acres, leaving the residue nnsurveyed, beginning between the rivers mentioned in the said entry above the lands granted to settlers, without including the same, or commencing at the beginning of the said entry, and extending up the west fork, towards and nearly to the mouth of <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, and in the forks of the said rivers, and obtained patents for the same. That these .surveys were made after the division of <em>Monongalia </em>county: which took place in consequence of the, act of 1784, and thereby the lands in controversy fell into <em>Harrison </em>county. That after the said division, the surveyor of <em>Monongalia </em>transmitted a copy of the said entry to the surveyor of <em>Harrison </em>county, who received the same, and, through mistake, entered it on his books as of the 7th of <em>May, </em>1784. That on the 7th of <em>February, </em>1797, <em>Daniel Martin </em>made an entry with the surveyor of <em>Harrison </em>county, in the following words: <em>\u201c Daniel Martin </em>enters 50 acres, part of two warrants, viz. 25 acres. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>part, of a Land Office treasury-warrant of 2,000 acres, No. 15,721, issued to \u2018Col. <em>William M\u2019 Williams, </em>the 8th of <em>May, </em>1783, and 25 acres, part of a pre-emption warrant of 1,000 acres, No. 2,412, issued to <em>John Goodwyn, </em>jr. the 28th <em>March, </em>1782, on waters of <em>Booth </em>creek, beginning adjoining the land of <em>John Martin, </em>and with his lines to join lands of <em>Thomas Clare, </em>thence to join lands of <em>William Tucker </em>and <em>George Wiseman; </em>which warrants were filed with the surveyor at'the time of making the entiy. That, in the year 1797, <em>Henry Banks </em>caused a number of other surveys to be executed upon the said entry, and assigned the same to the said <em>James Currie; </em>among which, the survey caveated was one. That the quantity of 58,400 acres cannot be obtained in the forks of the rivers before mentioned, by including all the lands as far up as the mouth of <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, and extending the same distance up the <em>Tyger Valley </em>river, that quantity being sufficient to take almost all the land between the said river and <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, almost as far up as the sources of the said creek. That the warrant, on which the 58,400 acres were entered for, was lodged with the surveyor of <em>Monongalia, </em>at the time of making the entry. That the caveator\u2019s survey, or a part of it, is contained within the bounds of the survey caveated against. That the caveator made a survey, on his entry, upon the 8th of <em>August, </em>1798.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">Upon this caso the District Court gave judgment in favor of <em>Martin; </em>and <em>Currie </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-5\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amv\">The entry is sufficiently certain; because it has a certain beginning, which is all that can be done in new countries, where there is nothing by which to describe fixed and ascertained limits with precision. The land entered for, is described to be within certain natural boundaries. For, the two rivers are to be pursued until the <em>Monongalia </em>comes to <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, and then along <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, until, if extended, it would strike the <em>Tyger Valley </em>river; because the lines were plainly to close some how or other; and that <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek should form the connecting line, was the most natural and fair interpretation of the terms of the entry. It would be no objection to say, that this might possibly contain more land than the entry called for; because, every entry is liable to the same objection; but, no entry was ever avoided upon that ground. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The great reason for requiring certainty in the entry <em>is, </em>that other persons may be enabled to locate without dif\u00edicully. But, in the present case, any other person might easily have located by this entry. For, lie would have had a certain beginning and natural boundaries, about which there coaid be no mistake: In which respects the entry is <em>much more cerium than </em>that of <em>Field </em>v. <em>Culbreath, 2 </em>Call, 517, the other day, where there was no beginning, and <em>the </em>survey did not even include several of the lines expressed in the entry; yet it was held sufficient. This is in the true spirit of the law, which does not require a mathematical certainty, hut a general description and a reasonable degree of certainty. <em>Hunter </em>et al. v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Call, 206, in this Court. For, the law does not suppose that the exact boundaries can be given by 1,lie locator, but plainly intends that they shall be ascertained by the surveyor. In other words, the law intends some things to he done by the locator, and <em>others by the surveyor; that </em>is to say, the locator is to name the place, and the surveyor is to take care of the boundaries. Therefore, it is made the duty of the survey- or, and not of the locator, to see to the length and breadth of the plat, which plainly shews that the Legislature intended that the surveyor should ascertain the metes and boundaries, and not the locator, who is only to describe the situation as well as he can.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">Hence, in practice, no survey, perhaps, has ever been found to agree precisely with the entry, as was proved in a remarkable degree in the case of <em>Field </em>v. Culbreath, The Laud Office has been examined, and few entries are found to contain more certainty than the present. So, that as well upon principle as upon a fair interpretation of the law and the practice of the country, the entry must be deemed sufficiently certain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-10\">The next enquiry then, will be, whether, as it appears that, there were prior patents for some of the lands included within \u00a1.he entry, that circumstance will render the entry void? And it is extremely clear that it will not. For, it does not injure the rights of the prior settlers at ail, because their prior patents would always be a sufficient defence, and a subsequent patent would avail nothing against, them. Consequently, there can be no reason for obliging the locator to go through the immense labor and difficulty of laying a large warrant on the separate parcels, when a general entry might serve every purpose as well. Besides, in point of fact, it often has happened, and must hereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of necessity, frequently happen, that an entry does include some of the lands belonging to some other person; yet no entry was ever avoided for that reason. On the contrary, the case of <em>Wolcott </em>et al. v. <em>Swan, </em>2 Call, 298, in this Court, may be considered as an express authority in favor of the entry. Because, in that case there were a great number of prior patentees within the bounds of the entry, and the decree directed those parcels to be expunged, and the entry stood for the balance, which is decisive of the principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKh\">A third question, which indeed grows out of that just discussed, is, whether the first survey did not satisfy the entry, so as to put it out of the power of <em>Banks </em>to make a second survey, upon the same entry ? Or, in other words, whether he could survey one parcel, then another, and so on <em>toties quoties, </em>until his warrant was exhausted and his whole quantity completed ? That such separate surveys may be made, seems necessarily to follow from the principles laid down in considering the last question For, wherever there are inclusive prior settlements, there must be separate surveys, or you can never tell when the locator has got his quantity: So that the public might either grant more than enough, or the patentee receive less than he was entitled to. The moment, therefore, it is admitted that the entry may include prior grants, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that there may be several surveys. For, the quantity of unappropriated land cannot otherwise be ascertained. Besides, the great object of the locator was to get the quantity of the land expressed in the entry; and, therefore, the separate surveys will be considered as a continuation of the same operation, in order to effect it. In other words, they will be considered as parts of a whole, which could not be completed without those distinct operations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-9\">It is no objection to say, that by this means large bodies of land may be engrossed by men unable to survey; or, worse still, that very large quantities of land may be protected against future locations, although the quantity really entered for will fall far short of that circumscribed by the entry. Because, the surveyor may be called on to appoint a time, and give notice when he will survey; which, if not attended to, will avoid the entry, and entitle the subsequent locator; but, if attended to, will immediately ascertain the quantity and boundaries.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Warden, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-3\">The entry was not special enough; for the boundaries are. indefinite, and described with no precision: Since, if it be true, that <em>Banks </em>might, go up one side, of the fork to <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, yet nothing is said about the course which he is to take afterwards. Therefore, although it should even be admitted that be may go up the <em>west </em>side of <em>the fork, </em>that is the <em>Monongalia, to Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, yet that does not decide where he is to stop on the <em>Tyger Valley </em>river; for, it does not appear where the creek <em>connects them; </em>and, from a view of the plat, it is extremely probable that it never does connect them at all: So, that although there may be an ultimate point on the <em>Monongalia, </em>yet there is none on'the <em>Tyler Valley. </em>Of course, the entry cannot ho, said to contain space; or to circumscribe any particular portion of land. Thcrcfoi\u2019e, although it may be true, that if the entry had, in fact, contained more land than the warrant called for, it would nevertheless be good, provided the land entered for bad been accurately described and bounded; yet, as for want of a back, or connecting line, there is no .such description or definite boundary, the entry is essentially defective. Besides, it appears that the beginning was on private land, and the plain words and intention o\u00ed\" the law was, that the location should be made on waste and unappropriated land altogether. In which view of the case, the inclusive patents were perhaps sufficient to avoid <em>the entry. </em>But, the first survey certainly satisfied the whole entry; for, it never could have been the intention of the law to allow of <em>any number </em>of surveys; and the fair presumption is, that when the locator has made a survey, he has specially designated the very land which lie meant to appropriate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-4\"><em>Doddridge, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApR\">This Court has no jurisdiction of the case. The act of 1779, [c. 13, \u00a7 3, 10 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>58,] directs that <em>ca'ueals </em>shall be tried in the General Court, and that the judgment there, shall be final. Therefore, when the District Court law gives the same proceedings in cases of caveat to the .District Courts as the General Court theretofore had, it follows, that the judgment of fhe District Court is to be final loo; and, consequently the general clause, relative to appeals, will not give an appellate jurisdiction to this Court, in cases of that kind. Which is the more evident from this circumstance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>that in \u00a7 6 of tlie District act, (which declares the jurisdiction of those Courts,) mills, wills and roads are coupled with caveats; but, in the section relating to appeals, mills, wills and roads only, are mentioned; and nothing said about caveats: which looks as if the Legislature had designedly' omitted it, on the ground that the judgment of the District Court, in conformity to that of the General Court formerly, was to be final; and that no appeal was intended to lie from it. Besides, the Clerk is to certify all determinations of the District Courts to the Register; but, nothing is said as to the determinations of this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abi\">The entry is not special enough, as it does not describe all the boundaries; which ought to be done. For, a description of the <em>beginning </em>is not enough; but the locator ought to mark out the lines along which he means the survey shall proceed; and, although it is urged that'this would be difficult in many cases, that does not exclude the necessity of it; since a general description of lines is not impracticable, but may be done with some degree of accuracy. If this be not necessary, the consequence will be, that all future locators will be in danger, or unable to tell where, or how to make their entries; because it will be impossible to know the extent and boundaries of the prior locations. The practice in making entries, when it is opposed to the positive requisition of the act of Assembly, proves nothing; but, if it was important to consider the practice, it would be found to be in our favor: For no entry, so uncertain as this, ever has been contended for. <em>Hunter </em>et al. v. <em>Hall, </em>[1 Call, 206,] turned upon other grounds, and the Inferior Courts have uniformly decided otherwise. So, that if the present entry is sustained, the inconvenience will be incalculably great; and innumerable titles will be shaken. It is monstrous, to call that a sufficient description of boundaries, which cannot be said to express more than a single line; for the distance up the <em>Tyger Halley </em>river is not attempted to be described, nor does it appear that <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek would, if infinitely extended, ever connect the two rivers. In point of fact, it is believed not to do so. Hence, it is impossible to maintain, that the entry contains any parcel of land in particular; and, therefore, it does not satisfy the law, which requires a reasonable precision; and such an accurate description, as that future locators may know how to make their entries, with some degree of certainty. Large and uncertain entries of this kind are contrary to the policy of the law; because it precludes poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00a1non from an opportunity of making entries, and acquiring .settlements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-4\">Une survey satisued the entry; lor several surveys cannot be executed on the same entry. The law no whore pays they may; hut. the language of the ad always supposes a single survey; And, if practice ho resorted to, more than one survey upon the same entry, never lias been made, The necessity of these separate surveys aids-our \u00a1wgumeiit concerning the uncertainty of the entry; because it shows, that the very certainty contended for ou the other side, was only got <em>by </em>surveys and acts ulterior to the entry itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">But the entry, if originally good, was forfeited for want of an earlier survey. The act of <em>October </em>session, 1784, c. 18, p. 7, [c. 9, 11 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>441,] required surveys previous thereto, to be made before the first of the following <em>February; </em>and future surveys to bo made within one. <em>year from </em>the date of the entry. This act was in part re pealed by the act of 1785, c. 41, p. 31, [12 <em>Stat. Larg. 91). </em>] which requires a previous notice <em>by </em>the surveyor, but then the owner of the entry is <em>to </em>appoint an agent, in the county, and to give notice thereof to the surveyor; and on failure, his entry is to become void. Therefore, as the appellant has not shewn such appointment and notice, his entry must be taken to have become void, according to the true construction of this act. But, by the act of 1786, c. 11, p. 14, [12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>266,] the time for appointing such agent, and giving notice thereof, was extended for two years from the. passing of the act of 1786; and by the act of 1788, c. 21, p. 13, [12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>679,] for two years more; after which it was no longer continued; and, therefore, the indulgence expired in the year 1790. For, the act of 1790, p. 8, [13 Stat. <em>Larg. </em>120,] relates only to failures to return the surveys, and to entries of another kind; which is likewise true of the acts of 1791, c. 4, p. 5, [13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>247, ] and 1792, c. 7, p. 31, [13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>402.] And although c. 8, in the same page, allows two years longer to make surveys, yet that will not save the forfeiture, on account of the failure to appoint the. agent; Of course, it does not save the entry in this case. The <em>rumo </em>observation applies to the acts of 1794, c. 11, \u00a7 2, p. 9, of <em>1795, </em>c. <em>9, </em>\u00a7 6, p. 15, and of 1796, c. 47, p. 29. So, that the failure to appoint the agent within the time prescribed, is not provided for; and, therefore, the entry of <em>Banks was </em>void for that reason.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-3\">This Court clearly has cognizance of the case: For, the District Court certainly has jurisdiction; and, by the laws constituting this Court, a general right of appeal to this tribunal, from the judgments of the District Courts, is given to the citizen in all cases: So that, as caveats are not excepted, it follows that they are included also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-4\">The entry is sufficient. For. reasonable certainty, or certainty to a common intent, is enough. Mathematical precision cannot be required. It is not material that the bottom line does not connect the two rivers. For, when the two side lines were given, the other could b\u00e9 found; and all that is required, is, that the locator shall so lay his warrant as that future locators may be enabled to lay theirs with safety; which is done here. The bottom line could not be described, without a survey; and, therefore, to say that it was necessary to describe it, is to contend that a survey should always precede an entry. Whenever the surveyor has gone up the forks, at equi-distances, so as to obtain 58,000 acres expressed in the warrant, he has arrived at the bottom line, and determines the ultimate points of the entry; observing, however, not to go beyond <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek on either side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-5\">ROANE, Judge. You say that quantity will give the bottom line: If so, and there be not the quantity of vacant land within those equi-distant points you speak of, can you go beyond them in order to obtain the amount in your warrant? For, if so, do you not contend, that in one case the figure will be bounded by one bottom line, and in the other by another?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ard\">My meaning is, that the figure shall be certainly bounded by the equi-distant points; and, if there be not a sufficient quantity of vacant land in it, that we cannot go beyond those points to seek for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\">That the entry includes vacant land does not prejudice it; for that frequently happens, and never was objected to; which answers the objection that the entry begins on patented land; for, if any part of it may be on patented land, the beginning may be so too: And, in point <em>of practice, it </em>has frequently been done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-8\">One survey did not satisfy the entry; and others might be made afterwards. This, which is a dictate of reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>is corroborated by the language of the act of Assembly; for, that supposes various surveys upon the-same warrant: which is convenient to the holder of the warrant; and prejud\u00edeos nobody. In this point too, the practice agrees with the reason of the thing, the fair interpretation of the act, and the convenience of the party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-6\">The observation that there is danger, from this doctrine, that large tracts may be protected against subsequent entries, by persons unable to survey, is incorrect; because, the surveyor may he called on to give notice; and, therefore, the inconvenience, if any, may be easily avoided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-7\">The length of time, between the entry and survey, is not material, if the acts of Assembly be fairly considered; but, upon that point, Mr. <em>Randolph, </em>who follows me, will speak at large.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ati\">The Court has jurisdiction.

It would have been impossible to state the hounds more particularly, in a country, at that time probably filled with hostile tribes of Indians. It is enough to give a general description of the place, and it is the business of the surveyor to ascertain the lines with precision; which is proved by the remark, that it is made his duty, by the act, to see to the length and breadth. The. meaning of the entry was, that they should begin at the confluence, and go up the forks, as far as <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek, for quantity; and, that is the usual course in business of this kind. It was not necessary to say in the entry, that they were to go across from the mouth of <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>creek to <em>Tyger Valley </em>river; for, that was implied; and, if the entry had said so expressly, a future locator would have been no wiser, than without it. The entry, therefore, was precise enough; and of course; the objection upon that ground, will not avail the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-12\">The length of time does not forfeit the entry, as no notice to survey was given. The act of 1785, altered that of 1784, as to the time; and, if <em>Banks </em>failed to appoint an agent, as that act required, it was matter of evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ought to have been shewn in the finding; but, as it is not, the Court would, if necessary, presume that it was done. But, this is unnecessary to be contended for; because, the continuing the acts of \u2019SS-\u201990-\u201991-\u201992-\u201994~\u201995 and \u201996, do completely save the entry; for their provisions are general; and contain no exceptions with regard to the appointment of agents.
