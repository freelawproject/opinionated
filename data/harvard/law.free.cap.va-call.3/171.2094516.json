The District Court gave judgment for the sum received, with 15 <em>per cent, </em>interest until paid. Prom which judgment, <em>Taylor </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-12\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-13\">This being a summary remedy, introduced by a statute, the statute is to be strictly observed. But, the act does no't give a motion on the bare <em>receipt </em>of the money without a <em>refusal </em>to pay. The plaintiff, therefore, in order to support his motion, ought to have shewn a refusal. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>was more necessary, if the 15 <em>per cent, </em>damages were recoverable; for, then, the day of <em>refusal </em>became important, in order to ascertain when the damages should commence. But, the act did not intend to subject the attorney to IS <em>per cent, </em>damages; for, the words are only, that he \u201cshall be proceeded against in a summary way, in the same <em>manner </em>as Sheriffs are liable to be proceeded against for money received on executions,\u201d without declaring that he shall be liable to any penalty: So that the word <em>manner, </em>relates merely to the mode of recovering the money received, and is not intended to create any penalty for the de - fault.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-8\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-9\">The notice was a demand and refusal; and, therefore, satisfied the act in that respect. As to the damages, they are to be awarded from the time the money ought to bo paid; and, as that could only be ascertained in the Court which rendered the judgment, this Court will presume that it was properly established there, nothing appearing to the contrary. \u2022</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-10\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-11\">The notice was not a demand and <em>refusal, </em>within the meaning of the act, which contemplates an actual demand of payment: But, this was merely notice for judgment, and a refusal, which, for any thing that appears, never existed; and it is not given by the client, in person, or by any body authorised to demand and receive payment. It ought to appear in the judgment, that there was a refusal, and at what time, in order that the Court might judge when the damages, if demandable, accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-12\"><em>Cur. adv. </em>vult.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-13\">LYONS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMq\">delivered the resolution of the Court, to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">That, as to the first point relative to the demand and refusal, there was no room for exception upon that ground; because the defendant, by appearing and contesting the claim, had rendered it unnecessary that further proof, with -regard thereto, should be stated in the record. But, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>respect to tlie second point, relative to the damages, the Court was clearly of opinion that the judgment, was erroneous; for, the .15 <em>percent, </em>damages are not given against an attorney by tlie act of Assembly, which merely relates to the notice and mode of conducting the cause, but does not create a penally. That, therefore, the judgment of the District Court was to he reversed, and judgment entered fbr the debt only. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\">[* See act <em>Feb. </em>18, 1819, c. <em>76, </em>\u00a7 9, R.
