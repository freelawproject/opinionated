The answer admitted dealings to a considerable amount, but alledged that <em>Brewer </em>had paid considerable sums of money and tobacco towards the discharge thereof, and had frequently solicited the plaintiff's factors and agents for a final settlement, which they did not comply with until the year 1774 or 1775, when one <em>Burt </em>pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>sented an account, which upon examination, the defendant found to be incorrect, and sets forth some credits which he claims. That, upon receipt of the account rendered by <em>Burt, </em>he went to <em>Petersburg </em>prepared to settle and discharge the balance, but, upon enquiry, found that the plaintiffs\u2019 agents had all left the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-3\">There are no documents or evidence filed in the cause, except a copy of the plaintiffs\u2019 account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-4\">The Court of Chancery referred the accounts to a Commissioner, who reported a balance of <em>2261. </em>13s. <em>8d. </em>due the plaintiffs, with interest from the 1st <em>September, </em>1775.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">No exception to this report was taken, either in the Commissioner\u2019s office or in the Court of Chancery; and that the Court confirming the report, decreed payment of the balance reported due, with interest as aforesaid. From which decree, the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-6\"><em>Duval, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">There was no evidence of the debt; for, the answer does not admit the amount, but merely that there had been dealings between the parties; and, therefore, the appellees were not entitled to a decree for any sum. However, be that as it may, the decree was clearly wrong in allowing interest during the war; as the plaintiffs were <em>British </em>subjects, who, by their own bill, shew that they were out of the Commonwealth; and the answer states, that the defendant was desirous of a settlement, but could not obtain it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-8\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-9\">The answer admits, that there were dealings and transactions, and only claims credit for some tobaccoes and grain; which virtually amounts to an admission, that the items stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 account were really furnished; especially, as the account is referred to, and made part of the bill. - Besides, upon the taking of the account before the Commissioner, the defendant appeared, his allegations were .heard, a report made, and no exception taken, either before the Commissioner or in the Court of Chancery. After which, it is too much to deny the existence of the debt. As to the question of interest, that is submitted to the judgment of the Court upon the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-13\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that there was no error in the decree as to the debt; but, that it was erroneous in allowing interest during the war, according to the case of <em>M</em>\u2019<em>Call </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call, 133, in this Court; and that the decree was likewise erroneous, in continuing the interest, after the date of the decree. That, consequently, the eight years during the war, were to be deducted, and the interest to be carried down to the time of the decree only, as was done in <em>Deans </em>v. <em>Scriba, 2 </em>Call, <em>415, </em>and <em>Deans </em>v. <em>Kunkall, </em>at the last term.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201c The Court is of opinion, that there is error in the said decree, in allowing to the appellees interest on the sum recovered, for the eight years during which the war continued between the <em>United States </em>and <em>Great Britain, </em>and during which, the appellees, who are <em>British </em>subjects, were non-residents within this Commonwealth, and no payment or tender could have been made to them; and, also, in continuing the interest to the time of payment instead of to the, time of the decree, and making the recovery to be of the aggregate of principal and interest. \u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">[* See notes to <em>M'Call </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>and <em>Deans </em>v. <em>Scriba.]</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
