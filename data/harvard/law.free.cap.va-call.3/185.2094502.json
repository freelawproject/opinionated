If, therefore, the said <em>Richard Noel </em>shall well and truly collect and receive all other fees and dues put into his hands to collect, and duly account for and pay the same to the officers to whom such fees are due, respectively at such times as are prescribed by law; and duly collect all taxes and dues imposed by law, and pay the same as the law directs; and shall well and truly execute and due return make of all process and precepts to him directed, and pay and satisfy all sums of money and tobacco by him received by virtue of any such process to the person or persons to whom the same are due, his or their executors, administrators or assigns, and in all other things shall truly and faithfully perform the said office of deputy Sheriff during the time of his continuance therein; and at all times hereafter indemnify them, the said <em>John Upshaw </em>and <em>William Fisher, </em>their heirs, executors and administrators, in every thing relating to the office of Sheriff; then the above obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d The declaration assigns a breach in not paying the <em>351. </em>and alledges generally, that the defendant had not performed any of the conditions of the bond.

That there was no <em>venue, </em>as the county was not stated either in the margin or the body of the declaration. 2.- That the breach was not sufficiently set forth, and the averment, with regard to the time during which there was to be a payment of the <em>351., </em>was not certain enough. 3. That greater damages are found than are laid in the declaration. 4. That the bond is void; because it was given for the sale of an office, which concerned the administration of justice. <em>R.

But at any rate the statute of <em>Jeofails </em>cures it. The breach is well enough laid, and there was no necessity to be more particular as to the <em>351. </em>That greater damages are found, in an action of this kind, than were laid in the writ, has been decided not to be error. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Elzey, 2 </em>Wash. 143. The act of 1793 does not render the bond void; for, there is an express exception in it, with regard to contracts between Sheriffs and their deputies; and the contract here, though in form, Between the deputies, was substantially between the Sheriff and <em>Noel; </em>because, the approbation of the Sheriff was necessary; and, therefore, it is within the reason and spirit of the proviso.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-5\"><em>Warden, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-6\">It was a contract between <em>Noel </em>and <em>Fisher, </em>that the latter should procure the Sheriff\u2019s permission that the former should become his deputy; which is sufficient to avoid the bond; for, it leads to extortion and oppression.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">[* It is remarkable, that this ease was argued ori the act of 1792, although the bond was dated in 1789.
