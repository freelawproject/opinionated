That <em>Benjamin Robinson, </em>the younger, took possession and died seised of the lands, and of a moiety of the mill, in tail; leaving <em>Benjamin Robinson </em>his eldest son and heir, who sold to the defendant. That <em>Joseph Robinson </em>conveyed his moiety of the mill to the plaintiff, in trust, to sell and pay his debts. And, therefore, the bill prays an account of a moiety of the profits of the mill, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-14\">The answer states, that the defendant has seen a deed, of the 10th of <em>February, </em>1757, to <em>Pe.ndle.ton, </em>(which he supposes is that spoken of in the bill,) and if it has conveyed any thing, in the said mill, <em>Pendleton </em>would have the legal estate: But, that it did not convey any thing; because <em>Benjamin Robinson </em>the elder, had before parted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>with the equitable estate therein, to <em>Benjamin Robinson </em>the younger.. That, the defendant has heard of a former suit in Chancery, respecting a moiety of <em>the mill; to </em>which he refers. That, the defendant bought the whole, from <em>Benjamin Robinson </em>the youngei', and has had quiet possession from the year 1783.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">The equitable right mentioned in the answer, was a claim under a marriage contract; concerning which, several depositions were taken in this suit, and one had been taken in the former suit mentioned in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">Among the exhibits are: 1.

At <em>December </em>Court, 1773, a commission was awarded to take the depositions of <em>.Anthony Thornton </em>and <em>Sarah Slaughter, </em>in the suit <em>Benjamin Robinson v. Joseph Robinson. </em>At <em>March, </em>1774, the bill was filed. .August, 1782, attachment for answer: After which, is a certificate of the present Clerk, that these were all the stops taken in that cause; and that no depositions appear to have been filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-4\">There is, also, a memorandum, stating, that <em>Thornton </em>was recommended as a Magistrate at <em>Caroline </em>September Court, 1776, and not before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">The County Court decreed a moiety of the mill and profits, to the plaintiff; from which decree, <em>Corbin </em>appealed to the High Court of Chancery: where the decree of the County Court was reversed; and from the decree of reversal, <em>Thornton </em>appealed to this Court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-6\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\">The appellant was, under all ihe circumstances, entitled to relief. <em>Thornton\u2019s </em>deposition was not admissible; for, as the suit between the <em>Robinsons </em>had never been decided, the deposition was never established by the judgment of any Court, and therefore, might be excepted to in this suit, in the same manner as it could in that: But, if so, then clearly it ought not to he read; because the commission to take it was improperly awarded, for it was before any bill was filed. <em>Old Virginia Laws, </em>177. And it appears by the testimony in the cause, that one of the commissioners who took it, was not a Magistrate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-8\"><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-9\">It is not absolutely necessary that the persons who execute commissions to\u2019take depositions should be Justices of the Peace, for any person may do it, if appointed by the commission. That no bill was filed, makes no difference; because the act of Assembly merely applies to commissions granted by the Clerk <em>ex debito justitise, </em>and not to such as are granted by the Court in session,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-10\"><em>Wickham, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAd\">The commission might be executed by a person not a Magistrate; and all foreign commissions are thus executed. That the hill was not filed is not material, as the case might have been urgent. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the act is affirmative, that the Clerk <em>may </em>grant, and not negative, that the Court <em>shall not </em>grant, a commission during term, unless the bill be filed. Besides, this exception was not taken at the hearing in the County Court. The Court of Equity had no jurisdiction, as the statute executed the use to the possession; and, therefore, an ejectment might have been brought. But, the deed to <em>Thornton </em>was clearly void, as <em>Joseph Robinson </em>was out of possession at the time of making it. Besides, <em>Joseph Robinson </em>ought to have been made a party to the suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aqkn\">Randolph, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">The Court of Equity had jurisdiction, because it was a trust, which alone conferred- jurisdiction. Besides, there was no plea in abatement, and therefore it is too late to object now; for, the act of Assembly precludes it. The point relative to <em>Joseph Robinson </em>being out of possession, is now under consideration of the Court, in <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>ante, p. 362. None but a Magistrate can execute commissions to take depositions within the State. The marriage contract, even had it been proved, is not recorded; and, therefore, is void against <em>Joseph Robinson.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-8\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9-\">He was a mere volunteer; and therefore has no superior equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-9\">\n<em>Randolph.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayn\">The act of Assembly only uses the word <em>purchaser, </em>and does not say for valuable consideration. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>1 Wash. 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b356-11\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AI_\">The weight of testimony in this cause being in favor of the appellee, independently of the testimony of <em>Anthony Thornton, </em>it is unnecessary to decide how far his deposition is admissible, or not, in consequence of its having been taken before a person who is alleged to have been no Magistrate. I shall barely remark, however, that this case differs from that of <em>Blincoe </em>v. <em>Berk</em>ley, 1 Call, 405, in that, here a commission was regularly awarded by the Court; the parties attended in pursuance, and as no objection was taken to the deposition at the time, it shall either be intended that <em>Anthony Thornton, </em>jun. was then a Magistrate, or that the parties agreed that the deposition might be taken before him. The certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>that that gentleman was not recommended to the <em>Governor </em>until a posterior time, is not conclusive evidence that he was not a Magistrate before; as it was, in so o instances probably the practice, to commission persons who had not been recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">I throw this out, however, only as my present impression. The testimony of Mrs. <em>S', </em>and <em>T. S. </em>go directly to establish a marriage agreement on the part of old Colonel <em>Robinson. </em>This was a most interesting fact for the family, and one which would have made an indelible impression. It is only confronted by the belief of Mr. <em>Pendleton, </em>that Mr. <em>Benjamin Robinson\u2019s </em>first knowledge of his title was derived from <em>him, </em>in or about the year, 1755; but as he does not speak from his memoranda at the time, it is probable he may be mistaken as to the year; and even if not, the pleasure discovered by old Mr. <em>Robinson </em>on the information received from him, may have arisen from his great reliance on the judgment and professional skill of that gentleman, and, consequently, may not be inconsistent with a knowledge on this subject previously derived from other sources. Admitting, then, this testimony to be as respectable as any whatever, yet it is overbalanced by that of the two witnesses before named; and their testimony is confirmed by that of <em>Barnes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Great stress was laid by Mr. <em>Randolph, </em>on the deed of 10th <em>March, </em>1757, for the <em>Orange </em>land, (by <em>B. R. </em>jun.) which he supposes contains a recognition of the deed of the 10th <em>February, </em>1757; but it only admits the fact, that <em>Benjamin </em>the father had before conveyed to him the <em>Caroline </em>land. This was probably from verbal information, as the deed of <em>February, </em>1757, was probably then in the <em>Caroline </em>office. It is certainly, however, by no means inferrible from the deed of <em>March </em>10, that that of <em>Februa,ry </em>had ever been seen by him; far less that, he was a party to it; and, if that deed varies from the terms of the marriage promise, it was not obligatory on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Mr. <em>Randolph </em>contended, that the marriage promise was void against purchasers under the act of Assembly, Admitting, (which cannot be denied,) that parol marriage agreements were then valid, according to this doctrine the <em>promiser </em>would have nothing to do but refuse to execute the deed, and then convey the land, which would defeat the promise. The admission, therefore, is inconsistent with the conclusion he draws. The intention of the act was certainly not of this kind; it was to compel persons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>wlio had written contracts or agreements, to record them for the information of others within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the case is a plain one, and that the decree of the <em>Chancellor </em>ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b358-9\">FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A1q2\">The first' question made at the bar, was, whether the marriage contract was established? And I am of opinion that it is. <em>Thornton\u2019s </em>deposition, which clearly proves it, is objected to, as having been illegally taken; but, besides that, if it wore necessary to investigate the point, it would perhaps turn out that the. objection is not well founded; there is ample testimony to support the contract.: For, the depositions of the two <em>S\u2019s </em>are full to that effect; they state (he circumstances with such precision as to leave no doubt upon the mind: and they contain nothing which is inconsistent with that of Mr. <em>F., </em>who like them, speaks merely from memory, and may have been mistaken as to dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">It is said, however, that even if the contract were proved, yet still it was destroyed by the deeds of <em>September, </em>1753, and <em>March, </em>1757: because, the first merged the parol contract, and the latter recognized the right of Joseph. But, I am of a different opinion: For, the object of that of <em>September, </em>was only to secure the <em>Orange </em>land to <em>Benjamin </em>the son, in case the moiety of <em>Page\u2019s </em>was not recovered; but as soon as that should be recovered, it was to be conveyed, and the other restored. Therefore, so far from this deed merging, it rather affirmed the marriage contract: And, with respect to that of <em>March, </em>it does not appear that <em>Benjamin </em>the son, if he meant to refer to the trust deed, had ever seen it or knew what it contained: for, he states it to be for 500 acres, without any restriction, although it gave him only 459 acres after the death of his father and mother, with a moiety instead of the whole of the mill; and even these were to be held in tail, instead of fee simple. Hence, it is plain, that if he did mean to refer to that deed, he was a stranger to its contents, and was deceived as to the purport of it: Which mistake, the father, never removed, but, on the. contrary, is said by one of the witnesses to have been in the habit, long after-wards, of speaking of the whole mill as belonging to <em>Benjamin </em>the younger, after his own death. Of course, no inference can be drawn from this supposed recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">But, then it is urged that the marriage contract, not having been recorded within the eight months, is void <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>against purchasers by the act of Assembly. <em>Old Edit. Eaws, </em>143. The purchasers meant in that act, however, are those for valuable consideration, and not mere volunteers. Of course, the argument does not apply to the present case. But, to remove this difficulty, it was said that the gift to <em>Joseph </em>was a provision for a younger sou, and that this was a good consideration. The observation at first sight, is plausible; but there is no force in it. For, besides that, <em>Joseph </em>was, in fact, the eldest and not the younger son, it appears by his deed of trust to the appellant, that his father had devised to him the <em>Moon?s-mount </em>estate, containing 1,100 acres, which was probably a better provision than that made for his brother <em>Benjamin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">There are other circumstances which have some weight; for, it seems that <em>Joseph </em>abandoning his claim under the deed of trust, relied upon the will to support, his right; that after <em>Benjamin </em>the grandson, sold to <em>Corbin, </em>he gave him possession in the presence of <em>Joseph, </em>and that the latter even turned his own miller out of the mill, and suffered <em>Corbin </em>to remain in quiet possession for several years, before he executed the deed to the plaintiff. This shews his own conviction on the subject, and serves to strength-oil his brother\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Upon the whole, I think the decree of the High Court of Chancery is right, and ought to bo affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b359-6\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">Concurred, that the decree of the High Court of Chancery should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
