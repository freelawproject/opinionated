That delicacy prevented him from pursuing the subject, he having received information from <em>Jonathan Williams, </em>(the son-in-law of <em>William Alexander,) </em>that they had made a contract with the <em>Farmers </em>for supplying them with tobacco. That this information, though incorrect in its full extent, terminated in <em>Morris\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>associating himself with <em>Williams </em>and <em>William Alexander </em>*n a conti\u2019act for 15,000 hogsheads <em>per annum, </em>fox three years, to be furnished to the <em>Farmers General. </em>That afterwards, in <em>January, </em>1785, a contract with the <em>Farmers General </em>was proposed to <em>Robert Morris; </em>which he confirmed in <em>April, </em>1785, for the shipment of 60,000 hogsheads of tobacco in the years 1785, 1786, and 1787. That <em>William Alexander </em>was to have a share in this contract, but its rate was not absolutely fixed,'though he entered upon the purchase of tobacco, with <em>Robert Morris\u2019s </em>funds, and continued <em>therein, until the 6th day </em>of <em>July, </em>1786; when he, <em>Robert Morris, </em>took upon himself the great loss sustained in the shipment of 2,000 hogsheads, which had been shipped upon an experiment, and agreed to give <em>William Alexander </em>a dollar <em>per </em>hogshead, for the 60,000 hogsheads, besides a certain commission, charges and allowance to sub-agents. That <em>Robert Morris </em>furnished necessary funds to a large amount; but <em>William Alexander </em>failed in his part of the contract, whereby <em>Robert Morris\u2019s </em>credit was ruined and himself impoverished. That <em>William Alexander </em>speculated with <em>Robert Morris\u2019s </em>funds, and made great profits to himself. That among the acquisitions, made with the funds of <em>Robert Morris, </em>were upwards of 56,000 dollars in military certificates, deposited by <em>John Tayloe Griffin </em>on account of a loan made by <em>William Alexander </em>to the said <em>Grffin, </em>by the express direction of <em>Robert Morris </em>himself, on whose proper account the transaction was. That <em>William Alexander </em>has refused to account, and pay the balance due to <em>Robert Morris, </em>and <em>to </em>deliver to him <em>the </em>eex'tificates aforesaid, of which <em>Robert Morris </em>is the owneiv Wherefore, <em>Robert Morris </em>prays that <em>William Alexander </em>may be compelled to pay the balance and deliver the cei\u2019tificates'.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">On the other hand, <em>William Alexander </em>insists, that his \u00ab\u2022edit and influence greatly contx-ibuted to the promotion of the contract with the <em>Farmers General; </em>and, if <em>Robert Morris </em>had not diverted the funds advanced by them, to other purposes than those of the contract, the business might have been perfected with great advantage. That, in the settlement of his accounts, he is entitled to ci\u2019edit for various articles, the most prominent of which are, 1. A dollar <em>per </em>hogshead on 20,000 hogsheads, which <em>Robert Morris </em>was .at liberty to ship to the <em>Farmers General, </em>under a permission given subsequently to the contract in <em>April, </em>1785; but which were never shipped. 2. Count<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00bfug-house expenses. 3. The cargo of the ship <em>Mary Jinne. </em>That, he is also entitled to retain the certificates of <em>John Tayloe Griffin, </em>they having been sold to indemnify <em>William Jllexander, </em>while he was a creditor of <em>Robert Morris, </em>for his endorsements on certain bills of exchange drawn by <em>Robarl </em>Morris, and protested; and that <em>Jllexander J. Alexander </em>was a purchaser of some in satisfaction of one of those bills. That, <em>William Jllexander </em>is also enritled to a discount for 110,000 dollars in the notes of <em>Robert Morris, </em>endorsed by <em>John Nicholson, </em>or of <em>John Nicholson, </em>endorsed by <em>Robert Morris.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-3\">The Court of Chancery decreed in favor of <em>Robert Morris; </em>and, thereupon, <em>Jllexander </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-4\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\"><em>Jllexander </em>was entitled to a commission of a dollar <em>per </em>hogshead on 80,000 hogsheads, because the <em>Farmers General </em>had agreed to take that quantity, and it was the failure of <em>Morris\u2019s </em>funds which prevented his compliance with the agreement. Of course, as the disappointment arose from his own delinquency, his agent is not to be prejudiced thereby; but should have the same compensation as lie would have been entitled to, if the agreement had been carried into effect; especially, as the money advanced to <em>Morris, </em>by the <em>Farmers General, </em>would have enabled him to carry the contract into complete effect, if ho had managed it judiciously. The household expenses were incurred for <em>the benefit of the </em>factorage; and, therefore, under the agreement, ought to be borne <em>by Morris. </em>The contract with <em>Griffin </em>was made out of <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>own funds, and <em>Morris </em>was only to have the tobacco, if paid: The certificates were pledged to <em>Jllexander </em>himself, and consequently, he alone .was entitled to them; but, if not, still he had a lien on them for the balance of his account. <em>[Drinkwater </em>et al. v. <em>Goodwin,] </em>Cowp. 251; and, as payment of the bill endorsed by him was demanded, some suits brought, and others threatened, he was justifiable in selling the certificates to pay the bills. Part of the certificates were bought by <em>John Jllexander, </em>who was an innocent purchaser, and, consequently, entitled to hold them. In any event, <em>Jllexander </em>is only liable for the value of the certificates, when sold, and <em>Morris </em>is not entitled to a decree for the certificates themselves, or for their present value. <em>Groves </em>v Graves, 1 Wash. 1. But, be this as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>may, <em>Mexander </em>was clearly entitled to discount the notes Morris, at their nominal value, against the balance in his hands; for, if he owed <em>Morris </em>on the account, and Morris owed him on the notes, the one ought to be a <em>set-off </em>against the other; which argument is the stronger, as there could not be any pretext of a trust, at the time the notes were purchased, for the factorage had long before ceased, and the transactions between the parties had all determined.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-4\">Call and <em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7T\"><em>Morris </em>never was authorised to ship the additional 20,000 hogsheads in the year 1788; for, by the terms of the correspondence and agreement, they were to be shipped within the same periods as the first 60,000 were; that is to say, within the years 1785, 1786, 1787: and the evidence clearly proves that <em>Mexander </em>could <em>not </em>ship them within that period, although furnished with ample means for the purpose. It is, therefore, preposterous to demand compensation for a service which he could not perform. Besides, if it were otherwise, the most which could be demanded, would be damages for breach of the agreement, and not a full commission upon the whole; because, in fact, he has not done the service for which it would have been payable. The household expenses were chiefly incurred for business, carried on by <em>Mexander, </em>on his own account, independent of the factorage; and, therefore, he ought to bear them. The advances to <em>Griffin, </em>were out of <em>Morris\u2019s </em>funds, and the contract expressly made on his own account, at his own request, and in consequence of his own treaty. Of course, <em>Mexander </em>could have no right to them, upon the ground of the contract: nor had he any just pretence for selling them; but the alledged sale, was altogether unauthorised and illegal. For, he did not acquire them- in the course of his factorage, but merely as the friend of <em>Morris, </em>upon a transaction entirely out of the line of the factorage. But, if it were even otherwise, still that did not authorise the sale; because it was unnecessary. For, there was no judgment against him; and no case proves, that a factor can sell the property of his principal, before actual damage, upon a mere apprehension of possible danger. Besides, he was actually a debtor at the time, and had not only refused an indemnity, but declared that he would not retain the funds in his hands. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Thy salo, <em>therefore, </em>was dearly illegal; and <em>Morris </em>is entitled to the: certificates themselves, -which remain in specie, and io the value of the rest, at the time of the decree. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>1 Wash. 164; <em>Wilson v. Rucker, </em>1 Call, 500. Which cases prove a difference between a contract, for certificates, and a, right to a particular set, of certificates. The first, from its very nature, being the subject of damages, the damages ought to be according to the period when the breach accrued; but the latter, being the <em>speeiGe </em>projierty of the owner, he may assert his right, to if, wherever <em>he </em>finds it, or the value, in case of failure to deliver it, which is the stronger, when it is considered, that if <em>trover </em>or <em>detinue </em>were brought, the value would bo settled, at the time of the verdict.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>John Alexander\u2019s </em>claim will form no exception; l. Because the purchase itself is subverted and overthrown by all the testimony in the cause; for, the very bill with which it is alledged to liave been bought, is proved to have been retired into <em>Morris\u2019s </em>own hands, before the date of the alledged purchase. <em>2. </em>Because the case of <em>Wilson v. Rucker, </em>1 Call, 500, proves that the true owner may pursue the certificates into the hands of any holder, although that holder be an innocent purchaser, without notice. <em>Alexander </em>cannot discount the notes of <em>Morris, </em>at more than he paid for them, eitlie.r against the certificates which remain in specie, or against the value of the residue. Not against the first: because a discount can only be against things of the same kind, and due in the same right. <em>Ayliff. </em>Pand. Civ. L. 573; I <em>Dom. Civ. L. 491, </em>IX; 6 <em>Bac. Abr. 135; </em>137. Not against <em>the </em>second: I. Because a trustee, or one standing in a fiduciary character, will not, be allowed moro for <em>compositions </em>than, he actually paid for them: which is not grounded merely on the, notion that he is <em>transacting </em>for the benefit of the trust, hut upon the principle of <em>v.tility </em>also, in order to remove the temptation to injustice through the hopes of retaining the fund, until the decline of the principal\u2019s affairs should bring down his papers to an under rate. 2 <em>Fonb. </em>Treat. Eq. 191; Ld. <em>Kames\u2019 </em>Princ. Eq. <em>24, 176. </em>Nor does the <em>ceasing </em>of the trust, as it is called, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>alter the rule, according to the argument on the other side: because, that would tend to encourage misconduct, as the agent would have nothing to do, but to sell the property, and then claim rights which he could not have pretended to before. It is no answer to say, that the principal in such cases sustains no injury. 1. Because, independent of the bad tendency of it, the creditors of the principal have an interest in the subject; for, the trustee is, in conscience, hound to yield it up for their benefit; and, therefore, cannot, for the sake of his own interest, drive them, through despair, to take less than the amount. <em>Francis\u2019s </em>Max. 9, 64, 65. Which applies with more force here, where a suit was actually depending, and the fund under the control of the Court. <em>2. </em>Because the deposition of <em>Cottinger </em>proves the notes to have issued on an illegal consideration; and, therefore, equity will not oblige <em>Morris </em>to allow more than was advanced upon them,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-6\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax4\"><em>Cottinger\u2019s </em>deposition was taken after the appeal; and, therefore, cannot be read at this time. None of the <em>English </em>cases upon the subject of discount, resemble this; -and those stated by Lord Kames were fanciful ones, of his own creation. Tobacco may be discounted against money, and money against certificates; then why not-notes against certificates ? For, money and tobacco, or money and certificates, differ as much, or more, in their nature, than certificates and notes. The pendency of the suit, at the time of the purchase of the notes, does not alter the case; and, as the property of the notes was in <em>Alexander, </em>he was entitled to all which they would command; <em>that </em>is to say, to the sum for which they issued, unless any payments can be proved. Therefore, he ought to have credit for their full amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b103-4\">[* See Grose, J. in <em>King </em>v. <em>Leith, </em>2 T.

Tn the moan time, a loss having been sustained in the shipment of 3,000 hogsheads, from the high price in <em>Virginia, he Normand </em>permits <em>Morris </em>to ship 20,000 hogsheads more than the <em>60,000, </em>within the limited time of three years; <em>Morris to be </em>at liberty to ship them, if convenient: <em>he Normand </em>bound to take them. <em>July </em>the 6th, 1786, <em>Morris </em>and <em>Alexander </em>enter into a new agreement, which reciting the contract with <em>he Normand </em>in <em>January, </em>1785, and that <em>Alexander </em>had been employed to superintend the purchase and shipment of tobacco on terms to be after-wards settled, proceeds to settle the terms, as follows: All tobacco purchased by, or under the orders of <em>Alexander, </em>since <em>October, </em>1784, till the completion of the contract with <em>he Normand, </em>were to be on the account and risk of <em>Morris; </em>and <em>Alexander </em>was to account for those, as well as for all gain on the sales of tobacco purchased, and commissions on purchases made for others: In consideration of. which, and as a recompense for his great abilities exerted, and to be exerted, <em>Morris </em>agrees to allow him, over and above all commissions to sub-agents and charges, a dollar/?*\u00bb\u2022 hogshead for every hogshead which had been, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>might be shipped to <em>France, </em>in consequence of the eontracts aforesaid; and to allow him two and a half^er <em>cent. </em>on all tobacco purchased and not sent to <em>France. Alexander </em>to retain all profit made by him, by speculations in military certificates, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"A3u\">Under this agreement, Mr. <em>Alexander </em>has credit for his dollar, on .60,000 hogsheads, although so many were not shipped before the end of the year 1787. But, his first claim discussed, is for <em>% 20,000' </em>for the tobacco which Mr. <em>Morris </em>was permitted to ship, if he chose, and did so within that year; the agreement between <em>Morris </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>is in terms confined to the contract for the 60.000 hogsheads, by reference to that contract for its date: and though both knew at the time that <em>Morris </em>had permission to add the 20,000 hogsheads, there is no reason to presume they meant to treat of it at all. Their silence, with that knowledge, is opposed to such presumption. It was optional with <em>Morris; </em>and it was precarious, whether it could be procured in time, in addition to the 60,000: Besides, it being substituted to recompense a loss in the 2.000 hogsheads borne by <em>Morris, </em>and producing a loss in itself, instead of a recompense, upon Mr. <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>own principles, his claim is unfounded, as he would receive the reward for getting rid of a losing bargain, instead of yielding a beneficial interest. Although the agreement did not extend to the 2,000 hogsheads, yet the correspondence shews that <em>Morris </em>meant to allow the six shillings upon them, if they could be shipped in time to entitle him to the profit; and to such intention, the stimulus to exertion, <em>\u201c </em>increase <em>my profit </em>and <em>your commission,\u201d </em>refers: It could not be purchased; <em>Morris </em>lost the profits; and <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>demand of reward, for what he could not do, is unreasonable. Hints are given, as if both knew that the tobacco would be received in 1788; a fact not proved by any document, and contradicted by the event. <em>Morris </em>made an essay, in that year, to discover if it would be received: The discovery was unfortunate. Much labor was employed, in argument, to shew, on one side, that <em>Morris </em>did not supply funds sufficient, and, on the other, that <em>Alexander </em>misapplied the funds furnished to his private speculations. Neither is satisfactorily proved: For, although <em>Alexander </em>frequently recommends it to <em>Morris </em>to keep him supplied, he never states that he lost a single opportunity of purchasing, for want of them: The accounts shew, that there were always considerable ba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>lances in the hands of him, and of his sub-agents; and though they consisted mostly in facilities, and not specie, those appear generally to have, answered the purpose: In the few instances where specie was required and sent for, it was furnished. The detention of the messengers, a few days, only proves that the difficulty of procuring, and <em>Mor riffs </em>anxiety to furnish, the specie. On the other band, the Court discover no proof of <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>having used the funds for his private speculations. The true cause of disappointment appears, from <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>letters, to have been at first, the high price of tobacco; and, after-wards, the scarcity of that commodity; of which, his strong expressions, <em>that it could not be procured by the aid of the. best funds of Heaven and Earth, </em>are the most conclusive evidence. Upon the whole, the Court is of opinion, that, this claim was properly rejected by the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The second claim is for about 1,700/. for household, or counting-house expenses. This is founded on the agreement between <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Williams, </em>wherein it is stipulated, that such expenses of house-keeping, 1 ravelling, clerks, &amp;c., should be allowed, but which does not apply to the present contract. By the agreement between <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Williams, </em>as first entered into, both were to devote themselves to that business only; and to settle, one in <em>Virginia, </em>the other in <em>France, </em>for carrying it on: Neither was to charge any thing- for his labour, but their whole expense of living- was <em>to </em>be a common charge: When <em>Morris </em>was taken in, however, a different language is used; no mention of house-keeping, clerks, &amp;c., is made; but, ho was to he allowed for actual expenses incurred. So, in the agreement between <em>Morris </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>charges are to be allowed over and above a large salary, and commissions to sub-agents.- Two auditors, who adjusted the accounts, well understood the common acceptation of <em>charges, </em>in a mercantile contract of this sort, to comprehend only real expenses paid in the purchase and shipment of tobacco; so much they had allowed in the costs of tobacco; and, therefore, they properly rejected the whole claim of 1,700/., including- those and other improper articles. On this point, therefore, the Court also approve the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The third claim is for the loss of the tobacco, shipped in the <em>Mary Anne, </em>and the expenses on that occasion. The deposition of <em>Eddins </em>proves, that the loss was occasioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>either from the insufficiency of the <em>ship </em>or the bad conduct of the captain and <em>seamen; </em>and Mr. <em>.Alexander </em>must bear it, as owner of the former and answerable for the latter. On this point the decree is also approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">We come then to the fourth, respecting <em>Griffin\u2019s </em>certificate, from which Mr. <em>Alexander </em>insists to be discharged, on accounting for the price at which he sold them, amounting to <em>2,5711. 7s. 3d. </em>which sale he justifies under his contract with <em>Griffin </em>in <em>July, </em>1787, by which he was empowered to sell them for what they would fetch, to be applied to the purchase of the tobacco, as a security for which they were deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The whole correspondence from <em>March, </em>1786, to <em>May, </em>1788, shews, that it. was <em>Morris\u2019s </em>money which was advanced to <em>Griffin; </em>the securities his; and the delays in selling the certificates were by his consent: And why <em>Alexander </em>should complain of <em>Morris\u2019s </em>having finally settled with <em>Griffin, </em>without consulting him, is not conceived, unless he meant to have added a heavy penalty upon <em>Griffin, </em>to his other gains of that .sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">On the 3d of <em>May, </em>1788, <em>Morris </em>wrote <em>Alexander, </em>that he had settled <em>Griffin\u2019s </em>debt, and desired him to deliver <em>Griffin </em>all securities and deposits taken of him. <em>John Richards </em>and <em>Alexander K. Marshall, </em>_ prove <em>Griffin\u2019s </em>demand and <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>refusal; and the latter adds, that <em>Alexander </em>said he retained them as his property, and that <em>Griffin </em>said he should hold <em>Alexander </em>responsible for the certificates. <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>letters to <em>Morris </em>of <em>May </em>1st and 6th, state, that he retained the certificates as an indemnity against <em>Morris\u2019s </em>protests; and for the same reason he refused to transfer vouchers for the out-standing debts, but said he was ready to do both, on having these protests produced, cancelled, or himself discharged. At that time the certificates were all in his hands, the sale of which he did not commence until the 16th of <em>May; </em>and we come to consider whether those sales were justifiable. That the certificates were the specific property of <em>Morris, </em>in the hands of <em>Alexander, </em>as his agent, is unquestionable; and, that an agent or factor may <em>retain </em>such property as security for a <em>debt </em>due, or as an indemnity against engagements for the principal, is also clear. But, whether he can sell such property, depends on the circumstances of each particular case, inducing a necessity for a sale to answer those purposes; and the circumstances ought to be strong, whereas, in the present case, the sale was forbid by the proprietor.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The general principle laid down by Lord Maj\u00edsitot,!), m <em>Drinkwater </em>et al. v. <em>Goodwin, </em>Cowp. 251, is, that a factor who receives cloths and is <em>authorised to sell them, </em>makes the buyer debtor to himself, and though he is not answerable for the debt, he has a right to receive the money. his receipt discharges the buyer, he may compel payment by suit, in which case the buyer could not defend himself by shewing that the principal was indebted to him; for, the principal can never say <em>that, </em>bid. where nothing is due to the factor. The circumstances there, were very strong; the factor\u2019, when he became security, stipulated that the money borrowed should pass through his hands to the principal, a clothier, who was to send his cloth to sell, <em>as usual, </em>for his security: But, in the present case, the sale of these certificates was not within the ordinary agency of <em>Alexander. </em>They were deposited as a pledge for <em>Morris\u2019s </em>money advanced, and subject to his control. He did not <em>authorise, </em>hut <em>forbid </em>the sale; and it can only bn justified, if at all, by shewing that money was then &lt;tue to the agent, or that, a saie was necessary to exonerate him from his engagements for Morris. That <em>Alexander </em>was not a creditor at the time, but a debtor to upwards of 6,000/., appears from the account settled; and he must shew that his engagements required it, in order to justify the sale. The bills <em>re,ally paid, </em>are charged to <em>Morris </em>in the accounts settled, amongst which are Mr. <em>Alexander John </em>Alexanders; which, in his account, current <em>March </em>28, 1788, he charges to <em>Morris, </em>with the interest and charges, amounting- to 2,1,91l. <em>3s. Id. </em>currency: at the foot of that account, he states a list of bills returned and unsettled, amounting to 3,600/. sterling, a sum not equal to the balanco he owed, and would not justify a sale of the certificates, even if he had been pressed for payment, which is not shewn. Whether these, bills have been since paid by either party, or were endorsed by <em>Alexander, </em>does not appear, except that <em>Morris </em>says in his answer that <em>Alexander </em>has paid part of them, which is credited to him in the account settled. If they are yet out-standing, and were endorsed by <em>Alexander, </em>he ought to be indemnified by <em>Morris </em>against them. No other protests appear, except, those on which judgments have been recovered by <em>Stott 8,\u2018 Donaldson; </em>which judgments, Mr. <em>Morris </em>swears, in his answer to the last bill, he paid to those creditors in 3 793, and took an assignment of the judgments, on which he ought to give a release to <em>Alexander,, </em>which will amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>to an indemnity of the bail. There not appearing, then, any pressing necessity for a sale of the certificates on account of th.ose protests, <em>Alexander </em>had no power to sell; ought to be considered as having retained them, and to be made so accountable. For, though deposited with <em>Gray </em>and <em>M\u2019Nair, </em>there seems to be no question but they are to be specifically delivered, on those defendants being indemnified as bail for <em>Alexander, </em>at the suit of <em>Stott </em>\u00a7 <em>Donaldson. </em>As to the balance, <em>Alexander </em>is, by the decree, to procure and transfer stock of equal value, or compensate for their present value, to be settled by a jury. This is objected to, and it is urged, that the price they sold for, or the real value, at that time, ought to be the rule. After reasoning by analogy to the ease of trover on one side, and detinue on the other, which did not support the objection, since <em>Morris </em>had the option which of those suits he would commence, the counsel recurred to cases in this Court. <em>Groves </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>[1 Wash. 1,] was a contract to deliver, on a fixed day, certificates of a certain description, but no <em>specific </em>paper; and the principal reason for fixing the value at that day, was, that <em>Groves </em>was not afterwards obliged to take the paper if depreciated; and, therefore, ought not to-have the gain by their rise: But, this is not the case of property in specific paper, which remains at 'the risk of the proprietor, for gain or loss; and so it was determined in the cases of <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>[1 Wash. 164,] and <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>[1 Call, 500.] In both which, the value, at the time of the recovery, was the rule. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Of this responsibility <em>Alexander </em>was warned before the sale; and any hardship in the case, he has brought on himself by his own misconduct. On this point, therefore, the decree is also right; as is the dismission of the bill of <em>Alexander John Alexander, </em>as his protests were given up and charged to <em>Morris </em>before the sale, when <em>Morris </em>ceased t\u00f3 be his debtor, and he became a creditor of <em>William Alexander &amp; Co. </em>only.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We now come to the last point, whether <em>Alexander </em>shall be allowed to discount the notes of <em>Morris S? Nicholson </em>at their nominal value, or at the price which he paid for them? The latter is the decree, and that price to be settled by a jury. The question is important in value, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>she only difficulty is, to decide between two men, both of whom appear to have done wrong, on which of them the injury shall fall. On the one hand, it is impossible to jusfcii'y <em>Morris, </em>whether his conduct, proceeded from his distress, or an insatiable thirst for riches, in coining these millions of notes, to circulate under a promise to redeem them at full specie value, which he must have known he would not he able to do; and that the world would be thereby deceived. According to his account, however, mankind was nol wholly deceived; they got into circulation by his depositing them in heaps for money borrowed, and their value to him was what they would sell for. And those sales gave a tone to their depreciation from lime <em>to </em>time, as a rate at which they were generally passed between individuals. Of these deposits and sales, we have no account, till 1796, when some were deposited at two shillings in the pound, and which sold afterwards, in <em>February, </em>1797, at twelve cents, something less than nine pence: at which rate <em>Williams </em>purchased at least <em>64,000 </em>dollars of the notes now offered in discount; for, that they are the same notes, appears from a comparison of three lists, one by each of the brokers <em>,/hnridge, </em>and <em>Biddle, </em>and the other by <em>Alexander, </em>all agreeing, so far as date, number and sums. The value <em>Williams </em>paid for them, appears in <em>Biddle\u2019s </em>deposition. He received them in exchange for old notes, which were sold for less than the new ones, and he paid <em>Biddle </em>one cent <em>per </em>pound for (he difference.</p>\n<p id=\"Agj\">Here, it may be necessary to observe, that the Court allow the depositions to be read, though taken after the decree and appeal, since they relate to the subject of discount; as to which the suits are to be considered as yet depending in the Court of Chancery, of which <em>Morris </em>ought not to be deprived, by the appeal having been granted before the iinal decree. The commissions were properly awarded, and the depositions taken in presence of the attorney of <em>Alexander,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Having stated the situation of <em>Morris, </em>what is that of <em>\u2022Alexander? </em>After suits depending near ten years, and the accounts between the parties are adjusted, he is found to be a fair debtor to <em>Morris </em>in a large sum; upon which he buys up those notes at about nine pence in the pound, and claims a discount for them at twenty shillings. Was lie deceived by the import of the notes? <em>William Marshall\u2019s </em>deposition, shews his opinion of the value of (hose notes in summer of 1797; when he declared that lie did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>not possess, nor would he be concerned with one of them; and advised Mr. <em>Marshall </em>not to be concerned with any more: Or, is he injured by being allowed the specie he really paid, as if he had paid that to <em>Morris? </em>It is believed, that the widows and orphans spoken of, and all others, holding <em>Morris\u2019s </em>notes, would be glad to be so paid for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In 6 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 137, <em>Gwil. </em>ed. it is said as in the case of bankruptcy the debt claimed to be set ollj must have existed at the time of the bankruptcy, so, in <em>other cases, </em>it must be in existence at the time of commencing the suit; for which he refers to the 3 <em>T. R. </em>186, <em>[Evans v. Prosser,] 2 </em>Burr. 1229, <em>[Baskerville </em>v. <em>Brown.] </em>Which is surely very reasonable, it being improper for a debtor after suit, to trump up claims against his creditors in order to discount them, especially when purchased at an under rate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The counsel aware of this, and that this is the case at law, claims the discount as an equity, and justifies the advantage gained in the purchase, as a balance for the loss in the certificates. Mr. <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>opinion of that loss may justify his morality in the attempt; but the Court having decided that the claim of <em>Morris </em>to the certificates is just, and that the loss, if any, was occasioned by <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>own fault, that loss can give him no equity to extend the value of his. discounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Upon the whole, the Court is of opinion that the decrees are all right as far as they go,; but that <em>Morris\u2019s </em>recovery ought to b,e suspended, until he shall release the judgments of <em>Stott &amp; Donaldson, </em>and indemnify <em>Alexander </em>against the outstanding bills, if any, endorsed by him, or allow him credit for their amount: And, with this direction, the decrees are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\">[* See <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 East, 211; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>The Portland Bank, </em>3 Mass.
