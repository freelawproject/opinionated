That they were taken from the possession of the said <em>Nathan, </em>whom she appointed executor of her will. That they were taken from the possession of the said <em>Nathan, </em>and sold as his absolute property, by virtue of an execution against his estate. That the said <em>Nathan </em>is still alive; and that it did not appear that the executor had given his consent to the suit, or to the legacy, or that any person had qualified as executor or administrator.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And the questions reserved for the opinion of the Court, were, 1st. Whether the plaintiffs, as legatees of <em>Sarah, </em>could maintain the action, without shewing the assent of the executor or administrator to the legacy? 2d. Whether the slaves could be sold, as the absolute property of the said <em>Nathan, </em>under the execution aforesaid? The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-5\">The legatees ought to have shewn the executor\u2019s assent; for, if the son took possession without the assent of a qualified executor or administrator, he was a trespasser.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-4\">The case is not liable to the general rule concerning the necessity of the executor\u2019s assent. For, the will appointed the son sole executor and universal devisee of the estate; and, as he did not qualify as executor, he was in possession, in his own right, under the devise: Of course, he was as much subject to the condition, and as liable to the forfeiture, as if there had been an express assent obtained, or he had qualified as executor: For, he could not avoid his mal-conduct, by saying that, as the assent of a qualified executor was not obtained, his possession was tortious; especially as it was even competent to him to do every act -as executor, but bring suits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-5\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">Perhaps it may be questionable if the devise over is not void: but, not being satisfied upon that point, I shall submit it to the Court. As the son had not qualified as executor, his possession was tortious, and the rightful administrator might have maintained an action <em>de bonis asportalis </em>against him. It is no objection to say,, that by this means, the son might avoid the condition and save the forfeiture, by taking possession and failing to qualify; because, the remainder men might have taken administration themselves, and thus have avoided the inconvenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-7\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vnll.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> There is a certificate to the will, which is found in <em>7ixc verba, </em>that the will was proved by the witnesses; but there is no certificate that the executor ever qualified thereto,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b209-8\"><em>LYONS, </em>Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Afc\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the judgment was erroneous and to be reversed, as it did not appear that there was any assent of the executor to the legacy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b209-9\">[* <em>Smith </em>et ux. v. <em>Townes's </em>adm\u2019r. 4 Munf. 191: <em>Toller's </em>law of Ex. and Adm. 306, 2 <em>Am. </em>ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
