The declaration was in the form of a declaration upon a common bond for payment of money: The writ being executed on <em>Stuart, Renick, </em>Anderson, <em>Reid </em>and <em>Johnston </em>only, they plead conditions performed; and the plaintiff for the benefit of <em>Burnsides, </em>assigned a breach in <em>Ward\u2019s </em>suffering a prisoner committed to his custody, by the County Court, at <em>the </em>suit of the said <em>Burtisides, </em>to escape. The defendants traversed the escape. \u2014 Issue.\u2014The jury found that the escape was through negligence, and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages to 173/. <em>2s. 9d. </em>The defendants moved to arrest the judgment, because an action of debt does not lie against a Sheriff for an escape on mesne or other process, either at common law or by statute; but the Distinct Court decided for the plaintiff: And thereupon, the defendants obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">The suit could only be maintained under the act of Assembly, and, therefore, the bond and proceedings must he conformable thereto, or they are void. But, the act of 1755, <em>ch. 2, </em>declares that the bond should be made payable to the King. <em>Old body Laws, </em>325, 6, [6 <em>Stat. Larg. 482: </em>And, by the act of Convention, all bonds formerly made to the King, should now be made payable to the Justices of the county, [c. 5, \u00a7 8, 9 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>128.] Of course, it does not pursue the law. Besides, the penalty of the bond is <em>for 10,0001. </em>whereas the Jaw only prescribed 1,000/.: Which charges the securities further than the Jaw intended; as writs of <em>scire facias </em>may be sued until the penalty is exhausted. It is not a voluntary bond; for, the law compels the Sheriff to give bond: So, that it is not an act <em>in pais; </em>but done under the authority of the law, which, therefore, ought to have been pursued. But, the other objection is equally fatal; for, it ought to have been made payable to the Justices, and not to the Governor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-6\"><em>Bennet Taylor, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\">The justice of the case is certainly with the appellee; and the decisions of this Court support him in his claim. <em>[Hewlett </em>v. <em>Chamberlayne,] </em>1 Wash. 367; <em>[Scott </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Hornsby,] 1 Call, 41; <em>[Beale </em>v. Downman,] Ib. 249. Which cases shew, that although the bond is not agreeable to the statute, yet it is good at common law. The same argument applies to the present case. For, although the bond does not pursue the statute, yet, as there is nothing in it repugnant to the rules of law, it will be good at common law. Besides, the Court might add to th\u00e9 judgment, that future writs of <em>scire facias </em>should not be issued beyond 1,000\u00bf., and thus obviate the argument with regard to the sureties being further charged than the act prescribed. In <em>Branch </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>2 Call, 510, the point concerning the bond\u2019s being made payable to the Governor occurred, but was not decided. However, there appears to be no cause of objection upon that ground, after the decisions already referred to.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-7\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-8\">The Court cannot apportion the penalty according to what is contended for on the other side; for, the sum is certain, and judgment must be entered for it. The cases cited do not apply. That of <em>Scott </em>v. Hornsby, 1 Call, 41,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was a case which depended upon calculation only; and, therefore, has no resemblance to the present, which is bottomed upon an act of Assembly; and that ought to have been pursued. A similar answer may be given to <em>Hewlett </em>V. <em>Chamberlayne, </em>1 Wash. 367; for there, a particular penalty and certain obligees, were not prescribed, as there are in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-9\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\"><em> </em>N.

As this action is, by the successor of the Governor, for the benefit of persons injured, it is to be brought under the act of Assembly; and the only question is, whether, it is sustainable under it or not? It is not: By the then law, the bond should have been given to the Justices: A 1,000Z. also, is stated in the act, as an essential part of the <em>condition; </em>and, therefore, not to be varied from.</p>\n<author id=\"b387-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Alj2\">The bond is not taken as the act of Assembly directs; for, by that, it should have been made payable to the Justices, and the penalty should have been 1,000/. only. The suit is brought upon it, however, as a bond taken under the act; and, therefore, the action not sustainable. I am, consequently of opinion, that the judgmerit ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b387-4\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AvM\">The Court are unanimously of opinion, that the judgment is to be reversed; and the entry is to be as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court is of opinion, that the said judgment is erroneous in this, that as the bond in the declaration mentioned, on which the suit is brought in the name of the said <em>Henry Lee, </em>esq\u2019r. Governor of the Commonwealth of <em>Virginia, </em>as successor to <em>Beverly Randolph, </em>&amp;c. as above mentioned, was not taken pursuant to law, or the act of Assembly in such case made and provided, no action can be had or maintained thereon by the said <em>Henry Lee, </em>esq'r. in his character of Governor or successor in office only; therefore, it is considered that the same be reversed, anti that the appellants recover their costs against the said defendant <em>Burnside</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
