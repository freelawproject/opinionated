The hill states, that, on the 20th of <em>November, </em>1749, <em>William Davies, </em>lor his father <em>Jloberl Dames, </em>entered with <em>Thomas Lewis, </em>Surveyor of <em>Augusta </em>county, for 300 acres of land <em>between his father\u2019s land and the widow Bell's. </em>That on the 29th of <em>August, </em>1753, <em>Robert Davies </em>sold the entry to <em>J. Phillips; </em>from whose son and heir, the plaintiff purchased it on the 23d of <em>May, </em>1789. And on the 12th of <em>October, </em>1789, <em>William Davies </em>also assigned it to the plaint,iff, for the consideration of <em>41. </em>10.s. That the entry being surveyed, and the plat returned into the Land Office, a patent issued thereon <em>June </em>9th, 1792. That <em>John Brown, </em>in 1753, entered with ihe same Surveyor, 230 acres of land, comprehending 190 acres of that above mentioned; and, in 1783, a patent for the same was obtained by his heir or devisee, from whom the bill prays a conveyance. The answer says, that two surveys cannot he made on one entry; that,.if the plaintiff\u2019s survey had pursued the entry, it must have gone through patented lands; that the entry is too vague: Thai the plaintiff\u2019s survey was forfeited, and could not regularly have been surveyed, when it was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-19\">There are several depositions with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s purchase; and the deposition of <em>Poage </em>a Surveyor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>stating that he had run certain lines; and annexing a plat comprehending the lands in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">The Court of Chancery decreed in favour of <em>Brown; </em>and thereupon, <em>Johnson </em>appealed to this Court..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-8\">Randolph, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\">The government could not have defeated <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>right; because, by' the act of 1748, all entries were to stand good until notice was given by the Surveyor, on two Court days. <em>Old edit, laws </em>220, \u00a7 20, [c. 19, \u00a7 8, 6 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>36.] But <em>Brown </em>cannot lie in a better situation than the government itself. The vagueness of the entry is not material. For, the officer was satisfied, and all the entries of that day were as vague. The survey agrees with the entry, for a line run from, it will touch the widow Bell\u2019s, as the plot exhibited by the appellee shews: But, the plot itself is not authentic, as it was not made under any order of Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-10\"><em>Nicholas, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-11\">Having got the first patent, we have the legal right, and the plaintiff shews no equitable title to overthrow it, as there is no charge of any fraud in obtaining it, which there must be, in order to affect the legal title. <em>White </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>1 Wash. 116. We had no notice of any prior entry, and therefore, our conduct' could not be fraudulent. But the entry is too vague, <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Call, 206; and it is not material that it was under the old law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-13\">The plot is evidence; for it is proved by the Surveyor; and was not excepted to, in the Court of Chancery. Therefore, no objection to it should be allowed at this time. But, if the plot be received, then it is manifest that <em>Johnson </em>did not pursue the entry in his survey; and, therefore, the survey itself is void as against us. But the entry was abandoned; for the lapse of time was so great, that a relinquishment ought to be presumed. <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Dowdel, </em>2 Wash. 106. Besides, the evidence proves, that <em>Davies </em>had forgot that he ever made the entry.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-15\"><em>Call, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANv\">The entry was too vague, to operate against a subsequent locator, without actual notice: And it will not be material, if no act of Assembly, at that day, required as much precision, as the present laws do. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>For, the act of 1779, [10 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>57,] only enacted into a statute, what was a law of equity before, as for as respected a subsequent locator; because it was a principle of general justice, that a vague and indefinite entry, from which no particular portion of land could be ascertained, ought not to prevent, or disappoint, a future locator: Otherwise, every man who wished to make an entry, must have consulted every prior locator, before he could have proceeded; which would have been an intolerable hardship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\">It Is under this view, therefore, that we say the entry is void; and not that it is <em>ipso facto </em>nullified against the public, or any other person. For, as against the public, the act of 1748, <em>(old edit, laws </em>220,) may have full operation, and yet be void against a subsequent locator, without knowledge of the particular place entered for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">This doctrine is attended with no inconvenience; because it was in the power of the first locator to have been more precise, or to have surveyed at an earlier day: Whereas, according to the other idea, an immense space of country might have lain unappropriated half a century, until some prior locator was satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">Hence it appears, that where there were conflicting entries, precision was as necessary before the act of 1779, as afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">Let us examine, then, what has been held an insufficient entry since that act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\">In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Call, 200, an entry of <em>400 </em>acres on the south branch, adjoining Lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>land, at the mouth of <em>Mill Creek, was held </em>insufficient; and yet that <em>entry was </em>fully as certain, as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-9\"><em>Field </em>v. <em>Culbreath, 2 </em>Call, 547, was not like this: <em>J. </em>Because it was for <em>all </em>the vacant land between certain lines; whereas, this, .is only for 300 acres in an immense space. 2. Because the survey, there, had reduced the location to certainty before the <em>caveat. 3. </em>Because the survey \u2022was upon the land described in the entry, and two of the lines actually agreed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-10\">Upon the ground of precision, therefore, the entry, as against <em>Brown, </em>who was an innocent man, is clearly void, on account of the vagueness of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-11\">But the survey does not agree with the entry:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-12\">For,,, the land surveyed does not lie between those of <em>Robert Davies </em>and the widow <em>Bell; </em>but, it lies behind those of <em>Robert Davies.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>When a man describes a tract of land, as lying between two others, he means, that the body of it, at least, actually lies between them. A mere corner, or mathematical point, will not satisfy the description. But, in the present case, however, not even a mathematical point lies between them; for, the land, surveyed is not comprehended between those described in the entry, but lies behind one, and recedes from both. So that, in the language of one of the Judges, [Lyons] in <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>it may be said, that <em>Davies, </em>when he entered, never expected to find the land he entered for, at the place which has been surveyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b250-9\">But the entry was abandoned:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-10\">It was made in <em>1749, </em>and no survey of the land took place until 1790, upwards of forty years. Therefore, according to <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Dowdel, </em>2 Wash. 106, it was utterly void against a subsequent locator. For, the rules there laid down, expressly apply to the present case: Because, the warrant of Lord <em>Fairfax, </em>was like that of the government, and he was as much bound by it. Of course, if the new grant could supersede the old entry and survey there, much more will it supersede a mere entry here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-12\">But our Case is stronger; because there is actual evidence here of the abandonment. For, <em>Perry </em>says that <em>Davies </em>appeared to haye no recollection of it; which is a clear proof of his having long since relinquished it; and Moffet, says, that <em>Phillips </em>offered to give it for nothing, into a bargain which they were treating about: A clear proof, that he also had abandoned it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-14\">But, by analogy to the three years after the patent before seating and planting, the failure to survey, patent, and. improve, ought tobe held a dereliction: Else, other locators might have been put to inconvenience, and the public defrauded of the taxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-15\">But, for another reason, the defendant must succeed: For, he has got the legal estate, without any fraud; and his equity is at least equal. Therefore, a Court of Equity will not interpose between two innocent men, but will let the law prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-16\">The survey is evidence; for, the correctness of it has never been impeached before; and an order for a survey is never made without the request of the parties. But <em>Poage </em>swears that it is correct; and as he might have described the situation in words only, without the assistance of lines, it can never be an objection, that he used lines to make himself better understood. Besides, this is a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>pial, composed of copies from his office; and if the copies could be read, so may the connected plat, of them also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\">But, the plaintiff shews no title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">He does not shew any assignment of the entry from <em>Robert Davies </em>to <em>Phillips, </em>or from <em>William Davies </em>to himself. Neither does he produce any patent, or authority for making the entry.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-6\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">The record is probably defective. <em>At </em>all events there is reason to presume the assignment and patent to Johnson; and the Court will institute an enquiry to ascertain it. <em>William, Davies </em>is stated to have assigned himself, with a knowledge that his father had previously done so. The entry is as certain as most of that day; indeed, it would bo precise enough at this. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Culbreath, </em>2 Call, 547. As to the lapse of time, it is no objection, as the act of 1748 preserves the entry, until the Surveyor gives the required notice. In this respect <em>it </em>differs from <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Doiodelj </em>because there was no such law, or private regulation, for the government of Lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>office. But, the doctrine in <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Buffington, </em>2 Wash. 116, is in our favor. There was no necessity that the whole land should lie between the tracts of <em>Davies </em>and <em>Bell; </em>and lines might be so run, as to throw part between them. The \u2022analogy contended for, between this and the three years after the patent, cannot be maintained; such a position has never been laid down by the Court in any case. The objections to the evidence of the survey, cannot be obviated; and, upon the whole, <em>the </em>decree is erroneous, and ought to <em>be </em>reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-10\">\n<em>Cur adv. milt.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b251-11\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A_8\">(after observing that as all the Judges who sat in the cause were unanimous; those present thought there would be no impropriety in proceeding to judgment in the absence of Judge Roane,) delivered the resolution of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Upon the 20th of <em>November, </em>1749, <em>William Davies </em>entered with the Surveyor of <em>Jlugusia </em>county, for 300 acres of land, <em>between Robert Davies\u2019s land, and the land of the widow Bell. </em>It, is stated, that <em>Phillips </em>purchased die <em>entry of Robert Davies </em>in <em>1753, </em>and sold it to <em>John </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>son </em>in 1789. Of this, however, no proof is exhibited; but let it for the present <em>be admitted, without </em>making it a precedent. It is proved, that in <em>October, </em>1789, <em>Johnson </em>purchased of <em>William Davies </em>his right to this entry, and be it also admitted, as stated, that he surveyed the land in dispute, under that entry, in 1790, and obtained a grant in 1792. - In <em>January, </em>1753, a survey appears to have been made, for <em>John Brown, </em>grand-father of the appellee, of 230 acres, including the lands in dispute, on <em>which it in </em>said a patent issued in 1788, but it does not appear. Upon the 10th of <em>June, </em>1770, <em>Thomas Broion, </em>father of the appellee, entered 400 acres, adjoining <em>Phillips, </em>his father\u2019s old tract, and his own land. <em>March </em>1st, 1775, he surveyed the 190 acres in dispute, correctly answering the description of his entry; and <em>February </em>1st, 1781, obtained a grant for it. The present suit in Chancery was brought by <em>Johnson, </em>stating his equitable title to be prior and superior to <em>Brown\u2019s; </em>and praying a decree that ho may convey the legal title. The bill was dismissed in Chancery, and from that dismission the appeal comes.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">We first consider the case, on general principles, as a claim to set up an equitable interest in opposition to a legal title; in which ease, the plaintiff, to succeed, must shew a superiority of equity to the defendant, for, if it be equal only, the law must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">We then contrast the equity of the parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\"><em>Brown </em>appears to have proceeded regularly, <em>fairly </em>and legally, to acquire a <em>title to </em>vacant lands, and has, without; fraud, obtained a patent. <em>Johnson, </em>on the other hand, appears to be a man searching for defects in his neighbors\u2019 land titles; hunting up, and purchasing a stale, dormant claim, in order to disturb that title; and would rather seem to merit the penalty of the act against buying pretensed titles, than to be considered as a fair claimant in a Court of Equity. In this view then, here is <em>no equity, </em>set up against <em>law </em>and <em>equity, </em>and cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">But, let us suppose <em>Johnson </em>had such an equity, as would, on a <em>caveat </em>prior to the grant, have entitled him to a preference; it would be no ground for a bill to set aside the patent, unless it had been suggested and proved, that he was prevented by fraud or accident from prosecuting a <em>caveat. </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On those grounds, this Court has sustain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ed bills of this sort, and enquired into the equilable preference, as if on a <em>caveat; </em>but to admit such bills in all cases, without even suggesting an excuse for not having entered a <em>caveat, </em>would be to transfer the whole <em>caveating </em>business from the Courts of Law, where the Legislature have placed it, into the Chancery; which this Court cannot give sanction to. It was foreseen by the Legislature, that there would be interfering entries and surveys; and the <em>caveat </em>was the remedy for settling all those disputes prior to the, patent, to avoid the inconvenience of that solemn instrument being involved in contests of that kind. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">But, we will gratify the plaintiff, as far as to suppose for the moment, that we were sitting in judgment on a <em>caveat, </em>entered by <em>Johnson </em>against <em>Brown, </em>to prevent the patent on his survey of 1775. Here Mr. <em>Rundolph </em>insisted, that the entry gave a legal title to the land. If so, why come into a Court of Equity ? But, it is not correct to say, the entry gave a legal title. An <em>entry </em>is the first legal step towards acquiring waste lands, and gives the person making it, if properly pursued, a preference to a <em>grant, </em>the true definition of an equitable interest. The <em>survey </em>is a progressive legal step; but, it is the <em>grant, </em>only, which passes the legal title.\u2020 However, the, counsel insisted that the title, whether legal or equitable, was to stand good, at all times, until notice given by the Surveyor, and a neglect on the part of the person making the entry: Which does not appear to have occurred in the present case. But, is there no period after which such notice, and a dereliction of the entry, shall be presumed? The law books abound with instances of similar presumptions, and we believe, that not a precedent, or reason, can be found, to induce a Court of Equity to give its aid to resuscitate an entry, which has slept for forty years, in order to disturb intervening legal titles, fairly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Again: To close the climax of defect in the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the <em>entry </em>gave no title, at any time, to the land in dispute: Which will appear by recurring to the survey annexed to the record. That survey, the Court think admissible, not only as it comes to us, as a part of the record, without exception, but because it is authenticated by the Surveyor\u2019s deposition. Without enquiry, whether the entry was too vague, <em>between Davies and Bell, </em>or whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>two distinct surveys could be made upon one entry; it is most obvious, that the land in dispute is not within the description of the entry, since it does not lie <em>between Davies and Bell. </em>The counsel supposed, that if a line were drawn, from <em>Davies\u2019s </em>corner at B. to <em>Bell\u2019s </em>at K. it would throw part of the land in dispute between the extreme points of that line, and satisfy the entry. This was ingenious, but not rational; since, as <em>Bell\u2019s </em>land lay to the <em>north-west </em>of <em>Davies\u2019s, </em>the entry must have the same position from <em>Davies; </em>and, therefore, it cannot be justifiable to go to the <em>south-eastern </em>corner of <em>Davies\u2019s </em>land, in order to discover the space between that and <em>Bell\u2019s, </em>which .would throw <em>Davies\u2019s </em>land between the entry and <em>Bell\u2019s, </em>instead of the entry lying between the other two. Surely, to draw lines from the extreme corners and lines of <em>Davies </em>to those of <em>Bell, </em>in the parts where they approach each other, is the way to discover the space between them. For instance, the lines D. E. and E. F. of <em>Davies, </em>and the lines J. K. of <em>Bell, </em>are the approximating lines. Then draw a line from D. or E. to K. and from F. to J. those lines will shew the space between those lands, and be the limits of the entry, which will not include a foot of the land in dispute. On every point, therefore, and every view of the case, the Court are unanimously, and without difficulty, of opinion, that the decree is right, and ought to be affirmed,, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\">[* <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, 4 </em>Munf. <em>155; Christian\u2019s devisee v.
