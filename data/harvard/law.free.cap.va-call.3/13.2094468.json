That, in 1780, she intermarried with the defendant <em>John Thornton Fiizhugh; </em>and in <em>September, </em>of that year, an order, for the assignment of her dower and thirds, was made by the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Court of <em>Prince William; </em>but that no suit for that purpose was instituted, nor guardian appointed the plaintiffs; and that their grand-father by the mother\u2019s side, did not, as the defendants pretend, pay attention to it on behalf of the plaintiffs; he being more attached to <em>Fitzhugh </em>than to their father: That, in carrying the order of the County Court into effect, the most valuable part of the lands, (having all the improvements on it,) were assigned for dower; which was not laid off by the county Surveyor, but by <em>Moffett, </em>the friend of the defendant <em>J. T. Fitzhugh; </em>and that more than a third part was assigned: That the allotment of the slaves and personal estates was also unfair and unequal, to the prejudice of the plaintiffs. The bill, therefore, prays, that those assignments may be set aside, and others made; and that the plaintiffs may have general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">The answer states, that the grand-father was appointed executor, and although he never qualified, yet he never renounced, but managed the estate during the defendant <em>Margaret\u2019s </em>widowhood; and applied to the County Court for the order of assignment: That the dower and thirds were laid off in his presence, without the interference of the defendant, who did not procure <em>Moffett </em>to make the survey; for, it was the grand-father who did it; and he was influenced therein as well because great part of the land lay in <em>Fauquier, </em>where <em>Moffett </em>lived, as because of the great age of the surveyor of <em>Prince William: </em>That the survey was fair, and not more than a third part of the lands were assigned for dower; nor was the part assigned so fertile as the residue: That the allotment of the slaves was not unequal at the time, although, from subsequent causes, as deaths, births, &amp;c. it may have become so: That the order of the County Court was agreeable to the usage of the country; and the assignments, under it, fairly, equally, and impartially made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AL\">Several witnesses were examined as to the value of the assignments; and the High Court of Chancery appointed Commissioners to view and examine the dower lands, and to correct the exeess, if any; as also to examine into the allotment of the slaves, and, if the widow received more than her <em>due </em>share, to allot her <em>one equal third part of the whole stock of survivng slaves; </em>and in both cases, to estimate the compensation which ought to be made the plaintiffs, for the excess.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The commissioners reported, that there was an excess, as 1,o quantity, in the dower lands, which they had corrected: that all the valuable improvements were upon those lands; and that they had left them still attached to the new assignment, hut had diminished the quantity: that they had assessed, a yearly rent, as well for the original excess in quantity, as for the additional surplus, arising from the reduction under the new assignment: that, the excess of quantity, under the first assignment, did not, proceed from the misconduct of Fitzhugh, or the grand-father, but from an accidental defect in the survey; and that there was an excess of SO/. 10.v, in the value of the dower slaves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">The Court of Chancery confirmed the correction in the dower lands, and made the following decree, with regard to the slaves:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">\u201cThat the Court, doubting, at least, the power thereof <em>to </em>compel the sons of <em>Richard Foote </em>to accept a compensation for excess in value of the slaves assigned to <em>Margaret Fitzhugh </em>for dower, whereas a division of the stock of slaves themselves, if it be not unequal, is indubitably sanctified by law, doth, after hearing counsel, adjudge, order and decree, that the said slaves shall be divided into three equal parts; that of those parts be allotted, one to <em>John Thornton Fitzhugh </em>and <em>Margaret, </em>his wife, and the other to the sons <em>Richard Foote </em>and <em>William Haywood </em>Foote; and that <em>John Fitzhugh </em>and <em>Margaret, </em>his wife, account with <em>Richard Foote </em>and <em>William Haywood Foote, </em>for so much of one-third part of the said profits as exceeds her proportion of those profits.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">From which decree, the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-7\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">The <em>Chancellor </em>ought not, to have set aside the allotment of dower altogether, but should have corrected the excess only, as was done at common law, in the writ of admeasurement of dower. <em>Fitzherb. N. B. </em>149. The practice of the country, at that time certainly, and perhaps even now, in a, great measure, was to make these summary applications to the Court for dower, and no inconvenience resulted from it; for, the same justice: was done as if there had been a friendly bill and answer drawn; because, the parties interested always attended when they were of full age, and, when minors, some of their friends attended for them: added to which, the Court always exercised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>same controul over the allotment in the one case as in the other. In the present instance, the executor attended and sanctioned the act. The conduct of <em>Fitzhugh </em>and his lady, was perfectly fair, and has, indeed, operated to the benefit of the estate. If the dower is better than the orphan shares, it has happened from accidental causes subsequent to the allotment. Therefore, the enquiry as to the excess, should only be at the time of the allotment, and not at any subsequent period; for, the former allotment was made when the slaves were all alive and before the commissioners: This gave them an opportunity of judging of their value, which future commissioners cannot have. It was better to assign the dower all in one tract, than to have given the dowress parts in several tracts. This was more convenient both for herself and for the estate: Because, the other mode would have obliged her to have disturbed the purchasers, and would have turned them \u201cupon the estate, which would have been far more inconvenient than the plan which was pursued. The lands allotted to the heir were timber lands, daily growing in value; and, therefore, better for him than those which were cut down.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-9\">The County Court could not assign dower iri this summary way; for, it was contrary to the principles of natural justice, as the other parties had no opportunity of being heard. The event proves the propriety of the argument; for, the allotment was every way unequal. There is no similitude between the writ of admeasurement, and this case: Especially, as that was only applicable to lands, which are permanent in their nature, whereas slaves are liable to constant fluctuation.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b33-17\">[* See <em>Moore </em>et ux v. <em>Waller </em>et al. <em>2 </em>Rand. 48.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-12\">\n<em>PER CUR.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aoq\">The Court is of opinion, that the appellant, <em>Margaret, </em>is entitled to dower in all the slaves whereof her former husband, <em>Richard Foote, </em>was possessed at the time of his death, as the sale of any of them was not necessary for the payment of his debts; and, therefore, that the commissioners, appointed by the Court of Chancery to enquire whether more slaves were retained by the said <em>Margaret </em>than she was entitled to for dower, ought, \u2022in the valuation of all the slaves of the said <em>Richard Foote, </em>which was made by them, to have ascertained the value of the widow\u2019s third part of the said slaves, to have included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the value of the slave <em>Lucy, </em>said to have been appointed for, and delivered to Mrs. <em>Alexander, </em>the daughter of the said <em>Richard, </em>which they omitted to do: That an equal division of slaves, in number or value, is not always possible, and sometimes improper, when it cannot be exactly done without separating infant children from their mothers, which humanity forbids, and will not, be countenanced in a Court of Equity: so, that, a compensation for excess must, in such cases, be made and received in money: And, that under all the circumstances of the present case, as stated in the proceedings in this cause, between children and parents, a new division of the slaves of the said <em>Richard Foote, </em>ought not, after such a length of time, for a small excess, to have been ordered; especially as the whole of the dower slaves, with their increase, will belong to the appellees on the death of the said <em>Margaret, </em>their mother; so, that only a reformation of that which was wrong ought to have been decreed, and a return or delivery of a part of the slaves to the value of the excess, if that could be properly done; accounting, also, for profits, as usual in such cases, or, if that could not have been properly done, then a satisfaction in money, or in payment of interest for the amount of such excess, should have been directed: That the commissioner be directed to correct the error in the valuation of the whole slaves of the said <em>Richard Foote, </em>by adding thereto the value of the slave <em>Lucy, </em>and in case an excess shall then appear, to report whether the same can be rectified by a delivery of one or more of the dower slaves retained by the said <em>Margaret, to </em>the appellee, to the value of the excess; and, if that can be reasonably done, then they are to name the slave or slaves, and the appellants to be decreed to deliver to the appellees such slave or slaves, and account for profits from the time the appellees were entitled to the possession of their respective shares of the slaves of the said <em>Richard Foote; </em>or, if the excess cannot he restored or rectified in that manner, then, that a compensation in money be decreed to the appellees:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> That the claim of the appellants to one-third of the money received from the estate of \u2014 <em>Grayson, </em>for land sold by the said <em>Richard Foote, </em>in his life-time, and charged <em>by </em>the appellant, <em>J.
