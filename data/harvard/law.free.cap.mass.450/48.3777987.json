On January 21, 2005, the Land Court entered judgment in favor of the defendant and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s petition. The plaintiff appealed. The Appeals Court affirmed the Land Court\u2019s judgment. <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>MacCardell, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 646 (2006). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>argues that the defendant had actual knowledge of the utility easement by virtue of the fact that the poles were on her property and supplied electricity to her residence; therefore, the Land Court improperly dismissed its petition to amend the defendant\u2019s title. Because we conclude that the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the utility easement, we affirm the decision of the Land Court dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s petition to amend the defendant\u2019s title.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The judge found the following facts. Thomas Murray owned two parcels of land on Plum Hill Avenue in Duxbury. On June 5, 1936, Murray granted an easement to the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, Plymouth County Electric Company, for the installation of transmission lines. The easement deed did not provide compass directions, it merely mentioned that the land was located in Duxbury and that the pole lines could \u201center from land now or formerly of Plum Hill Avenue and cross to land now or formerly of Chester L. Churchill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">On April 13, 1944, William T. Reagan, administrator of the Murray estate, filed an action in the Land Court in order to register and confirm the title to the two parcels of land on Plum Hill Avenue. The smaller parcel, Lot 1, is located on the north side of Plum Hill Avenue and the larger parcel, Lot 2, is located on the south side of Plum Hill Avenue. On October 25, 1944, the Land Court entered a decree that confirmed and registered the two lots to Reagan. After the decree had been entered, the Plymouth registry district of the Land Court issued a certificate of title to Reagan. Both the certificate of title and the Land Court decree of registration state that <em>\u201clot 2 </em>is subject to pole easements as set forth in a deed given by Thomas Murray to the Plymouth County Electric Co., dated June 5, 1936, duly recorded.\u201d However, the defendant inhabits and owns Lot 1, which contains the actual poles. The poles supply electricity to both the defendant\u2019s property and the adjacent property owned by Alec and Leah Petro. Neither certificate of title refers to the poles or utility easement that the plaintiff is claiming.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The present dispute arose when Petro requested that the plaintiff increase the level of electrical service to his home. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>plaintiff determined that, in order to effectuate this increase in service, a transformer might need to be installed on a pole located on the defendant\u2019s property. When it conducted a search of the records to discern whether it had an easement, the plaintiff found that there was an easement on the certificate of title for Lot 2 but no easement on the certificate of title for Lot 1. Consequently, it petitioned the Land Court pursuant to G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 114, to amend the defendant\u2019s certificate of title for Lot 1 to hold the easement. The plaintiff contends that in 1944 the registration decree imposed the easement on the wrong lot, Lot 2 rather than Lot 1. The defendant argues that she purchased a title with no encumbrances and allowing the plaintiff to amend her certificate would impair that title.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The Land Court title examiner selected to conduct the title search of the properties found that the easement granted by Murray to Plymouth County Electric Company in 1944 should have been registered as an encumbrance on Lot 1 and not Lot 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The principal reason for establishing a land title registration system pursuant to G. L. c. 185 is to provide individuals with a means of ensuring that titles to land are indefeasible and certain. <em>Feinzig </em>v. <em>Ficksman, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 113, 116 (1997). <em>McDonnell </em>v. <em>Quirk, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 126, 129 (1986). The statutory mechanism for amending an error in the certificate of title is prescribed by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 114.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is well established that certificate of title holders and subsequent purchasers of registered land for value and in good faith take \u201cfree from all encumbrances except those noted on the certificate.\u201d G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>c. 185, \u00a7 46. Furthermore, with respect to easements, the general rule is that \u201c[i]n order to affect registered land as the servient estate, an easement must appear on the certificate of title.\u201d <em>Tetrault </em>v. <em>Bruscoe, </em>398 Mass. 454, 461 (1986). See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>418 Mass. 704, 710 (1994). However, the court has carved out two exceptions to the general rule: \u201c(1) if there were facts described on his certificate of title which would prompt a reasonable purchaser to investigate further other certificates of title, documents, or plans in the registration system; or (2) if the purchaser has actual knowledge of a prior unregistered interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711. It is undisputed that the utility easement was not noted on the defendant\u2019s certificate of title or referenced within other documents within the registration system. Therefore, we need only consider the \u201cactual knowledge\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The \u201cactual knowledge\u201d exception is based on the statutory good faith requirement in G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 46. Essentially, this means that for a title holder to benefit from the protections afforded by the land registration system, the title holder must be a good faith purchaser and must not possess actual knowledge of unregistered interests, i.e., easements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Calci </em>v. <em>Reitano, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 249 (2006). See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Knott, supra </em>at 711. A party seeking to encumber an owner\u2019s registered land on the ground that he or she had actual knowledge of the unregistered interest bears the burden of proving the actual knowledge. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Knott, supra </em>at 710-711. See <em>Sandwich </em>v. <em>Panciocco, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 556, 561 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The actual knowledge exception was first applied in <em>Killam </em>v. <em>March, </em>316 Mass. 646, 652 (1944), where the court held that a purchaser of registered land was subject to the encumbrance of an unregistered lease when the purchaser had actual notice through a reference to the lease in the purchase and sale agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Registered land owners forfeit the protections afforded by the registration system when they have actual notice because the \u201cLegislature did not intend to give certificate hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ers . . . an indefeasible title as against interests of which they had actual notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">One way to satisfy the actual knowledge exception is through \u201cdocumentation, whether registered or unregistered.\u201d <em>Calci </em>v. <em>Reitano, supra </em>at 250. In the <em>Calci </em>case, the defendant purchased registered land that had a certificate of title free of any encumbrances; however, the plaintiff claimed an easement over the defendant\u2019s land. <em>Id. </em>at 246. The Appeals Court stated, \u201cTo fulfil the actual notice exception to a recorded easement, it is not enough that the holder of registered title know that the land has been used in a . . . way that might indicate an easement, because this could be . . . [either] adverse use, which\u201d is not allowed under G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 53, or permissive use. <em>Id. </em>at 249-250. The Appeals Court held that no actual knowledge existed because there was no documentation registered or unregistered of the easement and no evidence that the defendant knew of any such documents. <em>Id. </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Essentially, the standard for determining actual knowledge is whether there is \u201c [i]ntelligible information of a fact, either verbally or in writing,\u201d or in documentation that can be registered or not. <em>Emmons </em>v. <em>White, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 54, 65 (2003), quoting <em>George </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>7 Allen 16, 18 (1863).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This standard makes sense in light of the statute\u2019s over-all purpose, which is to establish indefeasible titles for good faith purchasers who are unaware of unregistered encumbrances attached to their registered land.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In the present case, the plaintiff argues that <em>Feldman </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1142 (1989), is the controlling case. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>disagree. There, the plaintiffs sought to amend the defendants\u2019 certificate of title to include an easement. <em>Id. </em>at 1143. The easement was noted on the plaintiffs\u2019 transfer certificate of title but was not on the defendants\u2019 certificate. <em>Id. </em>at 1142-1143. However, before the defendants purchased the property Feldman told Souza that he had an easement. <em>Id. </em>at 1143. In addition, on the original registration plan and subsequent revisions there was an unlabelled strip that \u201clooks like a right of way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Appeals Court concluded that the defendants had actual knowledge of the easement. <em>Id. </em>at 1144. Unlike in the <em>Feldman </em>case, the defendant was not explicitly forewarned by the plaintiff that there was a utility easement before she purchased Lot 1. Moreover, no documents existed that explicitly reference an easement on Lot 1. In fact, if the defendant had tracked down the original certificate of title granted to Reagan in 1944, it would have referenced an easement on Lot 2, not Lot l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the <em>Feldman </em>case controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The plaintiff has not presented any proof that the defendant had actual knowledge of the easement and thus has not met its burden of proof. The plaintiff did not depose the defendant nor was she questioned during the Land Court proceeding. Instead, the plaintiff relies on the presence of utility poles on the defendant\u2019s property, the fact that she can turn her lights on every morning, and the fact that she receives a monthly utility bill to prove that the defendant had actual knowledge. Moreover, the plaintiff argues that \u201c[u]nlike an access case ... it is inconceivable that a utility company\u2019s installation and use of poles\u201d would ever be permissive rather than a claim of right. These arguments are unpersuasive. To meet the actual notice exception it is insufficient merely to claim that the holder of registered title knew that the land was being used in a way that might indicate an easement. The use may be adverse, which does not create an easement under G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 53, or a registered owner might have granted permissive use. See <em>Calci </em>v. <em>Reitano, supra </em>at 249-250. The plaintiff provided no evidence to support its assertion that the installation of poles would never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>be granted through permissive use. Moreover, the mere presence of a utility pole does not automatically place a registered landowner on notice that his or her property might be encumbered because the actual owner of a utility pole is not readily ascertainable and the average lay person may be unaware of the exact boundaries of the property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To meet the actual knowledge exception, there must be some intelligible oral or written information that indicates the existence of an encumbrance or prior, unregistered interest. <em>Emmons </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Land Court\u2019s decision, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s petition to amend the defendant\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We acknowledge receipt of an amicus brief of the Real Estate Bar Association for Massachusetts, Inc., and The Abstract Club.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The defendant contended that amending the certificate would impair her title because she would then be subject to at least a five-to-ten foot pole height increase and trees would have to be cut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">General Laws c. 185, \u00a7 114, states, in relevant part: \u201cNo erasure, alteration or amendment shall be made upon the registration book after the entry of a certificate of title . . . except by order of the court. A registered owner or other person of interest may apply by motion to the court upon the ground that . . . error or omission was made in entering a certificate . . . and the court may hear and determine the motion after notice to all parties in interest, and may order the entry of a new certificate . . . but this section shall not authorize the court to open original judgment of registration, and nothing shall be done or ordered by the court which shall impair the title or other interest of a purchaser holding a certificate for value and in good faith, or his heirs or assigns, without his or their written consent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The plaintiff conceded at the hearing that the defendant was a good faith purchaser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u201cActual knowledge\u201d and \u201cactual notice\u201d are treated the same when applying the actual knowledge exception articulated in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>418 Mass. 704, 711, 713 n.6 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\">See <em>Wild </em>v. <em>Constantini, </em>415 Mass. 663, 666 (1993) (actual knowledge where owner of parcel acknowledges the existence of right of way before land is registered that owner is bound by encumbrance even if it is not on subsequent registration certificate); <em>One-O-Six Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>66 Mass.

We decline to do so. A constructive knowledge test would not help the plaintiff because ownership of a utility pole is not readily ascertainable. A utility pole could be owned by a municipality or a utility company. See, e.g., G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 34A <em>(a) </em>(allowing municipalities to purchase light poles). See <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>449 Mass. 868, 872 (2007). Such a test would also subvert the goals of the land registration system.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
