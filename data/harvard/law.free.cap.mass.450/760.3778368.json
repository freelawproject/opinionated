L. c. 21E for later incurred response costs at the site. We conclude that the parent corporation is not directly liable as an operator of the site.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the parent corporation is not indirectly liable as an operator of the site where there are no grounds for piercing the corporate veil of the parent. We affirm the grant of summary judgment for all defendants, vacate the order denying the defendants\u2019 motions for litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees, and remand for further proceedings on that issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>On cross motions for summary judgment and associated motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, a judge in the Superior Court granted the defendant corporations\u2019 motions for summary judgment and denied the plaintiff property owner\u2019s cross motion, concluding that the defendants were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>liable to the plaintiff for response costs or damages, pursuant to G. L. c. 21E.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge also ruled that the defendants were not entitled to their attorney\u2019s fees and costs, pursuant to G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (/). The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment except on one point: it concluded that a genuine issue of material fact \u2014 concerning whether the corporate veil of New England Electric System (NEES), the defendant NG US 1, Inc.\u2019s, corporate predecessor, could be pierced to impose derivative liability \u2014 precluded entry of summary judgment, and accordingly vacated the entry of summary judgment for NG US 1, Inc., on that issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 474, 485 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We granted the defendants\u2019 applications for further appellate review without limitation, and have considered all of the issues briefed and argued before the Appeals Court. See, e.g., <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>429 Mass. 597, 606 n.11 (1999). For essentially the reasons stated by the motion judge, and those expressed by the Appeals Court in part 1 of its opinion, <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., supra </em>at 477-479, as well as those articulated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. 51, 64-67 (1998) (circumstances supporting direct liability of corporate parent as operator of facility), the order of the Superior Court judge concluding that NEES is not directly liable as an operator of the contaminated site pursuant to G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 5 (a) (1), was correct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Likewise, for essentially the reasons stated by the motion judge, and those expressed by the Appeals Court in part 3 of its opinion, <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., supra </em>at 485-488, the order of the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Court judge allowing the defendant Boston Gas Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment was correct. We proceed, focusing our discussion solely on two remaining issues: first, whether the judge correctly ruled that the undisputed facts present no occasion to disregard NEES\u2019s corporate form to impose operator liability indirectly; and second, whether the judge properly denied the defendants\u2019 motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">2. <em>Corporate background. </em>Apart from the attorney\u2019s fees and cost issue, the case is before us on appeal from the entry of summary judgment for the defendants. We consider the facts underlying those motions, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in their light most favorable to the plaintiff, the non-moving party.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 438 (1995); <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). We review the Superior Court judge\u2019s legal conclusions de nova. <em>Maffei </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>449 Mass. 235, 243 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In January, 2002, the plaintiff, Wayne Scott, trustee of 12 Woodbury Court Trust, purchased property in Salem, intending to develop and sell townhouses on it. During construction, he discovered \u201chighly volatile\u201d coal tar, or a similar contaminant, on the property that, for purposes of summary judgment, was assumed to have migrated from abutting land on Northey Street (Northey Street property). From 1850 to 1890, the Northey Street property had been owned and operated by Salem Gas Light Company (Salem Gas) as a \u201cgas works.\u201d The gas works facility ceased gas production in 1890, Salem Gas conveyed the property to a third party,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the facility was dismantled by 1906, at the latest. Salem Gas, incorporated in Massachusetts in 1847, existed as an independent gas utility company until at least 1927. It continued to manufacture gas at another site in Salem until 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In 1926, some thirty-six years after Salem Gas sold the Northey Street property, North Boston Lighting Properties (North Boston) began acquiring Salem Gas stock; by the following year, New England Power Association (NEPA), a corporate predecessor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>defendant NEES, had acquired almost six per cent of the voting power of outstanding shares of North Boston stock. By 1942 \u2014 more than fifty years after the Northey Street property had been sold \u2014 North Boston owned almost ninety-five per cent of Salem Gas, and by 1945, NEPA (through a holding company, Massachusetts Power and Light Associates [MPLA]) owned a substantial majority interest in North Boston. NEPA was reorganized in 1947, NEES was formed, and North Boston\u2019s assets (including its stock in Salem Gas) and obligations were transferred to NEES. Through these corporate transactions, Salem Gas became a subsidiary of NEES in 1947, and North Boston and MPLA were liquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In 1951, NEES formed an unincorporated \u201cgas division\u201d and, in 1953, arranged for consolidation of the gas operations of Salem Gas and two other companies \u2014 Gloucester Gas Light Company and Beverly Gas and Electric Company \u2014 into a new company, North Shore Gas Company. In March, 1964, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered NEES to divest itself of its gas operations. After its appeals were exhausted, on October 27, 1972, conditioned on regulatory approval, NEES sold all of its stock in North Shore Gas Company (of which the former Salem Gas was part) and two other companies (Lynn Gas Company and Mystic Valley Gas Company) to Eastern Gas &amp; Fuel Associates. The stock purchase agreement provided that the companies would be acquired by or combined with Eastern Gas &amp; Fuel Associates\u2019s subsidiary, Boston Gas Company (Boston Gas), one of the defendants in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">On January 23, 1973, Boston Gas, North Shore Gas Company, Lynn Gas Company, and Mystic Valley Gas Company executed an \u201cAgreement for Purchase and Sale of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities.\u201d Under that agreement, Boston Gas agreed to purchase all assets of North Shore Gas, Lynn Gas, and Mystic Valley Gas \u201cas then constituted,\u201d and to assume all liabilities of those three companies \u201cas then existing.\u201d The defendant, NG US 1, Inc., also known as National Grid USA (National Grid), subsequently became the corporate successor to NEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">3. <em>Indirect liability as an operator: piercing the corporate veil. </em>As we have said, NEES is not a present owner or operator of the Northey Street site, and is not directly liable to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>tiff under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 <em>(\u00e1) </em>(1). <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 824, 827 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass 365 (1995) (former lessee of site not liable as present operator). See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., supra </em>at 478 (rejecting proposition that entity remains \u201cpresent operator\u201d of site until hazardous wastes removed). The question we now consider is whether NEES, which acquired a controlling interest in Salem Gas many years after the environmental release, may be derivatively liable for Salem Gas\u2019s actions as a past operator under G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(2) or (5).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The conduct giving rise to liability under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(5), is \u201ccausing]\u201d or being \u201clegally responsible\u201d for the release or threat of release of oil or hazardous material. Under \u00a7 5 (a) (5), therefore, \u201ca past owner or operator of a site contaminated by oil can be held liable if that person \u2018caused\u2019 a release or threat of a release of oil from the site,\u201d or is otherwise legally responsible for it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 830. See G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 (a) (2) (liability rests on ownership or operation of a site \u201cat the time\u201d of storage or disposal). Assuming, for purposes of summary judgment, that Salem Gas \u2014 a past owner or operator \u2014 \u201ccaused or is legally responsible for a release,\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 (a) (5), the question is whether NEES \u2014 which acquired its interest in Salem Gas decades after both the environmental contamination and sale of the site \u2014 is indirectly liable for that release through application of corporate veil piercing concepts. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Neither Federal (CERCLA) nor State environmental laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>displace bedrock principles of corporate common law. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. 51, 61-62 (1998). See generally <em>Martignetti </em>v. <em>Haigh-Farr, Inc., </em>425 Mass. 294 (1997). One of the basic tenets of that body of law is that corporations \u2014 notwithstanding relationships between or among them \u2014 ordinarily are regarded as separate and distinct entities. See, e.g., <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., </em>432 Mass. 546, 555 (2000); <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 618 (1968). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">\u201cThus it is hornbook law that \u2018the exercise of the \u201ccontrol\u201d which stock ownership gives to the stockholders . . . will not create liability beyond the assets of the subsidiary. That \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the election of directors, the making of by-laws . . . and the doing of all other acts incident to the legal status of stockholders. Nor will a duplication of some or all of the directors or executive officers be fatal.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-6\"><em>Id., </em>quoting Douglas, Insulation from Liability Through Subsidiary Corporations, 39 Yale L.J. 193,196 (1929) (Douglas). Indeed, the concept that \u201ca parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of another corporation\u2019s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries,\u201d is \u201cdeeply \u2018ingrained in our economic and legal systems,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, supra </em>at 61, quoting Douglas, <em>supra </em>at 193, and assures that \u201cthe exercise of the \u2018control\u2019 which stock ownership gives to the stockholders . . . will not create liability beyond the assets of the subsidiary.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, supra </em>at 61-62. Also settled is the equilibratory concept that the corporate veil between parent and subsidiary corporations may be pierced when, \u201cinter alla, the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish certain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 62. Cf. 1 W.M. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations \u00a7 43, at 286-290 (rev. ed 2006) (\u201cThere is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>presumption of separateness that a plaintiff must overcome to establish liability by showing that a parent is employing a subsidiary to perpetrate a fraud or commit wrongdoing and that this was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury\u201d). \u201cNothing in CERCLA purports to rewrite this well-settled rule. ...\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, supra </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">In Massachusetts, the equitable doctrine of corporate disregard differs in no material respect from the description in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, supra </em>at 62-63, and nothing in G. L. c. 21E displaces the doctrine\u2019s established scope. In the environmental context, as in other contexts, corporate veils are pierced only in \u201crare particular situations,\u201d and only when an \u201cagency or similar relationship exists between the entities.\u201d <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., supra </em>at 619, 620. A veil may be pierced where the parent exercises \u201csome form of pervasive control\u201d of the activities of the subsidiary <em>\u201cand </em>there is some fraudulent or injurious consequence of the intercorporate relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619. See <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>298 Mass. 371, 381 (1937) (\u201cThe right and the duty of courts to look beyond the corporate forms are exercised only for the defeat of fraud or wrong, or the remedying of injustice\u201d). See also 1 W.M. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 43, at 292 (\u201cthe injured party must show some connection between its injury and the parent\u2019s improper manner of doing business \u2014 without that connection, even when the parent exercises domination and control over the subsidiary, corporate separateness will be recognized\u201d). Corporate formalities also may be disregarded \u201cwhen there is a confused intermingling of activity of two or more corporations engaged in a common enterprise <em>with substantial disregard of the separate nature of the corporate entities, </em>or serious ambiguity about the manner and capacity in which the various corporations and their respective representatives are acting\u201d (emphasis added). <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., supra </em>at 619. Stated more directly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>control, even pervasive control, without more, is not a sufficient basis for a court to ignore corporate formalities: \u201cThere is present in the cases which have looked through the corporate form an element of dubious manipulation and contrivance [and] finagling . . . .\u201d <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Multicon Constr. Corp., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 728, 736 (1991). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, supra </em>at 62 (veil piercing appropriate when, \u201cinter alla, the corporate form would otherwise be used to accomplish certain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud, on the shareholder\u2019s behalf\u201d); 1 W.M. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 43, at 296 (\u201calthough corporations are related, there can be no piercing of the corporate veil without a showing of improper conduct\u201d). Ultimately, the decision to disregard settled expectations accompanying corporate form requires a determination that the parent corporation directed and controlled the subsidiary, and used it for an improper purpose, based on evaluative consideration of twelve factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">\u201c(1) common ownership; (2) pervasive control; (3) confused intermingling of business assets; (4) thin capitalization; (5) nonobservance of corporate formalities; (6) absence of corporate records; (7) no payment of dividends; (8) insolvency at the time of the litigated transaction; (9) siphoning away of corporation\u2019s funds by dominant shareholder; (10) nonfunctioning of officers and directors; (11) use of the corporation for transactions of the dominant shareholders; and (12) <em>use of the corporation in promoting </em>fraud\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., supra </em>at 555 n.19, citing <em>Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Checkers, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 10, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1985) (categorizing <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In this case, the plaintiff makes no claim of \u201cfraudulent or injurious consequence\u201d under the first of the <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>prongs, but relies instead on the second prong: confused intermingling with \u201csubstantial disregard of the separate nature of the corporate entitles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He contends that during the period of 1931 to 1973, there is evidence of operational integration of the operations of NEBS and the entities to which business of Salem Gas succeeded, including financial operations. Beginning in 1951, he alleges that Salem Gas and its successors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>operated as an integrated part of NEES, without regard to corporate formality, and when the business of Salem Gas was sold, only NEES received the resulting funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Assuming, for summary judgment purposes, that Salem Gas\u2019s conduct, ownership, or operation of the Northey Street site during the 1800\u2019s meets the requirements of G.

See also <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., supra </em>at 620-621 (analyzing whether, in refusing to return bread racks, subsidiary corporation acted as parent corporation\u2019s agents). See generally 1 W.M. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 41.10, at 143-144 (while various jurisdictions apply different veil-piercing factors, they commonly require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>control with respect to transaction at issue, such that, at that time, controlled corporation lacked \u201cno separate mind, will or existence of its own\u201d). Cf. <em>Lily Transp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Royal Inst. Servs., Inc., </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 179, 188 (2005) (\u201cStockholders who are not involved in the improper transaction or wrongdoing are not liable even when the corporate veil is pierced\u201d). We agree with the Superior Court judge\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cin the absence of some very special facts, a parent corporation should not be held responsible by veil piercing for the acts of a subsidiary that occurred decades before the parent acquired the subsidiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">In the present case, the environmental releases occurred \u2014 and the contaminated property was sold \u2014 more than thirty years before North Boston purchased its first share of stock in Salem Gas, and before NEES\u2019s predecessor, NEPA, purchased its first share of stock in North Boston. The plaintiff does not suggest that NEPA\u2019s acquisition of North Boston was related to the then-discontinued operations at a site no longer owned by Salem Gas. Nor was there evidence that NEES had any ability to direct or control environmental measures on a site sold decades before, let alone any duty to do so. Indeed, G. L. c. 21E was enacted in 1983, ten years after NEES sold its interest in Salem Gas, and the plaintiff has identified no other source of statutory or common-law obligation of NEES (or of Salem Gas) during the period NEES had such an interest, to investigate, identify, or respond to possible environmental contamination from coal tar caused decades before, on property not owned by NEES or related entities. Cf. <em>John S. Boyd Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>992 F.2d 401, 408 (1st Cir. 1993) (parent corporations liable \u201cfor the oil gas waste created while they were linked to the Lynn Gas Co.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">We do not doubt that an important objective of G. L. c. 21E is prompt \u201cassessment, containment and removal,\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, of hazardous materials. Nor do we question that the party that caused the environmental contamination should be responsible for its cleanup. <em>Garweth Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>415 Mass. 303, 307 (1993). But it does no injustice to G. L. c. 21E to conclude that where the parent corporation lacked any interest in, and did not control, the subsidiary or its facility at the time of the acts giving rise to environmental liability, there is no occasion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>disregard its corporate form. Summary judgment properly was granted to NEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>General Laws c. 21E, \u00a7 4A <em>(f), </em>requires a court to award litigation costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a defendant if it finds \u201c(1) the plaintiff did not participate in negotiations or dispute resolution in good faith; (2) the plaintiff had no reasonable basis for asserting that the defendant was liable, or (3) the plaintiff\u2019s position with respect to the amount of the defendant\u2019s liability pursuant to the provisions of this chapter was unreasonable.\u201d The Superior Court judge, though properly granting summary judgment to the defendants on liability, denied their \u00a7 4A (/) litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees request. He rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments that (1) the plaintiff had no reasonable basis for asserting liability; and (2) the plaintiff failed to negotiate in good faith by failing to explain the legal basis for his claim, and by failing to provide detailed information on the contamination and remediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">As to the first point, the judge reasoned that the test whether the plaintiff \u201chad no reasonable basis for asserting that [the defendants were] liable,\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A, is akin to the inquiry whether a complaint would survive a motion to dismiss under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974): that is, based on the facts known to the plaintiff at the time the complaint was filed, whether it appeared \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief viewing the complaint.\u201d <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43, 45 (2004), quoting <em>Warner Lambert Co. </em>v. <em>Execuquest Corp., </em>427 Mass. 46, 47 (1998). He concluded, quoting <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), that given that the corporate history leading from Salem Gas to the defendants was \u201cfar from transparent,\u201d and notwithstanding that <em>John S. Boyd Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., supra </em>at 404 (addressing 1973 transaction between defendants), and Longview Fibre Co. vs. Boston Gas Co., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 92-10284-WD (D. Mass. Sept. 10, 1993), strongly signaled weakness in the plaintiff\u2019s claims with respect to Boston Gas, it could not be said \u201cthat when filed, \u2018it appeared] beyond doubt that the [Trust could] prove no set of facts in support of [its] claim which would entitle [it] to relief.\u2019 \u201d While recognizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>that the claims against NEES are \u201cadmittedly thinner,\u201d given that NEES did not acquire Salem Gas stock until well after the contaminated site was no longer owned by Salem Gas and the site was no longer operational, the judge concluded that the plaintiffs position was neither irrational nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">In evaluating the plaintiffs claims, the Superior Court judge applied the incorrect standard. At issue under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A, is not whether it is \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief viewing the complaint,\u201d <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., supra, </em>but rather whether \u201cthe plaintiff had no reasonable basis for asserting that the defendant was liable.\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (/). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>442 Mass. 127, 134 (2004) (Legislature could have, but did not, impose standard other than that provided in statute). Put another way, the question is whether, when the complaint was filed, application of the facts to existing law made it reasonably clear that the defendants were not liable under G. L. c. 21E. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>439 Mass. 266, 278 (2003); <em>Buddy\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 262-263 (2004). We do not presume to speculate about the conclusion the Superior Court judge might have reached if the \u201creasonable basis\u201d standard had been applied. Accordingly, we remand this case to the Superior Court to consider whether the plaintiff had \u201cno reasonable basis\u201d to assert liability on the part of Boston Gas or NEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In addition, G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (/) (1), requires an award of fees if the plaintiff \u201cdid not participate in negotiations or dispute resolution in good faith.\u201d In evaluating the plaintiff\u2019s actions in this regard, the Superior Court judge interpreted G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (a), as permitting, but not requiring, the plaintiff to give notice to the defendant prior to filing suit. Existing case law requires compliance with \u00a7 4A procedures prior to commencement of litigation. See, e.g., <em>Martignetti </em>v. <em>Haigh-Farr, Inc., </em>425 Mass. 294, 322 (1997) (\u201conly after such notice and procedures [under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (a) and (b),] may a civil action be brought\u201d); <em>Buddy\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Saugus, supra </em>at 261-262 (prelitigation notification \u201crequired of plaintiffs as a condition of initiating a lawsuit\u201d); <em>Rudnick </em>v. <em>Hospital Mtge. Group, Inc., </em>951 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>F. Supp. 7, 9 (D. Mass. 1996) (actual, though not perfect, notice sufficient to confer jurisdiction under G. L. c. 21E). On remand, the Superior Court judge may consider whether the mandatory nature of the predispute notice requirement affects the analysis regarding the comportment of the plaintiff\u2019s predispute activities with the requirements of good faith. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>On the facts contained in the summary judgment record, this case does not present a \u201crare situation,\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., supra </em>at 555, warranting piercing the corporate veil of NEES to impose indirect liability for the environmental wrongdoing by Salem Gas more than one century ago.

He alleges that after 1951, the business of Salem Gas was operated by NEES without regard to corporate formality. Among other things, he alleges that NEES and its various gas subsidiaries, including Salem Gas, shared employees, management, marketing, supply, operations and merchandising; that the president of Salem Gas and other NEES gas subsidiaries was also the head of the unincorporated gas division of NEES; and that final authority on important matters rested with NEES management. The question before us is not whether the corporate veil could be pierced at some point after 1931, but rather whether it should be pierced during the time of the release or threatened release of oil or hazardous material. While we need not decide whether the corporate veil could be pierced at any other point in time, we are dubious that the summary judgment record in this case, particularly lacking substantial evidence of impropriety or injurious consequences of the corporate relationship, would support application of the doctrine.

The plaintiff likewise has not suggested, prior to NEES\u2019s sale of its interest in Salem Gas in 1973, the source of NEES\u2019s alleged duty to assess and remediate possible environmental contamination on property owned (since the turn of the century) by a third party or parties with whom NEES apparently had no relationship at all.
