L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, may override local zoning requirements when a <em>commercial </em>use is included within an affordable housing development. We also consider claims of standing, including whether a municipal housing authority, which is an abutter to an affordable housing development, has standing to challenge the grant of a comprehensive permit. We conclude that one of the plaintiffs here had standing and that the zoning board of appeals (board) of Ipswich (town) did not exceed its authority in overriding local zoning requirements for the commercial component of the affordable housing development at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">The background of the case is as follows. The defendant YMCA of the North Shore, Inc. (YMCA), is a nonprofit organization that owns slightly over two acres of land<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> located at 108 and 112 County Road (on Routes 1A and 133) in Ipswich (property). The plaintiffs, Warren Jepson and the Ipswich Housing Authority (housing authority), are abutters to the property entitled to notice under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jepson owns, and resides on, property that is adjacent to 108 County Road. The housing authority owns property directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>across the street from the YMCA\u2019s property. On some of its property, the housing authority operates eighty units of subsidized elderly housing and fourteen units of affordable family housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In January, 2004, the YMCA applied to the board for a comprehensive permit to build forty-eight rental units of low and moderate income residential housing in two separate structures on the property,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to include within the structure at 112 County Road approximately 8,220 square feet of commercial space. The project is referred to as the Powder House Village development. Generally, the project involves the removal of existing structures on the property and the construction of two new structures, associated parking, pedestrian walkways, storm water drainage systems, and utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Each new structure will be three stories in height. The proposed structure at 108 County Road contemplates only residential use, comprising thirty units (six one-bedroom units, sixteen two-bedroom units, and eight three-bedroom units). The proposed structure at 112 Country Road will involve the construction of a mixed-use structure, consisting of both residential and commercial uses. The structure will contain eighteen residential units (four one-bedroom units, eight two-bedroom units, and six three-bedroom units). In addition, the structure will contain approximately 8,220 square feet of commercial space on the first floor. For this space, the YMCA proposes a YMCA child care facility that will occupy 3,970 square feet, a bank with a drive-up teller window, and a coffee shop or similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>establishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Vehicular access to the proposed structures will be by an existing driveway located at 110 County Road, property also owned by the YMCA, and on which the Ipswich Family YMCA is situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The property located at 108 County Road is included within the \u201crural residential A\u201d zoning district. The property at 112 County Road is located in the \u201chighway business\u201d zoning district. The parties did not provide a copy of the town\u2019s zoning bylaw in its entirety, but no one disputes the fact that \u201ccommercial components [or uses] are allowed in the underlying [h]ighway [b]usiness [district in the [bylaw].\u201d The development of the structure proposed for 112 County Road will violate two dimensional requirements of Ipswich\u2019s zoning bylaw \u2014 the minimum front setback of fifty feet and the minimum side setback of twenty feet for commercial uses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the east and north of the property lies a \u201clarge.wetland,\u201d comprising over fifty acres. The property directly abuts \u201cextensive streamways and border[s] vegetated wetlands\u201d and \u201cis an important and extensive system of wetlands.\u201d The water source \u201cnourishes the Ipswich River and Saltonstall Brook,\u201d and \u201cfunctions as a floodwater storage area.\u201d As such, in its application for a comprehensive permit, the YMCA also sought waivers from the bylaw that limit \u201cdevelopment and activity within a portion of the buffer zone [of the wetlands], so-called no-build and no-disturbance zones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-27\">After a series of public hearings, and its own extensive review, the board, in October, 2004, voted to grant the YMCA a comprehensive permit. The grant was made subject to the impositian of forty-two conditions. The conditions included the following: a statement of permissible and impermissible commercial uses for the commercial space at 112 County Road<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; a requirement that one hundred per cent of the dwelling units be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>reserved for rental to households earning no more than sixty per cent of the median household income for the Boston primary metropolitan statistical area; a requirement that all of the units remain affordable in perpetuity or as long as the property is used for residential purposes and does not comply with local zoning requirements, whichever is longer; requirements addressing and monitoring traffic; and a requirement that both structures, and all units therein, connect to town water and sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In addition, the board imposed a number of conditions concerning drainage and storm water management. The board required that the YMCA comply with the storm water management policy of the Department of Environmental Protection (department),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in the event that such compliance is neglected, provided that \u201cthe [t]own may perform necessary maintenance or repairs and the [YMCA] shall convey any easement necessary to implement such guidelines [for the operation and maintenance of the storm water management system] [and] reimburse the [t]own for any and all expense associated therewith.\u201d The board also provided that the conservation commission\u2019s order of conditions, or any applicable order of the department concerning the property, \u201cshall be made a part of [the] comprehensive permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the plaintiffs filed separate complaints in the Superior Court challenging the board\u2019s decision to grant the comprehensive permit. The cases were con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>solidated, and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The YMCA moved for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing. The plaintiffs filed oppositions, and cross motions for summary judgment, seeking to invalidate the board\u2019s grant of the permit on the ground that the board lacks authority under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, to waive local dimensional zoning requirements regulating commercial uses on property being used for the development of affordable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The judge initially noted that the parties submitted evidence of events that occurred after the board had granted the comprehensive permit. In particular, in December, 2004, the conservation commission issued an order of conditions for the project. Later, in July, 2005, after conducting its review of the project, the department issued a superseding order of conditions affirming the conservation commission\u2019s original order of conditions. The superseding order contained the following special condition, modifying the original order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">\u201cAt the time of construction, it shall be the applicant\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether any flooding caused by beaver dams[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] has altered the site conditions such that the \u25a0function or performance of any of the proposed water management structures would be adversely affected. If so, the applicant shall propose modifications, limited to the location and/or elevation of those elements of the storm water system, to [the department] and the conservation commission for review. If the modifications are acceptable to [the department], they shall be approved for construction. No construction shall take place until such approval is received in writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The approval states that, in the department\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe project as proposed and conditioned herein adequately protects the interests of the [Wetlands Protection] Act and [Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The judge went on to address standing. The judge noted that the plaintiffs, as abutters, ordinarily are entitled to a presumption of standing. Relying on the Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 337 (2005), <em>S.C., </em>447 Mass. 20 (2006), the judge concluded that because the board had not presented evidence warranting a conclusion that Jepson\u2019s property would not be diminished in value as a result of the project, Jepson had at least one valid basis for standing. Because one plaintiff had standing to appeal, the judge declined to decide whether a municipal housing authority that is an abutting landowner may be a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of standing. See <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667, 674-675 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The judge went on to reject the claim that the board lacked authority to override local zoning requirements as applied to a commercial component of an affordable housing development. The judge concluded that Jepson failed to provide sufficient evidence to raise a material question of fact as to the reasonableness and validity of the board\u2019s decision as it pertains to storm water management, drainage, and the effects of ongoing beaver activity on water levels and wetlands. The judge explained that Jepson\u2019s reliance on submissions to the department, in which the town\u2019s conservation agent and conservation commission dispute certain claims the YMCA\u2019s consultant made on the effect of ongoing beaver activity, did not create a disputed material question of fact because the board addressed the issue of beaver activity by expressly making any order or superseding order of conditions of the conservation commission or the department a special condition of the comprehensive permit. The judge further explained that Jepson\u2019s submissions were made to the department, which addressed the issue in a special condition which, due to the board\u2019s decision, is part of the comprehensive permit. The judge thus allowed the YMCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. Judgment entered affirming the grant of the comprehensive permit. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">1. <em>Standing. </em>Just before the judge\u2019s decision entered in this case, we granted an application for further appellate review of the Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Appeals of Andover, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 337 (2005). See 445 Mass. 1105 (2005). We rejected the statement (relied on by the Appeals Court in its <em>Standerwick </em>decision) in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 553 (1999), that the \u201csame standing requirements apply to appeals under G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40B appeals.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 28 (2006) <em>(Standerwick), </em>quoting <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, supra. </em>We stated: \u201cAlthough the Legislature chose in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, to incorporate the judicial review procedure established in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, the substantive standing requirements of G. L. c. 40A are neither the same as nor incorporated into G. L. c. 40B.\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 28. We concluded that \u201cthe diminution of real estate values is not an injury to an interest that G. L. c. 40B was intended to protect,\u201d and was not, therefore, an injury that could confer standing on the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In <em>Standerwick, </em>however, we explained that the term \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d as used in both G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40B, should be interpreted in a like manner. <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 27. We went on to say, \u201c[specifically, a \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 as that term is used in both statutes must assert \u2018a plausible claim of a definite violation of a private right, a private property interest, or a private legal interest.\u2019 ... Of particular importance, the right or interest asserted must be one that the statute under which a plaintiff claims aggrievement intends to protect.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 27-28. We also went on to note that the rebuttable presumption afforded to abutters \u2014 that they are \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d under G. L. c. 40A, see note 4, <em>supra </em>\u2014 \u201capplies with equal force in the context of challenges to comprehensive permits issued pursuant to G. L. c. 40B.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. \u201cOnce the presumption is rebutted,[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] the burden rests with the plaintiff to prove standing, which requires that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u2018establish \u2014 by direct facts and not by speculative personal opinion \u2014 that his injury is special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 132 (1992). \u201cOnce a defendant \u2018challenges the plaintiff\u2019s standing and offers evidence to support the challenge ... the jurisdictional issue is to be decided on the basis of the evidence with no benefit to the plaintiff from the presumption.\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra, </em>quoting <em>Barvenik, supra </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">a. In light of our <em>Standerwick </em>decision, the judge\u2019s basis for conferring standing on Jepson, a diminution in value of his real estate, is erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 21. We inquire, therefore, whether other valid bases for standing remain. The judge concluded that the board correctly demonstrated that \u201cthe remaining interests identified by Jepson are either not legally cognizable ... or that [it] adduced sufficient evidence to make the presumption [afforded to abutters] recede and to require Jepson to adduce evidence establishing the existence of a material question of fact [which he] failed to do.\u201d The judge did not explain or point to anything in the record to support these conclusions. Because the case is here on a grant of summary judgment, we review the material evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, here, Jepson. See <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). An examination of the record establishes that Jepson sufficiently demonstrated that he has standing to challenge the grant of the comprehensive permit based on flooding to his property because, under <em>Standerwick, </em>flooding constitutes an injury to an interest that G. L. c. 40B was intended to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">As explained by the conservation commission, in general terms, the project involved not only the construction of two new structures, but also the filling of surfaces on the YMCA\u2019s property that serve as a storm water detention function adjacent to a critical and sizeable wetlands area. That filling, combined with beaver activity on nearby streamways, raises issues of downstream flooding. Downstream \u201cthe streamflow is constrained by small culverts under the driveways to the Jepson property before it reaches the highway culvert [and, ultimately, the Ipswich River].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>While the prevention of flooding (and the retention of flood storage capacity) in land constituting, and immediately adjacent to, wetlands are interests protected and regulated by, in the first instance, the department and the Wetlands Protection Act, G. L. c. 4QB permits the waiver only of <em>local </em>requirements, not State laws. Although the town may impose (and here did impose) even stricter wetlands protections that appropriately may be waived by the local board, it does not follow that the interests served by such protections are thereby excluded from the c. 40B scheme. The fact that under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, a board, on receipt of an application for a comprehensive permit, \u201cshall forthwith notify each such local board [that would otherwise act with respect to the application], of the filing of such application by sending a copy thereof to such local boards for their recommendations,\u201d and \u201cshall take into consideration the recommendations of the local boards,\u201d illustrates the Legislature\u2019s intent that the interests protected by local boards not only be recognized, but also be considered, during the comprehensive permit process. Thus, the interests of the conservation commission, and the department, in the prevention of flooding in, bordering, or affecting an integral and comprehensive wetlands system adjacent to an affordable housing development are interests that the G. L. c. 40B statutory scheme intends to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The YMCA acknowledges that, as an abutter, Jepson is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under G. L. c. 40B, and therefore has standing to appeal from the grant of the comprehensive permit. <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 33. To rebut the presumption, the YMCA submitted two affidavits of an engineer and senior project manager to the effect that the project would have no negative impact on flooding in the critical wetlands area. The YMCA contends that Jepson was required to rebut its evidence with expert evidence, and because he did not, he lacks a valid basis for standing. The YMCA also argues that, because the board imposed various conditions on the project calculated to alleviate the issue of flooding, Jepson lacks standing to challenge the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The latter argument of the YMCA was rejected in <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 723 (1996). With respect to the issues of parking and traffic in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Marashlian </em>case, the court explained, \u201c[t]hat the judge ultimately found the reduced number of [parking] spaces provided by the variance to be adequate does not defeat a claim of injury to legal rights of the type intended to be protected by the zoning enabling act. Such a finding goes to the plaintiffs\u2019 success on the merits and <em>not to their ability to challenge acts of the board,\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>The same can be said for the issue of flooding in this case. That flooding can be controlled, or alleviated, has no bearing on standing as long as Jepson \u201cput forth credible evidence to substantiate his allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721. Indeed, \u201c[a] review of standing based on \u2018all the evidence\u2019 does not require that the factfinder ultimately find a plaintiff\u2019s allegations meritorious. To do so would be to deny standing, after the fact, to any unsuccessful plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Jepson \u201cput forth credible evidence to substantiate his allegations\u201d of flooding to his property, including reliance on the expertise and findings of the conservation commission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-20\">Jepson provided an affidavit in which he states that he is an abutter to the property. He explains that beaver dams constructed after July of 2004 have raised the baseline water level on his property so that \u201cany moderate rainfall\u201d results in the flooding of the property at 108 County Way and of his own property. He submitted photographs illustrating the flooding. As previously noted, there was evidence in the record concerning the storm water detention function of the property and the concern of downstream flooding from filling the property and from nearby beaver activity. In addition, Jepson submitted copies of documents from the conservation commission to the department. These documents, dated in May and June of 2005 (well after the grant of the comprehensive permit), discuss the existence, and effect, of nearby dams, and, in particular, one dam located on property owned by the town and by the YMCA, and another dam located on property owned by Jepson. The documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>point out the change in character of the dam located on property owned by the town and the YMCA. The documents also state that the effect of one of these dams has been to raise water elevation, which necessarily has an impact on the project\u2019s storm water detention function and affects flood control in the area, and that \u201ca redesign of the drainage and proposed bank restoration is in order.\u201d Based on this evidence, Jepson presented sufficient proof on the issue of flooding to his property as a result of the project to warrant a conclusion that he is a \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d entitled to appeal from the grant of the comprehensive permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">b. Although it is only necessary to determine that one plaintiff has standing to challenge the board\u2019s action, see <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667, 674-675 (1975), we turn next to the question whether a municipal housing authority that is an abutter to the project may be a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of standing under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. The housing authority is a municipal housing authority organized under the provisions of G. L. c. 121B. Municipal housing authorities are bodies politic and corporate, and are analogous to municipal corporations. G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 1. See <em>Finance Comm\u2019n of Boston </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>343 Mass. 754, 763 (1962). Municipal housing authorities are a creation of a municipality, and their operations are interwoven with the management and interests of the municipality in which they function. See <em>id. </em>at 764. They are also subject to substantial statutory regulation and public control. <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Zoning Agent of Bellingham, </em>357 Mass. 757, 761 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-30\">In <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham </em>v. <em>Hingham Campus, LLC, </em>438 Mass. 364, 368 (2003), we concluded that a municipal planning board lacked standing under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, because \u201c[mjunicipal boards and officers are not \u2018person[s]\u2019 for purposes of standing.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 164, 166 (1994), and cases cited (in term \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d \u201cthe word \u2018person\u2019 ordinarily does not describe the State or its subdivisions\u201d). These cases do not involve a situation where the municipal body actually owns land in a form similar to a municipal corporation\u2019s abutting the proposed development. Based on this status, the housing authority qualifies as a \u201cperson\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>for standing purposes. This conclusion distinguishes a housing authority from a board or agency of a municipality (as was the situation in the <em>Hingham </em>case) and is consistent with the directive that the term \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d should not be construed narrowly. See <em>Marotta </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Revere, </em>336 Mass. 199, 204 (1957). See also <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 27 (term \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d as used in both G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40B, should be interpreted in like manner). It is also consistent with those provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, which define \u201c[pjarties in interest\u201d as \u201cabutters,\u201d and the presumption afforded to such abutters that they are \u201cpersons aggrieved.\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 33 &amp; n.17. However, a municipal housing authority\u2019s status as a \u201cperson\u201d for standing purposes does not establish its \u201caggrievement.\u201d The YMCA argues that the housing authority does not qualify as a \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d We need not take up this issue because Jepson has standing to contest the board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">2. <em>Waiver of local zoning requirements to commercial component of affordable housing development. </em>We turn now to the central issue in this case, whether the board, when granting the comprehensive permit, could override dimensional requirements (pertaining to front and side setbacks) for a commercial use included within the affordable housing development. We conclude that when commercial use is permitted on the property to be developed under the local zoning bylaw or ordinance, the board, under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, has that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The plaintiffs do not dispute that when, as is the case with the property at 112 County Road, an affordable housing development is proposed to be located in a commercial zone or zone that permits commercial use, the development may contain mixed residential and commercial uses. They maintain, however, that the commercial component of the development must conform to all local requirements and regulations concerning commercial use, and that the proposed commercial component in this case does not comply with certain dimensional requirements governing commercial use. Thus, the plaintiffs conclude that the YMCA needs to obtain a variance to waive those requirements, and cannot merely rely on the grant of a comprehensive permit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>accomplish that result.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that the judge impermissibly expanded the scope of G. L. c. 40B, because the plain language and intent of the statute make clear that waivers of local requirements are intended only to benefit affordable housing, or residential use, and not commercial development and use.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Affordable housing developments do not solely benefit those who qualify for the housing. See <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 517 n.7 (2007) (\u201cTo be eligible for a comprehensive permit under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, it is \u2018commonly understood\u2019 that in a residential development with both affordable and market-rate units, at least [or only] twenty-five per cent of the planned project must be set aside for owners or renters with incomes that do not exceed eighty per cent of the area median income\u201d). Flexibility, such as that demonstrated by the minimum percentage of affordable housing units required under the statutory scheme, promotes the continued development of affordable housing by providing economic incentives (such as financial cross-subsidization derived from rental income of market-rate units) to developers so they can include in their projects needed affordable housing. Extending that flexibility to allow an <em>incidental </em>commercial component under the umbrella of the comprehensive permit provides additional incentives, including economic, to developers to establish affordable housing, and serves to further the development of needed affordable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">This conclusion is consistent with the statutory scheme and the Legislature\u2019s intent. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354 (1973) (G. L. c. 40B \u201cmust be construed in a manner that effectuates its intent\u201d). Nothing in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, expressly prohibits the inclusion of incidental commercial uses (when such uses are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>permitted on the proposed property by zoning ordinance or bylaw) to complement an affordable housing development. Further, the Legislature took into account that developers of affordable housing need to generate a reasonable economic return on their investment. This consideration is significant as illustrated by the right of appeal afforded to developers under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, when a developer\u2019s application for a comprehensive permit is denied \u201cor is granted with such conditions and requirements as to make the building or operation of such housing uneconomic.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It has been \u201clong recognized that the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, is \u2018to provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevented the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 28-29, quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra. </em>\u201cThe statute reflects the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment that a crisis in housing for low and moderate income people demands a legislative scheme that requires the local interests of a town to yield to the regional need for the construction of low and moderate income housing, particularly in suburban areas.\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 29. Our conclusion represents yet another instance where a yield to the regional need for affordable housing is appropriate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Some final points are in order. Contrary to Jepson\u2019s suggestion, the judge applied the correct legal standard to review the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. See <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 639 (1970) (decision of board \u201ccannot be disturbed unless it is based on a legally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary\u201d). The judge\u2019s statement that Jepson did not demonstrate that the development \u201cis a subterfuge for commercial development\u201d is not reasonably understood to mean that Jepson was obligated to prove subterfuge. If the proposed housing development were a pretext for commercial development, that would have been a reason to challenge the board\u2019s decision. The fact that the board did not explain how the commercial uses would enhance the development does not make its decision unreasonable, capricious, or arbitrary. Finally, in contesting the determination that the commercial use within the project comprises less than fourteen per cent of the development, Jepson fails to take into account the fact that the proposed structures are three stories in height.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">3. <em>Disputed issues of material fact. </em>We reject Jepson\u2019s claim that the judge should have vacated the grant of the comprehensive permit on the ground that disputed issues of material fact remain pertaining to the effectiveness of the YMCA\u2019s storm water management system because of beaver activity that postdated the board\u2019s action on the application. The judge\u2019s decision reflects that she did not \u201cignore\u201d Jepson\u2019s submissions. Jepson\u2019s submissions were reviewed by the department, which ultimately concluded that its superseding order of conditions would adequately protect the interests of the Wetlands Protection Act. Jepson has not shown that the judge\u2019s decision, essentially accepting the department\u2019s position on this point, was unreasonable, capricious, or arbitrary. See <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, supra </em>at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The exact amount of land is disputed. The YMCA states that the property comprises 2.36 acres, but Jepson points to survey plans filed by the YMCA that indicate the land comprises only 2.02 acres. Any discrepancy is not material to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-14\">As explained in <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Mass. 20, 33 n.17 (2006) (Standerwick):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cHearings on an application for a comprehensive permit are held subject to the provisions of G.
