Later that morning, Turner\u2019s badly battered body was discovered on the lawn of a house located in the same neighborhood. Mathews was charged with Turner\u2019s murder and, following a five-day jury trial, was convicted of murder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty. He now appeals that conviction, as well as the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">On appeal, he asserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of the inconclusive results of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing at trial created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. He also contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to the introduction of the inconclusive DNA evidence; to move to dismiss the indictment based on alleged misconduct by the Commonwealth in its grand jury presentation; and to move to suppress a statement made by Mathews purportedly given before he had been advised of his Miranda rights. After considering Mathews\u2019s arguments and undertaking a complete review of the trial record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we affirm the conviction and the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">1. <em>Trial. </em>We summarize the evidence presented at the trial. In June, 2004, Turner was living with his sister, Linda, at 181 Ninigret Avenue in Mashpee. On June 22, Linda decided to host a cookout for a few friends. Among those invited was Mathews, Linda\u2019s former boy friend. Mathews had known Turner for only a short time, but the two had become close. It was Turner who called Mathews to invite him to the cookout that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Mathews arrived between 10 a.m. and noon, and those at the small gathering began to drink vodka and beer. They continued to do so for the remainder of the day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the early evening, Linda roasted a chicken in the kitchen and the party continued. By 9:30 p.m., the crowd had dwindled. Only Linda, her live-in boy friend Wayne Dougherty, Mathews, and Turner remained. Around that time Mathews and Turner left on foot for Dino\u2019s Restaurant and Sports Bar (Dino\u2019s), a local establishment, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Linda and Dougherty headed to bed. Mathews was wearing a pair of red shorts when he left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">On their way to Dino\u2019s, Mathews and Turner stopped at a market to purchase two packs of cigarettes and a small bottle of Sambuca liqueur. After arriving at Dino\u2019s, they sat at the bar for the remainder of the evening. Mathews introduced Turner to the bartender as his friend. Each ordered shots of bourbon and beer, leaving the bar only once to go outside for a cigarette. While there, both Mathews and Turner kept to themselves and seemed to be having a good time.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The bartender observed the two leaving Dino\u2019s just past midnight to begin the short walk back to 181 Ninigret Avenue. Both had consumed a great deal of alcohol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At some point during this walk, they became involved in a heated discussion. Several witnesses reported seeing a small African-American man (matching Mathews\u2019s appearance), and a taller Caucasian man with a ponytail (matching Turner\u2019s appearance) arguing along Ninigret Avenue around 1 a.m.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">When Mathews arrived back at 181 Ninigret Avenue, he was agitated and excited. He opened the door to the room where Linda and Dougherty were sleeping three times. Each time he yelled to Linda and then slammed the door shut. He shouted, alternatively: \u201cI need your help\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m going to . . . kill your brother\u201d; and \u201cHe\u2019s trying to leave me.\u201d Linda, thinking this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>exchange was little more than liquor-induced bluster, replied that her brother was a \u201cgrown man\u201d who could go wherever he wanted, and went back to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Turner\u2019s body was found at approximately 6:40 a.m. on June 23, by a neighbor on an area of lawn at 152 Ninigret Avenue, approximately 700 feet from Linda\u2019s house. A police officer responding to the scene noticed that Turner had suffered severe facial and head trauma. His hands were outstretched over his head, his black jeans were pulled down, his pockets were turned out, and his boots were tied together, apparently to facilitate the dragging of the body. Bloodstains located by investigators indicated that he had been dragged from an area closer to 181 Ninigret Avenue. The blood spatter evidence found in the area suggested that the victim was struck with a club-like instrument numerous times, including when he was lying on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">A thirty-inch long branch, between one and one and one-half inches in diameter and weighing approximately one and one-half pounds, was eventually found in the woods near 181 Ninigret Avenue. The branch had dried bloodstains and hairs on it. DNA testing revealed that the blood on the branch matched the victim\u2019s blood, leading the police to conclude that it was the murder weapon. An autopsy revealed that the victim suffered multiple fractures of the jaw, nose, temporal bone, and lower skull. These injuries were caused, at least in part, by ten or more blows to the head with the branch. The cause of death was blunt trauma to the head and face, resulting in brain bmising, hemorrhaging, and swelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Linda awoke around 4 a.m. on the morning of June 23, to use the bathroom. As she walked through her living room, she encountered Mathews sitting on a white ottoman. She asked him where her brother was, and Mathews told her that \u201che must have got lucky; he left with two Jamaicans and some girl.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Linda returned to bed. She awoke again around 6 a.m., and found Mathews sitting in a recliner in the living room. He got up and started pacing back and forth, muttering, \u201cGot to go, got to go.\u201d Linda\u2019s boss, Michael Mayne, arrived at approximately 7 a.m. to drive her to work, and Mathews asked for a ride across town to Mashpee Village. Mayne agreed, and Mathews and Linda got into his red pickup truck. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Linda and Mayne noted that Mathews\u2019s face had dried blood on it, which appeared to have dripped from a recently opened scab on the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">After Mayne pulled out of the driveway of 181 Ninigret Avenue, he proceeded down the road toward 152 Ninigret Avenue. Police cruisers were present, and the area had all of the obvious markings of a crime scene. As they drove by, Mathews took a quick look at the scene, and then shielded his face. His behavior caught the attention of an investigating officer, who noted the registration number of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Mayne drove Mathews to 28 Wampanoag Drive in Mashpee Village, the residence of Shauna Mathews, his former wife, and her housemate Shannon Price. Price saw Mathews come in early on the morning of June 23, and head to the bathroom. She noted that he was acting in an unusual fashion, and observed him leaning over the bathtub rinsing out some red clothing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Meanwhile, the police continued their investigation at the crime scene. As Dougherty left 181 Ninigret Avenue and headed for work, he too noticed the ongoing investigation. He walked up the street, spoke with the investigating officers, and identified the victim as Turner. At the time, Dougherty was wearing a white T-shirt that had two small red spots on it. The police asked if they could have the shirt for testing, and Dougherty complied with their request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Later on that same morning, Mathews was taken into custody on an unrelated charge. At the Mashpee police station, he was met by Trooper Richard Cosgrove of the Massachusetts State police and Detective Robert R. Waterfield of the Mashpee police department. Mathews was given Miranda warnings, which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>waived, and agreed to speak to the officers. Mathews told them that he and the victim left Dino\u2019s separately, and that he arrived back at 181 Ninigret Avenue about 11:30 p.m., where he fell asleep watching television. According to Mathews, he later awoke when Turner returned to the house and asked him for money. Mathews refused to give Turner any money, at which time Turner became angry and \u201cshoved\u201d him in the back. After this, Mathews admitted yelling into Linda\u2019s room about wanting to \u201ckill [Linda\u2019s] brother,\u201d but claimed that Turner then left as a passenger in an automobile, perhaps with a \u201cgirl from Dino\u2019s.\u201d Mathews made no mention of any \u201cJamaicans.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The Commonwealth also presented testimony from a crime scene investigator employed by the State police crime laboratory (crime lab). His testimony focused on the results of multiple orthotolidine tests, which are screening tests to determine whether blood is present in or on a given substance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The results indicated that blood was present in a series of significant locales. The white ottoman where Linda found Mathews at 4 a.m. on the morning of June 23 tested positive for the presence of blood, as did the blue recliner where he was sitting two hours later. The passenger seat of Mayne\u2019s pickup truck, where Mathews sat that morning, tested positive for the presence of blood, as did the corresponding floor area in the truck. The bathtub, shower curtain, and the bathroom carpet in front of the bathtub at 28 Wampanoag Drive all tested positive for the presence of blood, as did the red shorts that Mathews had worn the previous night and early that morning. Swabs obtained from Mathews\u2019s hands also revealed the presence of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Defense counsel responded to this testimony by questioning the significance of orthotolidine testing, and the sufficiency of the investigation into the blood evidence. He elicited testimony that the test only confirmed that blood was present, not whose blood or even what type of blood it was. He characterized the test as \u201ca dinosaur, [part of] the dark ages,\u201d in his questioning of the crime scene investigator, and got him to confirm that the test was only a \u201cgood first step,\u201d best supplemented with further forensic analysis, including DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The Commonwealth subsequently introduced testimony from a DNA chemist also employed by the crime lab. She conducted DNA testing on samples that were collected by the crime scene investigators. The majority of the results were inconclusive in one way or another. For example, DNA testing of the blood sample from Mathews\u2019s red shorts was \u201cinconclusive\u201d when the results were compared with his DNA and the DNA of the victim. According to the chemist\u2019s testimony, the significance of an inconclusive result is \u201cthat there was just not enough DNA information in the DNA profile that we obtained to either include or exclude those two individuals.\u201d DNA testing of the blood found on the murder weapon established that it belonged to the victim, but the chemist was unable to obtain a DNA profile from the other end of the branch from which the weapon was wielded. DNA tests of the swabs taken between the fingers of Mathews\u2019s right hand, between the fingers of his left hand, from his right palm, and from underneath the fingernails of his hand revealed a mixture of DNA from at least two sources. The results indicated that the major contributor of the DNA was Mathews. The DNA profile of the minor contributor, however, yielded \u201cinclusive\u201d results when compared with the DNA of the victim, also meaning that \u201cthe minor profile in the mixture didn\u2019t contain enough DNA to make a conclusion, either an inclusion or exclusion of the DNA profile of Scott Turner.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The State chemist also tested swabbings from underneath the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>victim\u2019s fingernails, and found that they contained a mixture of DNA from at least three individuals. The major contributor was found to be the victim himself, the minor profiles in the mixture were inconclusive as to Mathews, but the source of one profile may have been from the person who was the major DNA contributor to one of the blood spots on Dougherty\u2019s T-shirt. See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The chemist indicated that not all the blood samples (or other evidence) gathered at the scene were in fact tested for DNA because time and manpower shortages required that her judgment be used in deciding which samples should be tested. On cross-examination, defense counsel underscored the failure of the DNA tests to link Turner and Mathews: the tests could neither establish that Turner\u2019s blood was found on Mathews, nor that Mathews\u2019s blood was found on Turner. The cross-examination of another Commonwealth witness revealed that the testing of Dougherty\u2019s white T-shirt had not been completed until just before the trial actually started, suggesting that the police had quickly focused on Mathews and neglected to investigate other possible suspects thoroughly.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In their closing arguments, both defense counsel and the prosecutor referenced the DNA evidence. Defense counsel pointed out that although Mathews was bleeding from his nose, the Commonwealth did not find his blood at the scene of the murder or on the victim, and that while the Commonwealth tested the DNA of the blood found on Mathews\u2019s hands, it did not belong to the victim. Defense counsel also stressed that the source of the major DNA profile on Dougherty\u2019s white T-shirt \u2014 someone other than Mathews \u2014 was determined to be a potential contributor to one of the minor profiles of DNA found under the victim\u2019s fingernails. The prosecutor responded, \u201c[T]he DNA did not exclude Scott Turner as possibly a potential contributor to the DNA on the defendant\u2019s hands. They simply said there wasn\u2019t enough there to confirm that. But it was not an exclusion. And remember carefully during your deliberations because that is important.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>DNA evidence. </em>Mathews claims that the introduction of \u201cinconclusive\u201d (or \u201cinclusive,\u201d see note 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number><em>supra) </em>DNA evidence at his trial was highly prejudicial and created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. His trial counsel did not object to the introduction of that evidence. A review of the trial transcript indicates that Mathews\u2019s trial counsel welcomed the testimony of the DNA chemist, as part of an overarching trial strategy. Mathews now contends that this strategy, and the resultant decision not to object to the inconclusive DNA evidence, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">When \u201cevaluating a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a capital case, we consider whether there was error at trial and, if so, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaboriault, </em>439 Mass. 84, 90 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Candelario, </em>446 Mass. 847, 854 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 &amp; n.1 (1992). \u201cThroughout the course of a trial, defense counsel is called on to make numerous tactical decisions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>428 Mass. 362, 369 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlos, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 929, 932 (1995). We have noted that, in retrospect, \u201c[i]t is far too easy to examine a transcript and point to ways to \u2018do it better.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 333 (2000). We therefore give deference to those tactical decisions, unless they were \u201cmanifestly unreasonable when made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 827 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 822 (1998). A list of post hoc, subjective critiques of trial counsel\u2019s decisions is insufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance, absent a showing that trial counsel engaged in an unreasonable strategy that likely influenced the jury\u2019s conclusions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, supra. </em>Mathews cannot make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Trial counsel presented a multipart defense on behalf of his client. First, he criticized the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation of the murder by eliciting testimony suggesting that the crime scene was insufficiently examined, that investigators improperly concentrated on Mathews to the exclusion of all other suspects, and that orthotolidine testing relied on by the Commonwealth should have been merely the first step leading to further DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>testing that was not done on a number of the samples collected.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, trial counsel sought to show that, despite evidence that Mathews was bleeding only hours after the murder and that the victim\u2019s blood was found throughout the crime scene, there was a complete lack of physical or forensic evidence tying him to the murder. Third, he attempted to demonstrate that Linda and Dougherty either played a role in the murder or were engaged in a cover-up to protect the true culprit. Trial counsel\u2019s decision not to object to the testimony of the DNA chemist furthered this defense strategy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">With respect to his challenge to the adequacy of the investigation, defense counsel first elicited testimony from the crime scene investigator that orthotolidine tests were merely a \u201cgood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>first step\u201d in forensic testing, often used to determine which materials should be collected for subsequent DNA testing. He then established that thirty-four items tested positive for the presence of blood and were collected for further testing. Finally, he elicited testimony from the DNA chemist that, given the time and resource constraints on the State crime lab, only twenty-one of the thirty-four items collected were tested, and the results of the samples that were tested were largely \u201cinconclusive.\u201d He further established that the major contributor of the DNA found on Dougherty\u2019s T-shirt later in the morning of the murder was a potential contributor to the DNA found underneath the victim\u2019s fingernails, yet, despite this seemingly relevant potential link, the Commonwealth was unable to identify the source of that DNA. He elaborated on this point in his cross-examination of a crime lab administrator, pointing out that the Commonwealth had not cross-checked the DNA profile found on Dougherty\u2019s T-shirt and under the victim\u2019s fingernails against the national Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) until just before the trial began.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, testimony regarding the DNA testing allowed defense counsel to argue in his closing that the Commonwealth conducted \u201cbad investigatory work,\u201d particularly by \u201cfocus[ing] on one person to the exclusion of all others\u201d in the face of physical evidence suggesting that another individual may have been involved. The chemist\u2019s testimony also allowed trial counsel to press the second prong of his defense by showing that, despite the relatively large amount of blood-related evidence recovered, none of the DNA testing could reliably link Mathews to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Finally, defense counsel attempted to show that Linda and Dougherty may have participated in a cover-up to conceal the identity of the culprit and frame Mathews. To that end, he established that the investigators canvassed and used canines to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>search for potential evidence after the murder, but did not locate the murder weapon at that time. Instead, eight days after the murder Linda and Dougherty informed investigators that they had discovered some additional blood evidence in their home, which proved not to be the case. However, when investigators arrived they happened to find the branch that was used as the murder weapon in a thicket of bushes only fifty feet from 181 Ninigret Avenue; In addition, he elicited testimony that two weeks after the murder, Linda and Dougherty telephoned police to report that they had discovered a black shirt (alleged by Linda to be in the victim\u2019s possession on the night of the murder) tucked in a recliner where Mathews was sitting on the morning of June 23. This was the same recliner that investigators had searched extensively for blood evidence that same morning without uncovering the shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Defense counsel used this and other evidence to suggest that Linda and Dougherty may have collaborated on the stories they told to police, and to imply that Linda and Dougherty concealed evidence in the immediate wake of the murder, only to later \u201crediscover\u201d that evidence to ensure that Mathews remained the focus of the investigation. The DNA testimony furthered this theory, by demonstrating that because the forensic evidence did not reliably link Mathews to the murder, the Commonwealth\u2019s case relied almost entirely on circumstantial evidence shaped largely by two people who may have been involved in it or its cover-up. As trial counsel asserted in his summation, \u201c[T]here [were] so many bits of [physical] evidence and pieces, none of which connect [the defendant]\u201d to the murder. Thus, the jury were left with the choice whether to believe the testimony of Linda and Dougherty, both of whom defense counsel extensively discredited.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">\u201cWhere, as here, the claim is that defense counsel committed a tactical error, the defendant must demonstrate that defense counsel\u2019s tactical judgment was manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Finstein, 426 Mass. 200, 203 (1997). This is a high burden, because \u201c[o]nly \u2018strategy and tactics which lawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law would not consider competent\u2019 are manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, </em>385 Mass. 345, 353 (1982). After a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>p\u00edete review of the record, it is apparent that the tactical decisions of defense counsel, particularly as they related to the admission and use of the DNA evidence, were calculated, reasonable, and competent, and that a strong defense was put forward on Mathews\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Mathews alternatively contends that, regardless of the effectiveness of his counsel\u2019s performance, the admission of inconclusive DNA evidence created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. In support of his argument, he relies almost entirely on a footnote in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 222 n.7 (1991), where this court noted that \u201c[i]n certain circumstances, the results of a DNA test may be inconclusive. If so, the consequences of the test are inadmissible.\u201d We conclude that the cited language, when considered both in its historical and textual context, does not support a conclusion that the DNA evidence should have been excluded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">In 1991, when <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, supra, </em>was decided, the investigatory and evidentiary potential of DNA testing was apparent, but the reliability of the tests were still shrouded in a cloud of judicial skepticism.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We noted at the time that no DNA testing process had yet come to be widely accepted as reliable in the courts of the Commonwealth, though we assumed that that time would come. Indeed, the court reversed the convictions in the <em>Curnin </em>case because DNA evidence had been admitted in the absence of sufficient evidence establishing that the testing followed a \u201cgenerally accepted or obviously logical procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. We have since held that the two most common DNA forensic testing methods \u2014 known as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \u2014 are scientifically valid and reliable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, </em>425 Mass. 787, 799-803 (1997) (finding PCR methodology reliable); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 26-27 (1994) (finding \u201cceiling principle\u201d reliable).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have also held that short tandem repeats testing (STR) is a reliable method. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosier, </em>425 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>807, 811-813 (1997).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 27, we noted that \u201c[t]his is a rapidly developing field, and new understanding may be expected as more studies and tests are conducted. Judges must be willing and able to adapt to these changes.\u201d The contours of our jurisprudence have changed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">In 1997, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, supra </em>at 789, 799, we concluded that a judge\u2019s decision that PCR-based DNA testing was scientifically valid under the principles set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 25-27, thus admitting DNA evidence at trial was subject to de nova review \u201cbecause a trial judge\u2019s conclusion will have applicability beyond the facts of the case before him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, supra </em>at 797. Since then, we have concluded that \u201ca judge\u2019s determination on the reliability of scientific testimony is no different from other evidentiary decisions by a trial judge that are reviewed on appeal under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. 304, 311 (2000). Thus, in the years following <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, supra, </em>this court has become more deferential to the determinations of a trial judge regarding the admissibility of the results of scientific testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Additionally, the excerpt from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, supra, </em>relied on by Mathews is dicta. The issue in that case was the \u201crationality of the process\u201d that yielded the conclusion that only one Caucasian in 59,000,000 would have DNA components matching those found on the victim\u2019s nightgown. <em>Id. </em>at 222. The footnote cited by Mathews addressed only the admissibility of DNA testing evidence in the foreseeable, but yet to occur, event that DNA testing processes and statistical analyses came to be accepted: positive results would be admitted only if the jury were told of the likelihood of a DNA match occurring; negative results could be admitted without any showing of likelihood; and \u201c[i]n certain circumstances, the results of a DNA test may be inconclusive, [and, if so] are inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222 n.7. The broader point, however, was that the admissibility of DNA test results should be determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>The circumstances here demonstrate the wisdom of a case-by-case approach. The defense in this case appropriately \u201ccall[ed] into question the integrity of the police investigation,\u201d and most pointedly its use of forensics. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485, 486 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, <em>177 </em>(1992) (holding \u201cfailure of the police to conduct certain tests is a permissible ground on which to build a defense\u201d). When faced with such a suggestion, the prosecutor is entitled to introduce testimony to demonstrate that tests were performed and results (even if inconclusive) were obtained. Had defense counsel objected, the judge would have been well within his discretion to admit the testimony of the DNA chemist as probative on this issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The chemist simply informed the jury that the significance of an inconclusive result is \u201cthat there was just not enough DNA information in the DNA profile we obtained to either include or exclude\u201d Mathews (or Turner) as a potential match. Given these circumstances and the integral role the DNA evidence played in the defense counsel\u2019s strategy, we cannot conclude that the DNA evidence should have been excluded, nor can we conclude that its admission created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">b. <em>Grand jury abuse. </em>After the jury verdict, appellate counsel filed a motion for a new trial on the following grounds: (1) the Commonwealth improperly advised the grand jury of Mathews\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>invocation of his right to remain silent and to seek the advice of an attorney; (2) the Commonwealth knowingly provided false and deceptive evidence to the grand jury; (3) the Commonwealth withheld exculpatory evidence from the grand jury; and (4) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move to dismiss the indictment for grand jury abuse. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In reviewing the claims raised in Mathews\u2019s motion for a new trial, we must determine whether the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged misconduct before the grand jury created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bly, </em>444 Mass. 640, 648 (2005) (\u201cassertions of unpreserved error offered as the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are evaluated in a case of murder in the first degree under a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard\u201d). Ultimately, the defendant must demonstrate that trial counsel would have been successful had he filed a motion to dismiss. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cutts, </em>444 Mass. 821, 830 (2005) (failure to file motion to suppress does not amount to ineffective assistance unless motion would have been successful).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Generally, a court will not inquire into the quality of evidence heard by a grand jury unless \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d are present. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>407 Mass. 279, 282 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lammi, </em>310 Mass. 159, 163-164 (1941). \u201cThe court has previously identified two such extraordinary circumstances where judicial inquiry is warranted: (1) when it is unclear that sufficient evidence was presented to the grand jury to support a finding of probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offense charged in the indictment; and (2) when the defendant contends that the integrity of the grand jury proceedings somehow has been impaired.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Trooper Cosgrove and Detective Waterfield testified before the grand jury investigating Turner\u2019s murder on Tuesday, August 31, 2004. Each testified to his involvement in and knowledge of the ongoing murder investigation, including their conclusion that Mathews was the last person seen with the victim. Cos-grove testified that the blood trail at the scene indicated that the victim\u2019s body was dragged to the spot where it was found from an area closer to Linda\u2019s house at 181 Ninigret Avenue. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>testified that Mathews woke up Linda in the early morning hours of June 23, 2004, and shouted that he was going to kill her brother. Although both Waterfield and Cosgrove questioned Mathews together on June 23, 2004, only Waterfield testified regarding what Mathews told them, including that he had been with the victim in the hours before the murder, during which time he admitted telling Linda that he was \u201cgoing to . . . kill\u201d her brother. Waterfield then testified that they told Mathews that they knew something had happened between him and the victim the night before, and that Mathews responded by invoking his right to silence and saying that \u201che needed to talk to a lawyer.\u201d The prosecutor immediately said, \u201cWell, just strike that part of it.\u201d And, moments later, he asked a clarifying question of Waterfield, whether Mathews was well \u201cwithin his rights not to proceed with the interview and ... to request a lawyer,\u201d to which Waterfield answered, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Reference to a defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to silence and his right to counsel implicates the \u201cintegrity of the grand jury proceedings,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>and justifies further inquiry. There is no doubt that Waterfield\u2019s testimony regarding Mathews\u2019s silence and his request for counsel was improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callagy, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 88-89 (1992) (noting \u201cstrong disapproval of [testimony] informing a grand jury that a suspect elected to exercise his right to remain silent\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Teixera, </em>396 Mass. 746, 752 (1986) (holding that, in context of criminal trial, \u201cdefendant\u2019s right to remain silent cannot be compromised by prosecutorial comments that cast aspersions on its exercise\u201d). Our analysis does not, however, end there. As this court noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>400 Mass. 283, 290 (1987), \u201cwe have never ordered the dismissal of an indictment for [prosecutorial] misconduct in the absence of prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Thus, the question becomes whether the disputed statement, \u201cviewed in the context of all the evidence presented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>grand jury, \u2018probably made a difference\u2019 in their decision to indict him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 283, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 621-622 (1986). In some circumstances, such improper testimony may involve a serious risk of prejudice, but this is not such a case. The evidence properly presented was more than adequate to meet the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of probable cause. In light of this evidence, we cannot conclude that Waterfield\u2019s improper testimony \u201cprobably made a difference\u201d in the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The testimony, therefore, did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, and trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to seek dismissal of the indictment on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Next, Mathews contends that the Commonwealth knowingly presented the grand jury with false and deceptive evidence. He points out that the timeline described by Waterfield in his testimony and the police report filed by Cosgrove are divergent. Waterfield told the grand jury that Mathews\u2019s police interview terminated after Mathews was informed that swabbings of his hands tested positive for blood. By contrast, the police report indicates that Mathews\u2019s hands were not swabbed until after the interview was concluded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Additionally, a grand juror asked Waterfield whether the defendant \u201cexplained how the blood got on his hands or why he was washing the shorts [in an odd manner].\u201d Waterfield testified that the defendant did not offer an explanation, despite evidence in the police report that Mathews informed his interviewers that he cleaned his shorts because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>they \u201cwere covered in BBQ sauce, grease, and steak from the cookout.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The statements may have been inaccurate, but not grossly so. \u201c[I]t is not enough for dismissal of an indictment that false or deceptive evidence was presented to the grand jury. Two further elements normally must be shown. First, our cases have required a showing that false or deceptive evidence was given to the grand jury knowingly and for the purpose of obtaining an indictment. . . . Second, the defendant must show that the presentation of the false or deceptive evidence probably influenced the grand jury\u2019s determination to hand up an indictment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, supra </em>at 621. This is a heavy burden, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 150 (1993), and one the defendant plainly fails to meet. The record is devoid of evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s questions, or Water-field\u2019s responses, were presented to the grand jury in bad faith. Nor do we find any evidence that the factual discrepancies were knowing or purposeful. In fact, the context suggests otherwise: One of \u201cthe disputed comments [was] made in response to a grand juror\u2019s question; [it was] not offered gratuitously by the police officer or by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 283. The other discrepancy was minor, as both the detective and the prosecutor confused the blood evidence found on Mathews\u2019s shorts with the blood evidence later found on his hands. See note 19, <em>infra. </em>The Commonwealth, therefore, engaged in nothing more than small factual missteps, well short of the \u201creckless disregard of the truth . . . [that] could warrant dismissal of an indictment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, supra </em>at 621. Additionally, given the evidence presented against Mathews, there is no indication that the potentially misleading evidence had any effect on the grand jury\u2019s decision to return an indictment. Therefore, Mathews has failed to show that the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged misconduct before the grand jury presented a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Last, Mathews claims that the prosecutor withheld from the grand jury crucial evidence regarding the presence of two blood spots on the T-shirt of Dougherty on June 23. \u201cProsecutors are not required in every instance to reveal all exculpatory evidence to a grand jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, supra </em>at 150, quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGahee, </em>393 Mass. 743, 746 (1985). Even assuming such evidence was exculpatory, the Commonwealth must only present exculpatory evidence \u201cthat would greatly undermine either the credibility of an important witness or evidence likely to affect the grand jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmey, </em>447 Mass. 121, 130 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>437 Mass. 33, 37 (2002). Small bloodstains on Dougherty\u2019s T-shirt plainly do not rise to that level.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Had trial counsel filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on this contention, it would not have been successful. There is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">c. <em>Mathews\u2019s statement. </em>Mathews contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress a statement he made to the police in a custodial interview on June 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">At trial, Cosgrove testified that he participated in a custodial interview of Mathews with Waterfield around 10 a.m. on June 23, 2004. According to that testimony, Waterfield read Mathews his Miranda rights before questioning began, Mathews understood those rights, and voluntarily chose to speak with the officers. At that point, Cosgrove informed Mathews that while he had been brought to the police station on an outstanding warrant, the officers wanted to talk to him about something else. Mathews responded that he \u201cthought that [to be the case],\u201d and the hour-long interview followed. This version of events differs slightly from the police report, which indicated that Miranda warnings were given only after Mathews told the officers that he \u201cfigured\u201d they wanted to talk to him about something else. Given that Cosgrove\u2019s sworn testimony at trial would likely have mirrored any testimony at a potential suppression hearing, it is not likely that trial counsel would have been successful if he had filed a motion to suppress Mathews\u2019s statement that he \u201cthought that [to be the case].\u201d However, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>had he been successful in excluding that brief comment, we cannot conclude that the admission in evidence of such an excerpt from an hour-long interview created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have examined the record under the standard set by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether there is any basis to set aside or reduce the verdict, regardless of whether such grounds were raised on appeal. We conclude that the evidence supported Mathews\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty, and that there is no basis on which to reduce that verdict or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">There was also evidence of cocaine use at the party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-8\">A test of Scott Turner\u2019s blood the next morning revealed a blood alcohol level of .33 per cent, more than four times the legal limit for driving an automobile. The judge fully and properly instructed the jury with respect to their consideration of evidence that Mathews was intoxicated at the time he allegedly killed the victim. \u201c[A] defendant is entitled, upon request, to an instruction to the effect that if he were so far overcome by intoxicating substances as to be rendered incapable of. . . committing murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty, the jury must return a verdict of murder in the second degree, if they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all other elements of the crime are present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 455 (1984). The jury may take the effects of alcohol into account, as they relate to the defendant\u2019s state of mind, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>434 Mass. 197, 206-207 (2001), and whether or not he was indifferent to the victim\u2019s pain. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983) (listing factors to be considered when determining whether murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-9\">One of the witnesses who observed the victim and Mathews arguing also saw the victim throw a bottle in the street very close to where she was standing.

They were wet and in a pile of dirty clothes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">The T-shirt tested positive for blood, and DNA testing of the two spots revealed that each included a mixture of blood from several different sources. One of the spots was a mixture of DNA from at least three different individuals; the other was a mixture from at least four individuals. DNA testing indicated that Mathews was not a source of this blood, and yielded inconclusive results when compared to Turner\u2019s DNA. The major DNA contributor to one of the blood stains on Dougherty\u2019s shirt, however, was determined to be a \u201cpotential contributor\u201d to the DNA found under the victim\u2019s fingernails. There was no evidence admitted as to the identity of this potential DNA contributor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Mathews admitted to rinsing off his red shorts when he got to 28 Wampanoag by taking a shower with them on, but claimed that he was getting steak, grease, and barbecue sauce from the cookout off of them.

Investigators take a small piece of filter paper, touch that paper to a suspected stain, and then test the paper with two chemicals. If blood was present, the filter paper will immediately change color. The presence of blood can often be detected even if it has been rinsed off the surface being tested. This court has allowed the introduction of the results of very similar tests for occult blood in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beldotti, </em>409 Mass. 553, 561-562 (1991), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 744-745 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">In the transcript of her testimony, the State chemist uses the terms, \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cinconclusive\u201d apparently to mean the same thing.

The few State courts to address the issue have split on whether such evidence should be admitted. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>151 N.J. 117, 185 (1997), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1085 (2000) (allowing admission of inconclusive DNA evidence and holding that the probative \u201ceffect of the evidence is that the DNA test results showed that defendant could not be excluded as a contributor\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodall, </em>182 W.

The swabs from Mathews\u2019s hands were not tested until a later date, when they did test positive for the presence of blood. Blood evidence did, however, play a large role in the police interview of Mathews. Toward the end of the questioning, another police officer spoke privately with Cosgrove, and informed him that the shorts that Mathews was wearing the previous night, and the bathtub where he was washing 'the shorts, both tested positive for the presence of blood. When that conversation ended, Cosgrove told Mathews that he knew something had happened between him and the victim the night before, and informed him of the positive blood tests.
