The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict. The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was also denied without an evidentiary hearing. The defendant is represented on appeal by counsel who had represented him in connection with his motion for a new trial. The defendant appeals from his conviction; from the denial of his motion to set aside the verdict; and from the denial of his motion for a new trial. The defendant also argues that we should exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict to a lesser degree of guilt or to order a new trial. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and the orders denying his motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. We discern no basis to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The jury could have found the following facts. Both the defendant and Ennis sold drugs, both on the street and, during December, 1999, from an apartment that was leased to another at 30 Walnut Park in the Roxbury section of Boston. Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Lee, the victim, who lived in Brockton, also sold drugs, and dealt in larger quantities than did the defendant and Ennis. The mother of one of the victim\u2019s children lived on Walnut Park. The victim and Ennis were friends. The victim associated with two individuals who lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, namely, Michael Brown and Gregory Carter. Carter was the half-brother of Steven Knight.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Knight knew the victim as well as the defendant and Ennis. In December, 1999, Knight was incarcerated, and while he was incarcerated, his girl friend, Tamika Wilson, and her friend, Tanya Brimage, lived at Knight\u2019s apartment on Stamford Street in Boston. The defendant was a friend of Wilson, and would sometimes stay at the Stamford Street apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The victim was last seen at about 10 p.m. on December 25, 1999, with the mother of one of his children outside her residence on Walnut Park. In her company, the victim spoke to someone on his cellular telephone and asked, \u201cIs that you in the gray car?\u201d There was a gray automobile within sight. The victim told the person on the telephone that he was just going to take his family upstairs and then would be right back down. The victim had been speaking with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On the morning of December 26,1999, the victim\u2019s automobile was towed from a wooded area adjacent to a parking lot of a school in Brockton. Two days later, on December 28, after the victim\u2019s sister reported the victim missing, his body was discovered in the trunk of his automobile at an automobile recovery yard. The victim\u2019s body had been wrapped with duct tape with a pillowcase placed over his head. The victim had been beaten, bound, and shot five times. He had been shot once in the jaw, once in the neck, twice in the chest, and once in the legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Investigation revealed that the pillowcase placed over the victim\u2019s head matched one recovered from the apartment at 30 Walnut Park, from which the defendant and Ennis sold drugs. Cellular telephone records indicated that between 1 a.m. and about 4 a.m. on December 26, the cellular telephone that the defendant possessed was used in Quincy, Braintree, Randolph, Avon, Brockton, and Holbrook. There was also ballistics evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>dence. Five .380 caliber automatic discharged cartridge casings and one live .380 caliber automatic bullet were recovered in the vicinity where the victim\u2019s automobile had been in the woods. All of the discharged cartridge casings had been fired from the same semiautomatic weapon. Two spent projectiles were recovered from the victim\u2019s body, and a third spent projectile fragment was recovered from the trunk of the victim\u2019s automobile. All three projectiles were consistent with .380 caliber automatic ammunition and had been fired from the same weapon. No weapon was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Early Christmas morning, the defendant, Carter, and another man went to the Stamford Street apartment belonging to Knight. A few hours later, Knight, from a house of correction, spoke with Carter on the apartment\u2019s telephone. Later that day, at about 7 p.m., Knight called the apartment again. The defendant was present and spoke with Knight. The defendant indicated that he was going to take care of a problem. Knight asked, \u201cMike Lee [the victim]?\u201d The defendant replied affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">At about 5 a.m. on December 26, Brimage let the defendant, Ennis, Carter, and another man into the Stamford Street apartment. Brimage went to sleep. She woke up after 8 a.m. to find the defendant and Ennis present. Later, , the defendant unzipped a blue backpack and pulled o\u00fat a gun and showed it to Ennis. Ennis said, \u201cDamn, you almost emptied the clip on that nigger.\u201d The defendant laughed and said, \u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">At about 7 p.m. on December 26, the defendant visited his friend Renee Phillips at her apartment. Referring to the victim, the defendant told Phillips, \u201cWe had to take a ride with him last night.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cWell, I had to leave that nigger in his trunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">During the evening of December 28, at the Stamford Street apartment, the defendant asked Brimage if she had heard that the victim had been killed (Ennis was not present). Brimage stated that she had not. The defendant told her that it was on the news and that the victim had been killed in the woods. Brimage turned on the news. While she was watching, Knight telephoned. The defendant spoke with Knight, and during their conversation, the defendant used the phrase \u201clights out.\u201d Afterward, Brimage asked the defendant what the television report on the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>death meant by a \u201cgruesome discovery\u201d found in the trunk of an automobile. The defendant said that the victim had been shot in the head, the neck, and the face, and \u201ceverywhere.\u201d As the defendant headed out of the apartment, Brimage told the defendant that he needed to keep quiet. The defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care because if I go down, so don\u2019t a whole lot of other people.\u201d The defendant went on to say that he never should have brought Ennis with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The defendant attempted to evade police, but was arrested on January 2, 2000, in the Walnut Park area. He received Miranda warnings and told police that on Christmas Day, he had called the victim and had made arrangements to purchase one hundred dollars\u2019 worth of marijuana from the victim that evening. The defendant then headed on foot to 38 Walnut Park to see Wilson. While the defendant was heading into 38 Walnut Park, at approximately noon or 1 p.m., he ran into the victim, who was walking out of that building. The victim could not confirm that the drug deal would occur. The defendant made plans with the victim to meet on Walnut Park at about 10:30 p.m. that evening. The defendant then visited with Wilson for almost one hour. He later borrowed a motor vehicle and drove to Plymouth, visited Knight, and then returned to Boston. The defendant stated that he went to the Stamford Street apartment. He unsuccessfully tried to contact the victim. The defendant returned to Walnut Park at 10:30 p.m., but the victim did not appear. The defendant met up with Ennis. The defendant parted with Ennis and went to a club, where he stayed until 2 a.m. on December 26. The defendant returned to the Stamford Street apartment. The defendant said he learned of the victim\u2019s death from the news on either Monday, December 27, or Tuesday, December 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Neither the defendant nor Ennis testified, and they did not call any witnesses to testify on their behalf. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel suggested that it was Carter, not the defendant, who had killed the victim. He argued that Brimage and Phillips were not credible witnesses. He further pointed out that there was no forensic or ballistics evidence implicating the defendant and that there were inadequacies in the police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">1. <em>Evidentiary issues, </em>a. After being arrested, Ennis gave a statement to police in which he stated that he had spent Christ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>mas night with his girl friend. In this statement, Ennis also stated that he had known the defendant for a long time and knew him to be involved in the drug business. Ennis\u2019s girl friend testified that Ennis had asked her to lie and tell the police that he had been with her the entire evening of Christmas. The defendant argues that the judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury that Ennis\u2019s postarrest statement to police and false alibi were not admissible against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">There was no prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>449 Mass. 316, 326 (2007). As to Ennis\u2019s false alibi, there is no likelihood that the jury would have found the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant significantly less persuasive without considering Ennis\u2019s statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 783 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>364 Mass. 1, 9-10 (1973). Ennis\u2019s efforts to exculpate himself did not corroborate any of the relevant evidence against the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, supra. </em>The fact that the jury acquitted Ennis indicates that they did not hold against him his efforts to falsify an alibi, and thus, such efforts could not reasonably be said to be significant evidence against the defendant. Ennis\u2019s statement that the defendant was involved in the drug business was of no real significance. The fact that the defendant, Ennis, and the victim all sold drugs was undisputed. Ennis\u2019s statement to police that the defendant was involved in the drug business was cumulative of other evidence admitted without objection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">b. During the testimony of Knight, a tape recording of a telephone conversation that took place on December 28, among Knight, the defendant, and Ennis, was played for the jury. The jury were permitted to read an informal transcript of the recording while they listened to the conversation. During the recording, Ennis stated to Knight that he and the defendant \u201cwere kicking his ass nigger.\u201d The judge admitted the statement, over the defendant\u2019s objection, as an adoptive admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that there was an inadequate foundation for the judge to admit the statement as an adoptive admission. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s suggestion, the judge did not state that the defendant silently assented to Ennis\u2019s statements, but found that the defendant said, \u201cYo, chill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>chill,\u201d to Ennis\u2019s statements. The defendant\u2019s remark indicated that he had heard the statement. We agree with the judge that Ennis\u2019s statement was the type of statement that the defendant could be expected to deny if untrue and that the defendant\u2019s response, \u201cYo, chill, chill,\u201d could be found not to constitute a denial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>436 Mass. 799, 808-809 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>430 Mass. 700, 708 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">c. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arose due to the testimony of Sergeant Leonard Coppenrath of the State police regarding statements that the defendant made after his arrest. Specifically, the defendant (after receiving Miranda warnings) told Coppenrath that, on December 24, he had gone to an establishment or club and remained there until a shooting had occurred. Coppenrath added that the Boston police department \u201cindicated that no such shooting took place.\u201d The judge sustained the defendant\u2019s objection and instructed the jury to disregard \u201cwhat the Boston police reported.\u201d The defendant also told Coppenrath that, on December 25, he again went to the club and left there \u201cabout 2 p.m. [\u00bffe] [on December 26] at the time of the alleged shooting.\u201d At a sidebar conference, the defendant and counsel for Ennis objected. The judge instructed the jury as follows: \u201c[D]uring the course of Sergeant Coppenrath\u2019s testimony, he interjected at one point that the shooting was at 2 a.m. [sic]. I\u2019m going to ask you to disregard that.\u201d On redirect examination, Coppenrath stated, with no objection by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, that the defendant had told him that, on December 26, he had left the club \u201c[b]ecause of an alleged shooting that took place at 2 a.m. at [the club].\u201d The defendant argues that these statements were prejudicial because they undermined his alibi by indicating that no shooting had occurred and had the effect of suggesting to the jury that his alibi was false. The defendant maintains that the prejudicial effect of the statements was not mitigated by the judge\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Jurors are presumed to follow a judge\u2019s instructions, including ins'tructions to disregard certain testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auclair, </em>444 Mass. 348, 357-358 (2005), and cases cited. In addition to his two instructions made at the time of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>instances of the objectionable testimony, the judge stressed to the jury in his final charge that, whenever he told the jurors to disregard something, it was not evidence, and they were not permitted to rely on that information in reaching their factual conclusions. These instructions sufficiently eliminated any potential prejudice to the defendant on the first two inteijections made by Coppenrath.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">There was no error in Coppenrath\u2019s testimony on redirect examination because Coppenrath was simply pointing out that the defendant had stated that a shooting had occurred at 2 a.m. at the club. Apart from this testimony, there was evidence from which the jury could have reasonably inferred that the victim was killed anytime between 10 p.m. on December 25, when he was last seen with the mother of one of his children, and the morning of December 26, when his automobile was towed from the woods next to a school in Brockton. While the defendant told Coppenrath that, after 10:30 p.m. on December 25, he went to a club until 2 a.m. on December 26, and then returned to the Stamford Street apartment, telephone records indicated that he was traveling from Boston to Brockton from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. on December 26, and Brimage testified that the defendant did not return to the Stamford Street apartment until 5 a.m. on December 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">2. <em>Denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding. </em>The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding was denied by the judge at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict the defendant as a joint venturer because, with Ennis\u2019s acquittal, there was no evidence that \u201ca principal other than the defendant\u201d was the person who shot the victim, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. 771, 779 (1995). We reject his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">\u201cIt is not necessary that the Commonwealth prove the identity of the other joint venturer or joint venturers, as long as the evidence supports the existence of some principal other than the defendant and that the defendant shared the other\u2019s intent and was available to help if needed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>443 Mass. 799, 806 (2005). Additionally, \u201cit is not necessary that the Commonwealth prove \u2018the precise conduct of each [individual] if there [is] evidence that a [homicide] took place.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 367, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 254 (1983). The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to permit the jury reasonably to conclude that others were involved in the victim\u2019s shooting. It could also be reasonably inferred by the jury that more than one person was needed to bind the victim and place him in the trunk of his automobile. Brimage testified that the defendant was accompanied by Carter, Ennis, and another man when she let them into the Staniford Street apartment at 5 a.m. on December 26. Carter and the other man left the apartment by 8 a.m. The defendant told Phillips that \u201cwe\u201d had to take the victim for a ride on Christmas night, and that he had to leave the victim in his trunk. He told Brimage that if he went down, \u201cso don\u2019t <em>a whole lot of other </em>people\u201d (emphasis added). There was sufficient evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s culpability as a joint venturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>On the second day of their deliberations, the jury sent the judge a written note asking, \u201cOn the law of joint venture pertaining to this case, does it only refer to only the two defendants, Williams and Ennis?\u201d The judge and the prosecutor considered the question confusing. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel and Ennis\u2019s trial counsel asked the judge to tell the jury to \u201cconfine\u201d themselves to determining \u201cwas [the defendant] a joint venturer with [Ennis] or was [Ennis] a joint venturer with [the defendant].\u201d The judge declined to give the instruction, stating that he did not understand the jury\u2019s question. Over the defendant\u2019s objection (and Ennis\u2019s), the judge sent the following written response to the jury: \u201cJurors: I am unable to answer your question because I do not understand it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The judge anticipated that the jurors might clarify their question. Shortly thereafter, the judge received another written question from the jury, \u201cCan one defendant be found guilty of joint venture and the other defendant found not guilty?\u201d Without objection, the judge responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s responses posed the risk that the defendant was convicted as a joint venturer, even if the Commonwealth had not proved that any other person was engaged in the joint venture or that any person had acted as a principal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s argument is based on his view that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>monwealth\u2019s evidence supported the culpability of only the defendant and Ennis as joint venturers. As we previously explained, the Commonwealth offered sufficient evidence suggesting that there may have been someone else (or others) involved in the joint venture apart from the defendant and Ennis. Proof of the precise identity of another joint venturer (or joint venturers) was not required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra. </em>Further, joinder of defendants at trial for the same crime does not require that all of the defendants be found guilty or none may be. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connearney, </em>359 Mass. 200, 202-203 (1971). Viewing the evidence, in light of the instructions as a whole, the judge did not abuse his discretion in answering the jury\u2019s second question or in defining the law of joint venture. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>366 Mass. 6, 10 (1974), cert. denied sub nom. <em>McAlister </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>419 U.S. 1115 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">4. <em>Motion to set aside verdict. </em>The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the ground of mutually antagonistic defenses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>448 Mass. 286, 290 (2007). Ennis did not seek to be acquitted by blaming the defendant. Rather, Ennis and the defendant shared common strategies, namely to suggest that someone else, likely Carter, committed the shooting, and to rely on the lack of forensic evidence implicating them in the shooting. Further, the videotape recording that showed the defendant entering the Stamford Street apartment building at 5 a.m. on December 26 was cumulative of Brimage\u2019s testimony. That Brimage could not positively identify Ennis on the videotape cannot be said to be exculpatory, antagonistic, and prejudicial in light of Brimage\u2019s testimony that there was a figure she could not make out on the recording, and that after letting this group into the apartment, she observed Ennis among them. The judge correctly concluded that the defenses were not \u201cmutually antagonistic.\u201d See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">5. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel when his counsel failed to obtain a copy of a television news broadcast that Brimage watched on the evening of December 28, at the Stamford Street apartment with the defendant nearby or present. The defendant argues that the recording of the broadcast might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>have provided material to impeach Brimage, who had testified that the defendant had given her more information about the location of the shooting than had appeared on the broadcast. Specifically, Brimage testified that the defendant said that the victim was killed in the woods, while the broadcast announced only that the victim\u2019s body was discovered in the trunk of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In support of his motion for a new trial, the defendant submitted a one-page affidavit in which he states that the broadcast had been on \u201cthe Fox 25 early news,\u201d and that the reporter had been taken to the location where the victim\u2019s automobile had been discovered, namely, in the woods. The defendant also states that during Brimage\u2019s trial testimony, he informed his counsel of this information and requested that he should subpoena a tape recording of the broadcast. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did nothing about the tape recording and, according to his affidavit, could not recall why. The defendant was granted post-trial discovery, but the television station responded that it did not have any records in existence pertaining to the discovery of the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We review the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>433 Mass. 185, 187 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>420 Mass. 242, 246 (1995). The absence of the tape recording of the broadcast at trial did not amount to error and, in any event, was not \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 188, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). The content of the broadcast was speculation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>375 Mass. 530, 540 (1978). Further, the point of <em>potential </em>impeachment, concerning the location of the victim\u2019s automobile, would have been diminished by the absence of impeachment on the issue of the type, and extent, of the victim\u2019s injury. At trial, Brimage recounted that the defendant said that the victim had been shot \u201ceverywhere,\u201d including in the head, face, and neck, while the broadcast merely reported an unspecified \u201cgruesome discovery.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s testimony corroborated Brimage\u2019s testimony. The defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of his new trial motion was silent on any possible impeachment concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Brimage\u2019s testimony on the type and extent of the victim\u2019s injuries. The defendant has not shown that the potential impeachment evidence in the location of the victim\u2019s body could have made a difference in the jury\u2019s conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>446 Mass. 709, 715 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">6. <em>Relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record under our statutory obligation and we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. The lack of forensic evidence, such as deoxyribonucleic acid retrieved from eyeglasses and boots found in the Walnut Park apartment used by the defendant and Ennis, linking the victim to the apartment, was argued to the jury during the defendant\u2019s closing remarks and was for them to consider. The jury\u2019s verdict was amply supported by other evidence offered by the Commonwealth, including the defendant\u2019s display of a firearm to Ennis on December 26 and his statement to Phillips the same day that he had to leave the victim in his trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel was able to argue, with respect to a fingerprint of a person named Gary Richards found on the trunk of the victim\u2019s automobile, that the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation was not adequate. That evidence did not exculpate the defendant and does not call into question the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Finally, the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, Timothy Howard, did not exculpate the defendant. Reading Howard\u2019s testimony in full shows that he did not know from whom he allegedly purchased drugs on December 26, at 2 or 3 a.m., at the apartment on Walnut Park from which the defendant and Ennis sold drugs. He claimed it was either the defendant or Ennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">7. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed, as is the denial of his motion to set aside the verdict and the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-11\">The Commonwealth had proceeded on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel brought out, in the cross-examination of a witness, that Carter and Knight had been involved in selling drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The defendant does not argue that the judge erred in instructing the jury on the law of joint venture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
