He was convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon on Darius Shepard, of assault by means of a dangerous weapon on Sharif Laster, and of armed assault with intent to murder Shepard and Laster. He also was found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition without an identification card. The defendant appealed. In September, 2005, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial in this court, which we remanded to the Superior Court. In May, 2006, the trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing. The defendant again appealed. The defendant requests that we reverse his convictions and reverse the denial of the motion for a new trial, arguing that the judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense and voluntary manslaughter and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims of error are without merit and discern no basis to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we affirm his convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>We summarize the facts that the jury were warranted in finding, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues. On November 18, 2001, two brothers, Nathaniel (Nate) and Bernab\u00e9 (Bernie) Pereira, were celebrating their birthdays. Sharif Laster picked up the brothers and Phillip Langley and drove them to the apartment of another friend, Patrick Bass. Prior to their arrival at Bass\u2019s apartment, Laster had telephoned Bass to arrange to purchase twenty dollars\u2019 worth of marijuana from the defendant. When the group arrived at Bass\u2019s apartment, the defendant was present as was Iraida Rolon, Bass\u2019s girl friend. After Nate took the marijuana he told the defendant, \u201cNow we are even.\u201d This statement led to an argument over whether the defendant owed Nate money. The argument became so heated that Rolon asked them to \u201cgo outside.\u201d Everyone but Rolon did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Once outside, the argument between Nate and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>continued. Laster, Bass, and Langley walked toward Laster\u2019s car. The argument between Nate and the defendant escalated; Nate attempted to leave. The defendant took off his watch and made a fist with his hand down. Bemie, who was standing near the defendant, thought that the defendant was going to hit Nate, so Bemie hit the defendant in the back of the head with a liquor bottle. The defendant \u201cbacked up and . . . said, \u2018Oh, you guys going to jump me now?\u2019 \u201d Bemie and Nate replied, \u201cNo, we are leaving.\u201d The defendant then stated, \u201cI know where you live.\u201d Bemie responded by slashing one of the defendant\u2019s tires with a box cutter. Laster drove Bemie, Nate, Langley, and Bass to Laster\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The defendant, injured and upset, returned to Bass\u2019s apartment. Rolon asked him to leave but instead he used the telephone. During the telephone call, Rolon overheard the defendant tell the person at the other end that he had been beaten for his marijuana and that he thought that he might be \u201cjumped,\u201d and she overheard the defendant \u201cplead\u201d with the person to bring him some \u201cheat.\u201d As the defendant was leaving the apartment, Rolon heard him say to himself, \u201cI am going to blast [them].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Meanwhile, another friend, Darius Shepard, joined the group at Laster\u2019s house. The group stayed at Laster\u2019s house for approximately one and one-half hours. They then drove back to Bass\u2019s apartment and parked the car in the parking lot behind the apartment building. At that time, the defendant\u2019s car was not there. Over the course of two to three hours, they watched television at Bass\u2019s apartment. During their stay, Rolon told them about the conversation she overheard in which the defendant requested \u201csome heat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Shepard was the first person to leave. He noticed that the defendant\u2019s car was parked in the back, almost blocking Laster\u2019s car. Immediately, he went back into the house and told everyone that the defendant\u2019s car was outside. Nate, Langley, and Bass went out to look around. No one saw the defendant. The group got in the car. As Laster tried \u201cinching his way by\u201d the defendant\u2019s car, the defendant appeared from the dumpster area. He approached the car, and hopped and banged on the trunk, yelling, \u201cWhere is Nate?\u201d Shepard saw a gun in the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>hand and yelled, \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun.\u201d As Laster was trying to drive away two shots were fired. After the first shot Nate began to scream, and Laster sped up in an attempt to get away. The defendant continued to fire, and Shepard was shot in the left ankle. Laster continued driving toward a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Nate died at the hospital from a gunshot wound through his back to his aorta that caused \u201cmassive bleeding.\u201d While Shepard was being treated for his gunshot wound, he identified the defendant, who had been brought to the hospital by the police, as the person who had shot at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The police found a spent projectile in the trunk of Laster\u2019s car and four spent casings from a .38 caliber pistol at the scene. The medical examiner also recovered a spent projectile during Nate\u2019s autopsy. The police seized a .38 caliber pistol and magazine from a garage belonging to the defendant\u2019s father. A State police ballistics expert, John Schrijn, examined the seized gun and magazine and concluded that the projectiles from the autopsy and the vehicle had been fired from the seized gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s case. </em>At trial, the defendant did not deny shooting at Laster\u2019s car, killing Nate, and injuring Shepard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, he claimed he was acting in self-defense. Evidence pertinent to self-defense is viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 395 (1998), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The defendant was a good friend of Bass. On the night of the incident, Bass asked him to bring some marijuana to his home. The defendant testified that he believed the debt that sparked the argument with Nate was because of an incident that occurred a week before where Nate, Bemie, and Shepard \u201cjumped\u201d on a \u201ckid\u201d who was trying to purchase marijuana. After the group beat up the \u201ckid,\u201d some of his money fell to the ground and the defendant picked it up. The defendant later used the money to buy pizza for the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The argument between the defendant and Nate escalated. Nate told the defendant to hit him, but the defendant did not do so. The defendant stated that, during the argument, someone said that if the defendant did anything or tried to do anything, they would \u201cjump\u201d him. The defendant testified that, during the argument, Laster received a telephone call and gave the telephone to Nate. The defendant overheard Nate say something about \u201cgetting] the heat.\u201d After Bemie struck the defendant on the head, the defendant thought that the group was going to jump him. He returned to Bass\u2019s apartment and telephoned his brother-in-law to ask for a ride, but was told that his brother-in-law was busy. The defendant denied asking for \u201cheat\u201d during this telephone conversation and denied stating that he was going to \u201cblast\u201d anyone. The defendant drove his car down the street, parked it, and walked home. At home, the defendant cleaned up and used his brother-in-law\u2019s cellular telephone to contact an acquaintance named \u201cMadness.\u201d He purchased a gun from Madness for his own protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The defendant took the gun and returned to his car to fix his flat tire. He testified that he could not change the tire because his car was on a hill, so he moved the car to an alleyway in front of a dumpster.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As he changed the tire he noticed that Laster\u2019s \u201ccar was back in the alleyway.\u201d The defendant saw Shepard come out and then go back inside. The defendant went to get in his car, but the whole group came outside \u201ccussing\u201d and talking to each other. They walked toward the defendant, and the defendant showed the group the gun at his waist. Once the defendant showed the gun, the group stopped and went to Laster\u2019s car. The defendant stated that he went behind the dumpster to avoid the car\u2019s lights as it pulled out of its parking spot. As the car pulled away, the defendant ran up to the window and asked to speak to Nate. The tinted window rolled down, and the defendant saw something \u201clike a movement, like a reflection of somebody\u2019s hand,\u201d or a \u201cflash.\u201d He was unsure of what he saw, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>but thought it could have been \u201ca weapon of some type.\u201d After the flash, the defendant pulled his gun and shot at the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The car drove off; the defendant drove to his father\u2019s house and hid the gun in the garage. At some point the police took the defendant to the hospital so that Shepard could identify him. While the defendant was at the police station he told the police where he had hidden the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Jury instructions, </em>a. <em>Self-defense. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense. \u201cA defendant is entitled to have the jury . . . instructed on the law relating to self-defense if the evidence, viewed in its light most favorable to him, is sufficient to raise the issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 450 (1980). There must be evidence that \u201cpermits at least a reasonable doubt that the defendant reasonably and actually believed that he was in \u2018imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, from which he could save himself only by using deadly force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 396, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 576 (1997). For a defendant to have such a reasonable belief, the victim must have committed some overt act constituting an assault or threat against the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 453 (1984). Moreover, there must be \u201csome evidence that the defendant availed himself of all means, proper and reasonable under the circumstances, of retreating from the conflict before resorting to the use of deadly force.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 398. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, </em>427 Mass. 718, 722 (1998) (where defendant has chance to retreat but fails to do so, he has no privilege to use force in self-defense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>359 Mass. 388, 390 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The defendant claims that he reasonably believed that Nate and his friends might use deadly force against him. He points out that, one week earlier, he saw Nate, Bernie, and Shepard rob and beat up a \u201ckid\u201d who wanted to purchase marijuana; a few hours before the shooting, Bernie hit him over the head with a liquor bottle and slashed his tires; and he overheard Nate arrange to obtain a gun. These incidents do not provide sufficient evidence that \u201cthe defendant reasonably and actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>believed that he was in \u2018imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Epsom, </em>399 Mass. 254, 256 (1987), an incident inside a bar turned into an altercation where the victim and his friends were the aggressors. The victim charged the defendant and the defendant was ultimately struck by a bottle. <em>Id. </em>The defendant left the bar and the victim followed. <em>Id. </em>at 257. Outside the bar, the defendant pulled a gun and shot the victim repeatedly. <em>Id. </em>This court determined that the evidence was insufficient to raise the issue of self-defense because the \u201conly evidence of an assault against the defendant related to events inside the pub [and] [t]here was no evidence that the defendant was assaulted or threatened outside the pub . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. Similarly, in this case, the only assault, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, occurred a minimum of one and one-half hours before the shooting. The defendant offers no evidence that the members of the group assaulted or threatened him as they were leaving Bass\u2019s apartment for the second time. A self-defense instruction is not warranted on this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">However, even assuming that the defendant reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger from the group, he would still not be entitled to a self-defense instruction, because there is no evidence that the defendant \u201cavailed himself of all proper means to avoid physical combat\u201d by retreating or attempting to retreat. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, supra </em>at 450. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 398-399. The defendant claims that he \u201chad no opportunity to retreat since he was in a small alley next to the vehicle.\u201d We disagree. The location of the spent casings in front of Bass\u2019s apartment building and on the sidewalk near the driveway suggest that the defendant was near the sidewalk and thus had some avenues by which he could have retreated. This court has determined that generally, \u201cself-defense . . . cannot be claimed by a [defendant] who provokes or initiates an assault.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>375 Mass. 768, 772 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>407 Mass. 333, 335 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pasteur, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 812, 820 (2006). The defendant initiated the confrontation. The defendant testified that as Nate, Bemie, Langley, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Shepard, and Laster were leaving the apartment they were \u201ccoming towards [him]\u201d and so he showed them his gun; they stopped and went to their car. Then the defendant went behind the dumpster. Instead of remaining safely behind the dumpster, the defendant \u201cran up\u201d to the departing car and asked, \u201cWhere is Nate? I want to talk to Nate.\u201d He saw a \u201cflash.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Then the defendant shot at the car four times, firing even as they tried to leave. Because the defendant\u2019s own evidence is that he initiated the altercation and created the\" circumstances by which he alleges he could not retreat, we conclude that the defendant was not entitled to a self-defense instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">b. <em>Voluntary manslaughter.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cVoluntary manslaughter is an unlawful killing \u2018arising not from malice, but from . . . sudden passion induced by reasonable provocation, \"sudden combat or excessive force in self-defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 443 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 267 (1990). The defendant claims that he was entitled to voluntary manslaughter instructions based on all three theories. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The defendant argues that when a \u201cdefendant reacted exces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>sively to a perceived threat of deadly force ... by firing too many shots in self defense, he [is] entitled to have the jury consider\u201d a verdict of manslaughter. His claim has no merit, because an instruction on voluntary manslaughter under a theory of excessive force in self-defense is unavailable \u201cif the Commonwealth proves that the defendant was not entitled to use deadly force.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 213, 218 (2005). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 632 n.11 (1994). Because the defendant is not entitled to a self-defense instruction, for the reasons set forth above, an instruction on manslaughter by excessive force in self-defense is not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A voluntary manslaughter instruction based on reasonable provocation is warranted if \u201cthere is evidence of provocation deemed adequate in law to cause the accused to lose his self-control in the heat of passion, and if the killing followed the provocation before sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\u2019s temper to cool.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>422 Mass. 236, 237 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178, 180 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984). Reasonable provocation that would support an instruction on voluntary manslaughter is such provocation that \u201cproduce[s] in an ordinary person such a state of passion, anger, fear, or nervous excitement\u201d that would eclipse the defendant\u2019s ability to reflect or exercise restraint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 728 (1980). \u201cProvocation and \u2018cooling off\u2019 time must meet both a subjective and an objective standard.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 220 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The defendant claims that his fear and excitement on the night of the incident is enough to support a voluntary manslaughter instruction based on reasonable provocation. He states that his fear and excitement were due to the \u201clate hour, dark setting, knowledge that Nate might have a gun or weapon, [the defendant\u2019s] display of the gun to the group as they got in the car, and the group\u2019s . . . attacking him and slashing his tire a few hours before.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the defendant\u2019s own testimony, he had the tools needed to fix his flat tire right away but instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>he purchased a gun, and then returned to his car and parked it in front of the dumpster near Bass\u2019s house instead of elsewhere, despite the fact that he noticed, as he was changing his tire, \u201cthat [Laster\u2019s] car was back in the alleyway.\u201d Viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, a minimum of one and one-half hours passed between the assault and when he returned to change his tire. This evidence would not allow a jury to \u201cinfer that a reasonable person would have become sufficiently provoked.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>394 Mass. 727, 738, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>474 U.S. 919 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Moreover, there is no indication that Nate provoked the defendant at the time of the shooting. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 444 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>442 Mass. 826, 838-839 (2004) (\u201cIt is well established that \u2018provocation must come from the victim\u2019 \u201d). In addition, Bemie struck the defendant with a bottle at least one and one-half hours before the defendant shot the victim, allowing a cooling off period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 738-739 (fifteen to thirty minutes sufficient cooling off period and \u201csignificantly longer . . . than is usually the situation in manslaughter cases\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 707 (1975) (no manslaughter instruction where defendant left scene after being punched, and then returned and shot victim several minutes later).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The defendant claims that the judge erred when he failed to provide manslaughter instructions on the basis of sudden combat. The defendant points to the \u201crolling down of the car window,\u201d the \u201cflash,\u201d and the \u201csudden action in the car\u201d as evidence to support a voluntary manslaughter instruction. Generally, for sudden combat to be the basis of a voluntary manslaughter instruction, the \u201cvictim . . . must attack the defendant or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>least strike a blow against the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pasteur, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 812, 822 (2006). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>441 Mass. 199, 206 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 629 (1994). Here, neither the victim nor anyone in the group attacked or struck a blow against the defendant. In fact the group was in the car, leaving the scene. Furthermore, even if the victim initiates contact and there is \u201cphysical contact between a defendant and a victim[, it] is not always sufficient to warrant a manslaughter instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 727 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>442 Mass. 826, 839 (2004) (no sudden combat instructions where victim slapped and jumped on defendant because the \u201cconduct presented no threat of serious harm to him\u201d). No view of the evidence would support an instruction of manslaughter based on sudden combat.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">2. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant raised several ineffective assistance claims in his motion for a new trial that the judge denied without a hearing. Specifically, he asserted that counsel was ineffective because he failed to question the defendant on two matters; object to portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement; cross-examine or impeach several witnesses; introduce expert evidence; and file a motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s statement to the police. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The decision to grant a motion for a new trial rests soundly within the judge\u2019s discretion and \u201cwill not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust or . . . the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, 770 (1999). Moreover, we give \u201cspecial deference to the decisions of a judge who was, as here, the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 499 (2004). Because the denial of the motion for a new trial is being considered \u201cin conjunction with [the] defendant\u2019s direct appeal from a conviction of murder in the first degree, we review it under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>432 Mass. 704, 710 n.14 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>449 Mass. 343, 353 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>a. The defendant contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to question him about two matters that he claims would have demonstrated self-defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to the defendant\u2019s affidavit, he telephoned Bass after the shooting to \u201cget back [his] watch\u201d and this tended to show \u201cconsciousness of innocence.\u201d Even assuming that this telephone call occurred, consciousness of innocence is of very little value, because there are a variety of different motives that can prompt action consistent with innocence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>438 Mass. 142, 157 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 966 (2003). The defendant also argues that threats from the group \u201ccorroborate- [the] defendant\u2019s claim that he acted in self-defense.\u201d At trial, counsel asked, \u201cWhat happened after you heard the bottle shatter?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cI ran away from him . . . yelling, \u2018You gonna jump me now?\u2019 \u201d The defendant thus had an opportunity to testify about the alleged threats, but he failed to do so. In any event the defendant still would not be entitled to a self-defense instruction, because a minimum of one and one-half hours had passed between the assault and the shooting, which was a sufficient cooling off period. Furthermore, the defendant initiated the confrontation, and in these circumstances, as discussed above, the defendant is not entitled to a self-defense instruction. For these reasons the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is unavailing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>431 Mass. 108, 120-121, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 864 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">b. The defendant also contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to two portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. The defendant alleges that the prosecutor voiced a personal opinion when she stated, \u201cIf I saw a guy coming at me with a gun, I think there would be some movement in that car.\u201d The prosecutor made this statement as a rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s claim that because there was movement in the car he was justified in shooting at the car. Merely using a \u201cfirst person pronoun does not interject personal belief into a statement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 424 (1990). The prosecutor was merely arguing that the average person would move if they saw a gun such as the one wielded by the defendant. Therefore, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was not improper, and consequently trial \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to object . . . becomes immaterial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 686 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In addition, the defendant argues that his counsel should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s characterizing the defendant\u2019s story as \u201cridiculous.\u201d A prosecutor is allowed to characterize a defendant\u2019s story. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deloney, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 52 (2003) (acceptable for prosecutor to describe defendant\u2019s story as \u201cpreposterous\u201d). A remark made during closing \u201cmust be considered in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s entire argument, as well as in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourgeois, </em>391 Mass. 869, 885 (1984). Here, viewing the remark in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s entire argument and taking into consideration the fact that the judge reminded the jury at the beginning of trial and after the defense rested that closing arguments were not evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s characterization was proper. \u201cBecause there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor, there was no ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirwan, </em>448 Mass. 304, 317 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">c. The defendant next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach or cross-examine witnesses. First, the defendant argues that trial counsel should have impeached Shepard by cross-examining him about the \u201cdiscrepancy between his trial and grand jury testimony\u201d with respect to the timing of the shooting, impeached the medical examiner\u2019s testimony because of the \u201ccontradiction\u201d between her testimony and the emergency room records, and impeached Taster\u2019s testimony regarding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>cellular telephone call he denied receiving during the argument at Bass\u2019s apartment. He claims that trial counsel\u2019s failure to probe these issues undercut the self-defense theory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> According to the defendant, if the shot that killed Nate came from the side of the car rather than the rear, it would support the claim that the defendant acted hastily in response to a threat rather than out of deliberate premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We need not detail the specifics of these arguments because even assuming that the claims had merit, the defendant would not be entitled to a self-defense instruction where he initiated the confrontation and failed to retreat or attempt to retreat. Furthermore, he presented no evidence that there was no reasonable means of escape available.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There was no ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The defendant next claims that trial counsel failed to cross-examine Langley, the only other witness the defense called in this case, concerning inconsistencies in his claim that he heard the defendant threaten to get \u201cheat\u201d after Bernie assaulted him. The record shows that trial counsel tried to impeach Langley\u2019s trial testimony with the police report in which he recounted hearing the threat.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even if we accept the defendant\u2019s contention, there is an obvious tactical reason trial counsel might not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>have wanted to impeach Langley: it would have reinforced Rolon\u2019s testimony that she overhead the defendant say something about getting \u201cheat.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Candelario, </em>446 Mass. 847, 854 (2006) (deference given to tactical decisions of trial counsel unless decisions manifestly unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The defendant further claims that trial counsel should have impeached Rolon because, according to the defendant, she told the grand jury that the defendant, while on the telephone inside her apartment, said he was going to \u201cblast\u201d his assailants but testified at trial that she heard him make the threat when he left the apartment. The judge found the \u201csignificance of this discrepancy elusive.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree, as it is the statement itself, not its timing in this particular context, that is relevant. Therefore, the failure to impeach on this matter did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">d. The defendant asserts several grounds to support his next contention that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress his statement to the police. The defendant states that had the statement been suppressed, the defendant could have also sought to have the gun suppressed. Even if we assume that the gun was improperly admitted, it would not create a substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice, because the Commonwealth had several witnesses who testified that the defendant was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The defendant further argues that the police statement was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. However, the prosecutor did not admit the police statement in evidence. She used it to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony by showing that it did not contain any reference to the \u201cmovement\u201d and \u201cflash\u201d within the car moments before the shooting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Statements that are obtained in violation of the Miranda rights may be used to impeach a witness, so long as the statement was not involuntarily given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>364 Mass. 236, 239-240 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The defendant next claims that the statement he gave to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>police was involuntary because they pressured him by withholding medical treatment, telling him that others were giving statements and that he should \u201cspeak up to demonstrate his innocence.\u201d The only basis for this claim is the defendant\u2019s affidavit, which the judge did not credit. Because we give \u201cspecial deference to the decision of the judge who was ... the trial judge,\u201d we accept this finding. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 499 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 787 (1995) (in motion for new trial, judge is \u201cfinal arbiter of matters of credibility\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>433 Mass. 654, 661 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The defendant also contends that trial counsel should have sought to suppress his statement to the police because he was denied his right to use the telephone pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Unfavorable evidence gained through an intentional deprivation of a defendant\u2019s right to make a telephone call should be suppressed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>362 Mass. 497, 502-503 (1972). At trial, the defendant testified that the police officers gave him Miranda warnings and \u201cgave [him] a couple phone calls.\u201d However, in his affidavit in support of his motion for a new trial the defendant claimed that he was not advised of his right to make a telephone call until over one hour after he had been arrested and that his request to make a telephone call was denied. Even assuming that the defendant was not told about his right to make a telephone call within one hour, he was informed before the inculpatory statement was given and consequently the statement would not have been suppressed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>347 Mass. 418, 420-421 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>As there was no ineffective assistance of counsel, the judge did not err in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">3. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record, including the defendant\u2019s arguments in his motion for a new trial, pursuant to our obligation under G.

Langley did not recall much of what happened, at one point stating, \u201cThis was a long time ago. I\u2019m trying to remember as best I can.\u201d However, Langley did state that during the initial altercation he told the defendant that they outnumbered him and he should not try anything. Nevertheless, the defendant\u2019s case relies heavily on his own testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">It is not clear from the defendant\u2019s testimony where the \u201calleyway\u201d was located. When asked if he backed his car and parked it in the parking lot, his response was, \u201cI just backed it up and parked it in front of the dumpster.\u201d Based on the record, it appears as though the alleyway was located in or near the back of Bass\u2019s apartment building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The defendant testified that the \u201cflash\u201d could have been \u201ca weapon of some type,\u201d perhaps something that could have been used to slash his, tire. The defendant argues that \u201cthe jury should have been allowed to weigh whether the perceived weapon . . . reasonably created a threat warranting the exercise of self-defense.\u201d Even assuming that the weapon was a knife or a box cutter, the defendant would still have a duty to attempt at least to retreat unless there was no reasonable means of escape. In this case, there is nothing in his testimony to suggest that once he saw the flash he attempted to retreat. Furthermdre, there is no evidence to suggest that there was no reasonable means of escape available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"ANY\">The facts in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>431 Mass. 782 (2000), on which the defendant relies, are easily distinguishable. In the <em>Little </em>case, the defendant and the victim argued and the defendant showed the victim his gun. <em>Id. </em>at 784. The defendant left and went to a friend\u2019s apartment. <em>Id. </em>As the defendant was leaving the apartment, the victim approached and kept advancing until the defendant warned the victim and pulled his gun. <em>Id. </em>at 784-785. The defendant testified that he \u201cwas scared\u201d because the victim was \u201chigh\u201d and he \u201cmade a motion like he was \"going for his hip.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785. Unlike the <em>Little </em>case where the victim was the aggressor, in this case, the defendant was the aggressor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\"> At oral argument the Commonwealth withdrew its contention that the defendant did not preserve for appellate review his claim of entitlement to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter based on the theories of provocation and sudden combat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The facts in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fortini, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 701 (2007), on which the defendant relies, are easily distinguished. In that case, the defendant had been harassed earlier in the evening by strangers in a vehicle and so he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>sat on his porch with a shotgun hoping to spot a registration number. <em>Id. </em>at 702-703. A stranger approached his porch, \u201c \u2018lunged\u2019 at [him] and reached for the gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. The defendant \u201ctook a step back\u201d and shot him. <em>Id. </em>The court held that the defendant was entitled to reasonable provocation instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 706. Unlike the <em>Fortini </em>case, in this case, the defendant approached the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b716-13\">The defendant testified that at least four hours had passed between the time of the assault on him and the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The defendant states, in his memorandum in support of the motion for a new trial, that \u201cthe deficiencies of counsel argued in this . . . motion deprived him of his right to counsel\u201d under the Sixth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Constitution. The statutory standard of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, is more favorable than the constitutional standard for ineffective counsel claims; therefore, if the defendant does not prevail under the \u00a7' 33E standard, he will not prevail under the constitutional standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"Aoz\">Although the defendant also argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because he failed to question the defendant on \u201cseveral points [that] tended to show self-defense or manslaughter,\u201d he does not explain how the failure to question the defendant would have shown manslaughter and under which of the three theories he is basing his claim. Pursuant to G.
