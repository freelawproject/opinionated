G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to a two-year term of probation which he completed without incident on September 9, 1981. Twenty-two years later, on November 10, 2003, the Sex Offender Registry Board (board) notified Doe that pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q, the sex offender registration law (registration law),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was reviewing his case to make a recommendation regarding his duty to register with the board and his classification level. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01 (2002). Doe was given thirty days to submit documentary evidence \u201crelative to his risk of reoffense, the degree of dangerousness posed to the public and his duty to register.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.05(1) (2002). Doe submitted documentary evidence to the board to the effect that he had established a stable life in the community, with a strong network of family and friends, and that he had been married for twenty-one years, had raised three accomplished children, and had maintained steady employment with increasing levels of responsibility over the years. Doe had not been convicted of any crime since his 1981 discharge from probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">On December 31, 2003, the board recommended that Doe be required to register as a level one sex offender. A level one classification is the classification given to sex offenders whose risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>of reoffense is low.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Doe was informed of his right to request an evidentiary hearing to challenge his classification and registration obligation. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.06(1), 1.07(1) (2002). On January 11, 2004, Doe requested a hearing, and the matter was assigned to a hearing examiner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) (c); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.07(2) (2002). The board then filed a motion for a required finding that Doe be classified as a level one offender (without a hearing) because as a matter of law, a person previously convicted of a sexually violent offense (such as rape)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was required to register regardless of whether he posed any risk of reoffense or danger to the public, and a level one classification was the least intrusive designation that Doe could obtain under the registration law. The board acknowledged that, although in some circumstances, it could relieve a sex offender of the duty to register and could remove registration information from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>the registry,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> such relief could not be granted where, as here, the offender had been convicted of a sexually violent offense. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In response to the board\u2019s motion, the hearing examiner issued an order granting Doe leave to file a rebuttal statement addressing only whether the conviction information presented by the board was accurate, whether he was an adult at the time of his offense, and whether the facts otherwise suggested any exception to the registration requirement of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d). </em>The order further stated that if, as an adult, Doe had committed a sexually violent offense, annual registration as a sex offender was mandatory pursuant to \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On April 20, 2004, Doe submitted a rebuttal statement in which he claimed that his duty to register was not automatic by virtue of his conviction of a sexually violent offense. In particular, Doe took issue with Section D of the board\u2019s \u201cClassification Worksheet,\u201d which stated that \u201c[o]ffender currently presents some risk to reoffend and a degree of dangerousness.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Doe asserted that there was no basis in the record for this conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>and that he had a right to challenge it at a hearing. Doe further argued that if G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K, mandated that he register solely because of his prior conviction, then the application of the statute to him violated his due process rights under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Notwithstanding Doe\u2019s request for a hearing, none was held. By order dated April 22, 2004, the hearing examiner directed Doe to register with the board as a level one sex offender, in accordance with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (a). At the time of the order, there was no evidence that Doe\u2019s behavior during the intervening decades since his plea indicated that he posed any risk of reoffense or danger \u201cto the vulnerable members of our communities\u201d that the registration law was intended to protect,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a circumstance essentially acknowledged by the hearing examiner. The examiner concluded, however, that because the crime of rape was specified as a \u201c[s]exually violent offense\u201d under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, Doe could be granted no relief from his obligation to register, irrespective of any showing that he posed no such risk. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178E <em>(e), </em>178G, 178K (2) <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Doe filed a complaint for judicial review of the board\u2019s decision in the Superior Court, asserting that his substantive and procedural due process rights under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights were violated because he was not afforded a hearing to challenge the board\u2019s classification recommendation, and there was no evidence to suggest that he posed a danger to anyone so as to necessitate registration. Doe\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), was denied and he was ordered to register as a level one sex offender. Doe filed a timely notice of appeal, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. For the reasons that follow, we agree that the board\u2019s determination that Doe had a mandatory obligation to register annually, solely by virtue of his prior conviction, violates Doe\u2019s due process rights as protected by the Massachusetts Declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>tian of Rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, we vacate and remand the case to the board to allow Doe to present evidence that he poses no risk to reoffend and thus should not be required to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>The genesis of the duty to register traces back to 1996, when the Legislature first enacted a registration law. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-1780. St. 1996, c. 239, \u00a7 1. The registration requirements and notification provisions were subsequently held to be unconstitutional and its implementation enjoined in 1997. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136 (1997). The registration law was rewritten in 1999, St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>and now applies to all persons convicted of certain sex offenses, including persons convicted long before its enactment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, it applies to persons convicted of a designated sex offense whose \u201cincarceration or parole or probation\u201d had been completed \u201con or after August 1, 1981.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Because Doe\u2019s probation ended on September 9, 1981, he is subject to the requirements of the 1999 law.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">As the board acknowledges, it has authority to relieve some sex offenders of the obligation to register if they establish \u201cthat the circumstances of the[ir] offense [and] criminal history do not indicate a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (d). But the 1999 statute mandates that those who have committed a \u201c[s]exually violent offense,\u201d which includes rape (G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C), may never be excused from registration; the obligation is lifetime in duration. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178G, 178K (2) <em>(d). </em>Thus, Doe was not permitted to challenge the board\u2019s determination that he posed a risk of reoffense to vulnerable offenders of our communities. This case presents the circumstance we noted, but did not need to decide, in <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750 (2006) <em>(Doe No. 1211), </em>where the record would establish \u201cthat Doe poses no risk at all [of reoffense]\u201d and the application of the statutory provisions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>permanently foreclose his being relieved of the duty to register may be \u201cconstitutionally vulnerable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">1. <em>Retroactivity. </em>In mentioning the registration law\u2019s constitutional vulnerability in <em>Doe No. 1211, </em>we did not distinguish between its retrospective and prospective application. However, retroactive statutes raise particular constitutional concerns. \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals.\u201d <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 266 (1994). This risk is acute in the context of people who have committed crimes that have a sexual component, and who are frequently the target of public ire and scorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Inquiry into whether the registration law has been unconstitutionally applied to Doe begins with an examination of whether the registration law is retroactive in its application. We confronted a similar challenge to the application of the sexually dangerous person act, G. L. c. 123A (SDP act), to persons convicted of sex offenses prior to the SDP act\u2019s amendment in 1999. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 497-499 (2000). We concluded that although a prerequisite for civil commitment under the SDP act was the commission of a sexual offense, and convictions occurring prior to the enactment of the SDP act could be used to satisfy that prerequisite, the statute\u2019s application was nonetheless not retroactive. <em>Id. </em>at 498. In reaching this conclusion, we held that the \u201crequisite sexual offense convictions determine only the persons eligible for potential civil commitment, and [are] not the basis for commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>of the commitment or, as we stated, \u201cthe conduct triggering the statute\u2019s application\u201d was the person\u2019s \u201ccurrent mental condition\u201d and consequent present sexual dangerousness, thereby making the application of the SDP act prospective. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In other words, the enactment of G. L. c. 123A did not attach \u201cnew legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Prods., supra </em>at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The same could be said of the registration law if a conviction for sexual offenses predating its enactment subjected a person only to potential registration and classification, or even a presumption of registration, with the ultimate registration requirement tied to an assessment (by the board) of the person\u2019s current level of dangerousness and risk of reoffense. With respect to some sex offenders, that is how the law operates. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (d). See also G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (c), (/). However, with respect to Doe, his conviction of rape, a \u201c[sjexually violent offense\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, makes the statutory presumption of risk conclusive. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C, 178G, 178K (2) <em>(d). </em>The sole basis for the requirement that Doe register, therefore, is the fact that he pleaded guilty to rape in 1979. Thus, in Doe\u2019s case, the registration law attaches new legal consequences to events that occurred before its enactment, and must be considered retroactive for the purposes of further constitutional inquiry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 498-499 (discussing \u201cnew consequence\u201d formulation of retroactivity).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A retroactive statute that imposes an additional punishment on past, and already punished, criminal behavior undoubtedly runs afoul of double jeopardy prohibitions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have said, however, that the registration law is generally regulatory rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>than punitive. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 499-502; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1224-1227 (1996). See also <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 534, 538-539 (1998), quoting <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997) (in determining whether civil sanctions constitute punishment, we must consider whether law was intended to be civil and, if so, whether statutory scheme was \u201cso punitive either in purpose or effect\u201d as to \u201ctransfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While nonpunitive retroactive regulation is not unconstitutional per se, it nonetheless raises due process concerns. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 189-190 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Retroactive laws must meet the test of \u201creasonableness\u201d to comport with State constitutional due process requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 190. \u201c[0]nly those retroactive statutes \u2018which, on a balancing of opposing considerations, are deemed to be unreasonable, are held to be unconstitutional. \u2019 \u201d <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>416 Mass. 698, 702 (1993), quoting <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 577 (1991). The burden is on the challenger to make a factual showing that the statute is irrational in its application. Ultimately, the \u201cprincipal inquiry \u2014 as to reasonableness \u2014 is essentially a review of whether it is equitable to apply the retroactive statute against the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In determining whether the application is equitable \u2014 and thus whether the regulation is reasonable \u2014 we examine the statute from three perspectives: \u201cthe nature of the public interest which motivated the Legislature to enact the retroactive statute; the nature of the rights . . . affected retroactively; and the extent or scope of the statutory effect or impact.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\"><em>2. The nature of the public interest. </em>In contrast to <em>American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 192-193, and <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, supra </em>at 577-578, where the court was required to consider what <em>could </em>or <em>may </em>have been the motivating reasons for the Legislature to enact the statutes that were at issue, in the case of the registration law, the Legislature was explicit regarding the public interest it was seeking to protect and advance. The purpose behind the registration law, as stated in the emergency preamble to its revision in 1999, is to protect \u201cthe vulnerable members of our communities from sexual offenders.\u201d See note 8, <em>supra. </em>In particular, the Legislature found \u201cthe danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders, <em>especially sexually violent offenders who commit predatory acts characterized by repetitive and compulsive behavior, </em>to be grave and that the protection of the public from <em>these sex offenders </em>is of paramount interest\u201d (emphasis added). St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 1. It also found that \u201claw enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to protect their communities\u201d from sex offenders are \u201cimpaired by the existing lack of information known about sex offenders who live within their jurisdictions\u201d; that the registration of sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>offenders is a proper exercise of police powers <em>\u201cregulating present and ongoing conduct, </em>which will provide law enforcement with additional information critical to preventing sexual victimization\u201d; and that the \u201cregistration by sex offenders is necessary in order to permit classification of such offenders on <em>an individualized basis according to their risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">There is no dispute that \u201c[s]ex offenders are a serious threat in this Nation,\u201d <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 4 (2003), quoting <em>McKune </em>v. <em>Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 32 (2002) (plurality opinion), and that the public interest in protecting vulnerable members of the community from sexual predators is a compelling one. But it is nearly impossible to conclude that this interest and the statute\u2019s defined purposes are served by imposing, without' any opportunity for classification \u201con an individualized basis,\u201d a registration requirement on a person who committed a single sexual offense more than twenty-four years before the board\u2019s imposition of the requirement,, and, whose demonstrable record since that time contains no evidence whatsoever of \u201cpredatory [sexual] acts characterized by repetitive and compulsive behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">3. <em>The nature of the rights affected. </em>The rights affected by the registration requirement, while not fundamental, are nevertheless substantial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As applied, the registration law requires Doe to register annually and requires the Commonwealth annu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>ally to inform local <em>and </em>Federal law enforcement officers that, in its- view, Doe presents a risk of committing a sex offense, despite his conduct between 1979 and the present that demonstrates otherwise. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 144 (1997). See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 453 (2001) (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). If Doe is forced to register, even though his information would not be released publicly, he would nevertheless be \u201csingled out and brought to the attention of the law enforcement agencies in the municipalities in which [Doe] live[s] and work[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450 (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Thus, in the eyes of those entrusted with enforcing the law, he would be forever viewed as a threat to the most vulnerable members of the Commonwealth, left to suffer the consequences of such an unsavory designation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Although Doe was not afforded \u201cany opportunity to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>what he likely could: that he is not a danger to children or other vulnerable persons,\u201d he would now be obligated to register or face criminal penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 449 (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). We have noted that such registration presents an \u201cimportantly distinct kind of constitutional danger,\u201d because it \u201cforces an action on the person required to register. It is a continuing, intrusive, and humiliating regulation of the person himself.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 149 (Fried, J., concurring). Ultimately, Doe would be required to acquiesce to the State\u2019s determination that he poses a continuing threat of reoffense, and regularly provide the board with his home and work addresses. He would be forced to say annually, and without regard for the past one-quarter century, \u201cI am a sex offender, and here is where to find me.\u201d Such a requirement would fundamentally change the nature of the relationship between Doe and State, and would be \u201cin principal quite alien to our traditions.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>430 Mass. 155, 162 (1999), quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 150 (1997) (Fried, J., concurring).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">4. <em>The extent of the abrogation of the asserted rights. </em>The burden imposed by the retroactive statute must be reasonable in scope and extent. In making that determination, we have asked whether the imposition is short-term, or of infinite duration. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 196 (1978). We have also considered whether the scope of the statute is narrowly drawn to treat the problem perceived by the legislature. <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>568, 579-580 (1991). <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins.

It is imposed yearly, without exception, and in Doe\u2019s case, it \u201cshall never be terminated.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178G. \u201cOffenders cannot shorten their registration or notification period, even on the clearest demonstration of rehabilitation .... However plain it may be that a former sex offender currently poses no threat of recidivism, he will remain subject to long-term monitoring and inescapable humiliation.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 117 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>When considering the retroactive application of civil statutes, we balance \u201copposing considerations.\u201d <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, supra </em>at 577, quoting <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 189-190. Here, the requirements the registration law would impose on Doe are extensive and permanent. Moreover, if Doe can establish that he poses neither a risk of reoffense nor a danger to the communities the law was intended to protect, the imposition of the registration law\u2019s requirements on him would not further the law\u2019s substantial and important purposes. Consequently, the retroactive imposition of the registration requirement without an opportunity to overcome the conclusive presumption of dangerousness that flows solely from Doe\u2019s conviction, violates his right to due process under the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Doe must be granted the hearing he has requested, in accordance with the procedure set forth in G.

See <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>441 Mass. 188, 195 (2004) (expansion of employer liability for employment discrimination based on religious beliefs could not be applied retroactively); <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>416 Mass. 698, 703-704 (1993) (retroactive application of statute imposing liability on single-home construction permit holder for injury to worker unreasonable and did not comport with due process); <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 578-580 (1991) (statute authorizing parents to bring claims for loss of consortium of child applied retroactively); <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 888, 904-905 (1980) (four-year retroactive imposition of tax unconstitutional, time period \u201coppressive and unjust\u201d). The three-part test is, therefore, largely tailored to cases involving retroactive financial liabilities. The same considerations, however, should be applicable here. As art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights states, \u201cEach individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property, according to standing Laws.\u201d Liberty, like property, therefore, must be protected from unreasonable infringement by retroactive laws. Cf. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 320-323, 326 (2001) (construing Federal statute that eliminated relief-from-deportation provision in prior law for resident aliens convicted of aggravated felonies as operating prospectively only, in light of new disabilities imposed by new law on aliens who had previously pleaded guilty to felonies); <em>Olatunji </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 383, 389-396 (4th Cir. 2004) (same law, same conclusion as applied to resident alien who previously pleaded guilty to theft of government property).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">As we noted in <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., supra </em>at 195, the inquiry is not only whether the Legislature\u2019s stated public interest is important, but also whether that interest is reasonably served by the statute. There, the court did not question \u201cwhether there [was] an important public interest at stake in prohibiting discrimination against persons for their sincerely held religious beliefs \u2014 there obviously [was] such an interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court asked whether that interest was reasonably achieved by the retroactive application of the legislation, and concluded that it was not. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\">We have noted in the context of civil statutes that, \u201c [generally, persons challenging a retroactive statute must show that they acted in reasonable reliance upon the previous state of the law.\u201d <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, supra </em>at 578. But see <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, supra </em>at 703-704 (retroactive application of statute imposing new obligations and potential tort liability on defendant\u2019s past conduct in obtaining and working under permit for construction of one single-family home violates defendant\u2019s due process rights without showing of actual reliance on law as it had existed). While- an. argument that Doe reasonably relied on the state of the law in 1979 (when there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>registration law) is not persuasive here, that fact alone is not dispositive. An individual, like Doe, who has committed a crime, served his sentence, and reformed his life has a justified expectation that he will not at some time in the distant future be automatically branded as a public danger in the eyes of law enforcement, and required annually to register as such, without consideration of his behavior since 1979. Cf. <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra </em>at 904 (in context of retroactive tax legislation, period of retroactivity cannot extend so far back as to be oppressive and unjust); <em>Olatunji </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, supra </em>at 396 (expressly rejecting idea that reliance on old statutory framework required before retroactivity will be considered unconstitutionally repressive in context of deportation for past crimes). \u201cTo be reminded again and again of an offense years past . . . that does not menace any vulnerable person now but that is swept into a grim, categorized term, \u2018sex offense,\u2019 would not be seen by most Americans as a minimal imposition.\u201d <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 452 (2001) (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">\u201c[I]t is the dissemination to law enforcement officials of a government-endorsed list of persons who in the eyes of the State are at risk of reoffending that raises due process concerns. . . .
