As the <em>Sole </em>Court noted, the \u201ctentative character\u201d of the preliminary injunction, where the litigation must continue \u201cto definitively resolve the controversy,\u201d makes a fee award \u201cat the initial stage premature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2195.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiff, T &amp; D Video, Inc. (T &amp; D), which in 2002 obtained permanent injunctive relief in a final judgment in the Superior Court, is eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees for its successful defense in 1994-1996 against the city of Revere\u2019s (city\u2019s) interlocutory appeals from a preliminary injunction, where T &amp; D did not request those fees. Instead, T &amp; D sought its interlocutory appellate (and other) attorney\u2019s fees for the first time in the Superior Court in 2003 after final judgment entered in its favor. In 2004, a judge in the Superior Court granted T &amp; D its fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, see note 7, <em>infra, </em>including in the award T &amp; D\u2019s fees and costs for defending against the city\u2019s interlocutory appeals in 1994-1996. The Appeals Court vacated the award, holding in part that any request for fees incurred on appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court should have been submitted in this court. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 461, 478 (2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 2905 (2007). We granted T &amp; D\u2019s application for further appellate review on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">For reasons we shall explain, we conclude that T &amp; D is eligible for its interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees. We also take this opportunity to clarify the Massachusetts procedure for requesting interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) and similar Federal fee-shifting statutes. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>In November, 1994, owing to difficulties that it experienced in obtaining permission from the city to open an \u201cadult\u201d video store in Revere, T &amp; D commenced an action in the Superior Court against the city, claiming, inter alla, that the city\u2019s \u201cadult entertainment\u201d zoning ordinances<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> violated T &amp; D\u2019s rights to protected expression under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111 (Massachusetts act).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> T &amp; D sought and obtained in the Superior Court a preliminary injunction restraining enforcement of the ordinances against it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>city filed a petition for relief from the injunction pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which a single justice of the Appeals Court denied. The city also appealed from the Superior Court judge\u2019s preliminary injunction pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, second par.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In February, 1995, this court granted the city\u2019s application for direct appellate review and, in September, 1996, affirmed the Superior Court judge\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. Revere, 423 Mass. 577, 583 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Following discovery, T &amp; D moved for summary judgment in the Superior Court, which was denied by a different judge in November, 2001. The case then proceeded to a jury-waived trial before a third judge in the Superior Court. In October, 2002, that judge concluded that enforcement of the city\u2019s adult entertainment ordinances violated the constitutional rights of T &amp; D to engage in the sale of nonobscene \u201cadult\u201d videotapes, and entered an order permanently enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinances against T &amp; D. In January, 2003, T &amp; D filed a motion in the Superior Court, as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u201cboth federal and state law,\u201d requesting attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the total amount of $1,163,233.28.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> T &amp; D\u2019s request included fees and costs associated with its defense of the city\u2019s appeals from the preliminary injunction in both the Appeals Court and in this court, identifying the amount of those fees and costs in detailed daily billing records submitted by T &amp; D\u2019s counsel, but without specifying the total amount in either court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In February, 2004, the judge awarded T &amp; D <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees and costs in a total amount of $915,027, but did not specify the portion of the award, if any, that related to the city\u2019s appeals from the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The city appealed from the final judgment in the Superior Court on the merits, and from the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to T &amp; D. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment on the merits. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 474 (2006). The court, however, disagreed with the judge\u2019s calculation of T &amp; D\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs and vacated so much of the order as had awarded those fees and costs, <em>id. </em>at 484, and remanded the matter to the Superior Court for recalculation of T &amp; D\u2019s fees and costs. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Appeals Court also concluded, without briefing or argument, that T &amp; D could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>recover none of its attorney\u2019s fees and costs related to its defense against the city\u2019s interlocutory appeal to this court, holding that any request for fees in connection with that appeal \u201cshould have been submitted\u201d to this court, which, it noted, \u201cawards attorney\u2019s fees where appropriate in its own cases, and has procedures for doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> T &amp; D petitioned for a rehearing in the Appeals Court solely on the issue of its interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Both parties applied for further appellate review. In the city\u2019s application, which we denied, it challenged the decision of the Appeals Court on the merits, and further claimed the Appeals Court should have denied \u201cin its entirety\u201d T &amp; D\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. In T &amp; D\u2019s application, which we granted, T &amp; D sought review only of the denial of its appellate attorney\u2019s fees pertaining to the city\u2019s 1994-1996 appeals from the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In its application, T &amp; D asserted that the Appeals Court\u2019s decision on this point misconstrued the relevant law, arguing that there is \u201cno basis under [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1988 to recover fees relating to a preliminary injunction while the merits of the underlying case are yet undecided,\u201d citing <em>Buckhannon </em>and other Federal cases.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It also argued that, at the time of the interlocutory appeals, \u201cit was not mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>that requests for appellate legal fees be made to the appellate court in the parties\u2019 briefs,\u201d citing <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"APi\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We first address the appropriateness of awarding T &amp; D its interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), and then outline the procedure for the request for, and award of, such fees and costs in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"A8N\">As noted earlier, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) authorizes a court to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d including attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal. See <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 604; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>391 F.3d 1, 24 (1st Cir. 2004) (allowing plaintiff\u2019s motion for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs of appeal pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988[b]). There is no question that T &amp; D is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs: it has obtained a permanent injunction enjoining enforcement of the city\u2019s \u201cadult entertainment\u201d ordinances against it. See <em>Buckhannon, </em>supra; <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Harris County, </em>485 F.3d 305, 314 (5th Cir. 2007) (party who obtained permanent injunction in trial court was \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to attorney\u2019s fees); <em>Andretti </em>v. <em>Borla Performance Indus., Inc., </em>426 F.3d 824, 835-836 (6th Cir. 2005) (same). See also <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 461, 475 (2006) (\u201cThat [T &amp; D] is the prevailing party here is not disputed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">The city argues, however, that, in 1996, when this court affirmed the order of the Superior Court granting T &amp; D a preliminary injunction, T &amp; D was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the then prevailing \u201ccatalyst test,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that T &amp; D\u2019s failure to request its appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs in its 1995 brief to this court was a \u201cclear waiver\u201d of that claim. <em>Buckhannon </em>and its progeny, however, \u201cmust be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.\u201d <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Retardation, </em>446 Mass. 286, 303 n.31 (2006), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Toms </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>338 F.3d 519, 530 (6th Cir. 2003). <em>Buckhannon </em>and <em>Sole </em>govern our resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The Appeals Court, which did not have the benefit of <em>Sole, supra, </em>rejected T &amp; D\u2019s petition for rehearing on the issue of its interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees for two reasons. First, it held that T &amp; D \u201cprevailed\u201d before this court, and T &amp; D\u2019s \u201cstatus as a prevailing party in that appeal became fixed when the court returned its decision regardless of what might happen in subsequent proceedings regarding a permanent injunction.\u201d This is contrary to <em>Buckhannon </em>and <em>Sole. </em>See <em>Sole, supra </em>at 2196; <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 604-605.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">The Appeals Court gave a second reason, in its view of \u201cgreater importance,\u201d pertaining not to the timing of T &amp; D\u2019s fee request, but rather its \u201clocation.\u201d The Appeals Court noted that it was \u201cnot persuaded that it is the business either of the Appeals Court or of a trial court to pass upon fee requests pertaining to proceedings in the Supreme Judicial Court.\u201d We agree with the Appeals Court that the appropriate forum for such a request is here, because we are in \u201ca far better position to evaluate the worth of the appellate work than the trial judge.\u201d <em>Yorke Mgt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989). The question, however, is whether, by failing to request its appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs from this court in 1995, T &amp; D waived its right to obtain those fees and costs as the prevailing party. The answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-23\">The fee request at issue in this appeal is based on a Federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). The procedure for requesting fees and costs, however, is governed by Massachusetts law. See <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, </em>411 Mass. 754, 756-757 (1992); <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 449, 425 (1981), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>456 U.S. 947 (1982). The Massachusetts procedure for requesting appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs was settled in <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004), which held for the first time that parties \u201cmust\u201d request such fees and costs in their appellate briefs. <em>Id. </em>at 10. In so doing, the <em>Fabre </em>court clarified that the admonition in <em>Yorke Mgt. </em>v. <em>Castro, supra </em>at 20, in effect when the city pursued interlocutory appeals in 1994-1996, that parties \u201cshould\u201d request attorney\u2019s fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>costs in their appellate brief, was mandatory, not discretionary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> T &amp; D\u2019s request does not come too late.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It may submit a request for its 1994-1996 appellate attorney\u2019s fees in this court and in the Appeals Court as explicated in <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 10-11.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aad\">We now clarify the procedure for parties seeking interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) and other similar Federal fee-shifting statutes. See note 4, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In fee requests filed pursuant to Federal fee-shifting statutes after the date of this opinion, a party seeking interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs must, consistent with <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra, </em>note its request in any interlocutory appellate brief, thereby giving notice to the appellate court and all other parties that it intends to seek fees and costs related to the interlocutory appeal in the event it is later determined to be a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d as explicated by <em>Buckhannon </em>and <em>Sole.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Sole, supra </em>at 2196; <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 603-605.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>If a party later becomes a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the trial court, that party must, within thirty days of the judgment or other action in the trial court judicially sanctioning a change in the legal relationship of the parties, <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 604-605, file an application for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, with appropriate supporting materials, in the trial court <em>and </em>in any appellate court for which it intends to seek its interlocutory appellate fees. If the nonprevailing party appeals from the judgment or other judicial action in the trial court, it may file a motion to stay all assessments of fees and costs in both the trial court and in any appellate court where fees are sought.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It shall then become the obligation of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d to move to lift any stay if the appeal is not pursued or when its \u201cprevailing party\u201d status is affirmed in subsequent proceedings. If the \u201cprevailing party\u201d fails to file a motion to lift any stay obtained by the nonprevailing party within thirty days of the date on which it became entitled to do so, any requests for attorney\u2019s fees and costs shall, except for good cause shown, be deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">If a party later becomes a \u201cprevailing party\u201d for the first time in an appellate court, the \u201cprevailing party\u201d must, within thirty days of the date of the appellate court rescript, file an application for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, with appropriate supporting materials, in both that appellate court in accordance with <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra, and </em>in the trial court, if it intends to seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Within thirty days of the date of the rescript, T &amp; D may file in this court an application for its attorney\u2019s fees and costs relating to its 1995-1996 defense in this court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the city\u2019s appeal from the preliminary injunction, with appropriate supporting materials. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra. </em>T &amp; D also has sought attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with this appeal. Its application for those fees and costs shall be filed at the same time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGj\">With respect to appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs T &amp; D may have incurred opposing the city\u2019s direct appeal in the Appeals Court, T &amp; D may apply for such fees and costs from the Appeals Court. See <em>Trustees of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>449 Mass. 675, 688-689 (2007). At the same time T &amp; D may apply in the Appeals Court for any attorney\u2019s fees and costs it may have incurred opposing the city\u2019s 1994-1995 interlocutory appeals in that court: for the same reasons explained above that T &amp; D did not waive its right to seek fees and costs for the interlocutory appeal to this court, it also did not waive the right to seek fees and costs for the interlocutory appeals in the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak1\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-18\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) (2006) provides: \u201cIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [\u00a7 1983] . . . , the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\"><em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Virginia Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598 (2001) <em>(Buckhannon), </em>involved fee-shifting provisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act.

The judge concluded that T &amp; D was entitled to 3,100 hours at the average hourly rate of $280, for a total award of $868,000 for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, not including expert witness fees. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 481 n.13 (2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 2905 (2007). In his memorandum of decision and order, the judge noted that he had the \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), but that the Massachusetts act mandates an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Most of the judge\u2019s discussion of T &amp; D\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs made reference to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). In relation to expert fees, however, the judge noted that expert fees are not available under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, but are available under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111. The judge first determined that the city had violated the Massachusetts act because it had, in his view, engaged in \u201ceconomic coercion.\u201d See <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 635, 648 (2003). He then ordered the city to pay $47,027 in expert fees to T &amp; D. The Appeals Court reversed the judge on that point, concluding that the city was not liable to T &amp; D under the Massachusetts act because there was, in its view, insufficient evidence of \u201ccoercion.\u201d <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. at 481-483. Accordingly, it held that T &amp; D was not eligible for expert fees (and presumably not eligible for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, although it did not say so specifically) under the Massachusetts act. See <em>id. </em>T &amp; D did not seek further appellate review on that aspect of the Appeals Court\u2019s decision. We therefore do not consider any claim for interlocutory appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the Massachusetts act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Appeals Court made no reference to the issue of attorney\u2019s fees expended by T &amp; D in its defense of the city\u2019s interlocutory appeals to the Appeals Court. See notes 8 and 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Although the judge did not state explicitly that he was awarding T &amp; D its attorney\u2019s fees and costs relating to the city\u2019s appeal from the preliminary injunction to the Appeals Court or to this court, it seems clear that he did so. As noted earlier, T &amp; D included its appellate fees in its application to the Superior Court. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>The judge made no finding that T &amp; D was not eligible for such fees. The Appeals Court stated that the trial judge had ordered the city to pay T &amp; D\u2019s appellate interlocutory fees in this court in an amount of $100,000, a figure used by the city in its brief in the Appeals Court without record citation. <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>66 Mass.

In the Federal courts, attorney\u2019s fees sought for appellate litigatian pursuant to Federal fee-shifting statutes are generally awarded by the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>391 F.3d 1, 24 (1st Cir. 2004) (granting, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988[b], reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs of appeal but remanding for determination of appropriate amount); <em>Aubin </em>v. <em>Fudala, </em>821 F.2d 45, 47-48 (1st Cir. 1987) (remanding for award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs); <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Southworth, </em>564 F.2d 609, 613 (1st Cir. 1977) (noting that some factors \u201cgoing into a fee determination [for appellate work] require factual findings more appropriately made by a district court\u201d than by court of appeals).
