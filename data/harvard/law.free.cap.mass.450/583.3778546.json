L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>(b). </em>The Appeals Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1105 (2006). Thereafter, we granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. The defendant concedes the fact of intercourse but claims it was consensual, and he argues that errors in his trial require the reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">In particular, the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning the elements the Commonwealth must prove to obtain a conviction of the crime of rape; he focuses in significant part on the instructions concerning the complainant\u2019s possible incapacity to consent. Since at least 1870, we have recognized that in cases of rape, while the Commonwealth must prove the complainant\u2019s lack of consent as an element of the crime, there are circumstances in which this element may be satisfied by proof that the complainant lacked the capacity to consent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>105 Mass. 376 (1870) <em>(Burke). </em>In this case, we return to <em>Burke </em>and examine once again circumstances that may affect a complainant\u2019s capacity to consent, and whether, as <em>Burke </em>suggests, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the complainant\u2019s incapacity must be shown. We conclude that the judge\u2019s instructions failed to explain adequately what must be established about a complainant\u2019s condition before the complainant may be deemed incapable of giving or withholding consent. For the reasons explained below, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>There was evidence at trial from which the jury could have found the following. On August 17, 2000, the complainant, who was twenty-six years old, went out with a female friend to a bar in Haverhill. The complainant was five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>feet, two inches tall and weighed 110 pounds. Before leaving home at around 7 p.m., the complainant smoked marijuana and took an antianxiety medication called Klonopin. She had not eaten any food all day. The complainant had \u201c[a] couple\u201d of alcoholic drinks at the first bar she visited, and drank \u201c[a] lot\u201d at a second bar, where she spent the latter part of the evening. Between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, the complainant and her friend were joined by David MacRae, whom the complainant had been dating for about one week, and his friend Allan Castro. By that time, the complainant was \u201cvery drunk,\u201d and she had only intermittent memories of the remainder of the evening. When the group left the bar shortly before it closed, the complainant was \u201ccausing a scene,\u201d was argumentative, had difficulty walking, and fell twice. The complainant\u2019s friend took her keys to drive her home. Ultimately, however, Castro drove the complainant\u2019s friend home in the complainant\u2019s truck, and then he, MacRae, and the complainant drove to MacRae\u2019s house in Methuen.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">At MacRae\u2019s house, the complainant continued to behave belligerently. She attempted to leave MacRae\u2019s house but drove her truck into his fence and then backed up into the house itself, at which point MacRae took her keys. Castro telephoned the police, and MacRae told them he needed assistance with an unwanted and very intoxicated female guest. Before the police arrived, the complainant returned to the house and \u201cpassed out\u201d for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The Methuen police dispatched the defendant, Officer David Blache, to respond to the call; he arrived at MacRae\u2019s house just before 2 a.m. When the defendant arrived, the complainant woke up; she was \u201cstill drunk,\u201d and Castro saw her fall \u201cstraight back and hit her head . . . [o]n the wall.\u201d The defendant spent about forty-five minutes at the house gathering information for an accident report and arranging for the complainant\u2019s truck to be towed. During this time, according to MacRae, Castro, the defendant, and the tow truck driver, the complainant exhibited sexually aggressive behavior toward the defendant. She touched him, tried to kiss him and \u201cgrab[] his crotch,\u201d asked him if he wanted to have sex with her, licked the windows of his police cruiser, and pulled down her pants to show the defendant her genitals. Witnesses also testified that at this time she was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>drunk; she slurred her speech; and she pulled down her pants and began to urinate in the street in front of MacRae\u2019s house when he refused to allow her back inside to use his bathroom. While the defendant was speaking with MacRae, he allowed the complainant to sit in the front seat of his cruiser because she was cold; after she twice turned on the cruiser\u2019s lights and siren, he transferred her to the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">After arranging to have the complainant\u2019s truck towed, the defendant obtained permission from police headquarters to transport her home to Haverhill because she did not have enough money to pay for a taxi. The complainant testified that she did not remember leaving MacRae\u2019s house in the cruiser, and that the next thing she remembered was the car pulling up next to a dumpster. Once the car stopped, the defendant opened the driver\u2019s side rear door, pulled down the complainant\u2019s pants, and vaginally raped her in the back seat of the cruiser. She testified that she told him she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do that,\u201d and tried to kick the defendant and the partition between the front and rear seats, but she was unable to open the opposite door because there was no interior handle. She further testified that the defendant then drove her home, and when he dropped her off he warned her that the police have a \u201ccode of silence\u201d and they would not believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The defendant also testified at trial. He admitted having intercourse with the complainant, but he claimed that it was consensual and occurred at her house. According to the defendant, he dropped the complainant at home and cleared the call with headquarters, then he knocked on her door and asked to use her bathroom. He testified that when he emerged from the bathroom, the complainant was completely naked; they embraced, she performed oral sex on him, and they had consensual intercourse on her couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Although the complainant did not remember making any telephone calls after she returned home, the prosecutor played recordings of two 911 calls she placed to the Haverhill police. Additionally, Castro testified that he answered two calls from the complainant at MacRae\u2019s house about one-half hour after the complainant had left with the defendant. In the first call, she said in a \u201cbragging\u201d or \u201csarcastic\u201d tone, \u201cTell Dave [MacRae] thanks for the best fuck of my life,\u201d and hung up. In the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>call, a few minutes later, she said, \u201cTell Dave I\u2019m going to go for the whole rape thing,\u201d and hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Haverhill police responded to the complainant\u2019s 911 calls at about 3:30 a.m. and convinced her to go to the hospital for a sexual assault examination. Two female officers who assisted the complainant that morning testified as fresh complaint witnesses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; they described the complainant as quite upset and still intoxicated. The vaginal swab taken from the complainant as part of the examination contained sperm cells, but the oral swab did not. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the sperm cells collected matched a blood sample submitted by the defendant. Sperm was also detected in a stain on the zipper area of the defendant\u2019s uniform pants but not in the back seat of the cruiser. The complainant\u2019s blood was drawn at 7:30 a.m.; testing revealed a blood alcohol level at that time of 0.14 per cent, as well as evidence of marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Using retrograde extrapolation, a toxicology expert testified that the complainant\u2019s blood alcohol level at 2:30 to 3 a.m. would have been between 0.176 and 0.24 per cent, a level that typically causes disorientation, loss of judgment, impaired perception, lethargy, imbalance, slurred speech, loss of memory, impaired comprehension, and confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In her charge to the jury, the judge touched on the issue of intoxication twice, first in defining the element of force required for the crime of rape, and later in explaining the crime\u2019s additional element of lack of consent on the part of the complainant. In explaining force, the judge instructed that \u201c[t]he crime of rape may be accomplished through the use of actual physical force or violence,\u201d but explained that this need not always be the case. She went on to say, \u201cfor example, if [a complainant\u2019s] condition as a result of being intoxicated or unconscious or asleep is such that she is wholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting, then the Commonwealth need only prove that amount of force which was necessary to accomplish the natural or unnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d In her separate explanation of the crime\u2019s element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>of lack of complainant consent, however, the judge told the jury only that they might consider evidence of the complainant\u2019s \u201csobriety\u201d in assessing her capacity to consent. The judge did not repeat that the complainant\u2019s level of /\u00absobriety or intoxication must be such that she was \u201cwholly insensible\u201d in order for the jury to find her incapable of consenting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">During their deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the judge asking, \u201cCould you please clarify the definition of \u2018wholly\u2019 insensible?\u201d The judge worked with the prosecutor and defense counsel in an attempt to frame a response, but she ultimately determined that the instruction was sufficiently clear as given. She accordingly instructed the jury, over the defendant\u2019s objection, to \u201capply your collective understanding of what those words mean in our ordinary discourse and . . . with some discussion among yourselves, decide the meaning of those words. Each word by itself is plain and are words that are used in ordinary discourse, and I cannot give you any further legal definition or clarification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">2. Commonwealth v. Burke <em>and instructions on incapacity to consent. </em>In challenging the judge\u2019s instruction on rape, the defendant argues that the judge erred in her explanation concerning the circumstances in which a complainant may be found to lack the capacity to consent, and compounded the error by refusing to explain her instruction further in response to the jury\u2019s question about the meaning of her words.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, the defendant objected to the language of the judge\u2019s instruction and to the judge\u2019s decision not to respond substantively to the jury\u2019s question. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim of error is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">When the judge told the jury that the complainant\u2019s \u201ccondition as a result of being intoxicated or unconscious or asleep [may be] such that she is <em>wholly insensible so as to be incapable of </em>consenting\u201d (emphasis supplied), she was. quoting language from this court\u2019s decision in <em>Burke. Burke </em>was a case involving a defendant charged with aiding and assisting in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>rape of an extremely intoxicated woman.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After reviewing English common-law precedents defining the crime of rape as \u201cthe carnal knowledge of a woman by force and against her will,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and demonstrating that the phrase \u201cagainst her will\u201d was synonymous with \u201cwithout her consent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 380, the court held as follows: \u201cWe are therefore unanimously of opinion that the crime, which the evidence in this case tended to prove, of a man\u2019s having carnal intercourse with a woman, without her consent, while she was, as he knew, wholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting, and with such force as was necessary to accomplish the purpose, was rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380-381.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">This holding in <em>Burke </em>contains two premises that bear on the issue of a complainant\u2019s incapacity to consent. The first has two parts and can be summarized as follows: While generally for the crime of rape the Commonwealth must prove that the alleged sexual intercourse occurred by force and without the complainant\u2019s consent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where the complainant is \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting,\u201d (a) the element of lack of consent is satisfied; and (b) the only force required for proof of the crime is \u201csuch force as was necessary to accomplish\u201d the act of intercourse \u2014 that is, only the force necessary to effect penetration. The second premise is perhaps more implicit than explicit. It is this: Where the Commonwealth uses proof that the complainant has been rendered \u201cincapable of consenting\u201d to establish the necessary element of her lack of consent and to reduce the degree of required force, the Commonwealth should also prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the complainant\u2019s incapacitated state.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Over the years, <em>Burke </em>has continued to be cited in Massachusetts decisions, and to be reflected in the rape instructions that trial judges give. However, in cases after <em>Burke, </em>instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tians used by trial judges (and implicitly approved by appellate decisions) have been less than clear in defining what must be shown in order for the jury to find the complainant was incapable of consenting, particularly in relation to the complainant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and drugs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And the second of <em>Burke\u2019s </em>premises \u2014 that the defendant have knowledge of the complainant\u2019s incapacity \u2014 has sometimes not been mentioned at all.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Despite this somewhat spotty record of adherence to <em>Burke, </em>for the reasons discussed immediately below, we think that <em>Burke </em>articulated the correct principles to govern in cases of rape where the complainant lacks the capacity to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">a. <em>Standard for finding of incapacity to consent. </em>First, where drugs or alcohol are concerned, it is important to emphasize that, as <em>Burke </em>makes clear, consumption or even intoxication by itself is not the issue. It is a matter of common knowledge that there are many levels of intoxication, and the fact of intoxication, by itself, does not necessarily mean that the individual in question is incapable of deciding whether to assent to a sexual encounter. The question instead is whether, as a result of the complainant\u2019s consumption of drugs, alcohol, or both, she was unable to give or refuse consent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The defendant argues that a complainant should only be considered incapable of giving or refusing consent when she \u201cwas intoxicated to the extent that. . . she was rendered unconscious or nearly so, and was temporarily incapable of making any decisions regarding sexual activity.\u201d He proposes to measure this level of impairment by looking to the complainant\u2019s capacity to communicate consent: the legal results of <em>Burke </em>should apply, he asserts, only where the complainant was \u201cunable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>communicate his [or] her lack of consent to the defendant (verbally, physically, or otherwise).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The defendant\u2019s characterization of the degree of incapacity required to trigger the <em>Burke </em>rules regarding proof of force and lack of consent is too restrictive. The law does not require that the complainant have been rendered \u201cunconscious or nearly so\u201d before she may be deemed past the point of consent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that an instruction concerning capacity to consent should be given in any case where the evidence would support a finding that because of the consumption of drugs or alcohol or for some other reason (for example, sleep, unconsciousness, mental retardation, or helplessness), the complainant was so im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>paired as to be incapable of consenting to intercourse. If the jury find the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the complainant\u2019s incapacity according to this standard, that finding satisfies the element of lack of consent, and as a corollary, the Commonwealth need only prove the amount of force necessary to accomplish intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We agree with the defendant, however, that the phrase \u201cwholly insensible,\u201d used in <em>Burke </em>to describe the necessary level of incapacity, sounds archaic and confusing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While both words may be used in modem discourse, the word \u201cinsensible\u201d does not have a single, unambiguous meaning. The dictionary definition of the word lists at least six possibilities, including: \u201cincapable or bereft of feeling or sensation[;] . . . deprived of consciousness[;j . . . deprived of . . . perception or ability to react[;] . . . <em>archaic: </em>lacking sense or intelligence: stupid, senseless, unreasoning[; and] unaware.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int'l Dictionary 1168 (1993). Some of these descriptions might suggest to jurors a lower bar than the law actually requires; others might suggest a higher bar. Even though, as the judge correctly pointed out to the lawyers, the complete phrase \u201cwholly insensible <em>so as to be incapable of consenting\u201d </em>(emphasis added) identifies the appropriate inquiry, the ambiguity of the word \u201cinsensible\u201d indicates the need for greater clarity. The formulation of the standard set forth above seeks to provide a more easily understood statement of what is required.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">b. <em>Defendant\u2019s knowledge of complainant\u2019s incapacity. </em>The second principle suggested by <em>Burke </em>is that where the evidence permits the Commonwealth to satisfy the element of lack of consent by proof of incapacity to consent, and therefore to satisfy the element of force simply by proof of penetration, there should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>also be proof that the defendant knew or should have known of the complainant\u2019s incapacity to consent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As noted, some of our cases have appeared to incorporate this principle. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ascolillo, 405 Mass. 456, 463 (1989) (judge included in incapacity instruction language \u201cas he knows, wholly insensible so as to be unable [to] consent\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simcock, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 194 (1991) (instruction included \u201cwhile knowing that she is utterly senseless so as to be unable [to] consent[]\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molle, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 621, 626-627 (2002) (instruction improper for failure to include language \u201cas he knows, wholly insensible so as to be unable to consent,\u201d although instruction also not warranted by evidence). Others have not. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urban, post </em>608, 612-613 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>439 Mass. 482, 490 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">There is good reason for requiring proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of incapacity. Massachusetts has not recognized the \u201cdefense\u201d of mistake of fact in rape cases generally. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 727-729, 732 (2001). We do not do so today (see part 4, <em>infra). </em>But there is an important distinction between a rape case where the complainant is capable of giving or refusing consent and one in which she is not. As the <em>Lopez </em>court noted, a primary rationale for our rule in cases where the complainant has the capacity to consent is that the prosecution must prove that the defendant compelled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>complainant to submit by the use of force or threat of bodily injury, and proof of that element of force \u201cshould negate any possible mistake as to consent\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 729. The <em>Lopez </em>court recognized, however, that in situations where the prosecution is not required to prove the use of force beyond that necessary for penetration, the possibility of a defendant\u2019s reasonable mistake about the complainant\u2019s consent could increase, creating the potential for injustice if no instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s honest and reasonable belief as to the complainant\u2019s consent were given.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">As <em>Burke </em>and its progeny reflect, a case in which the jury find that the complainant lacked the capacity to consent obviously represents one instance where the Commonwealth has no obligation to prove the use of force by the defendant beyond what is required for the act of penetration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. at 728-729. It thus makes sense to reemphasize the second principle suggested by <em>Burke, </em>and affirm that in such a case, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant\u2019s condition rendered her incapable of consenting to the sexual act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>proposed instruction that covers incapacity to consent, its effect on the elements of force and lack of consent, and the defendant\u2019s knowledge is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">c. <em>Incapacity instructions in this case. </em>The judge\u2019s instructions in this case failed to explain fully or with sufficient clarity the <em>Burke </em>principles that we have discussed above. The judge first summarized for the jury, correctly, that to prove the defendant guilty of rape, the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements: (1) the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with the complainant; and (2) the sexual intercourse was accomplished by the defendant\u2019s compelling the complainant to submit (a) by force and (b) against her will. After defining the necessary proof of sexual intercourse, the judge turned to the element of force and its definition. It was in this context that the judge gave her first instruction about the complainant\u2019s possible incapacity to consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>\u201cThe crime of rape may be accomplished through the use of actual physical force or violence. Depending on the circumstances, however, the amount of force necessary may be only that which is needed to accomplish the act itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\"><em>\u201cSo, for example, if [the complainant\u2019s] condition as a result of being intoxicated or unconscious or asleep is such that she is wholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting, then the Commonwealth need only prove that amount of force which was necessary to accomplish the . . . sexual intercourse\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The instructions went on to a further discussion of the use of force, and then reached the element of \u201cagainst her will.\u201d The judge began with the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse, and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201cYou may consider evidence of [the complainant\u2019s] state of mind at the time of the alleged incident on the issue of whether or not she consented to sexual intercourse. If a person submits because of fear, it is not consent. The person has to be free to exercise her will without restraint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\"><em>\u201cNow, there was some evidence presented in this case regarding the consumption of alcohol and marijuana and Klonopin by [the complainant] before the alleged incident occurred. You may take into consideration any evidence you find credible on the issue of her sobriety in assessing her ability to consent under such circumstances\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">From this order of the instructions, it is not clear that the jury would understand that the \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting\u201d instruction, given in connection with the element of force, also applied to the element of lack of consent. In other words, the jury may not have appreciated that for the Commonwealth to meet its burden of proof on the complainant\u2019s lack of consent by establishing that she was incapable of consenting, the Commonwealth must show not simply that she lacked sobriety or was intoxicated, but that as a result of the alcohol and drugs she consumed, the complainant\u2019s physical or mental condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>was so impaired that she could not consent. Moreover, quite apart from the question of order, the jury indicated their confusion about the meaning of the specific phrase \u201cwholly insensible\u201d by asking the judge for a further explanation of the meaning of the phrase, but the judge ultimately decided not to provide clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The record in this case reveals that with the fact of intercourse conceded, lack of consent was the principal if not only contested issue before the jury. The evidence presented conflicting views about whether the complainant was capable of consenting, and if she was capable, whether she did so. We cannot say that the errors in the charge were not prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). The defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The judge\u2019s instructions also failed to address the issue of the defendant\u2019s awareness of the complainant\u2019s possible incapacity. Although the <em>Burke </em>case impliedly suggests the need for such an instruction, <em>Burke </em>did not require it, and neither this court nor the Appeals Court has ever done so in the 137 years since <em>Burke </em>was decided. In the circumstances, we treat \u201c[t]he entitlement t\u00f3 a jury instruction [on the issue of the defendant\u2019s knowledge about incapacity] . . . [as] an exercise of our power of superintendence \u2018to regulate the presentation of evidence in court proceedings,\u2019 . . . not a new constitutional rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 720 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 444-445 (2004). Accordingly, we will not give the new rule retroactive effect, but will apply it solely to trials occurring after the issuance of the rescript in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, supra </em>at 720-721, and cases cited. In this case, a new trial is required for other reasons. In any retrial, if the complainant\u2019s capacity to consent is again at issue, the defendant will be entitled to an instruction that, in order to sustain a conviction on a theory of incapacity to consent, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant\u2019s condition rendered her incapable of consenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">3. <em>Sufficiency of evidence concerning incapacity. </em>The defendant argues strenuously on appeal that the evidence at trial was not sufficient to justify an instruction about the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ant\u2019s possible incapacity to consent. He did not raise this point at trial. After reviewing the record, we conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">An incapacity instruction was warranted on the evidence presented in this case. Several witnesses who observed the complainant shortly before the alleged rape took place testified that she exhibited signs of extreme intoxication, including falling down, behaving combatively, driving into a fence and the side of a house, and \u201cpassing] out\u201d for a period of time. The complainant herself testified to significant gaps in her memory. Furthermore, the complainant\u2019s blood alcohol level several hours after the alleged offense tested at 0.14 per cent, and there was expert testimony that, according to a retrograde analysis, her blood alcohol level at the time of the incident would have been between 0.176 and 0.240 per cent, a level likely to produce disorientation, loss of judgment, impaired perception, lethargy, imbalance, slurred speech, impaired comprehension, and confusion. Although the defendant points to countervailing evidence that the complainant was able to walk steadily, talk comprehensibly, dial the telephone, and make decisions regarding having her vehicle towed, the weight of such evidence was for the jury to determine. If any reasonable view of the evidence supports an instruction, it should be given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 220 (2007). Regardless of the existence of countervailing evidence, an intoxication instruction was warranted because there was evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude that the complainant was impaired to the point of being incapable of consenting to the sexual encounter.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molle, </em>56 Mass.

Although the defendant objected to the judge\u2019s instruction on the question whether the complainant was \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting,\u201d his objection went to the judge\u2019s failure to instruct on the complainant\u2019s \u201cincapacity\u201d in the terms he had requested. In particular, the defendant requested an \u201cincapacity\u201d instruction that would have required the Commonwealth to prove that the complainant was unconscious. He now argues for the first time that the \u201cwholly insensible\u201d instruction should not have been given because the evidence does not support a finding that the complainant was unconscious, or nearly so. We review a challenge to a jury instruction on a ground not specifically brought to the attention of the trial judge under the standard of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>433 Mass. 481, 489 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I disagree with the court and believe that because the evidence does not support a finding that the complainant was \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>105 Mass. 376, 380 (1870), a <em>Burke </em>instruction should not have been given. In that case, the court held the Commonwealth may prove lack of consent if it shows the complainant was \u201cwholly insensible,\u201d in a state of \u201cutter stupefaction,\u201d or in a \u201cstate of unconsciousness,\u201d terms the court used interchangeably, \u201cso as to be incapable of consenting.\u201d The evidence here fails to establish that the complainant had the requisite state of mind (or absence thereof) as exemplified by her testimony that she remembered telling the defendant at least three times that she did not want to have intercourse, and that she tried to kick him and she tried to push him off her. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>338 Mass. 377, 383, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 1001 (1959) (where complainant had been drugged by defendant but was sensible of what he was doing to her yet made no objection and offered no resistance, court said, \u201cThis is not a case where [the complainant] is incapable of consent by reason of stupefaction, unconsciousness or helplessness,\u201d citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra). </em>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>439 Mass. 482, 491 (2003) <em>(Burke </em>instruction warranted where intoxicated complainant was asleep each time defendant started performing sexual acts on her, and after waking she felt drugged and unable to act).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The complainant here also testified that she remembered sitting in the front seat of the police car before being raped, and pushing buttons that activated the siren. She recalled that the defendant was angry, and that he told her to sit in the rear seat of the police car and not touch anything. She remembered that the defendant had removed his duty belt, climbed into the rear seat of the police car, and removed her clothing. Within thirty minutes, the complainant telephoned police and reported she had been raped by a Methuen police officer. She was taken to a hospital less than one hour later, where a nurse recorded her condition as \u201cagitated,\u201d \u201cupset,\u201d and \u201cdistraught,\u201d but \u201calert and oriented.\u201d This evidence is insufficient to meet the standard of showing the complainant was \u201cwholly insensible,\u201d or in a state of \u201cutter stupefaction,\u201d or a \u201cstate of unconsciousness\u201d such that she was incapable of consenting. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra </em>at 380-381. There is no evidence that the complainant had no capacity to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Of course, an instruction is proper if it is supported by any hypothesis of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, </em>405 Mass. 456, 464 (1989). However, the evidence of the complainant\u2019s intoxication on which the judge presumably relied in deciding to give the <em>Burke </em>instruction also does not support a finding that she was incapable of consenting. An expert opined that, based on a retrograde analysis of the complainant\u2019s blood alcohol in a sample taken at the hospital approximately one and one-half hours after intercourse, and taking into consideration her body size and her lack of food consumption, her blood alcohol level at the time of the intercourse would have been between 0.176 and 0.240. The expert further opined that such an elevated blood alcohol level was likely to produce disorientation, loss of judgment, impaired perception, lethargy, imbalance, slurred speech, impaired comprehension, and confusion. Admittedly, the evidence shows she was highly intoxicated, but this is not enough. The evidence must show that the complainant\u2019s \u201cstate of insensibility\u201d was such that she \u201chad <em>no power </em>over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>her will\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra </em>at 379. In effect, there must be a showing of total incapacity to consent. Here, the evidence of intoxication does not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that this complainant had \u201cno power\u201d to consent. I would hold that the Commonwealth failed to produce evidence that could support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was totally incapable of consenting, and therefore a <em>Burke </em>instruction should not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\u25a0 2. <em>The instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. </em>Although I believe it was error to give a <em>Burke </em>instruction, a proper <em>Burke </em>instruction would not have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The jury were instructed, conformably with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra, </em>that if the Commonwealth proved the complainant were \u201cwholly insensible as to be incapable of consenting,\u201d then the amount of force required to commit rape was that necessary to accomplish sexual intercourse. I disagree that this instruction is confusing, or, as the defendant contends, that it lowers the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. Because the Commonwealth fell so far short of meeting its burden, the jury probably did not conclude the defendant only used the amount of force needed to accomplish intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The problem comes in a later portion of the instructions, as the court points out, <em>ante </em>at 595-597, part 2 (c), where the judge addressed the separate element of the complainant\u2019s lack of consent. The judge instructed the jury that submission because of fear is not consent, and added, \u201cThe person has to be free to exercise her will without restraint.\u201d She then instructed that, as to the evidence of the complainant\u2019s consumption of drugs and alcohol, \u201cYou may take into consideration any evidence you find credible on the issue of her sobriety in assessing her ability to consent under such circumstances.\u201d This instruction made no reference to the instruction on force, nor did it inform the jury that their consideration of the evidence of the complainant\u2019s sobriety should be focused on the question whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she had been rendered \u201cwholly insensible as to be incapable of consenting\u201d such that the amount of force required was merely that needed to perform intercourse. Instead, the instruction permitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>jury to find that intoxication, like fear, could support a finding of lack of consent if the Commonwealth proved the complainant\u2019s free will was impaired or restrained. I agree with the defendant that this instruction lowered the Commonwealth\u2019s burden by permitting a finding of lack of consent based on intoxication alone. This created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and a new trial is required. Although this is one of the reasons cited by the court for reversing the conviction, I would reverse the conviction for this reason alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The court reverses the conviction in part because the judge instructed the jury, in response to their question, that the words \u201cwholly insensible,\u201d taken together, should be given their common meaning. I believe that instruction was correct. Although it would have been preferable to repeat the entire phrase \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consent\u201d and thereby provide context for the words \u201cwholly insensible,\u201d the judge answered the question asked by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">3. <em>The new standard under </em>Commonwealth v. Burke. Today the court holds that the <em>Burke </em>standard is not limited to cases where a complainant is \u201cunconscious,\u201d or nearly so, but includes cases where \u201cthe complainant\u2019s physical or mental condition was so impaired that she could not consent.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 597. The court also inserts a model instruction, <em>ante </em>at 595 n.19, that reflects the court\u2019s opinion. However, I would insert the word \u201ctotally\u201d before the phrase \u201cincapable of consenting\u201d in the model instruction. The devil lies in the details that render use of the model instruction appropriate. I already have stated my reasons why a <em>Burke </em>instruction was not appropriate in this case, and I will now discuss my reasons for disagreeing with the use of the model instruction in cases where the evidence suggests a condition less than unconsciousness or total incapacity to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">I believe that this case significantly changes the law of rape. Hereafter, a person who has sexual intercourse with one who is highly intoxicated but capable of interacting with others, a common occurrence, does so at great risk that when the effects of the alcohol wear off, the other person will claim that intercourse occurred without consent. Moreover, where the standard had been virtual unconsciousness, a defendant must have known there was no consent. Under the standard announced today, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>defendant could not possibly know the complainant was in an incapacitated state that prevented giving or withholding consent. Indeed, in this case, the Commonwealth relied on scientific analysis of the complainant\u2019s blood alcohol level and expert testimony to show a state of mind that the court holds warranted a <em>Burke </em>instruction. If expert testimony is needed, a defendant could not possibly know, based on his or her untrained observations of the complainant\u2019s sobriety alone, that the complainant was incapable of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The court makes clear that, as provocative as the evidence shows this complainant had been, the evidence also shows that her level of intoxication warrants a <em>Burke </em>instruction. This places a defendant who is as highly intoxicated as the complainant in the anomalous and unfair position of defending against evidence of a complainant\u2019s mental state, admitted in evidence to show the complainant\u2019s incapacity to consent to intercourse, an element of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, but unable to present the same type of evidence on the question of his or her own intent to have intercourse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>405 Mass. 253, 262-263 (1989) (intoxication has no mitigating effect on general intent to have intercourse or other elements of rape charge). Where the defendant\u2019s intent to have intercourse and the complainant\u2019s intent not to have intercourse are both elements of the Commonwealth\u2019s proof, and where the intent to have intercourse either was mutual or it was not, the effects of intoxication should apply equally to the respective intent of each party to the intercourse. This should be so because the question of fact to be determined as to each is qualitatively the same: whether intercourse was intended. After today, however, the concept of diminished capacity and its relative, specific intent, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 592 (1985), will apply to the mental state of a rape complainant, but not to the mental state of a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">When the standard was unconsciousness, it was probably open to both parties to show total incapacity to form the requisite intent. Now, although a defendant may be able to show through evidence of his own unconsciousness a total incapacity to form the requisite general intent to have intercourse, the Commonwealth no longer needs to show unconsciousness on the part of the complainant. Its burden as to the complainant\u2019s capacity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>intend to have intercourse is henceforth reduced. The direction of this imbalance will be determined exclusively by the prosecutor, as can be seen from the following illustrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">If this complainant had had intercourse with a willing and eager child under the age of sixteen years, in all likelihood she would have been charged with statutory rape, and evidence of her sobriety would not have been admitted because it would not have been relevant to her intent to have sexual intercourse. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy, supra. </em>However, if the prosecutor decided to charge the child with rape, the degree of the complainant\u2019s sobriety short of unconsciousness now has significance and hereafter will be admissible on the issue of consent. Turning closer to the facts of this case, if there had been no intercourse here and the complainant had been charged with indecent assault and battery for having grabbed Blache\u2019s crotch, evidence of her sobriety would not have been admissible. It is highly unlikely that the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>105 Mass. 376 (1870), understood that its holding would permit evidence of sobriety short of unconsciousness on the issue of the complainant\u2019s intent to have intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The decision in this case makes the complainant\u2019s capacity to consent a highly disputable issue, something akin to diminished capacity, evidenced by debilitating intoxication, to form a specific intent to have intercourse. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 788-789 (1997). By accepting what was essentially the Commonwealth\u2019s argument in this case, evidence of intoxication now may be offered to show that the complainant (but not the defendant) lacked the capacity to intend intercourse. Essentially, the Commonwealth may now show the complainant lacked specific intent to have intercourse. The defendant\u2019s intent remains tethered to the law concerning general intent, although the focus of the case for the defendant is the mutuality of intent to have intercourse. This case changes the focus from what was once an easily ascertainable objective fact, i.e., unconsciousness, to a fact that, as was seen in this case, requires expert testimony. It also may well expose complainants in some cases to disclosure of medical and mental health records, and even examination by a physician, including, but not limited to, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. This was not necessary under our prior law.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The court suggests that case law after <em>Burke </em>was \u201cless than clear in defining what must be shown in order for a jury to find the complainant was incapable of consenting, particularly in relation to the complainant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and drugs.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 589-590. Curiously, the court relies on such cases for support in its ultimate holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In one such case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, </em>405 Mass. 456 (1989), there was no analysis to suggest that evidence of a mental condition less than \u201cwholly insensible so as to be incapable of consenting\u201d was relevant. In that case the defendant apparently attempted to recast the victim\u2019s clear resistance to his attempts at intercourse and her assertions that she did not want to have intercourse with him as a \u201cseizure\u201d from a \u201ccocaine overdose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464. He claimed that thereafter she consented to intercourse. <em>Id. </em>at 458. The <em>Ascolillo </em>court accepted the defendant\u2019s diagnosis as evidence warranting a <em>Burke </em>instruction, and compared her condition to those of the victims in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 217, 221 (1986) (victim injected with Valium and rendered unconscious), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra </em>(victim in state of \u201cutter stupefaction\u201d caused by drunkenness), and distinguished her condition from that of the complainant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>338 Mass. 377, 383 (1959) (victim drugged by defendant, but was sensible of what he was doing to her). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, supra </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simcock, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 184 (1991), another case that figures prominently in the analysis of today\u2019s opinion, is the first case to hold a <em>Burke </em>instruction may be given where \u201cthe evidence fell short of suggesting the victim was in a state of stupefaction or unconsciousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. That case, however, is based on a faulty reading of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, supra. </em>The <em>Simcock </em>court glaringly failed to mention that the <em>Ascolillo </em>court cited and relied on the evidence that the victim had suffered what was described as a \u201cseizure from cocaine overdose,\u201d which the court determined warranted the giving of a <em>Burke </em>instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The standard of \u201cwholly insensible,\u201d \u201cutter stupefaction,\u201d and \u201cunconsciousness,\u201d by which a complainant has heretofore been deemed to be incapable of consenting to intercourse, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>fair and workable standard from which the court today departs in favor of a standard that needlessly complicates certain rape cases, and has great potential to produce unfair results for defendants and unwanted intrusions into the private affairs of complainants. In the future we can expect the Commonwealth to try rape cases, as here, like drunk driving cases. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
