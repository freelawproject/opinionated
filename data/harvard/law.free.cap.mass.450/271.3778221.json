L. c. 123A, Marcus De\u2019Amicis filed a motion in the Appeals Court to enter his appeal without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>payment of entry fees on the basis of indigency. A single justice of that court denied the motion, apparently concluding that De\u2019Amicis did not meet the more onerous indigency requirement applicable to an \u201cinmate.\u201d G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A, 29.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 832, 834-835 n.6 (2006) (suggesting in dicta that inmate appealing commitment as sexually dangerous person must follow procedure in G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 29, to obtain fee waiver). De\u2019Amicis thereafter filed an appeal from the denial of his motion. We granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On appeal, De\u2019Amicis contends that the provisions of G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 29, do not apply, and were never intended to apply, to individuals who are appealing from their commitments to the treatment center at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Bridgewater (treatment center) as sexually dangerous persons. He also contends that to apply the provisions of \u00a7 29 in these circumstances would be unconstitutional. See <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 124 (1996) (State court costs that prevent indigent mother from appealing from parental termination order violates Federal Constitution because proceeding quasi criminal in nature). We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the requirements of \u00a7 29 do not apply to an inmate appealing from his commitment as a sexually dangerous person. We also conclude that G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, governs the appeal from denied requests for fee waivers and remand the matter to the single justice of the Appeals Court for a determination as to the timeliness of De\u2019Amicis\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>On February 13, 2006, after a jury-waived trial, a judge in the Superior Court found that De\u2019Amicis was a sexually dangerous person and committed him to the treatment center for an indeterminate period under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d). </em>On February 16, 2007, De\u2019Amicis filed a motion to enter his appeal in the Appeals Court without prepayment of fees. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of indigency that stated that he was \u201cpresently in custody at the Massachusetts Treatment Center at Bridgewater\u201d and had been \u201crepresented by the Committee for Public Counsel Services throughout the adjudication of [his] case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Attached to the affidavit was an \u201cinmate transaction report\u201d showing a six-month average balance of $1,708.22 in his account at the treatment center. On February 16, a single justice in the Appeals Court denied the motion, ruling that the \u201cappeal shall be entered upon the payment of the $300.00 filing fee on or before 9 MAR 07.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 6, 2007 (eighteen days after the denial of his motion), De\u2019Amicis filed a notice of appeal. We granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">2. <em>Applicable statutes. </em>General Laws c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, and \u00a7 29, govern requests by indigent individuals for, among other things, the waiver of certain costs and fees incident to civil and criminal litigation, including court filing fees for civil cases and the fees for docketing civil appeals. Section 27A defines the terms applicable to \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, and includes a definition of the term \u201c[ijndigent.\u201d Section 27B provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[u]pan or after commencing or answering to any civil, criminal or juvenile proceeding or appeal in any court. . . any party may file with the clerk an affidavit of indigency and request for waiver, substitution or payment\u201d of the fees. Section 27C sets forth a procedure for processing fee waiver requests. Section 27D governs the appeal process in \u201cany case where the court denies a request for waiver, substitution or payment by the commonwealth of fees and costs, pursuant to [\u00a7 27C] or any other provision of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Sections 27A-27G were originally enacted in 1974, at the same time the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure were promulgated. St. 1974, c. 694, \u00a7 3. In their original form, these provisions appeared to provide for fee waivers, substitutions, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>payments for indigent persons only in the trial courts. In 1978, the Legislature directed the Supreme Judicial Court to file a report on fees and indigency standards to assist the effort of making \u201cuniform standards of indigency to be employed by each court in the commonwealth.\u201d St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 337. Thereafter, in 1980, the Legislature amended the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, by, among other things, broadening the applicability of \u00a7 27B to include \u201cappeal[s] in any court,\u201d thereby enabling indigent persons to obtain waivers of fees and costs for all appeals, civil and criminal. St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, as they appeared before 1999, the term \u201cindigent\u201d was defined broadly. In 1999, through St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 180-182, the Legislature amended this statutory scheme as part of a series of statutes \u201cmodeled after, but . . . more expansive than, the Federal Prisoner Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) ... an act that Congress passed \u2018with the principal purpose of deterring frivolous prisoner litigation by instituting economic costs for prisoners wishing to file civil claims.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, </em>434 Mass. 718, 719 (2001) <em>(Longval), </em>quoting <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Dosal, </em>150 F.3d 814, 816 (8th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1070 (1999). In particular, the Legislature changed the definition of \u201c[ijndigent\u201d in \u00a7 27A by adding a proviso applicable to inmates, and added \u00a7 29, which, like the PLRA, refashioned the procedures prisoners must observe when seeking to proceed without the payment of costs in civil actions. Section 29 makes it more difficult for an inmate bringing such an action to be adjudged indigent, by establishing far more rigorous standards for determining indigency than those generally applicable to indigency determinations and set forth in the definition of \u201c[ijndigent\u201d appearing in \u00a7 27A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Section 29 requires an inmate who commences a civil action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>against a State or county agency, official, or employee and who \u201crequests a waiver of filing fees or court costs due to indigency pursuant to [\u00a7] 27B,\u201d to submit or cause to be submitted certain documentation to the court. Thus, once the inmate makes the waiver request, under \u00a7 29 <em>(a) </em>the court directs a prison official to file a \u201ccopy of a current account statement of the inmate\u2019s account and a copy of the inmate\u2019s activity sheet for the preceding six months.\u201d Section 29 <em>(b) </em>then obligates the inmate to file a signed affidavit reporting assets including, but not limited to, \u201ccash, monies in bank accounts, real property, other investments and all assets of a spouse to which the inmate has legal access; income received in the past six months and income expected to be received in the next six months.\u201d Once all the required information is filed, \u201c[t]he court shall order the inmate to pay, as a partial payment of any filing fees and court costs, 20 per cent of the preceding six months\u2019 average balance in the inmate\u2019s account and, thereafter, monthly payments of 10 per cent of the average monthly balance in the inmate\u2019s account, until all such fees are paid, provided that the payment amount to be drawn from the inmate\u2019s account is equal to or greater than $10.\u201d \u00a7 29 <em>(d) </em>(1). The court must issue this order unless it \u201cfinds that the inmate is incapable of making payments under such a plan or if the court determines, at any time, that such order imposes an undue administrative burden upon the court.\u201d \u00a7 29 <em>(d) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Ordinarily, if the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to the legislative intent. See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986). \u201cHowever, time and again we have stated that we should not accept the literal meaning of the words of a statute without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>regard for that statute\u2019s purpose and history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words . . . considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">a. <em>Section 29. </em>In <em>Longval, supra </em>at 721-723, we followed Federal precedent and, applying the rational basis test, held that \u00a7 29 (as applied in civil actions) did not violate an inmate\u2019s right of access to the courts or to equal protection under either the Massachusetts or Federal Constitution. The question we must answer in this case is a narrower one, whether the indigency determination provisions set out in \u00a7 29 apply to an appeal brought by an inmate from his commitment to the treatment center as a sexually dangerous person.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 29 suggests that its provisions do not apply in the circumstances that De\u2019Amicis presents. While De\u2019Amicis is an \u201c[ijnmate,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 27A, \u00a7 29 applies only to an \u201caction\u201d that an inmate \u201cbrings\u201d against governmental agencies or officials. An \u201caction\u201d is \u201can ordinary proceeding in a court of justice [through] which one party prosecutes another party for the enforcement or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 31 (8th ed. 2004). An \u201cappeal,\u201d in contrast, is \u201cundertaken to have a decision reconsidered\u201d by a higher court. <em>Id. </em>at 105. Applying these common definitions to De\u2019Amicis, it is clear that he is not bringing an \u201caction\u201d but seeks to bring an appeal of an \u201caction\u201d that the Commonwealth brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">To the extent there is ambiguity whether the requirements of \u00a7 29 nonetheless apply to the appeal De\u2019Amicis seeks to bring, that ambiguity is created by the cross-reference to \u00a7 29 in the proviso added in 1999 to the definition of \u201c[i]ndigent\u201d in \u00a7 27A. The definition of that term (which otherwise would appear readily to include De\u2019Amicis, see note 6, <em>supra) </em>concludes with the following language: \u201cbut an inmate shall not be adjudged indigent pursuant to [\u00a7] 27C unless the inmate has complied with the procedures set forth in [\u00a7] 29 and the court finds that the inmate is incapable of making payments under the plan set forth in said [\u00a7] 29.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The Commonwealth would have the court interpret this language to mean that in every case in which an inmate is a party, including cases brought against him related or unrelated to his status as an inmate and including appeals, a special and heightened standard of indigency would be applied in connection with \u00a7 27D\u2019s \u201cwaiver, substitution or payment by the commonwealth of fees and costs.\u201d Such a reading, however, makes it almost impossible to harmonize the language of the proviso with \u00a7 29. It would require that an inmate who is <em>not </em>bringing an action \u201cagainst a state or county agency, official or employee\u201d comply with procedures that by the very terms of the statute in which these procedures appear, see \u00a7 29 (a), apply only when the inmate <em>is </em>bringing such an action. We decline to indorse such a result. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Renderos, </em>440 Mass. 422, 432-433 (2003), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975) (statutes enacted together to be construed together \u201cto constitute a harmonious whole while consistent with the legislative purpose\u201d); <em>New England Div. of the Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y v. Commissioner of Admin., </em>437 Mass. 172, 180 (2002) (same). Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s reading is not consistent with the intent the Legislature \u201cconsidered in connection with the cause\u201d of the 1999 enactment (frivolous inmate lawsuits), the \u201cmischief\u201d to be remedied (virtually free filing of such lawsuits), \u201cand the main object to be accomplished\u201d (discouraging their filing by instituting economic costs for inmates wishing to file them). <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, supra </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In light of its statutory history, a more plausible reading of this statutory cross-reference between \u00a7 27A and \u00a7 29, one that is consistent with legislative intent, is that the special inmate proviso in \u00a7 27A\u2019s definition of \u201c[ijndigent\u201d applies only when the inmate seeks to bring an action covered by \u00a7 29, that is, \u201can action . . . against a state or county agency, official or employee.\u201d Where, as here, the inmate does not bring such an action but seeks to commence an appeal in an action brought against him, his indigency status is governed by the general definition of \u201c[ijndigent\u201d that precedes the inmate proviso.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">b. <em>Section 27D. </em>The Commonwealth contends that the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ments of \u00a7 27D apply to De\u2019Amicis\u2019s appeal, including the requirement that an appeal be filed within seven days of the time the appellant was notified of the denial and of his right to appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 159 (1980) (\u00a7 27D provides exclusive procedure for appealing from denial of request for waiver, substitution, or payment of fees and costs); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 832 (2006) (applying \u00a7 27D in appellate context and deeming appeal from denial of indigency based request for waiver of appellate fees untimely when taken after seven-day period). De\u2019Amicis contends that Mass. R. A. P. 4, as amended, 430 Mass. 1603 (1999), applies. That rule provides for a sixty-day appeal period in civil cases where the Commonwealth is a party. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Rule 4 is a procedural default rule. It governs the time in which appeals must be filed, <em>\u201cunless otherwise provided by </em>statute\u201d (emphasis added). Mass. R. A. P. 4. Section 27D provides, \u201c[i]n any case where the court denies a request for waiver, substitution or payment by the commonwealth of fees and costs, pursuant to [\u00a7 27C] or any other provision of law, the applicant may take an appeal as hereafter provided.\u201d Here, a court denied De\u2019Amicis\u2019s request for the waiver of fees. This circumstance plainly falls within the language of the statute. Cf. <em>Ben </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 808, 811-812 (1999) (explaining that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, provides for appeal from ruling on attorney\u2019s fees and its shorter time period applies to such appeals rather than rule 4 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">De\u2019Amicis argues, however, that \u00a7 27D does not apply to his case, because he did not bring his appeal under that statute, but rather under Mass. R. A. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 859 (1974) (relating to power of single justice to hear and decide motions, and providing that \u201c[t]he action of a single justice may be reviewed by the appellate court\u201d). He further argues that there is no statute that applies to appeals from single justice rulings under rule 15 (c). Therefore, the argument goes, he had sixty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to take his appeal pursuant to rule 4. We disagree. Even viewing his appeal as one brought under rule 15 (c), there is no reason to apply the time period of rule 4 rather than that of \u00a7 27D, which specifically applies to appeals in \u201cany case\u201d from the denial of motions for fee waivers. In <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>427 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1998), a petitioner made a similar argument when he was denied a free copy of his transcript, claiming he was not appealing pursuant to \u00a7 27D. We concluded that, \u201cregardless of how the petitioner characterizes his appeal, he is seeking a free copy of his transcript, and consequently, his request is governed by G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G,\u201d and the timing of his appeal is governed by \u00a7 27D. <em>Id. </em>The same reasoning applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The decision in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>444 Mass. 460 (2005) <em>(Hunt), </em>on which De\u2019Amicis relies, is not to the contrary. In that case, we noted that \u00a7 27D lists a variety of appellate routes,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> depending on the court in which the motion for waiver of fees was denied, but does not explicitly provide a route for the appeal from the denial of appellate fees by a single justice. We held that the appellate routes listed in \u00a7 27D were not exclusive, and that the failure to designate a specific appellate route did not mean that no appeal was available. Specifically, we held that when a single justice of an appellate court acts on a fee waiver request in the first instance, the \u201cprovisions of the statute are to be read in conjunction with the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463. In determining to apply the appellate route suggested by rule 15 (c) of those rules (to the Appeals Court in that case), we considered the statutory scheme on the subject, and concluded that the application of the rules did \u201cno violence to the statutory scheme governing the requests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. Consequently, the rules appropriately could be used to fill the apparent gap in \u00a7 27D.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Here, as in <em>Hunt, </em>a single justice of the Appeals Court declined to waive fees, and an appeal to the Appeals Court was the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>propriate route. There is, however, no gap or silence in the statutory scheme on the matter of the time in which such an appeal, like an appeal from a denial in any other fee waiver denial case, must be filed. Consequently, no reason exists to substitute the conflicting general time limit of rule 4. This is particularly so given the broad language of \u00a7 27D (\u201cIn any case where the court denies a request . . .\u201d) and rule 4\u2019s explicit contemplation that it would only apply in the absence of a more specific statutory provision. Further, unlike in <em>Hunt, supra </em>at 465, the substitution of role 4, being contrary to the explicit language in \u00a7 27D, would do \u201cviolence\u201d to the statutory scheme regulating appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>If De\u2019Amicis did not file his appeal within the seven-day period provided by \u00a7 27D, it must be dismissed. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 665-666 (1993) (dismissing appeal for failure to comply with statutory deadline); <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, supra </em>(Appeals Court correctly dismissed appeal from denial of motion for free transcript for failure to file timely appeal under \u00a7 27D); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, supra </em>(failure to file appeal from denial of fee waiver within \u00a7 27D time period must result in dismissal of appeal). Because the record is devoid of any evidence as to when the defendant received proper notice, the matter is remanded to the single justice of the Appeals Court to determine when De\u2019Amicis was given such notice, and thus whether his appeal was timely under \u00a7 27D.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Only a handwritten note denying the motion is included in the record.
