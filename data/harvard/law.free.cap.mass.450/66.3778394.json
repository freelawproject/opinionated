G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We consider in this case whether, consistent with that statute, a landlord may refuse to rent an apartment to a participant in a subsidy program for temporary housing because the landlord considers the termination provisions of a form lease provided by the subsidizing agency to be economically disadvantageous. Specifically, the plaintiff, Lori DiLiddo, a housing subsidy recipient, appealed from the entry of summary judgment in the Superior Court against her and in favor of the landlord\u2019s agent, Oxford Street Realty, Inc. (Oxford), and its principal, Jeffrey W. Indeck.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We transferred the appeal from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the lease termination provision at issue was a \u201crequirement,\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), of the alternative housing voucher program (AHVP), the program that provided a housing subsidy to DiLiddo. We further conclude that, where the Legislature has exercised its authority to set the balance between the protection of landlords\u2019 interests and the need for affordable housing, the defendants\u2019 refusal to agree to the provision violated the strictures of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10). We reverse the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, vacate the order granting summary judgment to the defendants, and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff as to liability, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We first summarize the provisions of the AHVP, the subsidy program for temporary housing at issue in this case. The program was established following the abolition of rent control in the Commonwealth by popular initiative. See St. 1995, c. 179, \u00a7 16 (\u201cAn Act improving housing opportunities for elders and non-elderly persons with disabilities\u201d). The statute called on the Executive Office of Communities and Development, now the Department of Housing and Community Development (department), to \u201cestablish and administer a <em>transitional </em>rental assistance program\u201d for \u201celigible and qualified handicapped persons of low income,\u201d and to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the program (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>The statute specifies that program participants pay a monthly rent on a rental unit limited to between twenty-five and thirty per cent of their income,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with the department paying the remainder, of the costs of the unit. <em>Id. </em>Consistent with the transitional nature of the subsidy, the statute also provides that \u201call participants in the program shall be <em>required, </em>as a condition of their participation ... to accept suitable permanent affordable housing in accordance with regulations established by [the department] once such housing becomes available\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Pursuant to the enabling statute, the department created the AHVP, see 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 53.00 (1996), limiting eligibility to nonelderly, low income, handicapped persons. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 53.03. Among the requirements of program participation is that, \u201c[w]hen a Participant chooses or is required to move, the Participant shall give a calendar month\u2019s written notice to the [local agency administering the program] and to the Owner or Owner\u2019s Agent.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 53.07. The regulations also impose certain conditions on landlords, including that landlords provide \u201ccertification from the Local Board of Health or other local code enforcement entity that the unit is in compliance with Article II of the State Sanitary Code and (if applicable) a certification from a Certified Lead Inspector that the contract unit is in compliance with applicable lead paint law.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">To administer the program, the department created a standard form lease to be signed by all landlords and tenants participating in the program (AHVP lease). Under the AHVP lease, tenancy is for a term of one year and is automatically extended from year to year unless either the landlord or the tenant gives sixty days\u2019 notice of election not to renew the lease. The AHVP lease does not allow either the landlord or the tenant to terminate the lease early, except for certain enumerated reasons that constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d In those cases, a landlord may terminate the lease on thirty days\u2019 notice, and a tenant on one month\u2019s notice. Among the circumstances that constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d under the AHVP lease are \u201cwhen the Tenant becomes a participant in another housing subsidy program, or when the tenant secures Suitable Permanent Housing, as defined\u201d in 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 53.02.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To further implement the transitional program, the department created an AHVP voucher, which every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>participant in the program must sign. The voucher requires participants to \u201c[a]ttempt to locate other suitable housing for which [the] AHVP subsidy is not necessary.\u201d If a participant succeeds in securing suitable permanent affordable housing, the statute provides that her AHVP subsidy may be made available to the next eligible AHVP applicant. St. 1995, c. 179, \u00a7 16. The voucher and standard form lease each specify that the AHVP participant must give one calendar month\u2019s notice to both the landlord and the housing authority if suitable permanent housing is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The amount of funding made available by the Legislature for the AHVP program has varied from year to year. In 1996, for example, the AHVP program administered as many as 784 vouchers. In 2005, the AHVP served fewer than 236 households.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We turn now to the facts of this case. In the Superior Court, the plaintiffs and the defendants filed cross motions for summary judgment. Summary judgment entered in favor of the defendants from which DiLiddo appealed. Because the standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the respective nonmoving party, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002); <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), we summarize the facts in their light most favorable to DiLiddo. See <em>Yakubowicz </em>v. <em>Paramount Pictures Corp., </em>404 Mass. 624, 626 (1989) (\u201cwe look at the materials available to the judge for summary judgment purposes in the light most favorable to the [nonmoving party] to see whether, as a matter of law, they support a claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">DiLiddo, who was disabled after an automobile accident in 1994, was issued an AHVP voucher by the Cambridge Housing Authority in April, 1998. In late May, 1998, DiLiddo viewed an apartment located at 2 Belvedere Place, in Cambridge. Marie Doubleday, a real estate agent (agent) working for Oxford, showed her the unit. DiLiddo was accompanied by Lisa Hart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>nett, a housing advocate from CASCAP, Inc., a local nonprofit agency that worked to help AHVP voucher holders locate suitable apartments. The owner of the building at 2 Belvedere Place was Lillian Pepi. Oxford was the property manager of the building, responsible for locating, identifying, interviewing, and selecting tenants. After returning to Oxford\u2019s offices with Hart-nett and the agent, DiLiddo expressed interest in renting the unit, and informed the agent that she held an AHVP voucher. The agent informed DiLiddo that she could rent the unit, and Oxford accepted a fee of $750 from DiLiddo for locating the apartment. Subsequently, Oxford mailed DiLiddo a \u201cwelcome to your apartment\u201d letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">At the time that Oxford offered DiLiddo the unit, Indeck testified, he and his company were aware that DiLiddo intended to use her AHVP voucher to pay the rent. Oxford nevertheless required that DiLiddo herself pay the rent for the first month, beginning June 1, because the first AHVP voucher payment was not expected until July 1. DiLiddo agreed to do so, and to be reimbursed by the landlord after the first voucher payment was processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On June 5, 1998, Hartnett sent Indeck a copy of the AHVP lease. Indeck was not familiar with the AHVP form lease, although he was familiar with the form lease required under the so-called \u201cSection 8\u201d Federal housing subsidy program. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (2006). After consulting with two attorneys and with Pepi\u2019s son, Indeck concluded that several of the AHVP form lease provisions were, he testified, \u201cunreasonable and excessive.\u201d Specifically, Indeck objected to the provisions of the AHVP lease that would terminate the lease on one calendar month\u2019s notice \u201cwhen the Tenant becomes a participant in another housing subsidy program, or when the Tenant secures Suitable Permanent Housing, as defined\u201d in 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 53.02. Indeck testified at his deposition that he believed that these provisions placed an \u201cunreasonable\u201d burden on landlords. Indeck also objected to a provision allowing the local housing authority and the department access to the landlord\u2019s premises and records for audit purposes, which he found \u201cinvasive\u201d; to a provision that would vary the tenant\u2019s share of the rent if the tenant\u2019s income changed; and to a provision requesting the owner\u2019s Social Security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Indeck testified that he attempted to persuade CASCAP and the local housing authority to modify the lease provisions to which he objected. Unsuccessful in these negotiations, Indeck informed DiLiddo by telephone that he could not sign the AHVP lease \u201cbecause of provisions in it that were unreasonable,\u201d although he would be \u201chappy to sign a regular lease agreement with her [and] . . . have her as a tenant.\u201d See note 13, <em>infra. </em>Unable to use her AHVP voucher to rent the apartment, DiLiddo once again commenced a search for suitable housing, which she subsequently secured, but only after incurring certain costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In December, 1998, DiLiddo filed a complaint with the human rights commission of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), alleging that Oxford and the landlord had discriminated against her in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (lO).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In October, 2003, MCAD found probable cause against Oxford,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which timely exercised its right under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 5, to have the claims against it resolved in the Superior Court by filing notice with the commission. In November, 2003, the Commonwealth commenced this action against Oxford, also naming Indeck as a defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> DiLiddo exercised her statutory right under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, to intervene as a plaintiff. In July, 2006, following a hearing on all parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment or partial summary judgment, a Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 joint motion for summary judgment and denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 motions. The judge concluded that the provisions of the AHVP lease disputed by Oxford were not \u201crequirements\u201d of the AHVP program. In the alternative, she ruled, if the provisions were \u201crequirements\u201d of that program, the defendants had not violated G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10), because their objections to the \u201crequirements\u201d constituted \u201clegitimate, non-discriminatory reasons\u201d for refusing to rent to DiLiddo, and because they acted on the advice of counsel. DiLiddo appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">2. <em>The \u201crequirement\u201d provision of G.L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10). </em>The defendants make no challenge, constitutional or otherwise, to the validity of the statute prohibiting landlords from discriminating on the basis of \u201cany requirement\u201d of housing subsidy programs, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10). Nor do they challenge the validity of the statute creating the housing subsidy program at issue in this case, St. 1995, c. 179, \u00a7 16. They do not challenge that the AHVP is a valid temporary housing subsidy program created in furtherance of the statute, and they do not challenge the regulations implementing the AHVP, 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 53.00. The question presented therefore is a narrow one of statutory interpretation: Is the one-month termination provision of the AHVP lease a \u201crequirement\u201d of the AHVP, and, if so, is it a requirement that a landlord may reject for purported financial reasons without running afoul of the housing antidiscrimination law?<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We begin with basic principles of statutory interpretation. We interpret a statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature, as evidenced by the language used, and considering the purposes and remedies intended to be advanced.\u201d <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 574, 577 (1984). \u201cThe statutory language, when clear and unambiguous, must be given its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). The relevant section of G. L. c. 151B makes it unlawful for a landlord to discriminate against recipients of rental assistance or housing subsidies \u201cbecause of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>requirement\u201d of the \u201chousing subsidy program.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10). The language is unambiguous. By its plain terms, a \u201crequirement\u201d is \u201c[something that is required; a necessity.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1533 (3d ed. 1992). The defendants do not contest that the department developed the standard form lease in order to implement the AHVP, nor do they claim that the department\u2019s decision to require landlords and tenants to sign the AHVP lease was \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>439 Mass. 1, 5 (2003), quoting <em>Tarin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 743, 750 (1997) (judicial review of administrative action \u201climited to a determination whether the State action is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law\u201d). Rather, the defendants suggest that the department lacked the authority to require that a landlord use the AHVP lease because neither the statute nor the regulations mandate any particular form of lease. General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), does not limit the scope of the term \u201crequirement\u201d to a statutory provision or regulation, and their argument misconstrues the legitimate reach of the department\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">The Legislature granted the department broad authority to \u201cestablish and administer\u201d a transitional housing subsidy program. St. 1995, c. 179, \u00a7 16. The development of a standard form AHVP lease containing clauses designed to implement the program\u2019s transitional character is well within the bounds of the department\u2019s mandate from the Legislature. Cf. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 765, 771 (1985) (upholding agency\u2019s authority to require standard coverage terms and standard form in automobile insurance context). We find no support for, and accordingly reject, the view of the defendants and of the judge that the \u201crequirements\u201d provision of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), pertains exclusively to an obligation to provide \u201cdecent\u201d housing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statute, fairly read, will not admit such an interpretation, as evidenced compellingly by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>statutory history of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10), as we now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The General Court added \u00a7 4 (10) to G. L. c. 151B in 1971. St. 1971, c. 726. As originally enacted, the provision prohibited landlords from discriminating against any recipient of public assistance or housing subsidies, such as rental assistance or rental supplements, \u201csolely because the individual is such a recipient.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>400 Mass. 826 (1987) <em>(Brown), </em>this court considered whether a landlord had violated G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10), when he refused to rent to tenants holding Section 8 housing subsidy vouchers on the ground that he objected to certain terms in the standard form lease used by the department for all tenancies subsidized by the Section 8 program. In particular, the landlord, whose own form lease required tenants to pay their last month\u2019s rent, and in some cases an additional month\u2019s rent as a security deposit, in advance of occupancy, objected to the Section 8 form lease that contained no such provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 832-833. This court concluded that, although the landlord\u2019s reasons for refusing to accept Section 8 voucher participants as tenants were \u201crelated to the requirements of the Section 8 program,\u201d the evidence did not establish that the landlord discriminated \u201csolely\u201d on the basis of an individual\u2019s status as a Section 8 voucher recipient. <em>Id. </em>at 834. Thus, the <em>Brown </em>court distinguished between housing discrimination \u201csolely\u201d because a prospective tenant holds a housing subsidy voucher, and discrimination that occurs because a landlord refuses \u2014 in that case for economic reasons \u2014 to be subject to the \u201crequirements\u201d of the housing subsidy program. The 1971 statutory language, this court concluded, prohibited only the former. <em>Id. </em>at 834. See St. 1971, c. 726 (making it unlawful to discriminate \u201csolely\u201d because the individual is subsidy recipient). See note 15, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Two years after the <em>Brown </em>decision, the General Court sought to amend G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, to make more housing available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>to persons with disabilities and to strengthen certain provisions of c. 151B. See St. 1989, c. 722. The original legislation imposed certain new burdens on landlords,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but did not seek to amend G.L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10). See, e.g., 1989 Senate Doc. No. 1735; 1989 House Doc. No. 5534. An amendment was subsequently introduced adding to the bill a provision to amend G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10). See 1989 House J. 1669-1670. This amendment, passed by the House on December 28,1989, removed the word \u201csolely\u201d from G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), and added new language making it unlawful for a landlord to discriminate against a housing subsidy recipient <em>either </em>\u201cbecause the individual is such a recipient,\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cbecause of any requirement of such public assistance, rental assistance, or housing subsidy program.\u201d St. 1989, c. 722, \u00a7 19A. See 1989 House J. 1822. The amended bill was enacted by both chambers on January 2, 1990, and signed into law by the Governor on January 13, 1990. 1989 House J. 2250. The 1990 amendment to G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10), thus clarified that both kinds of housing discrimination that this court had parsed so carefully in <em>Brown </em>were now unlawful under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10). Indeed, the language of the 1990 amendment (\u201cbecause of any requirement of . . . [the] housing subsidy program\u201d) mirrors the language used in <em>Brown, supra </em>at 834 (\u201crelated to the requirements of the Section 8 program\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The facts of this case parallel the facts in the <em>Brown </em>case, but the General Court\u2019s amendment to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), compels a different result. As in <em>Brown, </em>the administrative agency charged with implementing the relevant housing subsidy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>program requires a standard form lease from all participants in the AHVP program. As in <em>Brown, </em>a landlord has objected to certain provisions of the form lease that she deems economically disadvantageous, has refused to sign the lease, and has refused to accept the tenant for that reason. Where the statutory language in effect when this court decided the <em>Brown </em>case permitted the landlord to defend against a claim of discrimination on that basis, <em>id. </em>at 835, Oxford\u2019s similar repudiation of the requirements contained in the AHVP lease falls squarely within the ambit of the prohibition of the statute as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"AkH\">The defendants argue that, even if the termination provisions of the AHVP lease are \u201crequirements\u201d of the AHVP for purposes of our antidiscrimination law, they may refuse to accept those requirements so long as they had a \u201clegitimate, non-discriminatory reason\u201d for doing do. Put another way, they contend that, because they rejected the AHVP based on a good faith attempt to serve the landlord\u2019s economic interests and not from any discriminatory \u201canimus,\u201d they may not be held hable for housing discriminatian under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10). But it is G. L. c. 151B, itself, not the defendants\u2019 conception of what should or should not constitute discrimination, that delineates what is \u201clegitimate\u201d and \u201cnondiscriminatory\u201d under the statute. The statute contains no language requiring a showing of \u201canimus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">The defendants urge that we read into the statute an exceptian that would allow landlords to reject a participant in any housing subsidy program whose requirements could cause the landlord \u201csubstantial economic harm.\u201d We may not rewrite the statute\u2019s clear terms.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>391 Mass. 92, 94 (1984) (\u201cwe need not look beyond the words of the statute where the language is plain and unambiguous\u201d). The General Court was aware that St. 1989, c. 722, imposed financial burdens on landlords, and it made various policy judgments striking the balance between those burdens and the public interest in making housing accessible and affordable for disabled persons. For example, the statute requires that the owner of a rental housing property containing ten or more units, rather than a tenant, bear the cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of modifying an existing unit to accommodate a tenant with disabilities, but provides an exception to that requirement \u201cif it would impose undue hardship\u201d on the landlord. St. 1989, c. 722, \u00a7 18. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (7A). The statute then enumerates a series of factors to be considered in resolving that issue. <em>Id. </em>No such exception is applicable to the provision at issue here. See St. 1989, c. 722, \u00a7 19A; G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10). Absent a challenge to the reach of the statute itself, or a challenge to the scope of the implementing regulations, we may not strike a different balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The defendants also contend that they should not be held liable for violating G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), because they acted as mere agents, following the instructions of the building\u2019s owner, Pepi. Specifically, Indeck and Oxford argue that they had \u201cno choice\u201d in the decision, merely acting as a \u201cmessenger.\u201d We need not decide whether a broker or agent who in fact acts solely as a \u201cmessenger\u201d for the decisions of a landlord, exercising no independent judgment, can be held liable under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), because here the judge found, and the record amply supports, that Oxford and Indeck were responsible for \u201clocating, interviewing and choosing\u201d tenants for Pepi. While Indeck testified at his deposition that \u201cI am not the one that makes the final decision,\u201d the defendants do not dispute that they play a role in the process of locating, interviewing, and choosing tenants. General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), applies to \u201cany person furnishing credit, services or rental accommodations.\u201d In addition, G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (5), provides that it is unlawful \u201c[f]or any person, whether an employer or an employee or not, to aid, [or] abet... the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this chapter or to attempt to do so.\u201d Thus, the test is whether Oxford and Indeck, at a minimum, \u201caid[ed]\u201d or \u201cabet[ted]\u201d a violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10). Oxford and Indeck\u2019s attempt to distance themselves from Pepi\u2019s decision is ill placed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The defendants argue that they had a fiduciary duty to Pepi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to follow her instructions to find a tenant willing to agree to a one-year lease, and that it would have been a breach of duty to sign the AHVP lease.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But both Oxford and Pepi were legally obligated not to discriminate on the basis of a \u201crequirement\u201d of a housing subsidy. The fiduciary duty Oxford owed to Pepi surely required Oxford to comply with the law; by refusing to sign the AHVP lease, Oxford exposed both itself and Pepi to potential liability. See <em>Ruffino </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>908 F. Supp. 1019, 1048 (D. Mass. 1995) (noting that \u201cany person\u201d language of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, unambiguously exposes both agents and principals to liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The AHVP housing subsidy program affects relatively few individuals. But if landlords or their agents are permitted to reject for their own reasons the \u201crequirements\u201d of the AHVP program, that could have, as the Commonwealth argues, \u201ca potentially widespread and profound impact on the ability of residents in the Commonwealth to utilize any rental assistance voucher to locate and then actually obtain affordable housing.\u201d The General Court has spoken unambiguously. See G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (10). The defendants have proffered no basis for us to ignore its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">3. <em>Advice of counsel. </em>The defendants argue, and the judge concluded, that the defendants should be absolved of all liability because they acted on the advice of counsel. The defense of reliance on advice of counsel is available, but only in limited contexts. For example, it is established as a defense to the charge of malicious prosecution. See, e.g., <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>316 Mass. 700, 713 (1944). The defense may serve to rebut the sci-enter element of a crime or civil charge requiring a wilful or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>intentional violation of the law. See, e.g., <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 269 (1991) (considering advice of counsel defense against charge of intentional interference with contractual relations); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>513 F.2d 1249, 1251 (8th Cir. 1975) (jury instruction on advice of counsel \u201cwarranted only where the crime charged involves willful and unlawful intent\u201d). General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), in contrast, does not require that a landlord wilfully or intentionally violate the law. Advice of counsel is not a defense to a claim under that statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, vacate the order granting summary judgment to the defendants, and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff as to liability, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (10), provides: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice . . .

If a tenant becomes a participant in a housing subsidy program other than the alternative housing voucher program (AHVP), such as the so-called \u201cSection 8\u201d Federal housing subsidy program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (2006), and if the housing subsidy from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the second program can be applied to the same unit in which the tenant is living under the AHVP program, nothing in the lease or regulations prohibits the tenant from remaining in the unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Pepi, whom Indeck testified was seventy-eight years old, was sufficiently distant from the day-to-day management of the building, which she had delegated to Oxford, that she had no knowledge of either DiLiddo or any of the events at issue in this case until she received the complaint filed by DiLiddo with the human rights commission of Cambridge in December, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">DiLiddo also alleged a violation of G.

The judge in the Superior Court implied that this was his <em>only </em>objection to the lease. The record reveals a longer series of objections, mentioned above. At his deposition, Indeck suggests that, if the termination provision of the AHVP lease had been compromised, he would have signed the lease, but his testimony is ambiguous on that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b94-25\">No reference to \u201cdecent\u201d housing is found in the statute, or the regulatians governing the AHVP. That term is used in Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Federal statute creating the so-called \u201cSection 8\u201d housing voucher program. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (a) (2006). That program is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Before it was amended in 1990, as described below, G.

For larger buildings, the owner rather than the tenant would be required to bear all of the costs of modification or alteration of the building. As finally enacted, the bill provided for an exemption for landlords in the case of \u201cundue hardship.\u201d 1989 Senate Doc. No. 1735, \u00a7 17.

See note 9, <em>supra. </em>Indeck testified that he consulted with Pepi\u2019s son about the lease provisions at issue in this case. But nothing in the record suggests that Pepi\u2019s son had the authority to require Indeck to refuse to sign the AHVP lease. Nor does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the record show that Pepi\u2019s son was authorized to act on Pepi\u2019s behalf. Indeck did testify that Pepi\u2019s \u201cson was acting on her behalf,\u201d noting that the son \u201cwas the executor of her estate.\u201d This is insufficient to establish legal authority to act on behalf of Pepi while she is alive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Oxford and Indeck argue that \u201cDiLiddo refused to sign a year-long lease,\u201d contending that the AHVP lease is \u201cmonth-to-month.\u201d This is incorrect. By its terms, the AHVP form lease requires a term of one year; an AHVP housing subsidy voucher cannot be used to secure a month-to-month tenancy. The defendants refer to \u201cDiLiddo\u2019s desire for flexibility so as to be able to leave one apartment for another,\u201d but the AHVP form lease does not permit tenants to end their tenancy at will. The termination provision allows voucher holders to terminate a year-long lease only when they are required to do so by statute.
