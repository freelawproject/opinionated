Ingersoll, and others, surviving trustees of the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Rail-road Company against Ardemus Stewart, Sheriff of Montgomery county, and Michael Wilt. Wilt, in 1840, obtained a judgment against the company, on which a <em>fieri facias </em>issued in the same year, and Stewart levied on and sold a locomotive engine and car as the property of the company. The plaintiffs gave notice to the defendants before the sheriff\u2019s sale that they claimed the property. The plaintiffs claimed title under an indenture of mortgage, dated 18 th of May 1833, and a conveyance dated 22d of March 1839, of the property sold, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">\u201c This Indenture, made the 18th day of May, in the year 1833, between the Philadelphia, Germantown, and Norristown Rail-road Company of the one part, and Jacob Ridgway, Edward Coleman, Joseph R.

The legislature, to enable them to perfect this valuable improvement, passed a supplement, enabling the company to increase their capital stock, not to exceed 16,000 shares of $50 each, and the proviso to the second section of the Act declares, \u2018 that the said company shall have the power to borrow money on loan, to enable them to finish their works, and to give mortgages, certificates or other evidences and securities for the payment thereof. The same to be convertible or not convertible into stock, as shall be agreed on between said company and the lender or lenders.\u2019 It would seem from the evidence, that in the spring of 1833, and prior, the company were without funds to complete the road. Under the second section of the Act to which the court have referred, passed the 30th March 1833, proposals were issued for a loan of $250,000, with the privilege of increasing it to $300,000. The interest on this loan was to commence from the day of payment. It was to be six per cent., and the interest was payable semi-annually on the 1st of May and November, in each year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">It is evident that James R. Wilson and others subscribed largely to this loan, and Jacob Ridgway and others agreed to become trustees, and accepted a mortgage on the 18th of May 1833, on the road of the corporation in trust for the subscribers of this loan. The mortgage recites that upwards of $250,000 of the loan was subscribed, and that the company had a right to increase it to $300,000. To secure the repayment of this loan and the interest semi-annually, the company gave a mortgage on \u2018 all and singular the lands, buildings, works, tenements and hereditaments, goods and chattels, and estate, real, personal and mixed, whatsoever and wheresoever of the said Philadelphia, Germantown and Norris-town Rail-road Company, and all the tolls, issues, income and profits of the said company, from and after the 1st of May 1835, reserving to the company a sum sufficient to defray the expenses of the administration of the affairs of the company, and to pay for the necessary repairs of the road,\u2019 &amp;c. A sufficient sum was subscribed to complete the road so far as to open it for transportation. The road was in operation and open for transportation for some years prior to the spring of 1839; the precise length of time does not appear. After deducting expenses, the tolls did not raise a sufficient sum to meet the interest on the loan of 1833; and on the 22d of March 1839, the company executed a deed under their seal, to the trustees in the mortgage. This conveyance recites the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>mortgage. You will observe that by .this deed the company granted, bargained, sold and assigned, \u2018 all the engines, cars, horses, carriages, tenders, iron, wood, machinery and machines for transportation, furniture, stock on the road, and in the dep\u00f3ts, and elsewhere, and all personal and moveable property of every kind and description whatsoever, belonging to the said Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Rail-road Company, and by them acquired since the 18th of May 1833,\u2019 with a schedule annexed; \u2018 to hold in trust for the uses, interests, and purposes expressed and contained in the indenture of mortgage before recited.\u2019 The schedule includes the property sold by Sheriff Stewart on the execution of Michael Wilt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">The defendant\u2019s third point; * The deed of transfer of 22d of March 1839, with the inventory, if under any circumstances it would be operative as a conveyance of the personal property of the company, is null and void against creditors, because it was not recorded within thirty days, and no right of property passes to the plaintiff under it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">Upon a careful examination of the Acts of 1818 and 1836, and of the cases of <em>Englebert </em>v. <em>Blanjot, </em>(2 <em>Whart. </em>240), and <em>Flanagin </em>v. <em>Wetherill, </em>(5 <em>Whart. </em>280), we are unable to come to any other conclusion than that this deed of the 22d of March 1839, comes within the statutory enactments, and within those decisions. The ingenious argument of the plaintiffs has not been able to satisfy us that this deed is valid against creditors, without being recorded. The Chief Justice says that the Act of 1818 is\u2018not only remedial but beneficial, and consequently to be liberally construed in suppression of the mischief. In the late case, Judge Sergeant says, it is sufficient that it is for creditors to bring it within the reasons for the passage of the Act of the 24th of March 1818. Was not this an assignment for the benefit of creditors? Most assuredly it was, and was so intended. It is said it did not vest the right absolutely in the personal estate of the company. This is true, but in our judgment, it increased the necessity of having the deed placed on record. We see no reason, nor any use in the Act, if this deed is not within it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">The result is, that the Act of 1818, not being regarded by the trustees, the assignment did not vest the property so as to bar the right of the plaintiffs to take it in execution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">The plaintiffs excepted to the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATp\">Error assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-11\">The court erred in charging the jury that the conveyance of 22d of March 1839 did not vest the property in the plaintiffs, so as to bar the right of a judgment creditor to take it in execution, the conveyance not having been recorded within thirty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-12\">This case was argued at December term 1841, by the same counsel who now re-argued it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Miles, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfH\">The paper of the 22d of March 1839, is not an assignment within the Act of 24th of March <em>1818, </em>sec. 5 <em>(Sm.

The Act contemplates an absolute conveyance without any reservation of right or interest in the grantor, and not a deed of mortgage or pledge merely.

L. </em>287,) instructed the jury that it was void as against the defendants, because it was not recorded in the office for recording of deeds in the county where the party making the deed resided, within thirty days after its execution. The section of the Act here referred to, declares \u201c that all <em>assignments </em>so as aforesaid to be made and executed, which shall not be recorded in the office for recording of deeds in the county in which such assignor resides within thirty days after the execution thereof shall be considered null and void as against any of the creditors of the said assignor.\u201d The assignments here designated by the words \u201c so as aforesaid to be made and executed, which shall not be recorded,\u201d &amp;c., are thus described in the first section of the Act, \u201c any <em>voluntary assignment </em>of his (the debtor\u2019s) estate, real, personal or mixed, or any part thereof to any person or persons <em>in trust for the use of his creditors, </em>or <em>in trust for the use of such person or persons to whom such assignment may be so made, and other creditors of the said assignor, </em>it shall and may be lawful for the Court of Common Pleas of the \u25a0 proper county, and they are hereby authorized and required, on the application of any of the creditors of such assignor, at any time <em>after two years from the time such assignment shall have been made, </em>to issue a citation to such assignee, &amp;c., commanding him, &amp;c., to appear at a time to be appointed by the court and settle his account,\u201d &amp;c. It is perfectly plain from the language just incited, that the assignments required by the 5th section of the Act to be recorded within the thirty days, are those absolute transfers made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>by debtors, in embarrassed or insolvent circumstances, of their estates to trustees for the benefit of their creditors, that is, for the purpose of being turned into money and applied by the trustees to the payment of the debts owing by the assignors.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">But the deed of the 22d of March 1839, under w\u2019hich the plaintiffs claim, is an entirely different instrument. It is a <em>mortgage </em>of the goods described in it, and not an <em>assignment </em>or <em>absolute </em>transfer or conveyance thereof, but <em>conditional </em>merely. In other words, a pledge of the things therein mentioned as a security for the payment of the money therein specified, according to the stipulation therein contained. The two instruments are very different from each other in their nature; the one is <em>an absolute, </em>and <em>indefeasible </em>conveyance of the subject matter thereof, whereas the other is only <em>conditional </em>and <em>defeasible. </em>Consequently the authority and right derived from the two instruments to the grantee, are very different. Indeed it would be difficult, if not wholly impracticable, to apply to mortgages of either goods or lands, all the various provisions made by the Act of the 24th of March 1818, in regard to the assignments therein mentioned. For instance, the Court of Common Pleas of the proper county is authorized and required, upon the application of any of the creditors, after two years (which is reduced to one year by the Act of the 14th of April 1828, on the same subject,) from the execution of the assignment, to cite the assignees to appear and settle their account of the execution of the trust; and that an assignment made since the 14th of April 1828, allowing more than a year for executing the trust, was void, was declared by this Court, because contrary to the spirit and meaning of those Acts. <em>Sheerer\u2019s Assignees </em>v. <em>Lautzerheiser, </em>(6 <em>Watts </em>543). Now it seems impossible to apply this principle of these Acts to mortgages, without making every debt, to secure the payment of which a mortgage is given, payable within a year after its execution. But this would be an utter surprise upon everybody; for it has never before, I think, entered into the mind of any one, notwithstanding the passage of these Acts of Assembly, to conceive, that as long time could not be given for the payment of a debt secured by mortgage as the parties should choose to agree on. If such a principle be applicable to mortgages on goods given to secure the payment of debts, it must be equally so to mortgages on lands or real estates for a like purpose, because the Acts of Assembly do not extend to or embrace the one more than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">It is perfectly manifest, therefore, that if the same principle be applied to mortgages that has been, under these Acts, to assignments made for the benefit of creditors, the whole law, as it has ever been understood, in relation to mortgages, will be entirely changed, and every one will be completely amazed to learn that it is so, without any previous intimation of it from the legislature. For, I think, it may be said with great truth, as well as propriety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that there is nothing either in the language of the Acts of Assembly on this subject, or in the provisions contained therein, which tends in the slightest degree to show that the legislature intended to embrace mortgages given for any purpose whatever. And one of the first rules which we have for the interpretation of the Acts of the legislature is well adapted to advise the community of every change that is intended to be made in the law of the State, so as to prevent any individual from being deluded or taken by surprise in respect to what the law is at any particular period. The rule I allude to is this, that the words of the Act are generally to be understood in their usual and most known signification; not so much regarding the propriety of grammar as their general and popular sense. 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>59. Regarding, then, the words of the Act of Assembly, on this point, in their usual and most known signification, or in their general and popular sense, or even in their grammatical and legal sense, there does not appear to be any good ground for holding that mortgages given, upon either real or personal estate, to secure the payment of moneys or debts, were intended by the legislature to be embraced within the 5th section of the Act of the 24th of March 1818. The court below, therefore, erred in charging the jury that the deed of the 22d of March 1839 was void, because not recorded as deeds of assignment are required by the terms of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
