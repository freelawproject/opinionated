The notice is insufficient, it not giving the name of the examining magistrate, nor stating that the deposition would be taken before competent authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-11\">2. The certificate of the justice before whom the deposition purports to have been taken, does not set forth that the same was taken at the place mentioned in the notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-12\">The court overruled the objections, admitted the deposition, and at request of defendant sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-13\"><em>Stewart </em>and <em>Pearson, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al4\">cited 8 <em>Watts 409; </em>6 <em>Watts </em>456; <em>7 Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>172; 14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>373.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-14\"><em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Sullivan, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APD\">argued that it was a reasonable inference from the certificate of the justice that the deposition was taken \u201c agreeable to the rule,\u201d that it was taken at the place mentioned in the notice, which was attached to the rule, and both were attached to the deposition. There would have been reason in the objection if it had been made to appear that the defendant attended at the place mentioned in the notice, and that no deposition was taken there.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-15\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ANa\">\u2014 The certificate of the justice sets forth affirmatively an execution of the rule in accordance with the notice, in regard to all things but the house appointed for the appearance' of the parties; but according to <em>Selin </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>(7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>172), and <em>Vickroy </em>v. <em>Skelley, </em>(14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>372), the want of that is fatal. It sufficiently appears the deposition was taken at the place; but where that is a town, and a particular house in it is specified, it should appear to have been taken at the very spot. The evidence ought to have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
