Plead. </em>311, 314 <em>(Edit. </em>1828.) Now the instrument in this case recognizes that a loan of #1700 had been made by the plaintiff to the defendants; and no time of payment being stated, it was payable immediately. To loan means to hand to another for a temporary purpose, to be returned in kind; and that was the obligation of the defendants. 1 <em>Baldw. </em>493. Did the voluntary recognition of the loan by the defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>under seal, after it was made, and their saying that they would apply the proceeds of certain real estate \u2014 a particular fund \u2014 of which they, the debtors, retained the ownership and management exclusively, alter their responsibility, or take away the lender\u2019s remedy upon the acknowledgment under seal? If so, any individual who writes a letter, and says he owes a precedent debt, and that out of the proceeds of some property, which he means to sell, he will pay it, gets rid of his personal liability, and transfers the claim of the creditor to the fund so to be raised. Any giving further security for a debt, after it is contracted, by a pledge, would have the same effect. Even where the creditor has the power to make sale of or to dispose of the pledged property, this is not the doctrine \u2014 he may sue the obligation, or raise the fund from the pledge. 3 <em>Leon. </em>223 ; 4 <em>Leon. </em>208 ; 15 <em>Wend. </em>218.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-4\">But, putting the first count out of the question, there was nothing to prevent the plaintiff from recovering on the second. The right to receive the payment stated in the instrument was clearly a mere collateral security. It did not disturb the relation of debtor and creditor. It was not payment, and it is nowhere said in the instrument that it is satisfaction of the debt. It gives the plaintiff no interest in the pews, nor any fight to dispose of them, or to control or receive the sales. To allow the power claimed for it by the defendants, would suspend the plaintiff\u2019s right to his money at the pleasure of the debtors, who do not even undertake to sell the pews, or to pay over the money. Suppose the pews were all to be sold for less than the debt, would the debt be paid ? The authorities are express that it would not. 4 <em>Watts </em>128 <em>; </em>4 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep. </em>308 ; 1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle 296; </em>5 <em>Rawle 166; 4 Watts </em>378. If this, therefore, be collateral security, there is no variance between either count of this declaration and the instrument produced. The declaration states the legal obligation, and does not describe the consideration; and it is well settled, that the consideration and discharge of an obligation do not in any way qualify it; it is complete without them. 1 <em>Howard\u2019s Miss. Rep. </em>195, 220.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-5\"><em>Kirliham </em>and <em>T. I. Wharton, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae-\">It may be true that a naked acknowledgment of indebtedness will give a right of action, but that is only when no other specific remedy is given; when that is the case, the specific remedy must be pursued. Now here the instrument gives a right to payment out of a specific fund, and containing no express covenant for the payment of the money set forth in it, the remedy of the plaintiff is confined to that fund, and he cannot support debt against the defendants. 10 <em>Johns. </em>57; <em>Cro. Jac. </em>282. At least he cannot do so until a sale of the pews has shown a deficit, or the defendants refuse, upon request, to sell them, all of which must be shown by proper averments in the narr. 11 <em>Wend. </em>106.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b545-6\">Rogers, J;</author>\n<p id=\"A0e\">\u2014 Several special causes of error have been assigned, but they resolve themselves into one question, viz: whether the instrument declared on is an absolute or conditional contract. If it be the latter, an averment is essential that the pews, or some of them, were sold, or that there was a refusal to sell on request made by the plaintiff. If the loan of the money and the execution of the instrument declared on were cotemporaneous acts, and this the first count assumes them to be, we are inclined to believe it must be taken as a conditional, and not an absolute engagement. The instrument must be construed according to the intention of the parties, and it is difficult to believe that it was intended that Montgomery should have the right to sue the church the day after the contract was sealed, the inevitable effect of the construction put upon it by the plaintiff. But, on the supposition that the money was loaned on the day of the date of the instrument, it would rather strike us to have been a concerted movement among certain members of the corporation to effect a loan, and to look exclusively for reimbursement to the funds of the church, derived from the sales of certain pews particularly enumerated; the proceeds of which, when received, to be divided <em>pro rata </em>among them. This, we think, is the true reading of the contract, on the supposition as above stated; and from this it will follow that to sustain the suit until default be made, would be an injury to the contributors as well as the defendant; as <em>non constat, </em>that the money would have been borrowed on any other terms, or that the other contributors would have advanced the money on any other conditions. <em>Gore and Wingfield\u2019s Case, </em>(3 <em>Leon. </em>223, and 4 <em>Leon. </em>208), has been cited as an authority on this point. But there the obligee had a double remedy; to bring his action on the instrument, or to levy his money according to the clause in the obligation. There was nothing in the bond which would warrant the idea that the money due was to be paid in a particular manner, or out of a specified fund. The plaintiff was at liberty, therefore, as was ruled, to bring his suit on the obligation, or to levy his money according to the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The words, however, of this obligation are peculiar: \u201c Be it remembered, that Austin Montgomery having loaned to the Rector, Churchwardens and Vestry of St. Stephen\u2019s Church the sum of $1700, is entitled to receive payment of the same, without interest, from the sales of the following pews, viz: Nos. 8, 14, &amp;c., all down stairs, and the whole of the gallery pews, excepting Nos. 4, 11, \u00e1se., payment <em>pro rata </em>to be made when any sale is effected, and the purchase money received.\u201d An inspection of the instrument leads to the conclusion that it is the acknowledgment of a debt previously contracted, and the pledge of a fund for its gradual liquidation, by sales of certain pews afterwards to be made. In this view the evidence ought to be submitted to the jury; for then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the agreement would be nothing more than a collateral security or pledge for the debt. The case of <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>(1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>296), is an authority in point, that an agreement, although under seal, accepted as a collateral security, is not a merger of a simple contract debt, and may be read in evidence to show the amount originally due. <em>Kemmill </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>(4 <em>Wash. C. </em>C. <em>R. </em>308); <em>Perit </em>v. <em>Pittfield, </em>(5 <em>Rawle </em>166).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the court was right in giving judgment for the defendant on the demurrer, but that there was error in overruling the evidence offered on the second count for money lent.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
