The defendant claimed them under his mother, Susannah Brouse, late Susannah Shoemaker, and took possession of them after her death. It appeared in evidence that the articles were all the property of Susannah Brouse whilst she was a widow. She was afterwards married to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who died the day after her. There was no issue of this second marriage. The defendant alleged a parol agreement between them that the wife\u2019s personal estate should remain hers; and proved by several witnesses declarations made by George Shoemaker shortly before and after the marriage that he would have nothing to do with her property; he did not want any part of it, but only her; he had enough of his own for them both. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>declared she would give her things to her boys by her will, he saying he would not have any part of it. One witness, (a brother of the defendant), stated that Shoemaker said that witness\u2019s grandmother had written a letter to his wife, saying that she would marry away her property from her children; and that he had written back, that he would not have anything that belonged to her. This was said after marriage, but the letter must have been written before. He declared before marriage, in speaking of a clock and apples of his wife\u2019s, that they were not his. Another witness told him while his wife was ill, that he would have a good <em>erbschaft. </em>He said \u201c no, we have it so far, that I will not nave anything of hers, nor she of mine.\u201d It appeared that though he moved to his wife\u2019s residence after marriage, he never intermeddled with her property. After the marriage, he and his wife conveyed real estate to the defendant, situate in Lehigh county, subject to the wife\u2019s possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">A bill of exceptions was taken, on the ground of its being out of order, to the defendant\u2019s cross-examining the plaintiff\u2019s first witness as to the deed above-mentioned, and another to a witness\u2019s mentioning what Shoemaker said about the letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">The court below, (Banks, President), charged in favour of the defendant, and errors were now assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-8\"><em>Davis, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmA\">referred to 1 <em>Baldw. </em>486; 3 <em>Whart. </em>50, 63; 7 <em>Watts </em>50.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-9\"><em>Gibons </em>and <em>King, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8RO\">cited 6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>467; 2 <em>Dall. </em>199; <em>Amb. </em>565; 3 <em>Penn.

No statute requires it to be in writing where the subject of the contract is the wife\u2019s chattels; and here it covers the whole case; for it precludes not only the husband\u2019s ownership during the coverture, but his right of survivorship at the dissolution of it. The provision of the intestate law was not designed for a case where the course of the property at the wife\u2019s death was marked out by a settlement. The existence of the contract was properly left to the jury as a fact of which there was evidence. There was no room for objection for want of mutuality, for the wife would be bound by the contract if she were a party to it; and there could be no such thing without her. The exceptions to evidence are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
