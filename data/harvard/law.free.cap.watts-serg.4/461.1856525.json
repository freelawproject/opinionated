The cause was arbitrated, and an award was rendered in favour of the plaintiff, from which the defendants appealed without giving bail.

Indeed the 5th section seems to imply that all suits in which corporations are parties are on the same footing, whether before a magistrate or in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">We see no ground for holding that this provision of the Act of 22d of March 1817, is repealed by the new arbitration Act, passed the 16th of June 1836. There is no repealing clause in the latter Act, nor can it be construed a constructive repeal, since there is no provision in it on the subject of appeals by corporations, and therefore there is no enactment contrary to the prior law, but both may well subsist together.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">Rule absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
