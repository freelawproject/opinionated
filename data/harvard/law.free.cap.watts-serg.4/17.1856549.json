But I perceive no ground on which it can be considered an executory agreement. It is a direct conveyance of one-sixth of the tract, or so much thereof as may be recovered, without anything farther to be done to vest the legal title. It embraces all the substantial parts of a deed. Under it the grantor\u2019s legal estate in this one-sixth was devested, and the grantee held it as tenant in common, for all legal purposes whatever. In all the cases which have been cited where the instrument was construed executory, although some of the words imported a present grant, yet there were other clauses by which something further was to be done, or which showed it to be the design of the parties, from the tenor of the whole instrument, that it was to be merely executory. Nothing exists here which leads to such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">Then in a present conveyance the rule of law is, that without the word \u201c heirs,\u201d but an estate for life passes. That estate has expired, and the heirs of the grantee acquired nothing by inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-9\">Judgment reversed, and judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
