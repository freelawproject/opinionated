Jackson against Giles Knight on two promissory notes, dated 4th of July 1839, each for $1000, payable at 6 and 9 months after date, drawn by the defendant to the order of the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded payment with leave, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">The defendant gave in evidence an agreement, dated 26th of October 1839, by which the plaintiff agreed to convey to him a lot of ground in Beaver county, for the consideration, among others, of $3000, to be paid in notes of $1000 each, payable respectively \u25a0at 3, 6 and 9 months from 4th of July 1839; in consideration of which sums, when all should have been paid to the plaintiff, he was to execute a deed with covenants of general warranty of the property in the names of both as joint owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\">The defendant gave in evidence the record of a judgment for $1860, obtained in the Common Pleas of Beaver county, on the 8th of August 1840, against Jackson by Stephen Paschall, on which a <em>ca. sa. </em>issued, and Jackson was committed to prison; and the following agreement of 10th of October 1840, on which he was discharged:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-11\">\u201c I agree to the discharge of the defendant from imprisonment upon this writ, upon the payment of the costs and jail fees, without prejudice to the future liability from the debt and interest of the judgment, which is to remain in full force and unimpaired.\u201d This agreement was signed by the attorney of Paschall -and by Jackson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-12\">The defendant alleged that this judgment remaining due and unsatisfied was a lien on his property which Jackson agreed to convey to him; that no conveyance of the property had been made to him by Jackson, and that the encumbrances on it prevented him from making a good title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The judge charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">\u201c The first question is, was the plaintiff bound to tender a deed before he brought this suit? Here notes were given, and the money was to be all paid before the deed was to be' made. After the payment of the notes, the defendant will be entitled to his deed. We instruct you that the legal construction of the agreement of the parties given in evidence, does not require a tender of a deed before the bringing of this action on the notes. The omission to tender a deed does not bar the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">The plaintiff asks us to instruct you that the arrest of the plaintiff by virtue of the <em>ca. sa. </em>issued in the case of <em>Paschall </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>was a discharge of the lien of the judgment, and that the discharge of Jackson by the attorney of the plaintiff, was a\" discharge of the debt. The arrest on a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>is itself not a satisfaction of the debt. The general principle is that where a defendant is in execution on a <em>ca. sa., </em>and plaintiff consents to his discharge, the debt is gone. This principle has been carried to an unreasonable and oppressive length, and often to the great injury of unfortunate debtors. The general law will be found in <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Speckenagle, </em>(3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>464). No case precisely like the present has been shown. Here, by agreement in writing with the defendant, endorsed on the writ and signed by the counsel and the defendant, his body was to be released without prejudice to the future liability for the debt and interest of the judgment, which is to remain in full force and unimpaired. Such a discharge is for-the benefit of the defendant; it comports with humanity, justice and common sense. Besides,' we do not think the defendant should be bound to take the title with this encumbrance hanging over it. We instruct the jury to deduct the amount of the judgment from the plaintiff\u2019s demand.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">Both parties excepted to this opinion. The jury rendered a verdict for $286 for the plaintiff, who took out this writ of error, and assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-9\">1. The court erred in charging the jury that the release of Jackson from imprisonment by the attorney for Paschall, was not a discharge of the lien of the judgment obtained in that case, and was not a satisfaction of the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-10\">2.

But his plan to obviate the difficulty by deducting the encumbrance from the purchase money, was defective, inasmuch as it would expose the plaintiff to the hazard of being compelled to pay it out of his own pocket after having left a sum equal to the purpose in the land. The way to do so was to direct a conditional verdict for the whole purchase money with stay of execution for a part sufficient for the exigence till the title should be cleared; which would have left either party the option to pay. If the plaintiff paid, he would be at liberty to proceed by execution for the residue of his judgment; if the defendant paid, the judgment would be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
