That after the arrival of the said daughter at age, the executors, on the 6th of April 1813, sold the said real estate and received the proceeds thereof, amounting to the sum of $5889.59; and in the year 1814 John Bartholomew died, and James Bones the other executor, died since, and that letters of administration on the estate of the latter, were duly granted to Anthony W. Olwine and Abraham Olwine; that no account of the trust has ever been settled by the executors, or either of them, or by the administrators of the surviving executor. Your petitioner further states, that he is interested in the execution of the trust, having been appointed trustee of said fund by the Court of Common Pleas of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Chester county, in the room of said James Bones, deceased. He therefore prays your Honour to award a citation directed to the said Anthony W. Olwine and Abraham Olwine, administrators of the said James Bones, deceased, commanding them to appear at the Orphans\u2019 Court of said county, on some day by your Hon-our to be fixed, to answer the complaint aforesaid, and to settle the account of the' said James Bones, trustee as aforesaid, or show-cause to the contrary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">A citation was issued, and the administrators filed an account, to which exceptions were taken, and it was referred to auditors who made a report. Exceptions were made also to the report, and after hearing a decree was made by the court. Throughout these proceedings Shafer appeared as the trustee above-mentioned until in May 1841, the court ordered certain amendments in the report, by which the balance of the trust fund in the administrators\u2019 hands was #1702.39; and on the same day decreed that the administrators should pay over the same to John Shafer, administrator <em>de bonis non cum testamento annexo </em>of Arthur Rice, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">Sundry exceptions to the same were taken in this court, one of which only it is necessary to notice, viz., that the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction or power to make the decree in the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-8\"><em>Hirst, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8s\">referred to the Act of 29th of March 1832, sec. 57, relative to Orphans\u2019 Courts, and cited 6 <em>Watts </em>278; 3 <em>P.

By the will, the trust for the widow was annexed to the office of the executors, and on the death of both could only be exercised by an administrator <em>de bonis non.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">The proceedings were, therefore, instituted and carried on in the Orphans\u2019 Court without jurisdiction. By the 57th section of the Act of 29th of March 1832, proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court to compel any one amenable to its jurisdiction, to appear and submit to its decree, are to be on the petition of one interested. But Shafer, as trustee, had no interest in the estate, or right to demand an account, or to receive the proceeds. It is true, after the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>count and hearing, a decree was made in favour of Shafer as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Rice, and had the proceedings been so instituted and earned on, all would be right. But being defective in their origin and progress, they could not be cured by this. The court could not make any decree in a suit in which they had not jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
