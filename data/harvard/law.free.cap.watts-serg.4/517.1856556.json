The first count of the narr. alleged that on the 4th of March 1818, Thomas Morris procured Samuel Sterret, deceased, and Robert Johnson to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>his sureties to the State of Maryland, for the faithful performance of the duties of Morris, as .administrator of Archibald Kane, deceased ; and before the execution of the bond, promised Sterret to procure for him counter security from Nixon against any injury that might accrue to Sterret by reason of his becoming surety as afoi\u2019esaid. That Morris, Sterret and Johnson afterwards, on the day aforesaid, (4th of March 1818), by their writing obligatory duly sealed, acknowledged themselves bound to the State of Maryland in the full and just sum of $20,000, in the whole and for tfie whole, jointly and severally. That the condition of that obligation was, that if Morris should well and truly perform the office of administrator aforesaid, according to law, and in all respects discharge the duties required of him by law as such administrator, without any injury or damage to any person interested in the faithful performance of the said office, then the obligation was to be void. That Nixon, in consideration thereof, and that Sterret had sealed the bond, trusting to the promise of Morris to procure him the guaranty of Nixon; afterwards, on the 18th of March 1818, at Philadelphia, in the lifetime of Nixon, promised and undertook, and then and there promised Sterret that he would indemnify him against all loss and injury which he might sustain in consequence of his having become surety as aforesaid. That Sterret, confiding in the said promise of Nixon, had ever since continued to be the surety of Morris, without attempting to procure other security, according to the promise of Morris, or otherwise as he might have done, protect himself from his said liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">The plaintiffs then averred that Morris did not faithfully perform his duties as administrator as aforesaid, but that the bond to the State of Maryland became forfeited, and that the State of Maryland recovered judgment upon the bond, after the death of Sterret, against the plaintiffs, his executors, on the 12th of May 1837, to be levied of the goods and chattels which were of Sterret, for $20,000, and $37.17 costs, to be released on payment of $8918.65, with interest .from the 12th of May 1837. That the plaintiffs paid that sum to the State of Maryland, with costs of suit; whereupon Nixon became liable to pay them the said sum with interest from the 12th of May 1837, &amp;c. Then followed the usual breach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">Th\u2018e second count stated the execution of the bond as before, (alleging no previous promise by Morris to procure the gu.aranty of Nixon), and then proceeded to state that by the provisions of the Act of Maryland then in force, it was provided that if any security of an executor or administrator should conceive himself to be in danger from the suretyship, he might apply to the Orphans\u2019 Court which granted the administration, and that the said court might call on the said party to give counter security, to be approved by the court; and if the party so called should not give, within a fixed and reasonable time, such' counter security, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>court might order the property remaining in the hands of such executor or administrator, to be delivered up to such security; and that Nixon, in consideration of the premises, and that Sterret*, at the special instance and request of Nixon, would forbear to proceed under the said law, and to call on Morris to give counter security, in the manner and under the penalty therein provided, thereupon, to wit, on the 18th of March 1818, undertook, &amp;c., (as in the former count).

In reply to my notification of the second arrangement, he writes under date, February 14, \u2018 I was fully convinced when I wrote you last, that I should have been enabled to make an arrangement here which would have provided me with the means of settling the business in Baltimore, and cancelling your suretyship for me.

It was in evidence, that by the laws of Maryland, Sterret, after signing the bond, and at the time Nixon signed the agreement of guaranty, could have called on Morris to furnish counter security, for his protection, or compelled him to resign the assets into Sterret\u2019s hands, and that Sterret forbore that remedy in consideration of Nixon\u2019s contract to indemnify him, and ever since has forborne, trusting to Nixon\u2019s promise.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-6\"><em>M\u2019Evaine, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">1. There was a continuing consideration which was sufficient to support the promise, as where in consideration that the defendant had become and was tenant to the plaintiff of certain land, and undertook during the tenancy to repair. 1 <em>Chitt. Plead. </em>298; 4 <em>East. </em>154. In <em>Pearl </em>v. <em>Unger (Cro. Eliz. </em>94), in <em>assumpsit, </em>the plaintiff declared he was possessed of certain land, and the defendant, in consideration that he had occupied the land and had paid the rent to the defendant all the time he had occupied it, assumed to save him harmless for the occupation of the land always during the term: it was adjudged that the consideration that the plaintiff was in possession and had paid his rent, and was to pay his rent, was sufficient to cause the other to defend his possession for the time past and to come. So in <em>Powley </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(5 <em>T. Rep. </em>873), the mere relation of landlord and tenant was held a sufficient consideratio'n for the tenant\u2019s promise to manage the farm in a husbandlike manner. So where the consideration of the defendant\u2019s marriage was the plaintiff\u2019s having married his daughter. Here the consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise was the plaintiff\u2019s continuing to remain surety for Morris, and not proceeding to require new bail under the laws of Maryland: and that is necessarily implied from the nature and terms of the defendant\u2019s undertaking.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-8\">2. There was some evidence to go to the jury to show that Nixon\u2019s promise was the consideration on which the defendant entered into the bond. They were brothers-in-law, and the correspondence shows they were intimate friends. Nixon, not living in Baltimore, could not become surety in the bond, and it is a fair inference, from the circumstances, that he told Morris to get some one to become surety, and he would indemnify him. The letter was nearly contemporaneous with the bond, considering the then state of the mails, and it ought all to be considered one transaction. In several cases it has been held fair, to infer that the guaranty was given in connection with the transaction it related to. 8 <em>J. B. Moore </em>2; 11 <em>Johns. </em>221; 10 <em>Wend. </em>207; 1 <em>Bing. </em>216; 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Johns. </em>28; 10 <em>Wend. </em>218; 6 <em>Bing. </em>201; 8 <em>Dowl. &amp; Ry. </em>62; 3 <em>Watts </em>214; 3 <em>Burr. </em>1663; 10 <em>Mass. </em>222.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">If the plaintiff being in danger applied to the defendant and threatened to proceed under the Maryland Act, and then the defendant gave the security, it would be a sufficient consideration. There would be forbearance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-7\">\n<em>Williams, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJXz\">There being no parol evidence, the case must turn on the bond and letter, and their construction is for the court. A past consideration is bad, and this is clearly so. It is for having before that time become security. All was past and done, and therefore the promise was <em>nudum pactum. </em>It is not like the cases of forbearance, for there the party was to wait, and here there was no such agreement. And as to a continuing consideration, that can only be where the relation exists which produces a continuing obligation, such as that of landlord and tenant, father and son-in-law, none of which apply to a surety or guarantor. There was nothing to prevent the plaintiff from applying to the court in Maryland and requiring new security. There was therefore no contract to forbear.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b525-9\">Kennedy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL9\">\u2014 This action, being <em>assumpsit, </em>is founded upon a promise of indemnity, and the only question raised in it is, was the consideration sufficient in law to render the promise binding. The court below considered the consideration as past; and as Nixon, the party who made the promise of indemnity, derived no benefit whatever from it, this promise was therefore to be regarded as a <em>nudum pacturh, </em>upon which no action could be maintained for a breach of it. We, however, think the court were mistaken in the view which they took of the matter: for instead of the consideration being a past consideration, it appears to us to have been more properly a continuing one. It was only eight days after the execution of the bond by Sterret as the surety of Morris, that Nixon gave his promise of indemnity to Sterret for having done so. At the time of making this promise, it is most likely that no act whatever had been done by Morris in administering the estate of Kane, to which the condition of the bond had reference. But, at all events, little if anything could have been done, for it was a work or trust that could only be accomplished or administered in the progress and after the lapse of considerable time. Generally one year, at least, is allowed for such purpose, so that as long as the estate, mentioned in the condition of the bond, remained to be administered, Sterret, the surety, was liable to be damnified by the misconduct or neglect of Morris, the principal, in attending to and performing the same. This liability of the surety to be injured in future, was a continuing liability, and, to prevent his sustaining a loss thereby, may be fairly said to be the consideration for mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ing the promise of indemnity by Nixon. If so, the consideration was a continuing consideration. Suppose,, for instance, that Morris himself, on the 12th of May after the execution, of the bond, had made a promise of indemnity to Sterret, his surety, similar to that which Nixon made on that day at Morris\u2019s instance, would not the consideration have been considered as continuing and the promise binding? No doubt will be entertained but it would, just as clearly as in the case of a promise made by a tenant, after the commencement of his lease and during its continuance, to repair, &amp;c. See 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Civil Pl. </em>298, and the authorities there referred to. Then' if Morris himself would have been bound by his promise of indemnity, upon the ground that the consideration was continuing, it is difficult to perceive any good reason why a third person should not be bound who undertakes to do it for him. It may be said that Morris had an interest in administering the estate and might be a gainer by it, but that Nixon, the third person in this case, could not in any way be a gainer by it, and therefore Morris might be considered as bound by such promise when Nixon ought not. But although profit or gain by the party ^promising may be a sufficient consideration to support his promise, yet it is equally well settled that a detriment to the party to whom the promise is made is equally good. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ashburnham </em>(4 <em>East </em>463). If the promise, in this case, had been made by Nixon to Sterret previously to the latter\u2019s becoming surety, for the purpose of inducing him to do so, it is admitted that it would have been binding. But although it was not made previously with such view, yet it was evidently made for the purpose of inducing him to be contented, to rest easy, and remain surety, when by the law of Maryland he might have relieved himself from all detriment on account of such suretyship, at least in time to come, as soon as he conceived that he was in danger of suffering from it, by obtaining an order of the court to have the property delivered over to himself, unless Morris gave counter security. Thus Sterret was induced to remain surety for Morris at the special instance and request of Nixon, whereby he received great detriment; and why Nixon should .not indemnify him in the latter case as much as in the former, is not easily answered. For it can scarcely be questioned, that the injury done by Morris to Sterret as his surety was all effected after the promise of indemnity given by Nixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">But there is another view, under which it appears to me, that this case might and ought to have been left by the court to the jury, if the plaintiff had not been entitled otherwise to recover, to say from the circumstances given in evidence, whether the promise of indemnity made by Nixon was not given in pursuance of a promise or assurance made, by Morris to Sterret previously to the latter\u2019s becoming his bail, that he would procure the promise of. Nixon to keep him indemnified; and, if so, that the promise of Nixon was good and binding. For unless such assurance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>given by Morris to Sterret, to induce him to become his bail, why should Morris, in the course of only eight days afterwards, almost as soon as it was practicable, have procured Nixon to give.his promise of indemnity ? It would have been idle and unnecessary in Morris to obtain from Nixon such promise of indemnity, unless he was bound to do so, in order to fulfil his previous promise to Sterret. Indeed it seems almost impossible to account rationally for his obtaining it upon any other ground, It is like the case of a precedent request, which is seldom proved, for in most cases, it necessarily arises 'out of the circumstances of the transaction. <em>Per Serg\u2019t.
