The plaintiff gave in evidence a deed in fee of the land in controversy to his testator from Michael Baker and wife, dated 25th of April 1830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">The defendant, after giving evidence to show that the purchase money of the tract in dispute was in part paid by him, offered Michael Baker as a witness to prove that the defendant came to him in the first instance and made a contract with him for the purchase of the land in dispute; and further, that at the time the deed was made by him (Baker) to John Kronk, the latter declared that he took the same for himself during his lifetime, and for Joseph Kronk after his death. This offer was for the purpose of showing that John Kronk accepted the deed as a trustee for himself and his son, the defendant. The plaintiff objected to the witness on the ground of his incompetency as grantor in the deed. The court overruled the objection as to the first part of the offer, and sustained it as to the second. The defendant excepted to this decision, and assigned it for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-10\"><em>Gilmore, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As0\">The rule that a party is not a witness is confined to negotiable instruments.

But Michael Baker does not appear to have any interest in the question whether the deed which he executed was to John Kronk in fee, or to him for life, with remainder to the defendant, Joseph Kronk. Baker\u2019s situation as grantor, and the covenants in his deed, would remain unaffected by the result of this suit in any event. We are, therefore, of opinion that the court below erred in rejecting the testimony of Michael Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
