No. 99-660, tit. III, \u00a7 311(a), 100 Stat. 3755 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-l et seq. (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993)). The order appealed is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b987-21\">Beard\u2019s petition for compensation under the Act alleged that she contracted polio as a result of contact with her daughter, who received an injection of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) which, because of contamination during manufacture, contained infectious polio virus. Beard\u2019s petition was consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>with several others alleging similar community-acquired polio from contact with recipients of contaminated IPV. Chief Special Master Golkiewicz decided the consolidated cases in <em>Staples v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 90-1205V, 1993 WL 330948 (Fed.Cl.Sp.Mstr. Aug. 16, 1993), concluding that terms of the Act limit compensation for community-acquired polio to those who contract the disease from recipients of oral polio vaccine (OPV). On August 18, 1993, the Chief Special Master dismissed Beard\u2019s petition in reliance on his decision in <em>Staples. </em>Beard\u2019s motion for review by the Court of Federal Claims was held in abeyance pending decision on the motion for review in the <em>Staples </em>case. On January 26, 1994, Judge Yock in a thorough opinion affirmed the Chief Special Master\u2019s dismissal of Staples\u2019 petition for compensation, holding that the Act bars compensation for community-acquired polio from exposure to recipients of contaminated IPV. <em>Staples v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>30 Fed.Cl. 348 (1994). Relying on Judge Yock\u2019s opinion and decision, Judge Weinstein by order affirmed the dismissal of Beard\u2019s petition for compensation. Beard timely appeals that order. We have jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(f) (Supp. V 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Beard\u2019s appeal raises a single question of statutory interpretation, namely whether the Act affords compensation to a person who contracts polio from another person who received contaminated IPV. Such questions \u201ccome to us for decision with little if any deference owed to or expected by the forums below,\u201d <em>Munn v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 (Fed.Cir.1992), and are reviewed de novo. <em>Widdoss v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>989 F.2d 1170, 1174 (Fed. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. 381, 126 L.Ed.2d 331 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">The pertinent statutory references begin with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1) (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993), which establishes the baseline standard of eligibility for compensation under the Act, providing in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIO\">Compensation shall be awarded under the Program to a petitioner if the special master or court finds on the record as a whole\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-13\">(A) that the petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence the matters required in the petition by section 300aa-ll(c)(l) of this title----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">In a paragraph entitled \u201cPetition content,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-11(c)(1)(A) (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993) requires a petition for compensation to contain an affidavit and supporting documentation demonstrating that the person who suffered injury or who died:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-15\">[Rjeceived a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table or, if such person did not receive such a vaccine, contracted polio, directly or indirectly, from another person who received an oral polio vaccine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-16\">In addition, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-lL(c)(l)(B)(ii) (1988) requires a petitioner to demonstrate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-17\">if such person did not receive such a vaccine [set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table] but contracted polio from another person who received an oral polio vaccine, [and such person] was a citizen, of the United States or a dependent of such a citizen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-18\">The clear, unambiguous and unmistakable terms of \u00a7\u00a7 13(a) and 11(c) limit compensation under the Act to a person who either has <em>received </em>a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table or contracted polio from the recipient of <em>oral </em>polio vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-19\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">Beard\u2019s daughter did not receive OPV. Consequently, Beard cannot demonstrate entitlement to compensation under the provisions of the Act that clearly afford relief to victims of exposure to recipients of OPV.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-21\">Instead, Beard argues that she, while not the direct recipient of any polio vaccine, should be deemed <em>de jure </em>to have constructively received a Table-listed vaccine. With respect to polio vaccines, the Vaccine Injury Table in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-14(a) (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993) contains two enumerations:</p>\n<p id=\"b989-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>III. Polio Vaccines (other than Inactivated Polio Vaccine).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">A. Paralytic polio</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">\u2014 in a non-immunodeficient recipient...................................30 days</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">\u2014 in an immunodeficient recipient....................................6 months</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">\u2014 in a vaccine-associated community case........................ Not applicable</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">* # * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">IV. Inactivated Polio Vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">A. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock......................................24 hours</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">The Vaccine Injury Table, by its terms, lists the vaccines, the adverse health consequences resulting from the administration of the listed vaccines, and the time periods in which the first reaction must occur after vaccine administration in order to qualify for compensation under the Act. With regard to paralytic polio contracted in a vaccine-associated community case, the Table establishes no time period limitation for occurrence of a first reaction to vaccine administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">As a victim of paralytic polio, Beard argues that the contaminated IPV injected into her daughter should be defined under Part III as a polio vaccine \u201cother than Inactivated Polio Vaccine\u201d because, due to its contamination, it was in fact an activated polio vaccine. Beard thus claims entitlement to compensation under \u00a7 11(c)(1)(A) as a recipient of a Table-listed vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Beard argues for a broad interpretation of \u201creceived\u201d in \u00a7 11(c)(1)(A) so that she may claim entitlement to compensation as recipient of a Table-listed vaccine under Part III \u201cother than Inactivated Polio Vaccine.\u201d She points to the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding in a companion case, <em>Staples, </em>that \u00a7\u00a7 11(c) and 14(a) are in \u201cirreconcilable\u201d conflict. According to the Chief Special Master, \u00a7 11(c) refers only recipients of vaccines (vaccinees) to the Table in \u00a7 14(a), and provides for injuries from contact with persons receiving <em>oral </em>vaccine in \u00a7 11(c)(1). However, the Table contemplates polio from a \u201cvaccine-associated communiiy case,\u201d which by definition, occurs in non-vaccinees, creating under this interpretation, the \u201cconflict\u201d that the Table appears to compensate a non-vaccinee when \u00a7 11(c)(1)(A) only refers vaccinees to the Table.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">From the Chief Special Master\u2019s reading of the statute, Beard reasons that \u201creceived\u201d in \u00a7 11(c) is ambiguous, as we cannot read \u201creceived\u201d narrowly to mean only vaccinees where the Table contemplates compensating non-vaccinees in community contact cases. Urging a broad reading of \u201creceived,\u201d Beard argues that she constructively \u201creceived\u201d a Table-listed polio vaccine within the meaning of \u00a7 11(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">We thus address Beard\u2019s argument that she constructively \u201creceived\u201d a Table-listed polio vaccine within the meaning of \u00a7 11(c)(1)(A), because, \u201chaving given her consent, the mother truly should be considered, together with the child, to have <em>received </em>the vaccine being administered\u201d to the child. Beard points to various definitions of \u201creceive\u201d such as accept; acquire; take as from a source or agency of transmission; obtain or get as a result of a delivery, transmission or communication; acquire from any source outside of oneself; to approve; to have; to be subjected to; etc. Beard argues that Congress would have used a term with a narrower meaning (such as \u201cadministered to\u201d or \u201cinjected with\u201d) had it intended to limit the class of potential plaintiffs to exclude people like Beard who were not actually injected with the vaccine. Additionally, Beard draws our attention to the Table category \u201cother than Inactivated Polio Vaccine,\u201d arguing that Congress did not use the categories \u201cOPV\u201d and \u201cIPV,\u201d but rather contemplated compensation where contaminated IPV was not inactivated and caused injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">We must reject her argument. First, we disagree with the Chief Special Master that \u00a7\u00a7 11(c) and 14(a) are \u201cirreconcilably in conflict.\u201d Section 11(c)(1) contains five elements which a petition for compensation under the Vaccine Act must satisfy. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>it is correct that \u00a7 11(c)(1)(A) directs only vaccine recipients to the Table in \u00a7 14(a), the Chief Special Master incorrectly concluded that only vaccine recipients could benefit from the Table. Under \u00a7\u00a7 ll(c)(l)(B)(ii) and ll(c)(l)(C)(i) persons who \u201cdid not receive [a vaccine set forth in the Table] but who contracted polio from another person who received <em>oral </em>polio vaccine,\u201d (emphasis added) and who \u201csustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury or condition set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table\u201d may petition for compensation. Thus, \u00a7 ll(c)(l)(C)(i) directs non-vaccinees who contract polio from a person who received an <em>oral </em>polio vaccination, to the Table. Consequently, the provision in the Table for community contact cases is not anomalous and is consistent with \u00a7 11(c)(1).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Second, Beard\u2019s definition of the word \u201creceive\u201d would lead to an anomaly whereby parents and guardians of children who were vaccinated with contaminated IPV would qualify for compensation but unrelated third parties would not. The Act makes no such distinctions with respect to those who qualify for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Because Beard did not <em>receive </em>a vaccine set forth in the Table, \u00a7 11(c)(1)(A) requires \u2014 in order for her petition to survive\u2014 that she demonstrate that she \u201ccontracted polio, directly or indirectly, from another person who received an <em>oral </em>polio vaccine.\u201d (emphasis added). This Beard cannot do, because her daughter did not receive OPV. In the final analysis, for Beard to prevail, we would have to ignore the word \u201coral\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 11(c)(1)(A) and ll(c)(l)(B)(ii). That we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The order of the Court of Federal Claims affirming the Chief Special Master\u2019s dismissal of Beard\u2019s petition for compensation is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">No Costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-10\"> Although Congress's intent in creating a category \"other than Inactivated Polio\" rather than \"OPV\u201d remains less than clear, we do not need to divine Congress\u2019s intent given the clear direction of the statute allowing only vaccinees and people who contract polio from recipients of <em>OPV </em>to benefit from the Table.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
