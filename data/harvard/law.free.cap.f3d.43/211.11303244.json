The deportation order was issued because of Wilson\u2019s conviction for possession of marijuana in Dallas County, Texas. Wilson challenges the order, contending that the Board\u2019s standard for conviction is contrary to congressional intent and to Supreme Court precedent, and alternatively arguing that his conviction was not final for purposes of deportation. Finding no merit in his contentions, we affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-22\">Wilson is a thirty-seven year old native and citizen of Saint Christopher who was admitted into the United States as a nonim-migrant visitor on or about March 3, 1985. On May 19, 1988, his status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident based on his marriage to a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">On July 15, 1988, Wilson pleaded guilty to and was convicted of possession of marijuana in a Texas state court in Dallas County. The self-titled \u201cJudgment\u201d stated that \u201c[i]t is therefore found and adjudged by the court, that the said Defendant is guilty of the felony offense\u201d of marijuana possession. Wilson received a sentence of four years confinement and a $500 fine, but the sentence was suspended and Wilson was placed on probation for a period of four years. On July 17, 1992, after Wilson had satisfactorily fulfilled his conditions of probation, the court entered an order setting aside the judgment of conviction, dismissing the indictment, discharging Wilson from probation, and releasing him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued an Order to Show Cause on May 31, 1992, charging Wilson with de-portability under section 241(a)(2)(B)\u00a9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). At his hearing, Wilson admitted the allegations against him but denied de-portability, arguing that his conviction did not qualify as a conviction for immigration purposes. The Immigration Judge followed the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision in <em>Matter of Ozkok, </em>A-12150228, 1988 WL 235459 (BIA 1988), and concluded that Wilson\u2019s conviction was sufficient for immigration and deportability purposes. On appeal to the BIA, Wilson argued that the <em>Ozkok </em>conviction test was invalid, and alternatively, Wilson alleged that his probationary sentence did not meet the <em>Ozkok </em>conviction test. He also challenged the finality of his conviction for immigration purposes. The BIA reaffirmed the <em>Ozkok </em>test and rejected Wilson\u2019s other arguments. Wilson appeals from the BIA\u2019s decision, asserting essentially the same arguments presented to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A5b\">In reviewing challenges to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term, we apply a two-pronged standard of review. First, we consider \u201cthe legal standard under which the INS should make the particular deportability decision.\u201d <em>Animashaun v. INS, </em>990 F.2d 234, 237 (5th Cir.1993). If the governing statute does not clearly speak to the question before the court, we have \u201cupheld agency interpretations of ambiguous law when that interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. National Resources Defense Counsel, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[w]e have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department\u2019s construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer_\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">After determining the controlling legal standard, \u201cwe will next examine the Board\u2019s findings under the substantial evidence test to determine whether the legal standard has been satisfied.\u201d <em>Animashaun, </em>990 F.2d at 237. The substantial evidence standard \u201crequires only that the Board\u2019s conclusion be based upon the evidence presented and that it be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">III. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">A. The Validity of the <em>Ozkok </em>Conviction Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Wilson contends that the conviction test announced in the BIA\u2019s <em>Ozkok </em>decision is inapplicable because it is inconsistent with congressional intent and with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pino v. Landon, </em>349 U.S. 901, 75 S.Ct. 576, 99 L.Ed. 1239 (1955). We disagree with both of these contentions, but we begin by examining the background and the history of the <em>Ozkok </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">1. The foundations of <em>Ozkok</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">In <em>Matter of Ozkok, </em>after \u201can extensive review of the relevant ease law, legislative history, and INS precedent, the BIA deviated abruptly from long-standing INS and BIA precedent.\u201d <em>Martinez-Montoya v. INS, </em>904 F.2d 1018, 1021 (5th Cir.1990). Under the narcotics violation provision of the INA, the BIA adopted a uniform federal standard for defining \u201cconviction,\u201d rather than retaining a state-by-state standard. Specifically, the BIA stated that \u201cwe shall consider a person convicted if the court has adjudicated him guilty or has entered a formal judgment of guilt.\u201d <em>Ozkok, </em>1988 WL 235459, at *4. \u201cWhere adjudication of guilt has been withheld,\u201d however, the Board in <em>Ozkok </em>stated that a conviction will be found for immigra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>tion purposes when the following elements are present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">(1) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or he has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">(2) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the person\u2019s liberty to be imposed (including but not limited to incarceration, probation, a fine or restitution, or community-based sanctions ...); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">(3) a judgment or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the person violates the terms of his probation or fails to comply with the requirements of the court\u2019s order, without availability of further proceedings regarding the person\u2019s guilt or innocence of the original charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Wilson correctly points out that the <em>Ozkok </em>standard represents a departure from the BIA\u2019s previous position, which required \u201cthe action of the court [to be] considered a conviction by the state for at least some purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6-7 n. 4; <em>Martinez-Montoya, </em>904 F.2d at 1021. In articulating this new standard, the BIA noted that the previous analytical framework was \u201ctoo narrow and undesirably subject to the vagaries of state law.\u201d <em>Martinez-Montoya, </em>904 F.2d at 1021; <em>Ozkok, </em>1988 WL 235459, at *3. According to the BIA, \u201cCongress did not intend for a narcotics violator to escape deportation as a result of a technical erasure of his conviction by a state.\u201d <em>Ozkok, </em>1988 WL 235459, at *3 (citing <em>Matter of A</em>\u2014F\u2014, 8 I &amp; N Dec. 429, 445-46 (BIA 1959)). The Attorney General noted \u201cthe federal policy to treat narcotics offenses seriously,\u201d and the Attorney General determined that \u201cit would be inappropriate for an alien\u2019s deportability for criminal activity to be dependent upon \u2018the vagaries of state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ozkok, </em>1988 WL 235459, at *3 (quoting <em>Matter of A</em>\u2014F\u2014, 8 I &amp; N Dec. 429, 445-46 (BIA 1959)); <em>see also Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cIn <em>Ozkok, </em>the Board considered Supreme Court and federal, precedent in concluding that Congress intended federal immigration laws to be uniform and that previous interpretations of state \u2018convictions\u2019 under varying state laws for immigration purposes produced \u2018anomalous and unfair results.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Ozkok, </em>1988 WL 235459, at *3). Thus, in light of the congressional resolve to combat our nation\u2019s drug problem and to unify the conviction standard, the BIA in <em>Ozkok </em>adopted a federal definition of \u201cconviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">2. Consistency with Congressional Intent</p>\n<p id=\"Aju9\">Wilson contends that the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 an amendment to a federal firearms statute \u2014 indicates that the federal conviction standard in <em>Ozkok </em>is inconsistent with congressional intent. Wilson apparently believes that the enactment of this amendment indicates that Congress intended for the term \u201cconviction\u201d to hinge on whether the state considers the person convicted for some purpose. In other words, according to Wilson, the Amendment reveals that Congress intended for the <em>pre-Ozkok </em>conviction standard to govern immigration law because that standard required the action of the court to be considered a conviction by the state for at least some purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">We believe that Wilson\u2019s interpretation of the <em>firearms </em>amendment is much too broad. On this point, we wholly agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s analysis and discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-14\">In <em>Dickerson [v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845], [ (1983) ] the Supreme Court held that for purposes of federal gun control laws, the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d was a question of federal law since there was an absence of Congress\u2019 intent to the contrary. Congress subsequently overruled <em>Dickerson </em>[in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921] by requiring that a conviction be defined in accordance with the laws in which the criminal proceedings are held. However, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>still stands for the general proposition that federal law governs the application of Congressional statutes in the absence of a plain language to the contrary. By overruling the holding in <em>Dickerson, </em>Congress merely provided the contrary indication that state, not federal law, applies in interpreting <em>the federal gun control statute. </em>Here, Congress has not overruled <em>Ozkok </em>with contrary legislation; accordingly, <em>Dickerson </em>persuades us to adopt Ozkok\u2019s holding that for the purpose of the INA, federal, rather than state, law is to define a \u201cconviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><em>Yanez-Popp, </em>998 F.2d at 236 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In other words, the firearms amendment mandates a state definition of conviction <em>only for the firearms statute that it amends. </em>For purposes of the INA, the amendment is inapplicable, especially because of the congressional policy to treat narcotics offenses seriously and to unify the deportability standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">3. <em>Pino v. Landon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Wilson also contends that the BIA\u2019s <em>Ozkok </em>decision effectively overruled the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pino v. Landon, </em>349 U.S. 901, 75 S.Ct. 576, 99 L.Ed. 1239 (1955). In <em>Pino, </em>an alien had been found guilty of petty larceny in Massachusetts district court. <em>See Pino v. Nicolls, </em>215 F.2d 237, 240 (1st Cir.1954). The court found the defendant guilty, but it suspended his one-year prison sentence and instead imposed probation for one year. <em>See id. </em>at 241. As the Seventh Circuit described:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">Under a special Massachusetts procedure, upon the satisfactory completion of his probation, his sentence was revoked and his case was put \u201con file.\u201d The \u201con file\u201d status meant that the ease remained on the records of the court but no further action would normally be taken. However, it was theoretically possible that the case could again be called up and a sentence imposed, at which time the defendant-alien could appeal from the sentence so imposed and secure a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Massachusetts superior court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\"><em>Will v. INS, </em>447 F.2d 529, 531 (7th Cir.1971) (describing the facts of <em>Pino). </em>The <em>Pino </em>court noted that \u201c[pjlacing the case on file was not equivalent to a revocation of the judicial determination of Pino\u2019s guilt....\u201d 215 F.2d at 244-45. The court subsequently held that the \u201con file\u201d status of Pino\u2019s conviction did not negate its finality. <em>See id. </em>Significantly, however, the court also noted that \u201cin the interest of a uniform application of the federal statute, the meaning of the word \u2018convicted\u2019 is a federal question....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In a brief per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the holding of the First Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">On the record here we are unable to say that the conviction has attained such finality as to support an order of deportation within the contemplation of \u00a7 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The judgment is reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">349 U.S. at 901, 75 S.Ct. at 576. Thus, it is clear that the Supreme Court only addressed the finality of the conviction in <em>Pino, </em>and the Court expressed no disagreement with the First Circuit\u2019s characterization of \u201cconviction\u201d as a federal question. Simply put, the decision of the BIA to apply a federal conviction standard in <em>Ozkok </em>does not infringe at all, either explicitly or implicitly, upon the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pino. See Yanez-Popp, </em>998 F.2d at 236 (\u201c[N]owhere in the <em>[Pino </em>] decision did the Court disapprove of the First Circuit\u2019s statement that \u2018conviction\u2019 was to be defined according to federal [and] not state law.\u201d). We conclude that the validity of <em>Ozkok </em>is unaffected by the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Pino </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">4. Reasonableness of the <em>Ozkok </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Simply put, we agree with the INS that Wilson\u2019s contentions are without merit. Ozkok\u2019s rule applying a federal \u201cconviction\u201d standard rather than a state standard is reasonable and is consistent with congressional intent and the relevant ease law. Numerous other circuit courts agree. <em>See, e.g., Parredes-Urrestarazu v. INS, </em>36 F.3d 801, 811 n. 11 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he meaning of the term \u2018conviction\u2019 is a question of federal law\u201d); <em>Molina v. INS, </em>981 F.2d 14, 19 (1st Cir.1992) (\u201cThe federal Constitution permits Congress to condition its immigration law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>upon the absence of a \u2018conviction\u2019 as <em>federally </em>defined.\u201d); <em>Chong v. INS, </em>890 F.2d 284, 285 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cThe BIA was also correct in not considering the Florida expungement statute because this court, other courts of appeals, and the BIA have expressly held that the term \u2018convicted\u2019 in the [INA] must be interpreted in accordance with federal standards.\u201d); <em>Yazdchi v. INS, </em>878 F.2d 166, 167 (5th Cir.1989) (\u201c[T]he consequences which a state chooses to attach to a conviction in its courts for purposes of its own law are for it to say; but they cannot control the consequences to be given it in a deportation proceeding \u2014 a function of federal law.\u201d); <em>Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, </em>516 F.2d 565, 570 (6th Cir.1975) (\u201cThe definition of \u2018convicted\u2019 ... is a matter of federal law, to be interpreted in harmony with the policies underlying the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d); <em>Will v. INS, </em>447 F.2d 529, 531 (7th Cir.1971) (\u201cWe must, however, agree with other circuits that Congress intended the term \u2018convicted\u2019 to be given meaning in light of federal law and policies rather than on the basis of all the peculiarities of the laws of the various states.\u201d (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Moreover, the BIA has discretion to reinterpret the INA if it employs a \u201creasoned analysis.\u201d <em>Rust v. Sullivan, </em>500 U.S. 173, 187, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 1769, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991). As the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">[A] revised interpretation deserves deference because an initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone and the agency, to engage in informal rulemak-ing, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis. An agency is not required to establish rules of conduct to last forever, but rather must be given ample latitude to adapt [its] rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 186-87, 111 S.Ct. at 1769 (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted). Based on our own analysis and on the deference that we accord to the BIA, we conclude that the <em>Ozkok </em>federal conviction standard is reasonable, and we will apply it in the present case. <em>See Martinez-Montoya, </em>904 F.2d at 1021 (\u201cThe federal agency construction is to be upheld if it is reasonable and if it is not contrary to Congressional intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">B. Application of the <em>Ozkok </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">There is substantial evidence to affirm the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Wilson is de-portable under the <em>Ozkok </em>test. Wilson\u2019s arguments regarding the satisfaction of the three <em>Ozkok </em>elements are misplaced and irrelevant, for the three-pronged test is only applicable \u201c[w]here adjudication of guilt has been withheld.\u201d <em>Ozkok, </em>1988 WL 235459, at *4. In this case, however, Wilson was not sentenced under the Texas deferred adjudication statute and adjudication of guilt was not otherwise withheld. On the contrary, <em>Ozkok </em>considers a person convicted \u201cif the court has adjudicated him guilty or has entered a formal judgment of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These conditions are satisfied in Wilson\u2019s ease, as his \u201cJudgment\u201d explicitly stated that he was \u201cfound and adjudged\u201d guilty of marijuana possession by the court; only his <em>sentence </em>was suspended. Thus, there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Wilson has been \u201cconvicted\u201d for purposes of the federal immigration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">C. Finality of the Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Wilson also contends that his conviction had not achieved a sufficient degree of finality during his probationary period. According to Wilson, his conviction is not final for deportation purposes because his probation remained subject to modification or revocation and because Texas probationers can appeal the revocation of their probation. Once again, we disagree with Wilson\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">As we noted in <em>Martinez-Montoya, </em>\u201c[w]e trace the requirement of finality back to the <em>per curiam </em>decision in <em>Pino v. Landon.\u201d </em>904 F.2d at 1025. Significantly, in <em>Martinez-Montoya, </em>we went on to make the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">The <em>Pino </em>opinion itself gives little indication as to the degree of finality required. But what is crucial is that all subsequent case authority has concluded that unless the alien has exhausted or waived his rights to direct appeal or the appeals period has lapsed the criminal proceeding is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>not sufficiently final to constitute a conviction for immigration purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1025. We adopted this framework for our \u201cfinality\u201d determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">Under this overwhelming authority, and consistent with the <em>Ozkok </em>decision, we conclude that, unless [petitioner] has waived or exhausted his right to direct appeals, or the appeals period has lapsed, he cannot be considered convicted for immigration purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">As mentioned, Wilson was not sentenced under a deferred adjudication statute; rather, he was \u201cfound and adjudged\u201d guilty and his sentence was suspended. Considering that Wilson\u2019s \u201cJudgment\u201d of conviction was entered on July 15,1988, his thirty-day direct appeals period has clearly lapsed. <em>See </em>Tex. R.App.P. 41(b)(1) (\u201cAppeal is perfected when notice of appeal is filed within thirty days <em>after the day sentence is imposed or suspended </em>in open court or the day an appeal-able order is signed by the trial judge....\u201d) (emphasis added). Wilson is simply wrong in his contention that \u201cthe Texas procedure allows the defendant to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals for review of the trial and conviction during the probationary period.\u201d The statute does provide that \u201c[t]he right of the probationer to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals for a review of the trial and conviction, as provided by law, shall be accorded the probationer <em>at the time he is placed on probation.\u201d </em>Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 42.12, \u00a7 8(b) (Vernon 1979). As mentioned, however, Wilson was placed on probation on July 15, 1988, and his statutory right of appeal lapsed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Wilson\u2019s finality argument based on the ability to appeal a revocation of probation is also unavailing. Simply put, Wilson\u2019s probationary period <em>has been completed; </em>thus, the right to appeal any modification or revocation of probation has lapsed and is inapplicable. Furthermore, Wilson\u2019s reliance on the <em>Will </em>opinion is misplaced, as that court agreed that a conviction is not final only when \u201ca direct appeal is pending\u201d \u2014 a situation that does not exist in Wilson\u2019s case. <em>Will, </em>447 F.2d at 533. In short, we agree that Wilson\u2019s conviction has achieved a sufficient degree of finality for purposes of the federal immigration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the BIA in support of deportability is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\">. Section 241(a)(2)(B)(i) states in the following relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">Any alien who at any time after entry has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance, ... other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(B)(i). Wilson\u2019s conviction did not fall under the thirty gram exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\">. The statute states in the following relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes <em>of this chapter, </em>unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
