Kane, Jr., appeals from the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims granting the government\u2019s motion to dismiss his claim for a tax refund. <em>Kane v. United States, </em>28 Fed.Cl. 10 (1993). Because a judge\u2019s disability retirement pay under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(a) (1988) is not excludable from gross income under \u00a7 104(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1) (1988), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b992-24\">Neither party disputes the material facts of this case. In 1977, Kane was appointed a federal district judge on the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. As time progressed, he began to suffer physical manifestations of stress. In 1988, Kane took disability retirement under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(a), having been diagnosed as suffering from a condition known as sleep apnea. Section 372(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-25\">Any justice or judge of the United States appointed to hold office during good behavior <em>who becomes permanently disabled from performing his duties may retire from regular active </em>service____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-26\">Each justice or judge retiring under this section after serving ten years continuously or otherwise shall, during the remainder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>of Ms lifetime, receive the salary of the office. A justice or judge retiring under tMs section who has served less than ten years in all shall, during the remainder of Ms lifetime, receive one-half the salary of the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(a) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 372(a), Kane received an amount equal to his salary as disability retirement pay in 1988 and 1989. He included these amounts in Ms gross income on his 1988 and 1989 tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">In 1991, Kane filed amended tax returns for 1988 and 1989, excluding Ms \u00a7 372(a) disability retirement pay from Ms gross income. He claimed that such disability retirement payments are exempt from taxation under \u00a7 104(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), wMch excludes from gross income \u201camounts received under workmen\u2019s compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or sickness.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) demed his claim on the ground that Kane failed to establish that the disability payments were in lieu of workmen\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Kane then filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking a refund, plus court costs, expenses, interest, and attorney fees. In response, the government filed a motion to dismiss the 1988 claim for failure to state a claim upon wMch relief could be granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kane filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and opposed the motion to dismiss. The court granted the government\u2019s motion. In so holding, the court rejected Kane\u2019s argument that entitlement to the exemption under \u00a7 104(a)(1) depended solely on whether payments were provided for a work-related injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, the court considered that \u00a7 104(a)(1) required an analysis of the statute under wMch payments were made to determine whether the statute qualified as a workmen\u2019s compensation act or one \u201cin the nature of\u2019 a workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Kane, </em>28 Fed.Cl. at 13. The court analyzed \u00a7 372(a) and determined that it was not a \u201cworkmen\u2019s compensation act\u201d or \u201cin the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act\u201d because the statute does not make a distinction between work-related disability payments and non-work-related disability payments. <em>Id. </em>at 14. Thus, the court held that Kane could not exclude the disability retirement payments from Ms gross income. <em>Id. </em>Kane now appeals from that judgment. We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) (Supp. V 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Our review of the decision turns on the proper interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code, a question of law wMch we review <em>de novo. Quaker State Oil Ref. Corp. v. United States, </em>994 F.2d 824, 826-27 (Fed. Cir.1993). The question of law presented in tMs case, a case of first impression, is whether disability retirement pay received by a judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(a) is excludable from gross income under \u00a7 104(a)(1) of the Code. To resolve this question of statutory interpretation, we look first to the language of the statute. <em>Martel v. Department of Transp., Federal Aviation Admin., </em>735 F.2d 504, 507 n. 6 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>469 U.S. 1018, 105 S.Ct. 432, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">Section 104(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">\u00a7 104. Compensation for injuries and sickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">(a) In general. \u2014 Except in the case of amounts attributable to (and not in excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 (relating to medical, etc., expenses) for any prior taxable year, <em>gross income does not </em>include\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">(1) amounts received <em>under workmen\u2019s compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or sickness;</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-17\">Treasury Regulation 1.104-l(b) elaborates on the scope of tMs exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>Section 104(a)(1) excludes from gross income amounts which are received by an employee <em>under a workmen\u2019s compensation act </em>... <em>or under a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act which provides compensation to employees for personal injuries or sickness incurred in the course of employment. </em>Section 104(a)(1) also applies to compensation which is paid under a workmen\u2019s compensation act to the survivor or survivors of a deceased employee. However, <em>section 101(a)(1) does not apply to a retirement pension or annuity to the extent that it is determined by reference to the employee\u2019s age or length of service, or by the employees prior contributions, even though the employee\u2019s retirement is occasioned by an occupational injury or sickness.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.104 \u2014 1(b) (1988) (emphasis added). \u201cDeference is ordinarily owing to the agency construction if ... the regulation \u2018implement[s] the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gannet v. United States, </em>877 F.2d 965, 968 (Fed.Cir.1989) (quoting <em>United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., </em>455 U.S. 16, 24, 102 S.Ct. 821, 827, 70 L.Ed.2d 792 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">The Code also provides that gross income includes \u201call income from whatever source derived,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a) (1988), and the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 61 reflects Congress\u2019s intent to use the full measure of its taxing power. <em>Helvering v. Clifford, </em>309 U.S. 331, 334, 60 S.Ct. 554, 556, 84 L.Ed. 788 (1940). Thus, the Court has held that statutes granting tax exemptions should be strictly construed. <em>E.g., Commissioner v. Jacobson, </em>336 U.S. 28, 49, 69 S.Ct. 358, 369, 93 L.Ed. 477 (1949) (construing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 22(b)(3) (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Kane argues that \u00a7 372(a) is \u201cin the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act\u201d and that his income received under that provision is therefore exempt under \u00a7 104(a). We disagree. The language of the statute and regulation are clear. To be excluded from gross income, payments must be received \u201cunder a workmen's compensation act\u201d or \u201cunder a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act.\u201d The payments to Kane are neither. Section 372(a) is not a workmen\u2019s com-pensation act. Workmen\u2019s compensation acts provide fixed awards to employees or their dependents in cases of employment-related accidents and diseases, regardless of fault. <em>See </em>W. PAGE KEETON ET AL., PROSSER AND KEETON ON THE LAW OF TORTS \u00a7 80 (5th ed. 1984). In general, they provide a no-fault award in place of an employer\u2019s fault-based liability. <em>See, e.g., </em>The Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, ch. 509, 44 Stat. 1424 (1927) (codified as amended at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1988)); Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, Pub.L. No. 89-554, 80 Stat. 532 (1966) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-8193 (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993)). Section 372(a), on the other hand, is a disability retirement provision, not a substitute for employer liability. It provides for a continuation of salary, either full salary or half salary, depending upon tenure. It does not in any way displace or relieve the government from any employer liability to the extent that the disability might be work-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Section 372(a) is also not \u201cin the nature of\u2019 a workmen\u2019s compensation act. Kane asserts that the trial court erred by applying a \u201cface of the statute\u201d test to determine if \u00a7 372(a) is in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act. In particular, Kane alleges that the trial court erroneously relied on <em>Riley v. United States, </em>156 F.Supp. 751, 140 Ct.Cl. 381 (1957), for the proposition that a statute must explicitly provide for work-related disability in order to qualify for an exemption. Kane argues that a court, rather than looking to the \u201cface of the statute,\u201d must inquire into the underlying cause of a claimant\u2019s injury to determine if payments were triggered by a work-related injury. We disagree..</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">While <em>Riley </em>dealt with a widow\u2019s pension under a District of Columbia statute, in contrast to \u00a7 372(a), which is before us, the trial court did not erroneously rely on <em>Riley. </em>It resolved the issue before us, as does this court, by focusing on the language of \u00a7 104. That statute refers to workmen\u2019s compensation acts. Faithful to the statute, the language of \u00a7 104\u2019s implementing regulation clearly requires that payments be received \u201cunder a <em>statute </em>in the nature of a workmen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>compensation act.\u201d 26 G.F.R. \u00a7 1.104-1 (emphasis added). Thus, it is the <em>statute, </em>not the nature of the <em>injury, </em>that must be analyzed to determine whether it is in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">Other courts have interpreted \u00a7 104(a)(1) similarly, holding that statutes that do not limit compensation to on-the-job injuries are not in the nature of workmen\u2019s compensation acts. <em>See Take v. Commissioner, </em>804 F.2d 553 (9th Cir.1986) (ordinance that makes no distinction between work-related and non-work-related diseases is not in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act); <em>Hoar v. Commissioner, </em>709 F.2d 1206 (8th Cir.1983) (exemption does not apply to payments under the Civil Service Retirement Act, which is not designed to provide compensation for on-the-job injuries); <em>Smelley v. United States, </em>806 F.Supp. 932 (N.D.Ala.1992) (state statute providing disability compensation to municipal employees and state troopers, regardless of cause, not a workmen\u2019s compensation act or in nature of workmen\u2019s compensation act), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>3 F.3d 389 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Kane counters that several Tax Court decisions have held that an inquiry into the nature of the injury is required under \u00a7 104(a)(1) rather than an analysis of the statute. <em>See Golden v. Commissioner, </em>30 T.C.M. (CCH) 691, 1971 WL 2409 (1971); <em>McDonald v. Commissioner, </em>33 T.C. 540, 1959 WL 967 (1959). These contrary decisions are not persuasive in light of more recent decisions and IRS rulings to the contrary. See, <em>e.g., Clifford v. Commissioner, </em>48 T.C.M. (CCH) 824, 825, 1984 WL 15075 (1984); Rev.Rul. 85-104, 1985-2 C.B. 52, 53 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Kane further argues that even if we accept a \u201cface of the statute\u201d test, \u00a7 372(a) is in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act because it is a \u201cdual-purpose\u201d statute that provides payment for both work-related and non-work-related disabilities. Kane argues that since the payments were received for a work-related disability under a \u201cdual-purpose\u201d statute, he may exclude these payments from his gross income. In support of his argument, Kane points to a line of cases concerning the predecessor statute to \u00a7 104(a)(1), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 22(b)(5) (1946), in which courts made inquiry into the source of the disability when a statute provided for both work-related and non-work-related disabilities. <em>See Simms v. Commissioner, </em>196 F.2d 238 (D.C.Cir.1952) (statute providing retirement for disability incurred in line of duty or for 25 years of service); <em>Neill v. Commissioner, </em>17 T.C. 1015, 1951 WL 288 (1951) (statute providing retirement for disability incurred in line of duty or for 16 years of service); <em>Frye v. United States, </em>72 F.Supp. 405 (D.D.C.1947) (same statute as in Simms).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">However, unlike the statutes in <em>Simms, Neill, </em>and <em>Frye, </em>\u00a7 372(a) provides for disability retirement payments regardless of the cause of the disability. In contrast, <em>Simms, Neill, </em>and <em>Frye </em>involved statutes in which at least one provision, on its face, specifically provided for payments based solely on injury or sickness arising out of employment. The courts, therefore, were required to make an inquiry as to the portion of the statute under which payments were awarded. For example, the district court in <em>Frye </em>dealt with a statute creating a policemen\u2019s and firemen\u2019s relief fund which the court described as providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-9\">(1) a system for the compensation of policemen and firemen who have been disabled through injury received or disease contracted in line of duty in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act; and (2) a system for voluntary retirement of policemen and firemen who have served not less than 25 years and have reached the age of 55, and the involuntary retirement of policemen and firemen who have reached the age of 60____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-10\"><em>Frye, </em>72 F.Supp. at 408. Faced with this dual-purpose statute, the district court made the determination that benefits were awarded under the first part of the statute and therefore exempt from taxation. <em>Id. </em>at 409. Here, however, \u00a7 372(a) makes no distinction between payments for work-related and non-work-related disabilities and therefore it is not a dualrpurpose statute. <em>Accord Take, </em>804 F.2d at 557. No inquiry into the nature of the injury is thus required.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>Our interpretation of \u00a7 104, and the trial court\u2019s, is consistent with the general rule that all income is taxable unless specifically excluded from gross income. Disability retirement income under \u00a7 372(a) is nowhere specifically excluded from gross income; in particular, it is not excluded under \u00a7 104(a)(1) because \u00a7 372(a) is not a workmen\u2019s compensation act. Moreover, the statute is no more \u201cin the nature of\u2019 a workmen\u2019s compensation act than it is a workmen\u2019s compensation act <em>per se. </em>We thus conclude that disability retirement pay under \u00a7 372(a) is not excludable from gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Added support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion is provided by the further sentence in Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.104-l(b) which states that \u201csection 104(a)(1) does not apply to a retirement pension or annuity to the extent that it is determined by reference to the employee\u2019s age or length of service, ... even though the employee\u2019s retirement is occasioned by an occupation injury or sickness.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.104-1. It is clear that disability retirement under \u00a7 372(a), even if \u201coccasioned by an occupation injury or sickness,\u201d provides a pension determined by length of service. Thus, \u00a7 372(a) awards a retirement pension or annuity not excludable under \u00a7 104(a)(1), rather than excludable workmen\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">We therefore hold that disability retirement payments received under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(a) are not excludable from gross income pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1) because \u00a7 372(a) is neither a workmen\u2019s compensation act nor is it \u201cin the nature of\u2019 a workmen\u2019s compensation act. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-7\">. The government does not contest Kane\u2019s entitlement to retire under the provisions of this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b993-8\">. Although the 1989 claim involves the same central issue as the 1988 claim, the United States asserted an offset to the 1989 claim. Therefore, the United States moved to dismiss only the 1988 claim. <em>Kane, </em>28 Fed.Cl. at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b993-19\">.
