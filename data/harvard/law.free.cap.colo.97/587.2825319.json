Edwin C. Johnson, has inquired whether the act approved April 4, 1935 (c. 118, Session Laws, 1935), is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The Governor\u2019s concern grows out of the fact that certain merchants of Colorado, advised that the act in question contravened their constitutional right to conduct restaurants, and anticipating its effective date, filed their bill of complaint in the United States District Court of Colorado, against the Governor and Attorney General, and the State Board of Health, seeking to enjoin its enforcement. Thereupon, as the practice is, a three-judge federal court was convened to consider the matter. On hearing, one judge dissenting, the court issued its temporary restraining order. At this point the Governor made his appeal to us, and since the record indicates that pending our construction of the act the federal court is withholding its further consideration, we have resolved that the question is important and the occasion solemn.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The Attorney General and members of his staff, as well as voluntary private counsel, maintain that the measure is constitutional, while counsel for the merchants in the federal court, appearing here at our request, argue contra.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The legislative enactment is entitled: \u201cAn act relating to foods; to provide for the public health and safety by licensing* places where food is prepared for human consumption, to be consumed on the premises, providing regulations, restrictions and conditions under which food may be prepared and sold for consumption therein; providing for the administration, disposition of funds, and penalties for the violation of the provisions of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">The sections of the act important to our examination, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cSection 1. <em>Ptorpose. </em>The control and regulation of premises or places wherein food is prepared and sold or served for consumption on such premises; the establishment of standards of purity for foods; and the enforcement of sanitary safeguards imposed upon food handlers, being necessary, this Act shall be deemed an exercise of the police powers of the State for the protection of the social welfare and the health of the people of the State of Colorado.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201cSection 2. <em>Definitions. </em>As used in this Act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201c(a) \u2018Person\u2019 shall mean natural person, partnership, co-partnership, association, company, corporation, organization, or manager, agent, servant, officer or employee of any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201c(b) \u2018Food\u2019 shall mean any substance used, or intended to be used, for human consumption, when the same is prepared for consumption to be consumed upon the premises where sold, which, among other things, shall include all meat, fish, vegetables, bread and condiments, whether simple, mixed or compounded, but shall not include soft drinks, ice cream or ices, and confections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">\u201c(c) \u2018Bestaurant\u2019 shall mean an establishment pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>vided with, special space and accommodations wherein, in consideration of payment, meals are habitually furnished to guests, or a place where food is prepared for human consumption to be consumed upon the premises, and whose principal business is the sale of meals, and in which room nothing\u2019 is sold excepting meals, food, drink and tobaccos.

The Board may refuse a license for failure to comply with the sanitary code, or other rules and regulations, or, if in its opinion, the premises on which the applicant conducts or proposes to conduct his business do not meet the requirements of this Act.

Does Chapter 118, Session Laws of 1935, when properly construed, prevent a person whose principal business is merchandising, or that other than operating a restaurant, from also engaging in the restaurant business?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">2. Does said act, properly construed, permit a dry goods house to go into the restaurant business although it maintained the restaurant in a separate room if the dry goods business would be considered its principal business?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">3. Could a dry goods house, or other mercantile concern, operate or conduct a restaurant in a separate room or space suitably partitioned off from the rest of its establishment but with a connecting door or doors, without violating said act?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">4. Does said act or any portion thereof, properly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>strued, violate either section 3 of article II, or section 15 of article II, or section 25 of article II, of the Constitution of the State of Colorado?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">5. Does said act, properly construed, violate any other provision of the Constitution of the State of Colorado?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">6. Does said act, when properly construed, violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">It is urged that the act violates the Constitution in the following particulars: (1) That it denies equal protection of the law; (2) that it takes property without compensation; (3) that it denies the use of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The measure under consideration is based on legislative finding that the preparation and service of meals in the same room where the sale of merchandise is actively carried on, is inimical to the public health. Police power, the genesis of the General Assembly\u2019s action, is inherent in government, and was well known to the common law. <em>4 </em>Blackstone\u2019s Comm. 162. \u201cThis power * * * has been said to be as broad as the public welfare. It is an inherent attribute of sovereignty with which the state is endowed for the protection and general welfare of its citizens, <em>* </em>* <em>Rowekamp v. Mercantile-Commerce B. &amp; T. Co., </em>72 F. (2d) 852, 858 (Circuit Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit). \u201cAll authorities agree that the Constitution presupposes the existence of the police power, and is to be construed with reference to that fact.\u201d <em>Village of Carthage v. Frederick, </em>122 N. Y. 268, 273, 19 Am. S. R. 490, 10 L. R. A. 178. The statute claimiug our attention is the expression of that branch of the government having primary authority to determine what is requisite to promote and preserve health, safety and morals. <em>Smith v. People, </em>51 Colo. 270, 117 Pac. 612; II Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) p. 1231. Unless by its terms it imports evil, or is calculated to operate arbitrarily, oppressively or unreasonably, courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>may not void the act. <em>McLean v. Arkansas, </em>211 U. S. 539, 29 Sup. Ct. 206, 53 L. Ed. 315. That in its operation a police measure may increase their labor, decrease the value of their property, or otherwise inconvenience individuals, does not make the act to offend. II Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) pp. 1228, 1231. By exercise of inherent police power, the sovereign, purposing to promote public health, may fairly and reasonably restrict the use of property. <em>Beveridge v. Harper &amp; Turner Oil Tr. Co., </em>168 Okl. 609, 35 P. (2d) 435. The unrestricted privilege to engage in business or to conduct it as one pleases, is not guaranteed by the Constitution. <em>Nebbia v. New York, </em>291 U. S. 502. <em>\u201cA </em>large discretion is necessarily vested in the legislature, to determine not only what the interests of the public require, but what measures are necessary for the protection of such interests. \u201d II Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) p. 1231. \u201cWhen the subject lies within the power of the state, debatable questions as to reasonableness are not for the courts but for the legislature, which is entitled to form its own judgment, and its action within its range of discretion cannot be set aside because compliance is burdensome.\u201d <em>Sproles v. Binford, </em>286 U. S. 374, 52 Sup. Ct. 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Referring to the contention that the act is discriminatory and void, because it excepts hotels, dining cars, private boarding houses, and the like, from its operation, we think the clause is but declaratory of the obvious. None of the activities mentioned in the exception come within the act\u2019s definition of a restaurant. Besides, the power to legislate on the subject is not to be'denied altogether because the law does not embrace \u201cthe whole field of possible abuses.\u201d <em>Farmers and Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank, </em>262 U. S. 649, 43 Sup. Ct. 651. See, also, <em>Miller v. Wilson, </em>236 U. S. 373, 383, 35 Sup. Ct. 342; <em>Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., </em>199 U. S. 401, 26 Sup. Ct. 66; <em>Consumer\u2019s League v. Colorado &amp; So. Ry. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Co., </em>53 Colo. 54, 125 Pac. 577; <em>Driverless Car Co. v. Armstrong, </em>91 Colo. 334, 14 P. (2d) 1098. The legislature \u201cis free to recognize degrees of harm, and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be clearest.\u201d <em>Miller v. Wilson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We think the act comes within the competency of the General Assembly, and that it does not violate the specific constitutional provisions, state or federal, to which the Governor has directed our attention. The major objective, as we perceive, premised on public health considerations, was to prevent the operation of a restaurant in a room where merchandising is carried on. It inhibits none, regardless of his other activities, or of what might be regarded as the principal one, from engaging in the restaurant business, but if he elects to be both merchant and restaurateur he must conduct the two businesses in separate rooms. It follows, if explanation be necessary, that questions 1, 4 and 6, we answer in the negative, and question 2, in the affirmative. We regard question 5 as too general to require an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Considering the variability of situations that may arise in the course of the administration of the act, we doubt the propriety of a categorical answer to question 3, and so withhold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Mr. Justice Burke and Mr. Justice Holland dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\n<em>On Petition for Modification.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b613-9\">Mr. Justice Hilliard.</author>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The Governor and his advisers urge that a more definite answer to interrogatory 3 is \u201cessential to the determination of this litigation, as contemplated by the federal court,\u201d and call our attention to what the judges of that court said in the cours\u00e9 of a hearing there. A fair summary of the view of the federal court is, that if reasonable means of physical communication between the rooms \u2014 the store and the restaurant \u2014 were to be af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>forded, it would be disposed to regard the law as constitutional; otherwise, as offending\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\">We still are of opinion that rather than to anything fundamental, the point emphasized goes to detail of administration, concerning which claimed abuse may have judicial consideration pursuant to section 6 of the act. It was our conception that the variant facts should enter into the determination of the administrative board and of the courts in their examination on review; and that was the sum of our previous answer to the question. But since the rule requires any reasonable construction that will support the validity of the act, in the interest of finality we now answer interrogatory 3 in the affirmative. It should be observed that departure from our earlier reticence finds justification in the assurance of the attorney general and other counsel advocating the constitutionality of the act, that no administrative objection is to be made to the employment of doors between merchandising and restaurant rooms.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b614-4\">Mr. Justice Holland</author>\n<p id=\"AYs\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I am unable to agree with the majority opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">As defined in the act, a restaurant is an establishment whose principal business is the sale of meals, and cannot be one which has any other principal business.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">I think the act is arbitrary and unreasonable, is a strained attempt to exercise the p\u00f3lice power and is unconstitutional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
