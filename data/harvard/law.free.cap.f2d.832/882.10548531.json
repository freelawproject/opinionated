In 1981, the United States had brought an eminent domain claim regarding a mineral interest in 5,507.-38 acres of land in Live Oak and McMullen Counties, Texas. A three-member commission heard the issue of just compensation for the taking of the mineral estate. The district court approved the findings of the commission and entered final judgment on March 19, 1986. Upon entry of the final judgment, the appellants applied for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to the Equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Access to Justice Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (EAJA). A \u201cplain meaning\u201d reading of the statute and the legislative history surrounding the act affirms the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in that the appellants were not the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Statutory guidance is clear. The EAJA provides that \u201ca court may award reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys ... to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b). Further, \u201cprevailing party\u201d with respect to the circumstances of this case is explicitly defined by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(H):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">[Prevailing party, in the case of <em>eminent domain proceedings, </em>means a party who obtains a final judgment (other than by settlement), exclusive of interest, the <em>amount </em>of which is <em>at least as close to the highest valuation of the property involved that is attested to at trial on behalf of the property owner as it is to the highest valuation of the property involved that is attested to at trial on behalf of the Government.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">(emphasis added). The legislature explained the formulation simply: \u201cIn other words, the prevailing party is the one whose testimony in court is closer to the award.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-120, Part 1, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 18, <em>reprinted in </em>1985 U.S. Cong. &amp; Ad.News 132, 147. When the commission\u2019s findings of value, which the district court adopted, are applied to this formulation, the prevailing party is the government and not the landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The following table presents the findings adopted by the district court that determine the question of prevailing party and ultimately the eligibility of the appellants for attorney\u2019s fees. The table summarizes the fair market values determined by the commission, contrasted with the values proposed by the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-10\">Appellee-Government Commissioner Appellant-Landowner</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYW\">Shallow Rights $ 165,221 $4,413,804 $16,375,800</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQYV\">Deep Rights $2,632,528 $2,767,458 $18,449,723</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azg\">Hard Minerals $ 55,070 $ 55,074 $ 1,849,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6g\">$2,852,819 $7,236,336 $36,674,523</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-22\"><em>See United States v. 5,507.38 Acres of Land, </em>643 F.Supp. 266 (1986). We have held that a \u201cdistrict court must [also] value the property as a whole rather than as the sum of the various uses to which it has been placed.\u201d <em>United States v. 8.41 Acres of Land, </em>680 F.2d 388, 395 (5th Cir.1982). Employing this unit rule of valuation, when the EAJA calls for a comparison of the parties\u2019 respective positions relative to \u201cthe amount\u201d awarded in a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(H), plain meaning indicates that the total valuation of the land is the relevant number to be considered when determining which is the prevailing party \u201cwhose testimon[ial position] in court is <em>closer </em>to <em>the award </em>(emphasis added).\u201d It is plain that the government is the one whose testimony is closer. Given these conditions, the appellant/landowners are not eligible under statutory guidelines to apply for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">The appellants, however, try to avoid this statutory guidance. They assert that a burden of proof that the fee award should not be made rests on the government. Further, they claim that this is a burden that the government cannot meet. The government bargained with the landowners in bad faith, it is said, and thus was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in its position denying attorney\u2019s fees to the landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-24\">This argument misreads the statute. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) provides that \u201ca court shall award to a prevailing party <em>other than the United States </em>fees and other expenses ... <em>unless </em>the court finds that the <em>position of the United States was substantially justified </em>or that special circumstances make an award unjust (emphasis added).\u201d A \u201cplain meaning\u201d reading of the statute indicates that this subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>applies only where it has been found that the private party \u201cprevailed\u201d under \u00a7 2412(b) and thereby made a prima facie case of entitlement to fees. Section 2412(d)(1)(A) then places the burden on the government to demonstrate that its position was substantially justified. <em>Herron v. Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 1127 (5th Cir.1986). Since the United States is the prevailing party in this case, however, there is no need for the government to prove that it was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
