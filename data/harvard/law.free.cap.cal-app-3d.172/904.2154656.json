The jury also found defendant used a firearm in the commission of the offenses (\u00a7 12022.5). After being sentenced to 16 years in state prison, defendant appeals, contending the trial court erred in: (1) refusing to grant his pretrial motion for change of venue; (2) refusing to permit him to introduce into evidence expurgated versions of third-party declarations against penal interest; (3) sentencing him pursuant to the sentencing scheme prescribed in section 213.5; (4) sentencing him to the upper term of robbery; and (5) imposing an aggregate term of imprisonment which exceeds that prescribed under section 1170.1. For the reasons expressed below, we will remand this case for a redetermination of defendant\u2019s sentence. In all other respects, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On February 15, 1983, at approximately 9:45 p.m., two intruders broke into the mobilehome of Mr. and Mrs. Hale. The two men had covered their faces so that only their eyes were exposed. One of the men, dressed in a plaid jacket, blue jeans, a wool ski mask, and boots, fired a shot at a pottery bowl in the home causing it to break. Mrs. Hale was hit on the head by one of the intruders and knocked to the floor; her hands and feet were tied together. While Mrs. Hale was face down on the floor, the intruder in the plaid jacket stuck a gun in her anus and threatened \u201cI\u2019ll blow you to pieces.\u201d Mr. Hale, who had been asleep at the time of the intrusion, was awakened, struck by one of the men, dragged into the living room, and tied up. One of the men asked Mr. Hale where his guns were kept; he then stuck a gun in Mr. Hale\u2019s mouth and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me I\u2019ll blow your fucking head off.\u201d After taking approximately $49,300 worth of cash and property from the home, the two men fled in the Hales\u2019 pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">At approximately 10:45 p.m. that same night, Tehama County Sheriff James Sulzer received information of the Hale robbery over his radio. Within a few minutes of receiving the call, he spotted a pickup matching the description of the Hales\u2019 truck. The officer activated his red light and began to follow the vehicle; the truck sped up, lost control as it made a turn, and went off into a ditch. When the officer reached the location of the pickup, he found the engine running, but no one was present. Two other officers arrived at the scene and assisted Officer Sulzer in a search of the nearby area. After following footprints across a muddy field,' the officers found defendant, wearing a plaid jacket, levis, and black boots, prone in the mud. Defendant was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Defendant was charged by information with two counts of violating section 211 (robbery) and two counts of violating section 245, subdivision (a)(2) (assault with a deadly weapon). The information also charged that, in the commission of the offenses, defendant used a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of all four counts charged in the information; the enhancement allegations were found to be true. Defendant was sentenced to state prison for the aggregate term of 16 years. The court imposed consecutive upper terms of six years each for counts one and two (\u00a7 211) plus two two-year terms for the firearm use allegations. (\u00a7 12022.5.) The court also imposed upper terms of four years each for counts three and four (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)) to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed for counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Defendant appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Defendant also asserts as error the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the admissibility of two third party declarations against penal interest. At trial, the prosecution filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent defense counsel from introducing portions of the extrajudicial statements of accomplices Travis Jordan and Michael Britt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jordan had confessed to the police that he, along with defendant and Britt, had robbed the Hales. Britt also made statements to the police to the effect that he, defendant, and Jordan had been involved in the robbery. Neither Jordan nor Britt was available to testify at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defense counsel stated his intent to introduce the statements, but only after excising any reference to defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant contended that the excised statements were offered to show that defendant did not enter the mobile-home and therefore did not personally use the gun as required by section 12022.5. The victims testified to there having been only two culprits in the mobilehome who were of a similar size. Defendant is apparently significantly larger than either Britt or Jordan. Therefore, according to defendant\u2019s theory, there were actually three participants in the robbery; defendant was the one who did not enter the home, and, therefore, he did not use a gun. However, defendant did not attempt to introduce any evidence of the fact that three individuals may have been involved; he merely attempted to admit the expurgated statements of Britt and Jordan. The trial court ruled that the statements were inadmissible in the form proposed by defendant and ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>served the statements would only be admitted in their complete form.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant did not introduce the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Defendant asserts that the court\u2019s ruling improperly denied him the opportunity to present evidence in his favor. We are unpersuaded by this argument. The amended statements, although hearsay, were admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule for declarations made against the penal interest of the declarant. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1201, 1230.) However, the trial court correctly concluded that the statements excised in the manner suggested by defendant would have been misleading to the jury. A court has discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability its admission would create substantial danger of misleading the jury. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) The admission of the excised statements would have led the jury to believe that the only two individuals involved in the robbery had already confessed. Because n\u00f3 evidence was introduced to support the theory that three individuals may have been involved, the statements as altered would have tended to completely exonerate defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to introduce the statements as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Defendant also claims the court committed various errors in sentencing.  Initially, defendant contends the trial court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the sentencing scheme of section 213.5. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Defendant was charged by information with \u201cwillfully, unlawfully, and by means of force and fear tak[ing] personal property from the person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>possession, and immediate presence\u201d of Mr. and Mrs. Hale in violation of section 211.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of robbery \u201cin violation of Section 211 of the California Penal Code, as charged in . . . the Information on file herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Section 213 provides in pertinent part that \u201cexcept as provided in sections 211a and 213.5, robbery is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or five years.\u201d At sentencing, the court found the offenses came within section 213.5. That section provides that \u201c[ejvery robbery perpetrated in an inhabited dwelling house or trailer coach as defined in the Vehicle Code is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for three, four, or six years.\u201d The court imposed the upper term of six years on each of the robbery counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Defendant contends the sentencing court was precluded from making a finding as to the applicability of section 213.5. Defendant argues that the trial court, by making the finding that the robbery occurred in an inhabited dwelling, was in effect imposing an enhancement. An enhancement must be properly pleaded and proved. (\u00a7 1170.1, subd. (f).) However, we cannot agree that section 213.5 specifies an enhancement. California Rules of Court, rule 405(c) defines \u201c[enhancement\u201d as \u201can additional term of imprisonment added to the base term. \u201d A base term is \u201cthe determinate prison term selected from among the three possible terms prescribed by statute ...\u201d (Rule 405(b).) \u201c[A]n enhancement does not define a crime or offense [citations] but merely fixes an additional penalty to be added to the selected base term. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Best </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 232, 236 [191 Cal.Rptr. 614].)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Because section 213.5 does not provide that an additional term of imprisonment be added to a base term, but rather establishes three possible base terms, it is not properly classified as an enhancement. Nor does the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>scheme purport to establish various degrees of robbery. In fact, the previously existing classification of robbery by degrees (see former \u00a7 211a (Stats. 1923, ch. 127, \u00a7 1) was abolished in 1976. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 137.5.) Section 213.5 was enacted in 1982. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1293, \u00a7 2.) Therefore, the statutory requirement of section 1157 that degrees be determined by the trier-of-fact is not applicable in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We conclude, however, that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant pursuant to section 213.5. Section 952 provides that \u201c[i]n charging an offense, each count shall contain, and shall be sufficient if it contains in substance, a statement that the accused has committed some public offense therein specified. . . . Such statement . . . may be in the words of the enactment describing the offense or declaring the matter to be a public offense, or in any words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offense of which he is accused.\u201d A jury, or a judge if a jury trial is waived, may find a defendant guilty of the offense charged, a necessarily included offense, or an attempt to commit such offense. (\u00a7 1159.) However, \u201c[a] person cannot be convicted of an offense (other than a necessarily included offense) not charged against him by indictment or information, whether or not there was evidence at his trial to show that he had committed that offense. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Hess </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 171, 174-175 [288 P.2d 5].) Under principles of due process a defendant is entitled to receive notice of the charges against him and the facts a prosecutor tends to prove. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 835, fn. 12 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736]; <em>In re Hess, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 171, 175; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ponds </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 665 [284 P.2d 793].) A fortiori, if a defendant cannot be convicted of an offense not charged, he cannot be sentenced for an uncharged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The question we address then is: With what <em>offense </em>was defendant charged? That question necessitates an inquiry into the statutory scheme codifying the offense of robbery. Robbery is defined in section 211 as \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d A conviction for robbery in violation of section 211 is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or five years. (\u00a7213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The Legislature, presumably determining that certain acts of robbery are more reprehensible than others, established separate statutory sections defining such aggravated acts and providing different penal sanctions. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>example, the Legislature provided that if a robbery is performed on a \u201cperson who is performing his duties as operator of any motor vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley used for the transportation of persons for hire,\u201d the offender may be punished by imprisonment in state prison for three, four, or six years. (\u00a7 211a.) A separate code section provides that \u201c[e]very robbery perpetrated in an inhabited dwelling house or trailer coach as defined in the Vehicle Code is punishable by imprisonment\u201d for three, four, or six years. (\u00a7 213.5.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus the base terms for a violation of section 211a or 213.5 are different from the base terms for a violation of section 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">By adding additional elements to the crime of robbery, i.e., the requirement that the offense occur in an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7213.5) or the requirement that the robbery be committed on an operator of a vehicle for hire (\u00a7 211a), and by providing separate base terms for such violations, the Legislature effectively established separate substantive crimes. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Best, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d 232 [rape committed in concert is a separate substantive crime from rape].) Thus, in order to be sentenced under section 213.5 or 211a, a defendant must be charged with that particular offense. (See <em>In re Hess, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 171, 175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In this case, the information did not charge defendant with perpetrating a robbery <em>in an inhabited dwelling or trailer coach. </em>Defendant was not informed that he would be required to controvert that fact. Furthermore, the finders of fact in this case\u2014the jury\u2014made no finding on that issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nor was defendant made aware of the potential punishment of three, four, or six years for such offense. The district attorney\u2019s decision to charge defendant with violation of section 211 without including any allegations to the effect that the offense came within section 213.5 precludes the prosecution from claiming the sentencing scheme prescribed in section 213.5 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The matter is remanded to the trial court for a redetermination of defendant\u2019s sentence consistent with this opinion.

On appeal, defendant asserts the former. In either case, the amended statements would exclude any reference to defendant and would have led the jury to believe that the two intruders had already confessed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">No attempt was made by either party to introduce the statements in their entirety. We note, however, that the trial court\u2019s gratuitous assertion that the statements were admissible in their entirety was erroneous. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 419, 441 [124 Cal.Rptr. 752, 541 P.2d 296], the court held that the declarations against interest exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230) is \u201c. . . inapplicable to evidence of any statement or portion of a statement not itself specifically disserving to the interests of the declarant.\u201d Consequently, the statements of Jordan and Britt were admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule only to the extent that they implicated the declarant. However, the court correctly concluded that the statements as altered would have been misleading to the jury. The proper characterization of the court\u2019s ruling is that it sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the introduction of the statements in the proposed form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Defendant contends he was placed in the position of making a choice between two constitutional rights, i.e., either admitting an out-of-court inculpatory statement without having the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant or foregoing his right to present a defense. However, we have previously concluded that it would have been error to admit the statements in their entirety. The only issue therefore is whether the court\u2019s ruling that the amended statements were inadmissible impermissibly precluded defendant from presenting a defense. We conclude it did not. The right to present a defense does not include the right to mislead the jury. \u201c[T]he prosecution as well as the defendant is entitled to the protection of the court from prejudicial evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arline </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 200, 205 [91 Cal.Rptr. 520].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The information alleged in pertinent part: \u201cGary Lester Beller accused by the District Attorney of the County of Tehama, State of California, by this information, of the crime of Robbery, 2 Counts, and Assault with a firearm, 2 counts, for a total of 4 counts, each a felony, in violation of Sections 211 and 245(a)(2) of the California Penal Code with 2 Special Allegations, committed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">\u201cCount I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">\u201cThe said Gary Lester Beller on or about the 15th day of February A.D., 1983 at and in the County of Tehama and State of California, and prior to the filing of this information did willfully, unlawfully, and by means of force and fear take personal property from the person, possession, and immediate presence of John Paul Hale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">\u201cCount II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">\u201cThe said Gary Lester Seller on or about the 15th day of February, 1983 and in the County of Tehama and State of California, and prior to the filing of this information did willfully, unlawfully, and by means of force and fear take personal property from the person, possession, and immediate presence of Argent Hale.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">We note that the Legislature distinguished <em>burglary </em>of an inhabited dwelling house or trailer coach from other kinds of burglary by establishing degrees of burglary.
