The issue before us is whether it appeared on the face of appellant\u2019s complaint that his action was barred by the \u201cfirefighter\u2019s rule.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that it did not; accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Appellant filed a complaint for damages in Alameda County Superior Court on September 27, 1982, naming as defendants American Commonwealth Associates, a limited partnership, Partap Kapoor, a general partner therein, and Does. Respondents demurred on the ground that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Specifically, they asserted that appellant\u2019s action was barred by the firefighter\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The trial court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer with leave to amend, but ultimately sustained a demurrer to a second amended complaint without leave to amend, stating only that the pleading \u201cshows on its face that the action is barred by the \u2018Fire[fighter]\u2019s Rule\u2019.\u201d Judgment of dismissal was entered, and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Appellant\u2019s second amended complaint, filed April 7, 1983, alleged the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Respondent American Commonwealth Associates is a limited partnership, and respondent Partap Kapoor is a general partner. Respondents \u201cconstructed, owned, operated, maintained and controlled\u201d a certain building in Berkeley which had a flat roof accessible from within the building. Respondents \u201cnegligently constructed, owned, operated, maintained and controlled said roof so as to create and permit an unguarded and concealed opening in the roof which was hazardous to anyone on the roof . . . .\u201d They \u201cknew of the opening and its hazard, but failed to warn [appellant] or anyone else of its presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Respondents were in violation of the Uniform Building Code of the City of Berkeley, which required guardrails around certain openings in roofs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>. . [A]s a proximate result thereof [appellant] fell through an unguarded opening in the roof of the aforesaid building causing injuries and damages</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On about November 17, 1981, appellant, \u201cwhile engaged in the course and scope of his employment as a fire[fighter], was on the roof of said building . . . unaware of the concealed opening and fell through it, causing him serious injuries and damages . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The complaint went on to specify certain injuries and expenses proximately resulting from the alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A81\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u201cOn appeal, the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating either that a demurrer was sustained erroneously or that sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend was an abuse of discretion. [Citation.] A trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining a demurrer is deemed erroneous where a plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. [Citations.] In assessing the sufficiency of a demurrer, all material facts pleaded in the complaint and those which arise by reasonable implication are deemed true. [Citations.]\u201d (Pol<em>lack </em>v. <em>Lytle </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 931, 939-940 [175 Cal.Rptr. 81].)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\n<em>The Firefighter\u2019s Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The rule and its rationale have been stated in a number of ways, which may be accurately summarized as follows: A firefighter who is injured fighting a fire is barred from bringing a tort action against a person for causing the fire. (E.g., <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Sloan </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 199, 202 [142 Cal.Rptr. 152, 571 P.2d 609].) This rule, now extended to police officers, is based upon \u201c(1) the traditional principle that \u2018one who has knowingly and voluntarily confronted a hazard cannot recover for injuries sustained thereby [assumption of risk],\u2019 [citation], and (2) a public policy to preclude tort recovery by fire[fighters] or police . . . [officers] who are presumably adequately compensated (in special salary, retirement, and disability benefits) for undertaking their hazardous work [citation].\u201d <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Boelt </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 480, 484 [169 Cal.Rptr. 706, 620 P.2d 156]; see generally Comment, <em>The Firefighter] \u2019s Rule: Defining Its Scope using the Cost-Spreading Rationale </em>(1983) 71 Cal.L.Rev. 218 [hereafter <em>Comment].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Use of the rule to bar causes of action has been strictly limited. It \u201cwas not intended to bar recovery for independent acts of misconduct which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>were not the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s presence at the . . . scene. (See, e.g., <em>Kocan </em>v. <em>Garino </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 291, 295-296 . . . .)\u201d <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Boelt, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 486.) The rule \u201chas not been applied in California to negligence other than that which started the fire.\u201d <em>(Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Klingler Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 975, 979 [126 Cal.Rptr. 191].)  \u201cThus, for example, although a landowner incurs no liability simply for negligently starting a fire, such a defendant has generally been held liable if, after a fire[fighter] arrives, the owner negligently fails to advise the fireffighter] of some special danger on the property which ultimately causes the officer\u2019s injury. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Boelt, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 487, 488 (dis. opn. \u00f3f Tobriner, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\n<em>Decisions Applying the Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Sloan, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 199, defendants permitted their 16-year-old daughter to host a party where she provided alcohol and drugs to minors. When disorder developed, plaintiff police officer responded to the scene, where he was injured while attempting to arrest one of the guests. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 201-202.) The court stated, \u201cIt is unnecessary to attempt to separate the legal theories [of the firefighter\u2019s rule] or to catalog their limitations. The rule finds its clearest application in situations like that before us\u2014a person who, fully aware of the hazard created by the defendant\u2019s negligence, voluntarily confronts the risk for compensation.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 204.) The fact that defendants\u2019 negligence constituted a statutory violation did not change this result, since the negligence of serving alcohol to minors was the same negligence which occasioned the summoning of the officer. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 206-207.) The court affirmed a judgment of dismissal after sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 201, 207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Similarly, the court affirmed dismissal after granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Boelt, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 480, where plaintiff police officer was injured during a high speed chase of defendant, who was a reckless traffic offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>Decisions Refusing to Apply the Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><em>Lipson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 362 [182 Cal.Rptr. 629, 644 P.2d 822], our Supreme Court\u2019s most recent decision on the firefighter\u2019s rule, provides an extreme example of facts outside the rule. There plaintiff firefighter alleged that he responded to a chemical boilover at defendants\u2019 plant. When he arrived, defendants informed him that the boilover did not involve toxic chemicals or materials and that there would be no danger in attempting to contain it. These were intentional or negligent misrepresen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tations; the boilover did involve toxic substances, and plaintiff was injured from exposure to them. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 365.) The court upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. (Id., at pp. 366, 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The essence of the ruling was a reaffirmation of these basic principles: \u201c. . . [T]he fire[fighter]\u2019s rule only bars a firefighter from recovering for injuries resulting from a person\u2019s negligence or recklessness in causing the fire or other emergency which is the reason for the fire[fighter]\u2019s presence.\u201d (I<em>d., </em>at p. 366.) It does \u201c' . . . not deal with . . . situations in which there is some hidden danger known to the defendant but not to the fire[fighter], nor situations in which the fire[fighter] is injured as a result of some risk beyond those inevitably involved in firefighting. Neither [does it] deal with those situations in which the defendant\u2019s negligence occurred after the fire[fighter] arrived on the scene and materially enhanced the risk of harm or created a new risk of harm. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 367, quoting <em>Scott </em>v. <em>E. L. Yeager Constr. Co. </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 1190 [91 Cal.Rptr. 232] [firefighter responded to ruptured gas main, gas ignited, recovery for injury based on defendant\u2019s negligence in rupturing gas main reversed].)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The <em>Lipson </em>court further defined the limits of the rule: \u201cIt is . . . unmistakably clear that in California, the fire[fighter]\u2019s rule has never been construed as shielding a defendant from liability for acts of misconduct which are independent from those which necessitated the summoning of the fire[fighter]. <em>(Kocan </em>v. <em>Garino </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 291 . . .; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Klingler Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 975, 979 . . . .) The rule has <em>only </em>been applied to prohibit a fire[fighter] from recovering for injuries caused by the very misconduct which created the risk which necessitated his [or her] presence.4\u201d In its footnote 4 at this point, the court stated, in part: \u201cA review of the California court decisions which have applied the fire[fighter]\u2019s rule finds no exceptions to this statement. ...\u201d <em>(Lipson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 369, fn. 4 and accompanying text, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Of particular relevance to the case at bench is the <em>Lipson </em>court\u2019s statement, \u201cThe type of deception most frequently confronted by the courts has been the failure of a landowner or occupier to warn a fire[fighter] of a known, hidden danger on the premises. Virtually all jurisdictions that have considered this factual situation have allowed recovery where the failure to warn ultimately resulted in an injury to the firefighter. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Two Court of Appeal decisions cited by <em>Lipson </em>with approval further illustrate the point. In <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Klingler Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 975, the court reversed a judgment dismissing plaintiff deputy sheriff\u2019s ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tion for damages which occurred when he responded to a silent burglar alarm and, while searching the premises, fell through a defective ceiling. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff \u201centered upon defendant\u2019s property in the line of his official duty, that a known concealed defect existed on the premises, and that defendant failed to warn him of the danger despite the opportunity to do so.\u201d (Id., at p. 979.) The court held that the firefighter\u2019s rule did not bar liability on these facts and that the question of reasonableness of defendant\u2019s conduct should be determined by the trier of fact. (Id., at p. 981.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In <em>Kocan </em>v. <em>Garino </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 291 [165 Cal.Rptr. 712], plaintiff police officer alleged that while he was in hot pursuit of a felony suspect he entered defendant\u2019s backyard and was injured when he continued the pursuit over a fence which gave way due to its dilapidated and unsafe condition. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 292.) The court held that defendant\u2019s \u201cnegligence, if such there were, in no wise created the risk which was the cause of appellant\u2019s presence on the property nor could it have provided, within the ambit of the fire[fighter]\u2019s rule, any occasion for [plaintiff\u2019s] engagement at the time, which was instead a result of wholly independent factors not involving [defendant].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 295-296; see also <em>Rose </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 883 [206 Cal.Rptr. 49] [reversing summary judgment for defendant who allegedly shot fellow officer on street in front of narcotics suspect\u2019s apartment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Application of the Firefighter\u2019s Rule to This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The above cases illustrate the present state of the California case law oh the firefighter\u2019s rule. When the principles developed there are applied to the case at bench, we must conclude that the trial court should not have denied appellant his day in court. Having an unguarded hole in the roof was not the cause of appellant\u2019s presence at the scene, and the firefighter\u2019s rule lias never been applied to negligence which did not cause the fire. <em>(Hubbard </em>v. <em>Boelt, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 486; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Klingler Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at p. 979.) Furthermore, application of the rule has been consistently denied where plaintiffs have alleged negligent failure to warn of a hidden known danger, as does appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">It must be emphasized, as has been done in many of the cases, that our decision does not establish liability; it merely permits plaintiff to place his case before the trier of fact. \u201cAccordingly, while it may yet be the case that liability will not be established in any event (see <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108 . . .), its absence will not depend upon the fire[fighter]\u2019s rule, but rather upon those considerations which generally govern the relationship between possessors of real property and those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>are injured on it.\u201d <em>(Kocan </em>v. <em>Garino, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.3d at p. 296; for discussion of <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>as it relates to the firefighter\u2019s rule, see <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Klingler Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at p. 980, fn. 2 and accompanying text; <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Sloan, supra, 20 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 204; 207, 211, 216, fn. 5 (dis. opn. of Tobriner, Acting C. J.); <em>Comment, supra, </em>71 Cal.L.Rev. at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In light of our holding that the firefighter\u2019s rule as developed by the courts of this state does not bar appellant\u2019s cause of action, we need not reach the question of retroactivity <em>vel non </em>of legislation which very strictly limits application of the rule. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714.9, added by Stats. 1982, ch. 258, \u00a7 1, p. 836.) We note that under the statute appellant\u2019s cause of action is not barred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Scott, Acting P.
