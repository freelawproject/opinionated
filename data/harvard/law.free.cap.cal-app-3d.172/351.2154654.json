We conclude that applicant is excluded from the protection of the workers\u2019 compensation law by the provisions of Labor Code sections 3351, subdivision (d), and 3352, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Applicant, a 72-year-old carpenter and handyman, sustained injuries to his back when he fell off a roof while removing a tree limb from the roof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of the garage of Mrs. Stewart. Mrs. Stewart, age 85, has been living on an 85-acre parcel of land in an isolated rural section of Point Reyes for the past 35 years. After her husband died, she converted a portion of her home into an apartment and rented it to a tenant, primarily because she wanted a man about the property. She receives $150 a month in rental income. She derives no other income from the property and has engaged in no trade, business, or occupation since the 1930\u2019s. Over the past 20 years, Mrs. Stewart has employed applicant to do odd jobs around the residence, such as painting, raking leaves, carpentry, and other handyman chores. She paid him $7 per hour, and the income supplemented applicant\u2019s social security pension. On December 27, 1982, she asked applicant to remove an oak branch which had fallen on the roof of her garage. In the course of removing the branch, he slipped on some moss and fell off the roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">When applicant filed his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, employer raised the affirmative defenses of sections 3351, subdivision (d), and 3352, subdivision (h). After a hearing on the matter, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) found that applicant had sustained the injury, but that he was a casual employee on that date and excluded from coverage. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) granted reconsideration. In rescinding the findings and award, the Board found applicant to be a covered employee, reasoning that because Mrs. Stewart derived income from rental of a part of her residence, \u201capplicant\u2019s job of fixing the garage roof was in the course of Mrs. Stewart\u2019s business of renting part of her property, including the garage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Section 3351, in pertinent part, provides: \u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 means every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, and includes: ... [1] (d) <em>Except as provided in subdivision (h) of Section 3352, </em>any person employed by the owner or occupant of a residential dwelling whose duties are incidental to the ownership, maintenance, or use of the dwelling, including the care and supervision of children, or whose duties are personal and not in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of such owner or occupant.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Section 3352, in pertinent part, provides: \u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 <em>excludes: </em>... [1] (h) Any person defined in subdivision (d) of Section 3351 who was employed by the employer to be held liable for less than 52 hours during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the injury for injuries as defined in Section 5411 or during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the last employment in an occupation exposing the employee to the hazards of such disease or injury for injuries as defined in Section 5412, <em>or </em>who earned less than one hundred dollars ($100) in wages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>from such employer during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the injury for injuries as defined in Section 5411 or during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the last employment in an occupation exposing the employee to the hazards of such disease or injury for injuries as defined in Section 5412.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The facts are undisputed that an employment relationship existed and that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment. Accordingly, whether applicant was within a covered employment relationship is a question of law. <em>(In-Home Supportive Services </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 720, 729 [199 Cal.Rptr. 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">As used in subdivision (d) of section 3351, the term \u201ccourse of the trade, business, profession or occupation\u201d includes \u201call services tending toward the preservation, maintenance, or operation of the business, business premises, or business property of the employer.\u201d (\u00a7 3355.) As used in subdivision (d) of section 3351 and in section 3355, the term \u201ctrade, business, profession, or occupation\u201d includes \u201cany undertaking actually engaged in by the employer with some degree of regularity irrespective of the trade name, articles of incorporation, or principal business of the employer.\u201d (\u00a7 3356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">If the work in question was actually performed in the course of Mrs. Stewart\u2019s business, liability for compensation would attach under the general provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law. (\u00a7\u00a7 3351, 3600; 1 Herlick, Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (3d ed. 1985) \u00a7 2.16, p. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Petitioners point to case law which appears to \u201c carve[] out an exception to this broad principle.\u201d (1 Herlick, <em>supra, </em>Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (3d ed. 1985) \u00a7 2.3, p. 24.) These cases hold that the ownership and rental of a house by an individual for the purpose of supplemental income, when such owner has no particular or principal business, is not a business within the contemplation of the act. <em>(Lauzier </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1919) 43 Cal.App. 725, 728 [185 P. 870].) <em>Lauzier </em>was followed in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1921) 53 Cal.App. 542 [200 P. 667], the court holding at page 545: \u201c[W]here an individual invests his money in a house or houses which as owner he lets for profit, and at irregular times when demanded has labor performed in the repair thereof, he is not engaged in the prosecution of a trade or business within the meaning of the act and upon which a charge as compensation for injury sustained by an employee casually engaged in doing such work can be imposed. <em>(Miller &amp; Lux Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>[1919] 179 Cal. 764.)\u201d To the same effect, see <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1933) 129 Cal.App. 447, 449 [18 P.2d 979]; see also <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Department of Indus. Relations </em>(1930) 208 Cal. 633, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>639 [284 P. 212]; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Cal. Dept. of Employment </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 829, 833 [14 Cal.Rptr. 589].</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The Board\u2019s finding is in conflict with the foregoing authority, which, although of ancient vintage, has not been overruled. Unless that authority is no longer viable, it must be followed by the Board and by this court. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) We hold that the cited authority is applicable under the circumstances of this case, and that Mrs. Stewart, in renting a portion of her residence to a tenant, was not engaged in a trade, business, occupation or profession within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Since the Board found that applicant was a covered employee by reason of the fact that Mrs. Stewart was engaged in a business, the Board did not consider whether applicant was excluded from coverage under the provisions of section 3352, subdivision (h). The WCJ had determined, however, that the applicant was so excluded because he worked less than 52 hours within the 90 days immediately prior to the injury. Applicant contends that since he earned more than $100 in the 90-day period immediately preceding the injury, he is not an excluded employee. The determination of this matter rests upon the interpretation of the language of the statute. This court is directed to \u201cliberally construe\u201d the statutes \u201cwith the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d (\u00a7 3202.) In the solution of a problem such as this, our inquiry must be: \u201cIs the employment <em>unmistakably excluded </em>by the terms of the act?\u201d <em>(In-Home Supportive Services </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 720, 733, internal quotation marks omitted [italics in original].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The parties have cited no appellate authority on the question whether a person who earned <em>more </em>than $100 but who worked <em>less </em>than 52 hours during the 90 calendar days preceding the injury is excluded from coverage. The Board, however, has addressed the issue in <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>Nichols and Allstate Insurance Company </em>(1978) 43 Cal.Comp.Cases 1137. Fulton had been paid a total of $164 but had worked only 22 hours in the preceding 90 days. The Board, in an en banc opinion, concluded that \u201c[b]ecause applicant was employed ... \u2018for less than 52 hours during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of injury,\u2019 he is excluded from the definition of employee and from the benefits of the act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1138; see also 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d ed. 1985 rev.) \u00a7 5.01 [1] [k]; 1 Herlick, Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.16; Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 1985) \u00a7 3.10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The burden of proof rests on the employer to establish that an injured person is excluded from the protection of the act. (\u00a7 5705, subd. (a).) Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>as in <em>Fulton, supra, </em>43 Cal.Comp.Cases 1137, it is undisputed that applicant worked less than 52 hours during the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the date of injury. We conclude that because applicant did not work the number of hours specified by the Legislature, he was excluded from the protection of the act by the provisions of sections 3351, subdivision (d), and 3352, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The decision of the Board is annulled, and the matter is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Poch\u00e9, Acting P. J., and Sabraw, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The petition of respondent Porter for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 30, 1985. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\">All section references arc to the Labor Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
