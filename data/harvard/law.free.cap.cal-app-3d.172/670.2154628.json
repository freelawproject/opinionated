Code, \u00a7 207),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> felony false imprisonment (\u00a7 236) and misdemeanor battery (\u00a7 242). After a court trial he was convicted of felony false imprisonment and misdemeanor battery. On appeal he alleges <em>Bunnell </em>error,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> improper waiver of jury trial, insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction of felony false imprisonment, ineffective assistance of counsel, and improper venue for trial of the battery offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Am1\">I. <em>Bunnell Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">At the pretrial conference defense counsel informed the court that appellant wished to waive jury trial and have the matter set for court trial. The court asked appellant if he understood the difference between court trials and jury trials and accepted his waiver of a jury trial. Defense counsel then stated that \u201cMr. Phillips has indicated he is willing to submit it on the basis of the preliminary hearing transcript plus any additional evidence either side wishes to produce, with the understanding that the complaining witness would be present for the trial.\u201d The court responded, \u201cRight. The district attorney would see that she is here, and either one of you would have the option of calling her at that time.\u201d The court then explained to appellant that the preliminary hearing transcript would be admitted in evidence, and that \u201c[ajssuming nobody called any other witnesses, in essence what you would be doing is waiving your right to have the witnesses personally present, testify under oath so that you could question them.\u201d In response to appellant\u2019s inquiry, \u201cYou mean the main witness?\u201d the court replied, \u201cThe understanding is she is going to be here and either of you can call her. Both of you may decide not to call her. [\u00b6] We will proceed with the assumption that the transcript will be admitted in evidence and each of you can call whatever witnesses you want, including her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in permitting him to submit his case on the preliminary hearing transcript without complying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>with the rules set forth in <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 592. We have concluded, however, that appellant\u2019s premise that there was a <em>Bunnell </em>submission in this case is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In <em>Bunnell </em>the Supreme Court stated: \u201cA defendant who submits his case for decision on the basis of the transcript of the preliminary examination agrees that the transcript may be considered <em>in lieu of </em>the personal testimony of the witnesses who appeared at the preliminary hearing.\u201d (13 Cal.3d at p. 602, italics added.) In so doing the defendant surrenders his constitutional rights to trial by jury, to confront and cross-examine his accusers, and to freedom from compulsory self-incrimination. <em>(Id.., </em>at pp. 603, 605. See also <em>In re Mosley </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 913, 924-926 and fn. 10 [83 Cal.Rptr. 809, 464 P.2d 473].) Consequently, \u201c[I]n order to give maximum assurance that defendants are fully aware of the significant rights that they surrender in any submission and of the possible consequences thereof, such defendants shall be fully advised of these rights and consequences and ... the record shall reflect such advice, waivers, and acknowledgment by the defendant of his understanding of these consequences in all submissions.\u201d <em>(Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Here appellant\u2019s waiver of jury trial was not a consequence of his stipulation to admission of the preliminary hearing transcript, but preceded it. His waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination likewise was effected not by the stipulation, but rather, by his voluntarily taking the stand to testify in his own behalf. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingram </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 722, 727 [131 Cal.Rptr. 752]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 862, 867 [118 Cal.Rptr. 226].) Nor did appellant surrender his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine his accusers. To the contrary, he insisted that Patricia be present at trial. Patricia was present at trial, she testified, and she was extensively cross-examined. The dual purpose of the confrontation clause\u2014to expose the witness to the probe of cross-examination and to weigh the demeanor of the witness <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 63-64 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 605-607, 100 S.Ct. 2531]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stritzinger </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 505, 515 [194 Cal.Rptr. 431, 668 P.2d 738]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Winson </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 711, 717 [175 Cal.Rptr. 621, 631 P.2d 55])\u2014was thus achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Appellant\u2019s asserted \u201cagreement to submit the case on the transcript of the preliminary examination\u201d was, in the circumstances of this case, no more than a stipulation that the prosecuting witness\u2019s former testimony, otherwise excludable as hearsay (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1291), would be admissible at trial\u2014admissible not <em>in lieu </em>of her trial testimony, but <em>in addition </em>to such other testimony of hers as the prosecution or the defense should choose to elicit. Insofar as the agreement meant that Patricia was not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>quired to repeat her direct examination testimony, as appellant complains, counsel\u2019s determination to forego reexamination of Patricia on matters previously covered was a \u201ctactical decision.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 894, 905 [88 Cal.Rptr. 208, 471 P.2d 1008]; <em>In re Mosley, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 924; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 306, 316 [96 Cal.Rptr. 813].) That the decision was not unreasonable is suggested by appellant\u2019s acquittal of the kidnaping charge. Having agreed to the admission of the hearsay evidence, appellant cannot complain of its admission on appeal. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 353; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Manning </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 159, 168-169 [183 Cal.Rptr. 727] [parties\u2019 stipulation precluded appealable ruling].)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Because appellant\u2019s case was not \u201csubmitted on the transcript\u201d within the meaning of <em>Bunnell, </em>the court did not err in failing to give the advisements and take the waivers required by <em>Bunnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">II. <em>Jury Waiver</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Anderson, P.
