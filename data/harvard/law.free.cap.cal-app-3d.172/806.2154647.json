Code, \u00a7 11350) and was sentenced to a middle term of two years in prison. Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court reversibly erred in failing to dismiss the case against appellant when appellant was not given a preliminary hearing within the 10-day period prescribed by Penal Code section 859b. We conclude that this issue is not cognizable on an appeal from a judgment of conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere and we thus affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">On January 24, 1985, appellant was arraigned in municipal court on a complaint charging him with one count of possession of heroin, two counts of receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496), and a special allegation of having suffered a prior conviction within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5. The preliminary hearing, originally set for February 6, 1985, was trailed to February 7. Over appellant\u2019s objection on February 7, the preliminary examination was continued to February 13 due to the unavailability of a prosecution witness. The only showing that the witness was unavailable for medical reasons consisted of the prosecutor\u2019s oral representations to the court. During this time appellant remained in custody on the complaint because of a parole hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">On February 8, 1985, appellant filed in municipal court a motion to dismiss pursuant to Penal Code section 859b, contending that the preliminary hearing had been continued beyond the statutory 10-day period without a showing of good cause. The motion to dismiss was denied. Appellant then filed in superior court a petition for an alternative writ of mandate and/or prohibition. The superior court vacated the order granting the continuance and denying the motion to dismiss; it ordered the municipal court to consider further evidence and to exercise its discretion as to granting section 859b relief. Pursuant to the peremptory writ of mandate, the municipal court viewed written declarations from the prosecutor and the witness; it deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>mined that good cause had existed at the time the continuance of the preliminary hearing was originally ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Appellant then entered his plea of nolo contendere in municipal court to the heroin possession count; the other charges were dismissed, and it was agreed that appellant would serve no more than two years in state prison, the time to run concurrently with a sentence for a parole violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Appellant filed a timely application for a certificate of probable cause on the grounds that his rights under Penal Code section 859b had been violated due to the continuance of the preliminary hearing. The superior court issued a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Appellant attacks the ruling of the superior court in the separate mandamus and prohibition proceeding in which the court declined to order dismissal of the criminal proceedings and directed the municipal court to exercise its discretion regarding the continuance and dismissal. Respondent counters that this issue is not cognizable on this appeal because appellant failed to appeal the superior court\u2019s ruling to the Court of Appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and failed to seek extraordinary relief after the municipal court subsequently declined to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We conclude that the question of whether or not the municipal court should have dismissed the case pursuant to Penal Code section 859b is not cognizable on an appeal from a judgment entered pursuant to a plea of nolo contendere.  Issues cognizable on appeal following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere are limited to issues based on reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings resulting in the plea. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1016, 1237.5.) Obtaining a certificate of probable cause does not make cognizable those issues which have been waived by a plea of guilty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kaanehe </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 1, 9 [136 Cal.Rptr. 409, 559 P.2d 1028].) Other than search and seizure issues which are specifically made reviewable by statute, all errors arising prior to entry of a guilty plea are waived except those which question the jurisdiction or legality of the proceedings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>A close analogy to Penal Code section 859b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is found in Penal Code section 1382, which mandates dismissal of an action when a defendant is not brought to trial in superior court within 60 days after the filing of an information.  It is established that the statutory speedy trial right does not go to the legality of the proceedings, and thus errors regarding its implementation are not cognizable on appeal from a judgment of conviction resting upon a guilty plea. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Draughon </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 471, 473-474 [164 Cal.Rptr. 440]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayton </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 413, 418 [156 Cal.Rptr. 426].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   The statutory rights embodied in section 859b are not grounds going to the legality of the proceedings within the meaning of Penal Code section 1237.5. The fact that appellant procured a certificate of probable cause does not change this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We note that a purported right to appeal this question was not part of the consideration for appellant\u2019s plea. At the time of sentencing, appellant\u2019s new counsel informed the court that appellant was considering moving to withdraw his plea. The court gave appellant time to think the matter over, noting that conviction without a negotiated sentence was likely to result in an upper term due to appellant\u2019s record and his parole violation. After a recess, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court if it would be willing to sign a certificate of probable cause. Another defense attorney (from the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>defender\u2019s office) present in court recounted the circumstances of the case to the court and indicated uncertainty as to appellant\u2019s right to appeal if given a certificate of probable cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court stated that under the circumstances it would be willing to sign the certificate of probable cause. The court proceeded to sentence appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Appellant does not contend that this is a case in which a nolo contendere plea was entered or maintained in exchange for a purported right to appeal an issue which was not appealable. Rather, the record before this court shows that at the time of sentencing there was uncertainty as to whether or not the issue could be raised on appeal, and that sentencing proceeded because the court was willing to sign a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention not being cognizable on this appeal, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Before Brown (G.
