Applicant did not appear, and no testimony was presented, at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Consequently, the only evidence presented by applicant on the issue of industrial causation consisted of her own deposition testimony. She testified in substance that her regular workshift was 6:45 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., with an 11:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. lunch break. During her lunch break on Fridays, she customarily drove to a bank \u201cthree to four blocks away\u201d and cashed her paycheck. On Friday, July 15, 1983, about 11:30 a.m., she left her workplace, walked to her car which was parked in a parking lot maintained by Hughes on its premises for its employees, drove to the bank, cashed her check, and returned to the Hughes parking lot. When she \u201cpulled in\u201d the lot, a \u201cbiker\u201d simultaneously pulled in behind her, followed her to where she parked her car, and parked his motorcycle in a nearby stall. She sat in the car for a minute or two and sorted her money before putting it in her purse. Then she got out of the car and walked hurriedly toward the lot exit on the way to her work station. However, the biker grabbed her from behind, struck her, beat her down, took her purse and fled on his motorcycle. She \u201cstarted hollering\u201d when the assailant first grabbed her. Two other employees who were in the lot and able to hear her \u201cwere taking care of their own business\u201d and did not come to her aid. She inferred that the biker followed her from the bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Applicant testified further that the parking lot, as well as the intervening 100 yards between the lot and her work station, were part of Hughes prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>ises. The lot is close by the railroad tracks. There were \u201cno guards around\u201d when she was assaulted. Guards \u201care supposed to patrol the areas at all hours, but they were on their lunch hour, I guess.\u201d Hughes issues decals to the employees to park in certain sections of the lot, but no particular stalls are assigned. There is no special device to insert in an entrance gate; rather, \u201c[y]ou drive right in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">The WCJ, applying the special risk exception to the going and coming rule as enunciated in <em>General Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 595 [128 Cal.Rptr. 417, 546 P.2d 1361], found that applicant\u2019s injuries from the assault arose out of and in her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The Board, in a two-to-one decision, granted reconsideration, rescinded the WCJ\u2019s findings, and found that applicant did not sustain injuries arising out of the course of her employment. The Board, relying on the \u201cpersonal risk cases\u201d <em>(Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 366 [202 Cal.Rptr. 74]; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 643 [184 Cal.Rptr. 111]; <em>California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 514 [179 Cal.Rptr. 605]; <em>Transactron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 233 [137 Cal.Rptr. 142]), concluded as follows: \u201cThe assault here was entirely personally motivated and the nature and circumstances of applicant\u2019s employment played no part in her assailant\u2019s evident intent to rob her. The most reasonable inference to be drawn from these facts is that, as inferred by applicant, applicant\u2019s assailant followed her from the bank for the purpose of robbing her. . . . Here, applicant\u2019s job \u2018was not the proximate cause of her injury for it merely provided a stage for the event.\u2019 [Citation.] Once the assailant had formed his intent to rob applicant, the assault \u2018could [have] conceivably occurred] anywhere.\u2019 [Citation.] Although it in fact occurred on the employer\u2019s premises, the chain of causation between the employment and the injury is so remote that the injury must be deemed not to be incident to the employment. [Citations.] [\u00b6] Applicant here was just like the victims of many violent robberies, except for the coincidental fact that her employer\u2019s workplace formed the backdrop for her assailant\u2019s final actions. Any injury which she suffered from the assault, though unfortunate, is not compensable.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Applicant then petitioned for reconsideration of the Board\u2019s decision and requested, inter alia, that the Board apply the Labor Code section 3202 rule of liberal construction resolving all doubts as to industrial causation in favor of the employee. The Board denied the petition, concluding (in another two-to-one decision) that \u201capplicant\u2019s contention that Labor Code Section 3202 requires all reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of applicant herein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>ignores the dictates of Labor Code Section 3202.5, which provides: \u2018[n]othing contained on [sic] Section 3202 shall be construed as relieving a party from meeting the evidentiary burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. \u2019 Applicant, of course, has the burden of proving industrial injury and applicant has failed to meet that burden here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">The Board stated further that from the facts related by applicant in her testimony, \u201ca reasonable inference to be drawn is that, as inferred by applicant, the assailant formed his intent to rob applicant at the bank and he followed her from there for the very purpose of doing so. We find no merit in the contention that, apart from applicant\u2019s \u2018speculation\u2019 in her deposition, this inference is without evidentiary support. In her deposition testimony, applicant not only inferred that her assailant had decided to rob her when she was at the bank, she also provided the factual basis for that inference: applicant stated that her assailant entered the parking lot when she did, parked when she did, and assaulted her but one or two minutes after she arrived. It is thus probable that applicant\u2019s assailant observed her cashing her check at her bank and that he decided to assault her before he ever entered onto her employer\u2019s premises. Moreover, applicant has come forward with no evidence, as was her burden, to refute the reasonable inference, drawn by both applicant and the Board, regarding the circumstances of her assault and robbery.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Applicant, of course, had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that her injury arose out of and in the course of her employment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3202.5, 3600, 5705; <em>Wehr </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 188, 193 [211 Cal.Rptr. 321]; <em>California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at p. 520; Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1985) \u00a7 8.45, p. 316.) \u201c \u2018Preponderance of the evidence\u2019 means such evidence as, when weighed with that opposed to it, has more convincing force and the greater probability of truth.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5; see <em>Wehr </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at pp. 193-194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">It is well settled that to be compensable under Labor Code section 3600, an injury resulting from an assault must both <em>\u201carise out of </em>and be <em>in the course of employment.\u201d (State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 652, original italics; see <em>Transactron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 236; <em>Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 369; <em>California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at p. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>Generally, the phrase, \u201cin the course of employment,\u201d refers to the time and place of the injury, whereas the phrase, \u201carise out of employment,\u201d refers to a causal connection between the employment and the injury. <em>(Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 369; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">The fact that an assault occurs while the applicant is on the employer\u2019s premises is not of itself determinant, since it only establishes the \u201carise in\u201d element; and it is incumbent upon applicant to show further that the assault \u201carose out of\u201d the employment, i.e., that there was a causal connection between the employment and the assault. (See <em>Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 369; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 652; <em>California State Polytechnic University, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at p. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">In the instant case, applicant met her burden of establishing that the assault \u201carose in\u201d the course of her employment, since she had clearly arrived on the employer\u2019s premises when the assault occurred, and she was not injured in her local commute to and from the bank. (See <em>Price </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 559, 565-566 [209 Cal.Rptr. 674, 693 P.2d 254].) Thus, the crucial issue here is whether applicant met her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the assault \u201carose out of\u201d the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">\u201cGenerally, whether an assault at the hands of a third person will be considered one \u2018arising out of . . . the employment\u2019 depends upon \u2018whether the assault is made by reason of circumstances connected with the employment or without any relation thereto.\u2019\u201d <em>(Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 369.) In other words, when a third party intentionally injures the employee on personal motivation, there has to be some work connection to establish compensability. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">If the assault at work is purely personal and unrelated to the employment, the injury is not compensable <em>(California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at p. 518); and, when the assault is personally motivated, it could conceivably occur anywhere. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 654.) As stated in <em>Transactron (supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 239): \u201cThe role of employment in the [assault] is inconsequential when it merely provides a place where the assailant can find the victim. [Citation.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>Where the nature of the employee\u2019s duties places her in no particularly dangerous or isolated position, or where the risk of harm is not limited to the place of employment and where the attack occurs on the premises not because the victim was performing the duties of employment at the time of assault but because she merely was there, and where the nature of the employment was not part of an assailant\u2019s plan to isolate or trap the victim, the injury does not arise out of the employment.\u201d (See <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 654; <em>California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at p. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">In determining whether applicant met her burden of proving a causal connection between her employment and the assault so as to establish that her injury arose out of the employment, the Board, as ultimate trier of fact, was empowered to rescind the WCJ\u2019s decision upon concluding that applicant did not meet her burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3202.5, 5906, 5907.) In determining whether applicant\u2019s evidence had such convincing force and probability of truth as to satisfy her burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5), the Board could properly draw inferences from the evidence presented. <em>(Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658, 664 [150 Cal.Rptr. 250, 586 P.2d 564]; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Here, applicant\u2019s case was submitted without objection on her version of the incident as'set forth in her deposition testimony.  Her own inference was that the assailant formed his intent to rob her while she was at the bank and followed her until she stopped in the parking lot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The assailant having formed his intent previously, the assault could have occurred anywhere. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 654; see <em>Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 370; <em>Transactron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 238.) There was no showing that her assailant intended to assault or rob only a Hughes employee, or that the assailant\u2019s motive was other than strictly personal. <em>(Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 371.) Thus, the assault was personally motivated, and the employer\u2019s premises played no part in the assailant\u2019s intent to rob her; rather, it was merely \u201ca stage for the event.\u201d <em>(Transactron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number><em>supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 238.) It was not shown that the risk of harm was limited to the place of employment <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 654), or that the employment contributed in any way to her selection as the victim of the assault. <em>(Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 369.) Nor was it shown that the assault occurred because she was performing the duties of her employment, but rather merely because the assailant followed her there from her personal errand at the bank. <em>(Ibid.; Transactron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">As the Board concluded, Labor Code section 3202.5 expressly provides that the Labor Code section 3202 rule of liberal construction shall not relieve a party from meeting the evidentiary burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.  The Board correctly determined that applicant did not meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that her injuries arose out of her employment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3202.5, 3600, 5705, 5906, 5907; <em>Western Airlines </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d 366; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d 643; <em>California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d 514; <em>Transactron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The January 9, 1985, decision after reconsideration by respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Feinerman, P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Petitioner\u2019s application for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 18, 1985.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Applicant\u2019s deposition testimony was in part as follows: \u201cQ. . . . When you say he pulled in behind you, do you mean he pulled into the lot at the same time you did; and you parked, and then he parked? [\u00b6] A. Uh-huh. [\u00b6] So I think that he followed me from the bank. [\u00b6] Q. Why do you think that? [\u00b6] A. Well, how else would he know I had some money with me to attack me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Applicant\u2019s deposition testimony includes many statements that could well be characterized as objectionable hearsay, opinion, speculation, or conclusion. It is to be noted, however, that she submitted her case on her deposition testimony without any objection or motion to strike any part thereof. Moreover, under Labor Code sections 5708 and 5709, the rules of evidence are not strictly applied in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
