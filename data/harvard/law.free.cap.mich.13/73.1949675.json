A judgment, to constitute a bar to a claim in a subsequent action, must have been rendered upon the merits, upon the same matter in issue, and between the same parties or their privies.\u2014 <em>Outram v. Morewood, </em>3 <em>East., </em>351, 364-6; <em>Ward v. Wilkinson, </em>4 <em>B. &amp; Ald., </em>412; <em>Carter v. James, </em>13 <em>M. &amp; W., </em>147; <em>Simpson v. Pickering, </em>1 <em>C.

John and Sophia Rohrback, </em>was not a bar to the set-off offered -in this case: 1. Because the parties were not- the same; 2. Because the issue was not the same. The issue in that suit was, whether the <em>two defendants </em>were indebted to Tucker for the present demand. That issue could only be supported by proof of a <em>joint </em>liability. Proof of the individual liability of John Rohrback would have defeated the claim. But on the issue in this case, the 'set-off must be supported by proof of an <em>individual </em>liability; and proof\u2019 of a <em>joint </em>liability defeats it. The issue in the two cases was, therefore, antagonistic; and evidence which would support the one would defeat the other. \u2014 <em>Outram v. </em>Morewood, 3 <em>East., </em>364-6; <em>King v.

What that judgment was, or upon what founded, we are not informed. It may have been rendered upon the merits,, or for misjoinder of parties,- or other collateral reason. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>We are not sufficiently informed respecting- it to attribute to it any force, or to determine its character. We only know, that it was a judgment against other parties than the one now before us as defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The judgment is reversed, with costs, and a new trial \u25a0ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-5\">The other Justices concurred in the result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
