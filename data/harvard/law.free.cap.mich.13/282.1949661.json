The witness further explained the object in giving the check, as follows: Mr. Simson expected to die; he had confidence in the plaintiff,' and drew the check for $600, being all, or nearly all, his property, with the understanding that the plaintiff should draw the money, pay the funeral expenses, and pay the rest over to Simson\u2019s family, and thus save the expense of an administration on the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Andrew McLellan was then introduced as a witness <em>on </em>behalf of plaintiff, and 'testified that he was teller in Y.

'Simson, but unless he was, he had no authority to pay it; but if plaintiff would give a bond of indemnity to the bank, the bank would pay the check; plaintiff refused to do so, and the check was not paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">And thereupon the Court charged the jury that upon the law of the case, there being no dispute as to the facts, the plaintiff was entitled to recover as assignee of the $600 deposited with defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">To this charge the defendants excepted,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">The defendants\u2019 counsel then requested the Court to charge the jury that the drawing of said check by said Simson, payable to the order of said plaintiff, did not, Without being accepted by the bank, operate as an assignment of the money deposited by said-John B.

That, however, so far as it operated as a transfer, took effect at once; and inasmuch as the money was to remain.

We claim it did,, and that it is the same, in legal effect, as if the instrument had read as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-10\">\u201c For value received, I hereby assign to Theodore Williams the \u00a7600 I have on deposit in the Second National Bank of Detroit, with full power to demand and receive the same, and I direct said money to be paid 'to him.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-11\">Such an assignment would have authorized the assignee to bring a suit for the money in his own name, under the act of 1863, and the books seem clearly to sustain the proposition that such a check as this, <em>for the whole sum on deposit, </em>is an assignment of' the money to the payee of the check.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-12\">A bill of exchange, for the amount of the fund on deposit drawn, upon, has the effect of an assignment to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the payee of the sum, for which it is drawn. \u2014 <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>1, 2; <em>Edwards on Bills, </em>44; 2 <em>Parsons on Bills, </em>57; 1 <em>B. &amp; P., </em>286; 1 <em>H.

It need not be, as it never or rarely is, in writing. By this implied, agreement the banker obligates himself to pay the checks \u25a0of the depositor to the payee or bearer of them, whoever that may be, even though the checks are but for a piart of the fund, and <em>a fortiori </em>if they are 'for the whole. This mode of doing business is well understood among all business men the world over, and it is illustrated in the every-day practice of bankers. As a result of the understanding and agreement, and as a result of the authorities, <em>the payee or hearer of a check .may, on refusal of payment, bring his action for the money in his own name against the hanker. </em>The common counts are also the proper form of remedy in such a case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\">Among other, cases relied on as sustaining this doctrine in principle, before the point came before the Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>directly, the following may be, cited: 2 <em>Wm. Blk., </em>1269; 1 <em>B. &amp; </em>P., 296; 1 <em>John. </em>Cases, 205; 3 <em>John. R., </em>82; 12 <em>John.

State Bank, </em>decided, with <em>Ambler v. Same, </em>in 1860, by the Court of Appeals of South Carolina. The Court, in these cases, in an exhaustive opinion, going over the whole ground, come square up to our proposition, and decide directly that the holder of an unaccepted check, though drawn generally, and for but part of the fund on deposit, may recover upon it in his own name, in an action for money had and received, brought by him against the banker.\u2014 12 <em>Rich.

To do so is clearly a wrong. \u2014 2 <em>Parsons on Bills, </em>60; 12 <em>Rich. L., </em>528.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b289-8\">Cixristianct J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. The counsel for the defendant in error \u2014 plaintiff below \u2014 insists .that the check of Simson, importing of itself a sufficient consideration, and being for the whole amount \u2022of the money of the drawer on deposit in the bank, operated, as between the drawer and the payee, as an assignment to the latter of the money, or the drawer\u2019s right to it; axxd as the drawex-, before giving the check, might have sustained an action against the bank for the amount, the payee, as assignee of the drawex-, may now maintain the action, under the Statute of 1863, authorizing the assigixee of a chose in action to sue in his own name. I do not think the question whether a \u2022check can, in any case, operate as an assignment, by \u2022.the drawer, of the money, or the drawer\u2019s right to it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>,to the ' payee, can properly arise in the present case. If a check can ever have this effect, it can only be in those cases when it has been given for a valuable consideration. Here the whole tendency of the evidence was to show there was no valuable consideration to support an assignment. The consideration implied by the giving of the check cannot aid the plaintiff. Upon any theory of the case, it was competent to inquire into the real consideration, and the plaintiff, without waiting for the consideration to be attacked by the defendant, himself introduced evidence to show what the consideration actually, was. The whole tendency of this evidence, as well as that introduced by the defendant, was to show that the drawing <em>of </em>the check, and placing it in the hands of the plaintiff, was understood and intended by the drawer and the plaintiff as a substitute for. a testamentary disposition of this money by the drawer, to avoid the expenses of administration on his estate, and that there was no pecuniary or valuable consideration. The arrangement was clearly not such as to constitute a valid will; and as an intended substitute for a testamentary disposition, it must have been understood as in its nature revocable by the drawer at anytime prior to his death. And if the plaintiff, by the arrangement, was to do any act with reference to the check, or the money, previous to Simson\u2019s death \u2014 which the evidence does not fairly tend to show \u2014 it could only 'have been as the agent of Simson, and not as trustee, or in his own right as a party having an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u2019 If, on the other hand, as we think the testimony clearly tends to show, he was only to act in the matter after the death of Simson, appropriating the money first to the payment of funeral expenses, and the balance to be paid to the family, or some member of 'it; then, unless the delivery of the check can be sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>as a <em>donatio causa mortis, </em>no interest whatever is vested in the plaintiff, and the trust intended never took effect; but the check, with the whole arrangement, was revoked by Simson\u2019s death, and the bank, after notice of the death of Simson, and of the arrangement upon which the check was given, could not have paid the check to the plaintiff without the risk of'being again called upon to pay an administrator upon .the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Did, then, the . execution and delivery of the check constitute a valid <em>donatio causa mortis ? </em>Without acceptance by the bank, or some special undertaking on its part, we do not think the bank could be held liable upon a check, as such, to the payee. There is no privity of contract between the payee and the drawee; and if the money is not paid upon the check, the drawee is only accountable to the drawer. The payee does not take an unaccepted check, relying upon the credit of the drawee, but that of the drawer. We do not, therefore, concur in the opinion expressed in <em>Fogarties v. State Bank, </em>and <em>Ambler v. Same, </em>12 <em>Rich., (S. Car.,) R., </em>518, holding the drawee of an unaccepted check, liable to a suit by the payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The, drawer, therefore, in the present case was the only party who could have been held liable to the plaintiff, if any; and we think no- mere contract, liability or obligation of the donor can be recognized as the proper subject of a gift <em>causa mortis. </em>\u2014 See <em>Story's Eq. Jur., </em>\u00a7607a, \u00a7607c; <em>Meach v. Meach, </em>24 <em>Vt., </em>598; <em>Raymond v. Sellick, </em>10 <em>Conn., </em>480; <em>Holley v. Adams, </em>16 <em>Vt., </em>206; <em>Harris v.

Lincoln, </em>31 <em>Me., </em>422.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We see, therefore, no ground, which the evidence in this case tends to establish, upon which the plaintiff below was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>with costs to the plaintiff in error, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
