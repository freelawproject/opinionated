Upon review of the record, we find no error in the imposition of Bias\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">In June 2001, Blas, a 48 year old male, began communicating by computer with a fifteen-year-old Florida girl (\u201cVictim 1\u201d). Bias testified that he initially told Victim 1 that he was eighteen years old, but that two weeks later, he admitted to being forty-seven. When asked on cross-examination why he lied about his age, he stated that he had established a relationship with Victim 1, and did not want to lose her friendship. Bias and Victim 1 communicated for several months during which he encouraged her to believe she was his girlfriend. Bias indicated that he intended to \u201cmake L-U-V\u201d to her. In December 2001, Bias traveled from New York to Florida and met Victim 1. Bias took Victim 1 to lunch at a restaurant, and then to a motel room where they engaged in vaginal, anal, and oral sex.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bias then took Victim 1 home and returned to New York. At the time, Bias was aware, as he had been for several years, that he was infected with the HIY virus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-17\">In January 2002, Bias began communicating by computer with a fourteen-year-old Florida girl (\u201cVictim 2\u201d). Bias and Victim 2 engaged in numerous telephone calls, during which they discussed sex and their relationship for several hours. On several occasions via webcam, Bias exposed himself to Victim 2 and masturbated. Bias told Victim 2 he was seropositive, but claimed she could not catch HIV from him because of the medications he was taking. Bias had planned on coming to visit Victim 2 to have sex with her in Summer 2002, but was arrested before they could meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-18\">Bias agreed to plea guilty to all counts without a plea agreement. At his plea colloquy, Bias denied having had anal sex with Victim 1, and disagreed with some of the statements he was reported to have made to Victim 2. However, he otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>agreed that the facts as presented by the government were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">The probation office\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) placed the three offenses into two groups, with the two counts involving Victim 1 (Counts One and Two) in one group, and the sole count involving Victim 2 (Count Three) in the other group. For the first group, the PSI set the base offense level at 24, because the offense involved the completion of a sexual act, pursuant to \u00a7 2A3.2(a)(l) United States Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The PSI then added two offense-specific characteristics: 1) a two-level increase for knowing misrepresentation of identity (\u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(A)), based on Bias\u2019s representation to Victim 1 of being eighteen years old; and 2) a two-level increase for use of the Internet (\u00a7 2A3.2(b)(3)(A) and (B)). Once adjusted, Bias\u2019s offense level for the first group was 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">For the second group, because the offense did not involve sexual contact, the PSI set the base offense level at 21 (\u00a7 2A3.2(a)(2)). The PSI included two offense-specific characteristics: 1) a two-level increase for undue influence (\u00a7 2A3-2(b)(2)(B)); and 2) a two-level increase for use of the Internet (\u00a7 2A3.2(b)(3)(A) and (B)). Once adjusted, Bias\u2019s offense level for the second group was 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">After a two level multiple count adjustment (\u00a7 3D1.4), Bias\u2019s combined adjusted offense level was 30. The PSI then subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility and cooperation with authorities (\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b)). The resulting offense level was 27. Bias had a criminal history category of I, which resulted in a punishment range of 70-87 months\u2019 incarceration and two to three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">Bias objected to the misrepresentation of identity enhancement, and to the possibility of an upward departure. Bias claimed that he informed Victim 1 of his HIV status before he went to Florida, and indicated that they had used condoms. Bias said that he had informed Victim 1 of his true age within two weeks of their first communication. The district court, finding that a misrepresentation of one\u2019s age to gain the confidence and trust of a victim fit within \u201cthe essence\u201d of \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(A)\u2019s enhancement for misrepresenting identity in order to \u201cpersuade, induce, entice, or coerce\u201d a minor victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, thereby overruling Bias\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">The government, raising no objection to the PSI, moved for an upward departure on three grounds: 1) extreme conduct (\u00a7 5K2.8) based on, <em>inter alia, </em>Victim l\u2019s age, Bias\u2019s infection with HIV and failure to inform Victim 1 of his medical condition; 2) the use of dangerous weapons and dangerous instrumentalities (\u00a7 5K2.6), arguing that Bias\u2019s conduct, in light of his disease, was akin to the use of a deadly weapon; and 3) atypical case (\u00a7 5K2.0), based on the uniqueness of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">At sentencing in December 2002, the district court denied the requested \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d departure. With regard to the government\u2019s motion for an \u201cextreme conduct\u201d upward departure, the district court noted that it was undisputed that Bias knowingly carried a potentially fatal disease. As the court stated, despite his awareness of his status and the risks involved, Bias engaged in numerous sexual acts with a fifteen-year-old girl. The court thereby found that, regardless of the possible use of a condom, multiple sex acts increased the risk of transmission. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>court also noted that, because of the nature of her contact with Bias, Victim 1 would be subject to repeated HIV testing, fear of having contracted the disease, and other psychological trauma. Quoting \u00a7 5K2.8, the district court found that Bias\u2019s behavior constituted an \u201cunusually heinous, cruel, and degrading act toward a minor,\u201d thus meriting the upward departure. Tr. Sent. Hr\u2019g at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">The court alternatively found that Bias\u2019s conduct, namely the exposure of a young-victim to a potentially fatal disease through sexual relations, took the matter out of the heartland of cases, and ruled that an upward departure for atypical ease was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">For the offenses involving Victim 1, the court departed upward to offense level 34, which had a guideline range of 151 to the statutory maximum of 180 months. The court sentenced Bias to 180 months\u2019 incarceration on Counts One and Two and 70 months\u2019 incarceration on Count Three, to be served concurrently, to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised release, concurrently, on each count. The court also imposed a $15,000 fine, and ordered Bias to pay $86 in restitution and a $300 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">Bias now appeals, arguing 1) that the district court erred in applying the two-level offense characteristic for misrepresenting his age; and.2) that the district court erred in applying an upward departure for extreme conduct and atypical case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">The district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is a question of law we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>348 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). However, a district court\u2019s finding with regard to a defendant\u2019s intent is reviewed for clear error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">Traditionally, the question of whether the facts of a case supported a departure has been reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 96-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). However, on April 30, 2003, Congress enacted the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, (the \u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003), which changed the standard of review we employ in reviewing a departure decision. Under the PROTECT Act, when a sentence is outside the guideline range, we review de novo the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts to decide whether the departure was based on a factor that 1) advanced the objectives of federal sentencing policy; 2) was authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b); and 3) was justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Pressley, </em>345 F.3d 1205, 1209 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). Bias was sentenced before the enactment of the PROTECT Act. However, we recently found that the changed standard of review under the PROTECT Act shall be applied retroactively. <em>See United States v. Saucedo-Patino, </em>358 F.3d 790, 791, 2004 WL 117766, at *2 (11th Cir. Jan.27, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">Bias first argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level specific offense characteristic for his misrepresentation. He argues that 1) while he initially told the victim that he was eighteen years old, he informed her of his real age before the relationship became sexual; 2) the government failed to meet its burden by proving otherwise; and 3) his misrepresentation did not \u201ccompel\u201d the prohibited sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>Application Note 4 of \u00a7 2A3.2 provides that a two-level enhancement may apply when a defendant misrepresents his \u201cname, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to ... persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d \u00a7 2A3.2, cmt. n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">The finding that Bias misrepresented his age in contacts with Victim 1 as a means of gaining her confidence and trust, if nothing more, was not clearly erroneous, particularly in light of Bias\u2019s admission as to his intent. While it could be the case that a finding that a perpetrator\u2019s misrepresentation of his age in order to gain a victim\u2019s trust and confidence would be sufficient to justify an enhancement under \u00a7 2A3.2, we have not yet fully considered the issue. However, we need not reach the question. In this case, the district court departed upward to 180 months. <em>See </em>Tr. Sent. Hr\u2019g at 52. If the upward departure was proper, any error in the application of \u00a7 2A3.2 would have yielded the same result and thus have been harmless. In such a case, a remand for resen-tencing on the \u00a7 2A3.2 issue would not be required. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). As such, we must turn to the question of whether the district court\u2019s upward departure was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">In arguing that the district court erred in applying an upward departure for extreme conduct, Bias argues that 1) the reasons given for the upward departure were already taken into consideration in formulating the guidelines; 2) even if the departure was applicable, it was unwarranted; and 3) that the amount of departure from the guideline range was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">One .basis on which the district court may upwardly depart from the Guidelines is \u201c[i]f the defendant\u2019s conduct was unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim.\u201d \u00a7 5K2.8. Examples of extreme conduct include torture, gratuitous infliction of injury, or prolonging pain or humiliation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">Likewise, a district court may upwardly depart if the case is atypical. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5K2.0. Departures under \u00a7 5K2.0 are \u201creserved for \u2018unusual\u2019 cases where there is something atypical about the defendant or the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime which significantly differ from the normal or \u2018heartland\u2019 conduct in the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>911 F.2d 542, 549 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>891 F.2d 962, 964 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\"> We find that both \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.8 and 5K2.0 separately justify an upward departure in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, we strain to determine how Bias\u2019s knowingly subjecting an adolescent to a communicable and potentially fatal, incurable disease through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>several sexual acts \u2014 and neglecting to notify her of his condition \u2014 could be anything other than \u201cunusually heinous, cruel, brutal or degrading.\u201d Moreover, we have not yet encountered a case with a similar factual backdrop, and like the district court, we cannot identify any other reported federal cases in which an HIV-infected defendant actively sought out \u2014 and was successful in securing \u2014 sexual contact with at least one minor. Bias\u2019s actions with regard to his young victim were incredibly risky and dangerous, and presented circumstances that clearly were not taken into consideration in formulating the applicable guidelines. We therefore find that a departure in this instance advanced the objectives of federal policy, was authorized by statute, and was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Finally, we reject Bias\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a seven-level departure. The extent of a district court\u2019s departure from the Guidelines must be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.1999). When a sentencing court departs from the Guidelines, a reviewing court determines the reasonableness of the departure in light of the factors to be considered in imposing the sentence, and the reasons the district court provided for departing. <em>See id. </em>at 1322-23. Among the factors a sentencing court must consider are the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">In other circumstances in which the facts supported departure, we have found sentences equal to or within the statutory maximum to be reasonable. <em>See, e.g. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d at 1323 (departure reasonable where sentence was below maximum); <em>United States v. Garrison, </em>133 F.3d 831, 853 (11th Cir.1998) (departure increasing fine to statutory maximum reasonable). In light of the nature and circumstances of Bias\u2019s offense, we find the sentence to have been reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Seeing no error, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">. At Bias\u2019s sentencing, a local police officer with whom Victim 1 had spoken after the incident testified that Victim 1 told her that Bias had used a condom. While the officer indicated that she did not believe Victim 1, there was no other evidence to suggest that Bias did not use a condom. Victim 1 was not available to testify at the sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">. Hereafter, provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines will be cited as ''\u00a7 X.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">. As to this issue, we reject Bias's suggestion that the district court abused its discretion by relying upon \"impermissible duplicative considerations\u201d and thus relying on the same conduct to depart upward on two different grounds and not adequately stating its reasons for each individual basis. The district court found, as we do today, that both sections 5K2.8 and 5K2.0 served as <em>alternative </em>bases for justifying a departure in this case. Because each departure, taken alone, would have been appropriate, and the district court sufficiently indicated its reasons for departure, Bias's argument is to no avail. <em>See United States v. Hersh, </em>297 F.3d 1233, 1251 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that \"the district court offered three independent and altogether sufficient reasons justifying its upward departure\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1217, 123 S.Ct. 1319, 154 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
