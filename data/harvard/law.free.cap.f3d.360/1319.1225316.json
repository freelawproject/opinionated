We hold that district courts do not have such jurisdiction because the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (2000), to adjudicate breach of contract claims for money damages in excess of $10,000, and Congress has not waived sovereign immunity for such suits in district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">Here, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and on appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, lacked jurisdiction to issue such a \u201cpredicate\u201d judgment, and the \u201cpredicate\u201d judgment was void. It follows that the Court of Federal Claims was not bound by this earlier judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">On the merits, we affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment. We agree that the contract between the government and the appellants was unenforceable against the government because of a material breach by the appellants predating the government\u2019s alleged breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">The National Housing Act was designed to \u201cassist private industry in providing housing for low and moderate income families and displaced families.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151(a) (2000). It authorized the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) to insure mortgages used to construct certain low-income housing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 17151(b). Owners of such properties were also entitled to certain tax benefits. <em>See Chancellor Manor v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 891, 894 (Fed.Cir.2003). In return for this mortgage insurance and tax benefits along with various other benefits, landlords agreed to be \u201cregulated or supervised ... by the Secretary under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>regulatory agreement.\u201d 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 17151(d)(3) (West Supp.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The appellants, Christopher Village, L.P. and its managing general partner, Wilshire Investments Corp., owned a federally subsidized low-income housing complex known as Mockingbird Run Apartments (\u201cMockingbird Run\u201d). Mockingbird Run was built in 1970 with an insured mortgage obtained under the National Housing Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1701-1750g (2000). In accordance with National Housing Act requirements, the appellants entered into a standard regulatory agreement with HUD concerning Mockingbird Run (the \u201cRegulatory Agreement\u201d). The Regulatory Agreement required the appellants to \u201cmaintain the mortgaged premises ... in good repair and condition.\u201d Regulatory Agreement 117 (App. at 2002). <em>See also </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.530(b) (1995). The agreement authorized HUD to regulate rents. Regulatory Agreement 114(f) (App. at 2001) (\u201cThe rent charged for each unit shall not exceed the upper limit of the range shown for such type of unit on the rental schedule approved in writing by the Commissioner [of HUD] .... \u201d); <em>see also </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1747c (2000) (\u201c[T]he investor shall not charge or collect rents for any dwellings in the project in excess of the appropriate rents therefor as shown in the latest rent schedule approved pursuant to this section.\u201d). According to HUD regulations, HUD-approved rent schedules were meant to \u201ccompensate for any increase in ... operating and maintenance costs over which owners have no effective control....\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.112(b) (1995). The Regulatory Agreement also stated that the landlord could not increase \u201cthe amount of the gross monthly dwelling income for all units ... unless such increase is approved by the Commissioner.\u201d Regulatory Agreement 1\u00cd 2(g) (App. at 2001); <em>see also </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.112(b) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The appellants also entered into a Housing Assistance Payment contract (the \u201cHAP Contract\u201d) with HUD pursuant to the United States Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (2000). (App. at 2100.) That Act authorized HUD to enter into contracts with landlords to subsidize rental payments of tenants living in private, low-income housing. <em>See Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, </em>508 U.S. 10, 12, 113 S.Ct. 1898, 123 L.Ed.2d 572 (1993). Under the HAP Contract, the appellants received \u201cassistance payments\u201d in \u201can amount calculated to make up the difference between the tenant\u2019s contribution and the contract rent agreed upon by the landlord and HUD.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Like the Regulatory Agreement, the HAP Contract regulated the appellants\u2019 management of Mockingbird Run, prohibiting the appellants from \u201ccharging] any family an amount in excess of the\u201d set allowable rents and requiring the appellants to \u201cmaintain and operate the contract units and related facilities so as to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing as defined by HUD.\u201d (App. at 2102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">By 1995, the physical condition of Mockingbird Run had substantially deteriorated, necessitating approximately $2 million worth of repairs. Finding that the appellants had allowed the complex to deteriorate in violation of the Regulatory Agreement and the HAP Contract, HUD informed the appellants in April of 1995 that their failure to refurbish the property could lead to a default of the Regulatory Agreement and loss of the HAP Contract rent subsidies.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Thereafter, on June 23, 1995, the appellants requested a twenty-nine percent rent increase from HUD, claiming that the current rent revenue was inadequate to cover operating costs as well as maintenance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>repairs. HUD sent the appellants a letter on August 25, 1995, explaining that the Regulatory Agreement and HAP Contract imposed an absolute obligation on the appellants to maintain the property. The letter did not decide the appellants\u2019 rent increase request, but it instead demanded that the appellants deposit approximately $2 million in escrow to fund Mockingbird Run\u2019s needed repairs. The appellants did not deposit the $2 million. On September 6, 1995, HUD sent the appellants a second letter explaining that it would not entertain the appellants\u2019 request for a rent increase unless they deposited the $2 million in escrow as the August letter demanded. The appellants again refused to pay the $2 million, and on September 14, 1995, HUD informed the appellants that they \u201chad violated ... the Regulatory Agreement by not maintaining the mortgaged premises in good repair and condition [and that] HUD would proceed without further notice to take whatever remedies are appropriate.\u201d <em>Christopher Vill., L.P. v. Retsinas, </em>190 F.3d 310, 313 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotations omitted). On November 17, 1995, the Federal National Mortgage Association, the original lender, assigned the note and mortgage to HUD, and \u201cHUD assumed control of the property as a mortgagee in possession\u201d on December 1, 1995. <em>Id. </em>(explaining that once the Federal National Mortgage Association assigned the note to HUD, HUD \u201chad the same remedial rights as the original lender\u201d); <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.255(a)(2) (2003); <em>see also United States v. Antioch Found., </em>822 F.2d 693, 695 (7th Cir.1987) (stating \u201cin determining when to foreclose following a default, HUD has very broad discretion in order to achieve national housing objectives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In October of 1995 the appellants brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against HUD, the Secretary of HUD, and the Director of Multifamily Housing Management of the Houston Area Office of HUD, seeking mandamus, injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant tb the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 706 (2000) (\u201cAPA\u201d). <em>Christopher Vill., L.P. v. Cuomo, </em>No. Civ. H-95-5005, 1998 WL 422854 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 2,1998). Arguing that HUD illegally demanded $2 million in escrow and illegally refused to consider its request for a rent increase, the appellants sought mandamus and injunctive relief to prevent HUD from foreclosing on the Mockingbird Run property. The appellants also sought a declaratory judgment that their obligation to maintain the property was contingent upon receiving adequate rent revenue and that they were under no duty to make repairs unless they received adequate rent increases. In March of 1998 the district court granted summary judgment in favor of HUD on all counts, holding that HUD\u2019s decisions whether to grant rent increases were unreviewable and that the appellants had an absolute responsibility to properly maintain the property irrespective of rent increases. <em>Id. </em>at *34.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The appellants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. While the case was pending in the Fifth Circuit, HUD sold the property in a foreclosure sale, and it was razed. <em>Christopher Vill., </em>190 F.3d at 312. The Fifth Circuit held that HUD\u2019s \u201cforeclosure sale and transfer ... effectively mooted [the appellants\u2019] request for an injunction and mandamus because of [the] court\u2019s inability to fashion adequate relief\u201d since the \u201crequest for relief ... involvefd] a transfer of the property [that] amount[ed] to an impossible request for [the] court\u201d to fulfill. <em>Id. </em>at 314-15 (internal quotations omitted). Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>held that the request for a declaratory judgment still \u201cpresent[ed] a live dispute\u201d because the appellants \u201ccould use the declaration as a predicate for a damages action against HUD in the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">On the merits, the Fifth Circuit agreed with the district court that HUD decisions regarding requests for rent increases were indeed unreviewable under the APA because \u201cCongress committed to HUD full discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a rent increase request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the Fifth Circuit found that both the Regulatory Agreement and HUD\u2019s own regulations required \u201cHUD at least to entertain a rent increase request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816 (citing Regulatory Agreement 14(g), stating that HUD \u201cwill at any time entertain a written request for [a rent] increase\u201d and 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.312(b), stating that in response to a request for a rent increase, HUD \u201cshall approve a rental schedule ... or shall deny the increase stating the reasons therefor\u201d). The court held that HUD \u201cviolated its contractual and regulatory duty to consider the rent request ... [thereby] rendering] suspect HUD\u2019s other actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit further stated that the appellants\u2019 duty to properly maintain Mockingbird Run \u201cwas not absolute\u201d and that the appellants\u2019 \u201ccost of operating and maintaining the property, in addition to the cost of complying with the Regulatory Agreement, must be paid for out of the regulated rental revenues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316-17. Although the Fifth Circuit found that \u201cHUD could understandably refuse to provide financial assistance to an owner that has misappropriated funds, mismanaged the property, taken a profit instead of maintaining the property, or been negligent in its management in some other regard,\u201d the court held that there was no evidence establishing that any of these things had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 317-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The Fifth Circuit accordingly reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. It found that \u201cHUD acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it refused to abide by its legal obligation to consider a rental increase request from a non-negligent owner and instead demanded a $2 million cash infusion and then declared the property in default for those very reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. The court ordered that \u201c[u]pon remand, the district court should issue [the appellants\u2019] requested declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>HUD did not seek further review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision. Neither, apparently, did the appellants seek a declaratory judgment from the district court as provided by the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">On September 21, 1999, the appellants filed an action in the Court of Federal Claims for breach of contract, seeking certification of a class of similarly situated entities. Appellants contended that they were entitled to a finding of liability against HUD as a matter of law because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling barred the government from relitigating the issue of breach of contract under the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Initially, the Court of Federal Claims denied the appellants\u2019 motion for class certification on October 26, 2001, finding that the appellants did not satisfy the <em>Quinault </em>requirements for certification, <em>see Qui-nault Allottee Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>197 Ct.Cl. 134, 453 F.2d 1272 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Christo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number><em>pher Vill., L.P. v. United States, </em>50 Fed.Cl. 635 (2001). In particular, the Court of Federal Claims found that common questions of law did not predominate over individual factual questions of class members; that the appellants\u2019 claim was not sufficiently typical of the class; and that the claims of individual class members were not necessarily too small to be pursued individually. <em>Christopher Vill., </em>50 Fed.Cl. at 642-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In 2001, while the damages action was pending in the Court of Federal Claims, criminal litigation regarding a fraudulent insurance scheme related to HUD projects was settled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. This litigation involved the Management Assistance Group, Inc. (\u201cMAGI\u201d), a company that shared a president and sole shareholder with Wilshire and was a limited partner of Christopher Village. The settlement of this criminal litigation on March 30, 2001, was effectuated through a plea agreement (\u201cthe Plea Agreement\u201d). In the Plea Agreement MAGI pled guilty to engaging in an illegal insurance kickback scheme, which involved Mockingbird Run as well as other HUD projects. Although neither Wilshire nor Christopher Village was a party to this Plea Agreement, Wilshire was a party to both the Consent Agreement and the Administrative Agreement, which, while not admitting any wrongdoing by Wilshire, barred future government claims against Wilshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">HUD required MAGI to procure insurance for its affiliated properties, including Mockingbird Run. MAGI admitted that it required illegal kickbacks from the insurance company that covered its affiliated properties in order to retain its insurance business. The insurance company in turn inflated the true costs of insurance for these HUD-project properties, and it invoiced MAGI\u2019s affiliated properties, including Mockingbird Run, for the kickback costs as well as the actual insurance costs. These inflated insurance charges were then included as an expense item in documentation that the appellants subsequently submitted to HUD in 1992, 1994, and 1995 in order to justify rent increase requests for Mockingbird Run. <em>See generally </em>HUD Housing Handbook: Multifamily Asset Management and Project Servicing, Chapter 7: Processing Budgeted Rent Increases and Fees for Commercial Space &amp; Services in Insured, Direct Loan and Non-Regulated HUD Project (Doc. No. 4350.1), <em>available at </em>http://www.hudclips.org. The appellants also submitted a \u201cCertification as to Purchasing Practices and Reasonableness of Expenses\u201d with each of these requests, in which the appellants certified that \u201c[ajmounts paid to individuals or companies having an identity-of-interest with the owner or the management agent were not excess of the costs that would have been incurred in making arms-length purchases on the open market.\u201d (App. at 2577.) HUD granted the appellants rent increases in 1992 and 1994 for Mockingbird Run.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">Subsequent to these events, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the Court of Federal Claims entered summary judgment in favor of the government. <em>Christopher Vill., L.P. v. United States, </em>53 Fed.Cl. 182 (2002). The government claimed that the MAGI plea evidenced a prior material breach by the appellants, thereby excusing the government of liability for any later breach that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>HUD may have committed by refusing to consider the rent requests. The appellants, however, argued that they were entitled to a judgment of liability as a matter of law because res judicata required the Court of Federal Claims to accept the Fifth Circuit\u2019s liability holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The court rejected the appellants\u2019 argument that it was bound by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision, reasoning that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel prohibited it from considering the government\u2019s prior breach defense. The court concluded that \u201cres judicata presumes that the first court had jurisdiction over the claim ... [and the] Fifth Circuit clearly recognized that it was up to this court to rule on the contract question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188. The Court of Federal Claims further explained that \u201c[a]l-though collateral estoppel bars the government from challenging HUD\u2019s breach [for failure to consider the appellants\u2019 rent increase request], collateral estoppel does not bar the government from defending that breach based on prior material breach\u201d because the Fifth Circuit did not decide the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 189. On the merits, the court found that the appellants committed a prior material breach that protected the government against liability for HUD\u2019s subsequent assumed breach because the appellants had not provided any evidence to rebut \u201cthe fact that Mockingbird Run Apartments were involved in the [MAGI] scheme ... [and] that Wilshire Investments, the general partner in the Christopher Village Limited Partnership, was part of the fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187 n. 4. The court concluded that \u201cthe fraudulent conduct of MAGI and Wilshire, in connection with the rent requests for the Mockingbird Run Apartments, constitutes a pri- or material breach of the HUD contracts which justifies HUD\u2019s termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 contract for default.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. The court held that this prior material breach excused HUD\u2019s assumed subsequent breach, \u201ceven though the U.S. government was not aware of the facts at the time of the foreclosure at issue in this litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. Finally, the court held that there was no settlement bar to the government\u2019s defense of prior material breach. <em>Id. </em>at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Christopher Village and its managing general partner, Wilshire, appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment without deference. <em>Agwiak v. United States, </em>847 F.3d 1375, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Appellants argue first that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201cis res judicata\u201d and precludes the government from challenging its liability for breach. (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 32.) Appellants therefore contend that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision entitles them to judgment as a matter of law on the breach of contract claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Initially, we must determine whether the Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction to issue a judgment as a \u201cpredicate\u201d to a suit in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, at 13 (1982); <em>see also id. </em>at 19. As we recently reaffirmed in <em>Fieldturf, Inc. v. Southwest Recreational Indus., Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1266, 1268 (Fed.Cir.2004), in circumstances such as these, the court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction is dependent on the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction to issue this \u201cpredicate\u201d judgment only if a district court would have had jurisdiction to issue such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>In order for a district court to have properly had jurisdiction, the government must have waived sovereign immunity to suit. As the Supreme Court recently noted in <em>United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, </em>537 U.S. 465, 472, 123 S.Ct. 1126, 155 L.Ed.2d 40 (2003), \u201c[jurisdiction over any suit against the Government requires a clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign immunity ... together with a claim falling within the terms of the waiver.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941) (\u201cThe terms of [the sovereign\u2019s] consent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d); <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. United States, </em>247 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\u201cTo invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court for relief from monetary obligations imposed by a federal agency, a litigant must show that the United States has waived sovereign immunity.\u201d). The APA has \u201cbroaden[ed] the avenues for judicial review of agency action by eliminating the defense of sovereign immunity in cases covered by\u201d its provisions. <em>Bowen v. Mass., </em>487 U.S. 879, 891-92, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988); <em>See also Darby v. Cisneros, </em>509 U.S. 137, 153, 113 S.Ct. 2539, 125 L.Ed.2d 113 (1993). But the waiver of sovereign immunity under the APA is limited. <em>See, e.g., Bowen, </em>487 U.S. at 904 n. 39, 108 S.Ct. 2722.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The APA waives sovereign immunity for suits to \u201cset aside agency action ... found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a) (2000), when the suit calls for \u201crelief other than money damages,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 702, but only if \u201cthere is <em>no other adequate remedy,\u201d id. </em>\u00a7 704 (emphasis added). This limits the government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity to situations in which \u201cho other adequate remedy\u201d exists. <em>Bowen, </em>487 U.S. at 902, 108 S.Ct. 2722. Here, the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity existed as to the appellants\u2019 claim for injunctive relief because no other adequate remedy existed to prevent the foreclosure and sale. Thus, there is no question that the District Court for the Southern District of Texas properly had jurisdiction over the original action to enjoin foreclosure by the government. But, as the Fifth Circuit correctly held, the claim that originally formed the basis for this jurisdiction under the APA, namely the request to enjoin HUD\u2019s foreclosure and sale, became moot when HUD foreclosed on and sold Mockingbird Run. <em>Christopher Vill., </em>190 F.3d at 314. At that point, the appellants\u2019 sole claim was for a declaratory judgment as to the legality of HUD\u2019s actions, and jurisdiction over this claim turned on whether the APA waived the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity to suit for such a declaratory judgment. This depended on whether suit in the Court of Federal Claims for money damages constituted an \u201cadequate remedy\u201d under section 704 of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">We held in <em>Consolidated Edison </em>that a litigant\u2019s ability to sue the government for money damages in the Court of Federal Claims is an \u201cadequate remedy\u201d that precludes an APA waiver of sovereign immunity in other courts. 247 F.3d at 1384. The plaintiff in <em>Consolidated Edison </em>sued the government in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the APA for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the special assessments imposed by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (\u201cEPACT\u201d) violated due process and constituted a taking under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 1380. The gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>eminent moved to have the case transferred to the Court of Federal Claims, but the district court denied the transfer. <em>Id. </em>at 1381-82. The plaintiff appealed this denial of transfer to our court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A), which gives our court exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to transfer to the Court of Federal Claims. We held that the district court lacked jurisdiction under section 704 of the APA because \u201c[e]very legal issue that [the plaintiff sought] to resolve in this district court case could [have been] ... decided in a suit before the Court of Federal Claims ... [and] a refund of the EPACT payments could [have] provide[d] an <em>adequate remedy\u201d </em>for the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 1385 (emphasis added). We further emphasized in <em>Consolidated Edison </em>that, \u201c[a] party may not circumvent the Claims Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction by framing a complaint in the district court as one seeking injunctive, declaratory or mandatory relief where the thrust of the suit is to obtain money from the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rogers v.

For example, in <em>Warner v. Cox, </em>487 F.2d 1301 (5th Cir. 1974), the Fifth Circuit held that it did not have jurisdiction to grant an injunction compelling the Navy to make certain contractual payments. <em>Id. </em>at 1307. Despite the contractor\u2019s argument that his \u201csole claim below was for review of administrative errors committed in the process of [the Navy] refusing\u201d his payments, the court found that \u201c[n]one of the substantive claims presented to the court below concerned anything but the payment of money....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304. The Fifth Circuit reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">[T]he APA does not provide for review under such circumstances. Specifically exempted from review is agency action for which there is some \u201c... other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d 5 \u00da.S.C. \u00a7 704. Suit under the Tucker Act in the Court of Claims has been held such an adequate remedy---- Congress\u2019 judgment seems to be that Tucker Act relief is adequate ... and to that judgment we defer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-8\"><em>Id.

Panama Canal Commission, </em>907 F.2d 532 (5th Cir.1990), the Fifth Circuit refused to entertain an APA claim for mandamus relief to require the Panama Canal Commission to pay certain survivor compensation. The Fifth Circuit held that \u201cbecause ... the substance of the complaints at issue is a claim for money damages, appellant\u2019s case is not one covered by section 702, and, hence, sovereign immunity has not been waived. As a result, the APA does not afford jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535. More recently in <em>Armendariz-Mata v. Department of Justice, </em>82 F.3d 679 (5th Cir. 1996), the Fifth Circuit stressed that \u201cwhen the substance of the complaint at issue is a claim for money damages, the case is not one covered by \u00a7 702, and hence, sovereign immunity has not been waived\u201d and the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>Id. </em>at 682 (citation omitted). Because the Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to award relief, the appeal should have been dismissed. <em>See City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. 277, 287, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000); <em>Church of Scientology v.

Indeed, that is the very premise of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cpredicate\u201d decision. Under these circumstances we must conclude that the Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction over the action for declaratory judgment because the APA did not waive the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for such a suit in district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">However, the fact that a court did not have jurisdiction over a suit in which it issued a decision does not automatically strip that decision of preclusive effect. In most circumstances a judgment may not be collaterally attacked on the ground that the original tribunal lacked subject matter jurisdiction, even if the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>sue of subject matter jurisdiction has not been litigated in the first action. <em>See, e.g., Ins. Corp. of Ir., Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 702 n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982) (explaining that principles of res judicata apply to issues of subject matter jurisdiction, and that \u201c[a] party that has had an opportunity to litigate the question of subject matter jurisdiction may not ... reopen that question in a collateral attack upon adverse judgment\u201d); <em>Underwriters Nat\u2019l Assurance Co. v.

The Restatement similarly notes that a court\u2019s \u201cjudgment precludes the parties from litigating the question of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction\u201d on collateral review. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 12 (1982). The Restatement, however, also recognizes exceptions to this rule, including when \u201c[allowing the judgment to stand would substantially infringe the authority of another tribunal or agency of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12(2); <em>see In re Bulldog Trucking, Inc. v. Productive Transp. Servs., Inc., </em>147 F.3d 347, 354 (4th Cir. 1998); <em>Sterling v. United States, </em>85 F.3d 1225, 1231 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><em>Kalb v. Feuerstein, </em>308 U.S. 433, 60 S.Ct. 343, 84 L.Ed. 370 (1940), involved just the type of situation described in the Restatement\u2019s exception. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 12, note on cmt. d at 127 (citing Kalb); <em>see also Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., Inc. v. S.E.C., </em>837 F.2d 1099, 1104 (D.C.Cir.1988). In <em>Kalb </em>the appellant was a farmer who had filed a petition in the Bankruptcy Court \u201cfor composition and extension of time to pay his debts\u201d under the Frazier-Lemke Act, Pub.L. No. 73-486, 75(s), 48 Stat. 1289 (1934) (formerly codified at 11 U.S.C. 203(s)) (repealed 1949). <em>Kalb, </em>308 U.S. at 435-36, 60 S.Ct. 343. The Act was designed to provide relief for farmer-debtors, and it explicitly prohibited other courts from instituting or continuing foreclosure proceedings against a farmer who filed a petition under the Act in the Bankruptcy Court. <em>Id. </em>at 440-41, 60 S.Ct. 343 (quoting the Frazier-Lemke Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(n)-(p)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless in violation of the Act\u2019s automatic stay, the Wisconsin County Court entered a mortgage foreclosure proceeding against the appellant; confirmed the sheriffs sale of his property; and ordered the appellant dispossessed. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 60 S.Ct. 343. The farmer did not directly appeal the Wisconsin County Court\u2019s decision. Instead, he instituted a separate action in the Circuit Court of Walworth County, Wisconsin for \u201crestoration of possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He argued that once he filed his petition in the Bankruptcy Court, the Frazier-Lemke Act automatically stayed proceedings in the Wisconsin County Court, and the Wisconsin County Court therefore did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the foreclosure proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 60 S.Ct. 343. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that it need not consider whether the Frazier-Lemke Act imposed an automatic stay on state court proceedings because \u201c[n]o appeal having been taken, no showing having been made in the state court, an order of sale having been confirmed and the purchaser put in possession, the plaintiff is in no position to claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>that the order ... is void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 60 S.Ct. 343 (quoting language from the Wisconsin Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The United States Supreme Court reversed. The Court found that \u201cconsiderations as to whether the issue of jurisdiction was actually contested in the County Court, or whether it could have been contested, are not applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 60 S.Ct. 343. The Court detailed the history of Congress\u2019 decision to grant bankruptcy courts exclusive jurisdiction in Frazier-Lemke cases, and it concluded that, \u201cCongress manifested its intention that the issue of jurisdiction in the foreclosing court need not be contested or even raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the Wisconsin County Court\u2019s action \u201cwas not merely erroneous but was beyond its power, void, and subject to collateral attack.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 60 S.Ct. 343. The <em>Kalb </em>holding would appear to apply equally to Congress\u2019 decision to grant exclusive jurisdiction to other courts, such as the Court of Federal Claims, and thereby render void a judgment that treads upon that exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>309 U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894 (1940), is even more closely on point. In <em>Fidelity &amp; Guaranty, </em>a coal company was involved in a bankruptcy proceeding in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, and the United States, as a trustee for the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations (\u201cthe Nations\u201d), filed a claim for lease royalties. <em>Id. </em>at 510, 60 S.Ct. 653. The coal company responded with a cross-claim for credits against the Nations. The Missouri district court granted the Nations\u2019 claim in part and allowed the cross-claim in full, decreeing an overall balance in favor of the coal company. <em>Id. </em>The government did not appeal this decision. However, the government had filed a separate action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma against the coal company\u2019s surety for the same royalties involved in the Missouri proceeding. <em>Id. </em>In the Supreme Court the government conceded that its claim for royalties was decided in the previous action, but' it argued that the affirmative judgment on the cross-claim should not be enforced because the Missouri district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim for affirmative relief against the Nations because of sovereign immunity, and the affirmative judgment was therefore not entitled to preclu-sive effect. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 60 S.Ct. 653. The Oklahoma district court and the Tenth Circuit held that the Missouri decision on the cross-claim was preclusive and that the government could not collaterally attack the judgment. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court reversed. The Court explained that a cross-claim against the Nations was comparable to a claim against the United States and was barred by sovereign immunity unless brought in the appropriate court, and Congress had not waived the Nations\u2019 sovereign immunity in the Missouri district court. <em>Id. </em>at 513, 60 S.Ct. 653. Accordingly, the Court held that the earlier \u201cMissouri judgment [was] void ... [because] cross-claims against the [Indian Nations] are justiciable only in those courts where Congress has consented to their consideration,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 512, 60 S.Ct. 653, namely a \u201cUnited States court in the Indian Territory,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 513, 60 S.Ct. 653 (quoting the Act of April 26, 1906, Pub.L. No. 59-129, \u00a7 18, 34 Stat. 137, 144). Finally, the Court held that the Missouri district court\u2019s judgment on the cross-claim was \u201csubject to collateral attack\u201d because it was \u201cvoid\u201d and was not entitled to preclusive effect. <em>Id. </em>at 514, 60 S.Ct. 653. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">Consent alone gives jurisdiction to adjudge against a sovereign. Absent that consent, the attempted exercise of judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>cial power is void. The failure of officials to seek review cannot give force- to this exercise of judicial power. Public policy forbids suit unless consent is given, as clearly as public policy makes jurisdiction exclusive by declaration of the legislative body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In <em>Durfee v. Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 84 S.Ct. 242, 11 L.Ed.2d 186 (1963), the Supreme Court cited both <em>Kalb </em>and <em>Fidelity &amp; Guaranty </em>for the proposition that the \u201cdoctrine! ] of ... sovereign immunity may in some contexts be controlling\u201d and allow a party to collaterally attack the jurisdiction of a court, thereby overriding the res judicata effect of the court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 84 S.Ct. 242. The Seventh Circuit, in <em>United States v. County of Cook, </em>167 F.3d 381 (7th Cir.1999), noted that <em>Fidelity &amp; Guaranty </em>\u201cpermits the United States to ignore proceedings instituted against it in the wrong court\u201d because such decisions are void. <em>Id. </em>at 390. Likewise, our court concluded in <em>International Air Response v. United States, </em>324 F.3d 1376 (Fed.Cir.2003), that <em>Fidelity &amp; Guaranty </em>teaches to override the res judicata effect of a prior opinion when its issuing court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction \u201cdirectly implicat[es] issues of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Respect for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims is no less important than respect for the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts in <em>Kalb </em>or that of the Indian Territory courts in <em>Fidelity &amp; Guaranty. </em>The history of the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 jurisdiction over suits under the Tucker Act emphasizes the importance that Congress ascribed to the exclusive nature of that jurisdiction. In 1887, Congress amended the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 jurisdiction to include \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (2000). This provision has come to be known as the Tucker Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The 1887 Act also included a provision known as the Little Tucker Act that gave district courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Claims over suits against the government in certain instances. 24 Stat. 505 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (2000)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has held, the obvious implication of these acts is that Congress intended the Court of Federal Claims to have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-11\">exclusive jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States for money damages exceeding $10,000 that is founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort ... unless Congress has withdrawn the Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-5\"><em>See Eastern Enters. v. Apfel, </em>524 U.S. 498, 520, 118 S.Ct. 2131, 141 L.Ed.2d 451 (1998) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Clinton v. Goldsmith, </em>526 U.S. 529, 539 n. 13, 119 S.Ct. 1538, 143 L.Ed.2d 720 (1999) (\u201cUnder the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over nontort claims against the government for greater than $10,000.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In the light of this history, we see no basis for distinguishing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kalb </em>or <em>Fidelity &amp; Guaranty. </em>Although we are reluctant to conclude that one of our sister circuits has acted beyond its jurisdiction, we find that it plainly did so here. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling, like the ones at issue in <em>Kalb </em>and <em>Fidelity &amp; Guaranty, </em>did not merely exceed the court\u2019s jurisdiction, it \u201cdirectly implicat[ed] issues of sovereign immunity\u201d and is therefore void. <em>See Int\u2019l Air Response, </em>324 F.3d at 1380. Because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment is void, it is not entitled to preclusive effect, despite the fact that the court\u2019s jurisdiction was not challenged on direct review. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, at 13 (1982); <em>see also id. </em>at 19. We accordingly reject the appellants\u2019 argument that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision conclusively determined the government\u2019s liability. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment is void as to the contract issues that could have been decided and also as to those contract issues actually decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">We turn now to the question whether the Court of Federal Claims correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the government on the appellants\u2019 contract claim. The Court of Federal Claims correctly declined to afford res judicata effect to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision, but it erred in ascribing collateral estoppel effect to the contract issues decided by the Fifth Circuit. Those issues should have been decided de novo by the Court of Federal Claims. However, while we doubt the correctness of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision that the government breached in refusing to consider the appellants\u2019 rent increase request, we are reluctant to address the question of the government\u2019s breach on the current record. The government did not move for summary judgment on that ground. <em>See Christopher Vill., </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 183. Rather, the government moved for summary judgment on the ground that, even assuming a government breach in 1995, the government was not hable because the appellants committed prior material breaches in 1992, 1994, and 1995 by submitting false data to HUD in connection with Mockingbird Run. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Federal Claims, agreeing with the government, held that the MAGI Plea Agreement established that the appellants had submitted false claims for rent increases to the government \u201cin violation of HUD regulations and specific terms of the HAP contract with [the appellants], which prohibited the submittal of, \u2018any false statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>or misrepresentations to HUD in connection with HUD mortgage insurance, loan processing or administration of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186 (quoting HAP Contract (App. at 2104)).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">When \u201ca party to a contract ... is sued for its breach [it] may ordinarily defend on the ground that there existed, at the time [of the breach], a legal excuse for nonperformance....\u201d <em>Coll. Point Boat Corp. v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 12, 15, 45 S.Ct. 199, 69 L.Ed. 490 (1925); <em>see also Sun Studs, Inc. v. ATA Equip. Leasing, Inc., </em>872 F.2d 978, 992-93 (Fed.Cir.1989). In resolving disputes among parties who each claim that the other has breached, courts will \u201c[o]ften ... impose liability on the party that committed the <em>first material breach.\u201d </em>E. Allen Farnsworth, <em>Farnsworth on Contracts </em>\u00a7 8.15, at 439 (1990) (emphasis in original). The Restatement explains that this doctrine of first material breach, or prior material breach, is \u201cbased on the principle that where performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises, each party is entitled to the assurance that he will not be called upon to perform his remaining duties ... if there has already been an uncured material failure of performance by the other party.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 237b, cmt. b (1981). A later breach \u201cis justified ... by the other party\u2019s [prior] failure.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Sun Studs, </em>872 F.2d at 992 (citing this provision of the Restatement in a discussion of the doctrine of prior material breach).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The appellants urge that MAGI\u2019s Plea Agreement cannot establish a prior material breach by the appellants because neither Christopher Village nor its general partner Wilshire was a party to the Plea Agreement; because the government has not established that the appellants intended to defraud HUD when they submitted inflated rent requests; because any breach that the appellants may have committed through these false submissions was immaterial; and because, even if these false submissions constituted a material breach by the appellants, the government was unaware of them at the time HUD breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">We think that the documentation submitted by the government on its motion for summary judgment did not support the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 finding \u201cthat Wilshire Investments, the general partner in the Christopher Village Limited Partnership, was part of the [MAGI] fraud.\u201d <em>Christopher Vill., </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 187 n. 4. Nonetheless, although it is true that the Plea Agreement did not directly implicate Christopher Village or Wilshire in the fraud, the existence of the false statements concerning Mockingbird Run is undisputed. On summary judgment the appellants conceded that false data concerning insurance premiums were submitted to the government in connection with the Mockingbird Run rent increase requests, and that these requests caused the government to make unjustified payments to the appellants. <em>Id. </em>at 189 (\u201cThe plaintiffs do not dispute that they submitted false certifications in support of their rent increase requests and that plaintiffs used HUD funds to pay for, at least in part, illegally-inflated insurance costs.\u201d). The appellants reiterated this concession at oral argument in our court. It is also clear that the appellants violated both the Regulatory Agreement and the HAP Contract by submitting these inflated rent increase requests, contrary to contract provisions that prohibited the submission of \u201cfalse statements or misrepresentations to HUD in connection with HUD mortgage insurance,\u201d HAP Contract 1126 (App. at 2404).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>While the government has not established that Christopher Village and Wil-shire specifically intended to defraud HUD, proof of fraudulent intent by Wil-shire or Christopher Village is not necessary to establish the appellants\u2019 breach in this case. The appellants\u2019 contrary contentions are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the government\u2019s prior material breach defense. The appellants claim that the plaintiffs intent to defraud must be proven under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514, a statute providing that a plaintiffs fraud can cause a forfeiture of its claim against the government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This statute, however, is not the basis for the government\u2019s argument, and the government never mentioned the statute in its brief. The Court of Federal Claims did not hold, and the government did not urge, that the appellants\u2019 inflated rent requests caused the appellants to forfeit their breach of contract claim against the government. Rather, the question is whether as a matter of contract law the government can defend against a subsequent breach by pointing to the appellants\u2019 prior breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The contract law question is whether the appellants\u2019 established and uncontro-verted breach was sufficiently material so as to justify the government\u2019s subsequent breach. The appellants correctly cite our decisi\u00f3n in <em>Thomas v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed.Cir.1997), for the proposition that \u201c[o]nly material breaches can justify the government\u2019s rescinding a contract.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 46.) The appellants reason that their false submissions concerned an amount of money that was too small to be material.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree with the appellants\u2019 conclusion that their breach was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">At the outset, we note that our case law holds that any degree of fraud is material as a matter of law. <em>Joseph Morton Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>757 F.2d 1273, 1278 (Fed.Cir.1985). This is particularly true in light of Congress\u2019 express prohibition of kickbacks reflected in the Anti-Kickback Act of 1986, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-58 (2000). <em>See United States v. Acme Process Equip. Co., </em>385 U.S. 138, 144-45, 87 S.Ct. 350, 17 L.Ed.2d 249 (1966). Our court, in turn, has \u201cunderscore^ the necessity for the Government to be secure in its confidence in its contractors.\u201d <em>Joseph Morton, </em>757 F.2d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Although the appellants may not themselves have participated in the fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>on HUD, their false submissions were unarguably a function of MAGI\u2019s fraud, and MAGI and the appellants were commonly controlled. It was uncontested at summary judgment in the Court of Federal Claims that MAGI and Wilshire had the same president, the same sole director, and the same sole shareholder. (Defendant\u2019s Supplemental Proposed Findings of Fact, <em>Christopher Vill., L.P. v. United States, </em>No. 99-775C (Fed.Cl.) (citing, among other things, the appellants\u2019 1992, 1993, and 1995 rent increase requests, which listed MAGI as a limited partner of Christopher Village).) We think that the submission of false data generated by companies under common control with the contractor constitutes a material breach as a matter of law at least when the commonly controlled company generated those data in a conscious effort to defraud the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Case law regarding the materiality requirement under the False Statements Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2000), is instructive in this respect. This Act imposes a criminal penalty on \u201cwhoever ... knowingly or willfully ... makes any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations\u201d to a government agency. <em>Id. </em>Courts are generally in agreement that the Act only imposes liability for material misstatements, and that \u201c[t]he test of the materiality of a statement is whether a statement has a natural tendency to influence, or was capable of influencing, the decision of the tribunal in making a determination required to be made.\u201d <em>United States v. DiFonzo, </em>603 F.2d 1260, 1266 (7th Cir.1979), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1018, 100 S.Ct. 672, 62 L.Ed.2d 648 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Krause, </em>507 F.2d 113, 118 (5th Cir.1975); <em>United States v. Deep, </em>497 F.2d 1316, 1321 (9th Cir.1974) (explaining that the materiality test asks whether the false statement \u201ccould affect or influence the exercise of governmental functions, \u2014 does it have a natural tendency to influence or is it capable of influencing agency decision\u201d (citing <em>United States v. East, </em>416 F.2d 351, 353 (9th Cir.1969)); <em>Blake v. United States, </em>323 F.2d 245, 246 (8th Cir.1963); <em>Gonzales v. United States, </em>286 F.2d 118, 122 (10th Cir.1960)). This authority suggests that efforts to defraud the government that are or may be successful are particularly culpable. Here, the appellants submission of Inflated insurance costs directly influenced HUD in making a determination [it was] required to ... ma[ke], <em>see DiFonzo, </em>603 F.2d at 1266. The whole purpose of these submissions was to influence HUDs determination on the appellants rent increase requests. For example, when the appellants submitted their final rent increase request in 1995, their accompanying letter stated that [t]he reasons for the proposed rent increase are as follows ... Increase in salaries, by adding the position of a service coordinator, and <em>property insurance, </em>and utility rates. (App. at 2801) (emphasis added). The false statements were successful in securing rent increases. Thus, the appellants committed a material breach as a matter of law by submitting false data that was generated by MAGI, a company under common control, in a successful effort to defraud the government. This breach of contract was plainly material.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The appellants also contend that the MAGI illegal kickback scheme cannot form the basis of a prior material breach by the appellants because the government was unaware of this scheme at the time of HUD\u2019s alleged breach. Our precedent, however, clearly supports the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 finding that the appellants\u2019 prior breach excused HUD\u2019s subsequent breach \u201ceven though the U.S. government was not aware of the facts at the time of the foreclosure at issue in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>litigation.\u201d <em>Christopher Vill., </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 189. For example, in <em>Joseph Morton </em>the question was whether the contractor was properly terminated for default based on information later discovered by the government. <em>See </em>757 F.2d at 1275. A few years after the default termination, the contractor was convicted of conspiring to defraud the government by submitting false cost statements under the contract, related to a period before the default termination. <em>Id. </em>We held that the interceding events justified the default termination because \u201c[i]t is settled law that a party can justify a termination if there existed at the time an adequate cause, even if then unknown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1277 (quoting <em>Pots Unlimited, Ltd. v. United States, </em>220 Ct.Cl. 405, 600 F.2d 790, 793 (1979)); <em>see also Kelso v. Kirk Bros. Mech. Contractors, Inc., </em>16 F.3d 1173, 1175 (Fed.Cir.1994) (\u201cThis court sustains a default termination if justified by circumstances at the time of termination, regardless of whether the Government originally removed the contractor for another reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Finally, the appellants argue that even assuming that the MAGI illegal kickback scheme constituted a material breach on their part, two other agreements that were part of the MAGI settlement prohibit the government from relying on that breach as a defense in the present litigation. While Wilshire was not a party to the Plea Agreement, it was a party to the Administrative Agreement and the Consent Judgment, executed at the same time. In support of this contention, the appellants urge that both agreements bar the government\u2019s defense. The appellants point to the provision of the Administrative Agreement that states, \u201cHUD will not seek civil money penalties ... for any conduct alleged as the basis for liability in the civil or criminal action, for the financial defaults resulting in the foreclosure of HUD properties prior to the date of this Agreement.\u201d (App. at 253.) The appellants also highlight the provision of the Consent Judgment that states that the Government agreed to \u201crelease All Defendants from any administrative monetary or civil monetary claim that the United States or HUD has or may have under ... any ... statute[s] or common law theories creating causes of action for civil damages or civil penalties for submitting or causing to be submitted claims to the government, for the Covered Conduct.\u201d (App. at 234-35.) We disagree. The Court of Federal Claims properly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-8\">[Wjhile the United States agreed to forego taking any further <em>affirmative </em>enforcement actions \u2014 to either seek further penalties or to continue to press affirmative suits \u2014 against Wilshire, the Global Settlement says nothing regarding the government\u2019s ability to <em>defend </em>itself from claims levied by parties involved in the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-9\"><em>Christopher Vill., </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 191 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">We conclude that the Court of Federal Claims correctly decided that the appellants engaged in a material breach of the Regulatory Agreement and the HAP Contract prior to HUD\u2019s assumed breach. We also agree that the Court of Federal Claims correctly decided that this breach barred the appellants from recovering on the government\u2019s breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Finally, there is the question whether the Court of Federal Claims properly denied class certification. As we held in <em>Greenbrier v. United States, </em>193 F.3d 1348 (Fed.Cir.1999), the appellants\u2019 class certification \u201cissue is moot in light of our holdings that the government is not liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>the [appellants] for breach of contract.\" Id. at 1360; see also Gollehon Farming v. United States, 207 F.3d 1373, 1382 (Fed. Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">For the foregoing reasons we affirm the Court of Federal Claims' grant of summary judgment in favor of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"axg-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-5\">. These factors include: (1) whether the class is large but manageable; (2) whether there is a question of law common to the whole class; (3) whether the common question of law predominates over individual questions of fact; (4) whether the plaintiff\u2019s claim is typical of those claimed by the class; (5) whether the government\u2019s action is generally applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>the class; (6) whether the claims of the class members are too small to be pursued individually; (7) whether the plaintiff will adequately represent the class; and (8) whether individual actions would create the risk of varying adjudications. <em>Christopher Vill., </em>50 Fed.Cl. at 643 (citing <em>Quinault, </em>453 F.2d at 1272).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-4\">. In <em>Consolidated Edison, </em>we explained that this conclusion was consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Bowen. </em>In <em>Bowen, </em>the Court held that the Court of Federal Claims does not always present an \u201cadequate remedy\" to defeat APA jurisdiction in suits for monetary relief, reasoning that it was \u201cnot willing to assume, categorically, that a naked money judgment against the United States will always be an adequate substitute for prospective relief....\u201d 487 U.S. at 905, 108 S.Ct. 2722. However, we held in <em>Consolidated Edison </em>that <em>\"Bowen ... </em>does not enunciate a broad rule that the Court of Federal Claims cannot supply an adequate remedy in any case seeking injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Consol.

Rather, <em>Bowen </em>\"linked its judgment to a specific set of circumstances\u201d where the monetary relief sought implicated the potential for prospective relief as well and \u201dinvolv[ed] state governmental activities that a district court would be in a better position to understand and evaluate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1384 (quoting <em>Bowen, </em>487 U.S. at 907-08, 108 S.Ct. 2722).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b847-5\">.
