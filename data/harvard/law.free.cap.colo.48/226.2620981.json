But that after making provision for the payment of my indebtedness and the'interest thereon, taxes, insurance and the expenses of my executorship, that the said money, the proceeds of my said property, shall from time to time be paid over to my wife, one-half and to my children, in equal parts of the remaining half for their maintenance and education; and I hereby appoint my wife Martha J.

Allen and George E. Crater, Jr., an undivided one-half interest in thei property in dispute, which title, whatever it is, later, and on the 22nd day of July, 1896, passed, by mesne conveyances, to John B. Killgore. On April 23,1902, Killgore began this suit in the district court of the city and county of Denver for possession of that undivided one-h\u00e1lf interest in the property so conveyed. For a first answer the defendants, except Albert Smith and Albert Smith, trustee, who plead separately, denied each and every allegation of the complaint. For a second answer they set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>substance, that William H. H. Cranmer died seized and in possession of the premises in question; that be left a last will and testament; that tbe same bad been duly probated and passed to record in tbe will records of tbe proper county; that Martha J. Cranmer, the widow of the deceased, had elected to accept, and did accept, the terms and conditions thereof, and as widow took, as heir and devisee under its provisions; thaj; letters testamentary thereunder issued to the executors named in the will; that they qualified as such, accepted the trust imposed thereby, and entered upon their duties as such executors and trustees; that the defendants Charles J. Hughes, Jr., and Martha J. Cranmer, the sole remaining and surviving executors and trustees under the will, are vested with title to all of the property, real and personal, including that in controversy, left by the defendant; that the youngest of the children left surviving had not yet attained her majority, which is admitted; that the estate has been, ever since the death of the deceased, and still is, under the terms and provisions of his last will and testament, in the course of administration; that the executors have not parted with the title to any of the property, real or personal, which the deceased left; and that the widow and children are in possession of the premises in controversy, under the right, title and possession of the defendants, Charles J. Hughes, Jr., and Martha J. Cranmer, as the sole remaining executors and trustees under the will. The defendants, Albert Smith and Albert Smith, trustee, claim title to this undivided one-half interest in controversy, through execution sale against Martha J. Cranmer and sheriff\u2019s deed thereunder, and that he is trustee for no one save himself, but as his rights are not involved in this appeal, in either capacity, they are neither discussed nor considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>On, May 10, 1906, trial was had to the court with a jury, and the court, among other things, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, made the following findings upon the pleadings and evidence, to wit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">\u201cFirst: That if the plaintiff has shown any interest or title to the property in controversy, such interest or title will not enable him to maintain an action for possession during the lifetime of the trust created by the will of William H. H. Cranmer, offered in evidence, and that such trust has not yet expired;</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">\u201cSecond: That the action of the plaintiff is premature,- and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\">\u201cThird: That the final disposition of this cause does not require determination or adjudication of the validity of any of the instruments offered in evidence by the plaintiff, nor of the interest or title of the plaintiff, if any, in and to the property in controversy, nor of the title or interest, if any, of the defendants Albert Smith and Albert Smith, Trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-9\">Thereupon the court instructed a verdict in favor of the defendants, and upon such verdict, on motion of defendants, ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain this action, and dismissed it. Plaintiff brings that judgment here for review.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-10\">Mr. Justice Bailey</author>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">The court below determined the single question, as to whether the deed from Martha J. Cranmer, even though valid and conveying title in fee, matters not passed upon by the trial court, or here, carried a present right of possession, in view of the provisions of the will and the evident purpose and intent, as therein and thereby expressed, of the testator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The findings below in this behalf conform precisely to onr views, respecting the construction of the will to this point, and we can do no better than adopt them as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Whatever right, title or interest the parties to this suit have or claim, in and to the property in controversy, comes solely by, through and under the provisions of the will, nearly every paragraph of which breathes forth a fixed and settled purpose and intention on the part of deceased to keep his entire property intact, inviolate and undivided for years. By the terms of this instrument his purpose to leave the present possession and enjoyment of his entire estate in the hands of his executors is so manifest that none may, upon any ordinary or reasonable construction thereof, entertain the slightest doubt. The right to sell, lease, mortgage, manage and control all of the property of the testator, real or personal, is full and unrestricted, except only as to the block and lots at Seventeenth and Curtis streets, Denver, not here involved. Force and effect can be given such power and authority except only upon the theory that the present use and enjoyment be exclusively in the executors. By the express terms of the will it is specifically directed that the property shall not be divided until the youngest of the children of the testator shall have become of age. Further, always expressly subject to the terms and conditions of the will and to the powers, duties, rights and authorities of the executors thereof, the property is demised to the wife and the children, to the widow an undivided one-half, and the other one-half to the children in equal undivided parts; it is specifically provided that such interests shall not be received and shall not vest, until the youngest of the children then living shall have obtained its majority. Thus by this, the eighth paragraph of the will,.the possession and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>joyment in the heirs and devisees of all of the decedent\u2019s property, including that in suit, is clearly postponed to a future day, no matter what may be finally determined as to whether the fee vested immediately, upon which latter question we offer no opinion.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Avu\">Rehearing denied July 5, A. D. 1910.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We have no hesitancy in declaring that, under the terms and provisions of the will, at the time of the commencement of this action and its trial, the right to the exclusive possession and enjoyment of the property in question was in the executors, and would so remain until the execution of the trust, when the youngest child obtained her majority. To hold otherwise would be to strip the executors of all power and authority to carry out the terms and provisions of that instrument definitely imposed. These terms and provisions are so specific to this end, that we regard citation of authorities, or further discussion, unnecessary, for to conclude, with absolute certainty, that plaintiff\u2019s action was premature, one has but to read and consider the terms and provisions of the will, giving them their obvious and common sense meaning. The judgment of the court in dismissing the action, because it was prematurely brought, was right, and is accordingly affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Chief Justice Steele and Mr. Justice Musser concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
