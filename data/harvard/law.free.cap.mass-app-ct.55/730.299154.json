After a high speed chase, the front-seat passenger bolted from the car and threw a gun, subsequently retrieved by police, into some bushes. Although the police tried to follow the passenger, he disappeared after leaping over one fence and climbing another. Subsequently apprehended, the defendant was charged with possession of a firearm without a license and receiving a firearm with knowledge that the serial number had been removed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His main defense at trial was misi-dentification, a contention buttressed by a claim of alibi, testified to by his mother, and by his alleged inability, because of an automobile accident in October, 1995, to navigate the fences in question.</p>\n<p id=\"AyO\">Shortly after his conviction of possession of a firearm without a license, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, claiming that the jury were subjected to extraneous influences because a juror had visited the area in which the fences were located. Because the affidavit in support of the motion was based on totem-pole hearsay, the motion was denied without prejudice by a judge who was not the trial judge, the latter having retired. After obtaining another affidavit, some two years later, the defendant renewed his motion for a new trial, but the motion and also his request for an evidentiary hearing were denied by a second motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"AANT\">The defendant appeals from his conviction and from the denial of his motion for a new trial and his motion for an evi-dentiary hearing on the question of juror misconduct. In his direct appeal, the defendant claims error in the admission of evidence suggesting he was a member of a gang and in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance to enable him to obtain expert medical testimony as to his disability. In his appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial, he claims error in the refusal of the second motion judge to grant an evidentiary hearing or a new trial in light of the affidavit of a coworker of a juror that the defendant contends raised a sufficient \u201csuggestion that there were extraneous matters in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 203 (1979). While we find no error in the actions of the trial judge challenged by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>defendant, we agree that an evidentiary hearing should have been held to determine whether extraneous matters were before the jury and, if so, whether the defendant was prejudiced. See <em>id. </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">1. <em>Suggestion of gang membership. </em>Prior to trial, the prosecutor informed the judge that she intended to ask the police why they had followed the defendant; the anticipated answer was that the defendant \u201chung out\u201d in an area where \u201ckids\u201d had a problem with \u201ckids\u201d in the Academy Homes project and the car in which the defendant was riding was headed toward Academy Homes. The prosecutor considered the evidence relevant to show that the police had cause to follow the defendant and to support the police identification of the defendant. The judge indicated that he would permit the inquiry, but ruled that no mention of gangs was to be made. The term \u201cgang\u201d was not used at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The defendant objected to the pretrial ruling and objected again at trial when, as expected, police officers repeated and elaborated on the explanation of the prosecutor. They testified that while they were patrolling an area of the Roxbury section of Boston on August 10, 1996, in an unmarked car, they recognized the defendant in the front passenger seat of another car as being a youth from the Columbia Road area, although at the time they had forgotten his name. Asked why they had followed the car, one of the officers explained that the youths from the Columbia Road area were affiliated with the youths from In-tervale Street, and that there was \u201can ongoing feud of the kids from Intervale Street and Academy Homes Housing Development .... When I saw the defendant I decided to follow the vehicle since they were heading in the area of the Academy Homes Housing Development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The defendant, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Wolcott, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 209-211 (1990), claims that here, as in Wolcott, the testimony of the police and closing argument \u201cinsinuated that the events at issue were motivated by gang relationships without any actual proof of gangs or gang activity.\u201d That case is not apposite. As the author of Wolcott, Justice Kaplan, pointed out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 299 (1999), in <em>Wolcott </em>\u2014 unlike in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>present defendant\u2019s (Philyaw\u2019s) trial \u2014\u201c \u2018gangs\u2019 were mentioned and dwelt on so as to prey on a jury\u2019s anxious fears of unpoliceable violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The evidence was relevant. It explained why the police followed the car in which the defendant was a passenger. \u201c[A]n arresting or investigating officer shbuld not be put in the false position of seeming just to have happened upon the scene; he should be allowed some explanation of, his presence and conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 393 (1992), quoting from McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 249, at 734 (3d ed. 1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the evidence supported the identification of the defendant by police, an issue crucial to the trial. That the police immediately decided to follow the d\u00e9fendant and, also, that when they returned to the police station, they were able to identify the defendant from arrays of youths from the Columbia Road area, lent credence to their identification of him as being from the Columbia Road area. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Best, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 727-728 (2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">\u201cEvidence is relevant if it has a rational tendency to prove a material issue. Whether evidence is relevant in any particular instance, and whether the probative value of relevant evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, are questions within the sound discretion of the judge. . . . The judge\u2019s determination of these questions will be upheld on appeal absent palpable error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-11\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smiley, </em>431 Mass. 477, 484 (2000) (citations omitted). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">2. <em>Denial of continuance. </em>Both the docket and the transcript indicate that on May 15, 1998, the case was set for trial for the week of June 8. On June 10, the parties were notified that trial would begin on June 11. In calling the case on June 11, the clerk stated: \u201cPer the request of [counsel for the defendant] the matter was sent to the Regional Administrative Judge on her mo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>tian to continue. And that motion was denied and the case was referred back to this session for trial.\u201d Immediately after the clerk\u2019s opening statement, the defendant\u2019s counsel again sought a continuance, this time from the trial judge, saying she was \u201ctotally unprepared\u201d for trial, that she had only found out the day before that the case was called for trial on June 11 and that \u201cthe whole issue in the matter, in fact, is whether or not the defendant was able to run away from the police officers given his medical condition at the time.\u201d Also, she had not spoken to the medical witnesses since August. The trial judge denied the motion stating he was unable to allow the motion in view of the denial of the continuance by the regional administrative judge. When the defendant again attempted to renew the motion for continuance after jury empanelment, the judge pointed out that defense counsel\u2019s appearance had been filed for two years. Although defense counsel stated that she needed the testimony of a therapist at Roxbury Medical Associates, a therapist at Mattapan and Dorchester Medical Associates, and two doctors, she did not know whether the witnesses were still available, and she did not proffer the content of their testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The defendant makes no claim with respect to the denial of his motion by the regional administrative judge, and the record does not disclose what arguments were made to that judge. We need not consider whether the trial judge was constrained by the decision of the regional administrative judge because, in any event, we view the judge\u2019s comment concerning the length of time that counsel had represented the defendant as indicating that if he had been free to act, he would have denied the renewed motion. Treating the decision of the trial judge as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>discretionary one, as does the defendant, we decline to overturn it, as a judge\u2019s action in the matter of a continuance \u201cwill not be disturbed unless there is a patent abuse of discretion,\u201d that is, unless the decision \u201cis shown to be arbitrary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryer, </em>398 Mass. 9, 15 (1986). Continuances are to be granted \u201conly when necessary to prevent injustice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>428 Mass. 623, 627 (1999). See Mass.R.Crim.P. 10(a)(1), (2), 378 Mass. 861 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">\u201cIn considering a request for a continuance, a trial judge should balance the movant\u2019s need for additional time against the possible inconvenience, increased costs, and prejudice which may be incurred by the opposing party if the motion is granted . . . [and] also give due weight to the interest of the judicial system in avoiding delays which would not measurably contribute to the resolution of a particular controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilchrest, </em>364 Mass. 272, 276-277 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryer, </em>398 Mass. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Here, the defendant presented the judge \u201conly with the bare allegation of necessity\u201d and did not proffer even \u201ca general representation and description of the testimony to be offered,\u201d a proffer held inadequate in <em>Bryer, supra. </em>The availability of the witnesses was even much in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This \u201crelatively simple case had been pending for some time,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryer, supra </em>at 15, there had been numerous continuances, and counsel had not been diligent in obtaining witnesses, see Mass. R.Crim.P. 10(a)(2)(C). There was no error in the denial of the motion for a continuance on the day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">3. <em>Juror misconduct. </em>On August 13, 1998, at a nonevidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s first motion for a new trial, he presented an affidavit from his mother stating that approximately two days after his sentencing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> she received a telephone call from a friend, Clarence Harrell. He informed her that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>had a conversation with a fellow employee at the Gillette Corporation, who, it turned out, had been a juror in the defendant\u2019s case. The mother\u2019s affidavit averred that Harrell had asked the juror, \u201cWhy did you send an innocent kid to jail?\u201d After discussing the case at some length, the juror concluded by saying, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t come to a decision, so the rest of the jurors sent one juror to take a view of the scene of the crime,\u201d and his observations were shared with the rest of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">At the hearing on the defendants first motion for a new trial, the prosecutor argued that the affidavit of the mother was insufficient, saying, \u201cI think we need an affidavit from the individual who spoke directly to the juror . . . .\u201d The judge concurred and denied without prejudice the defendant\u2019s request for an evi-dentiary hearing. When asked by defense counsel whether she would take a different view if Harrell\u2019s affidavit were obtained, the judge answered: \u201cIt seems to me that that\u2019s the person.\u201d The judge added, \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to the juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">New counsel procured Harrell\u2019s affidavit, which was dated October 3, 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">\u201cI work at the Gillette Company in South Boston. In June of 1998, I spoke with [an identified person], a coworker of mine at Gillette. She told me that she had been a juror in the trial of Damyel Philyaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">\u201cShe stated that during the trial two men serving on the jury had gone to the scene of the chase described in the trial to look at the fence. The men reported back to the jury that it was possible for the defendant to jump over the fence because they had looked at the area. [The identified person] no longer works at Gillette.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">With Harrell\u2019s affidavit in hand, and relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 201-204 (1979), the defendant\u2019s new counsel filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing and an amended motion for a new trial. The motions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>denied by a second motion judge without a hearing and without explanation. While the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing is a discretionary one, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>395 Mass. 149, 151 (1985) (trial judge has broad discretion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>393 Mass. 367, 391 (1984) (motion judge who is not the trial judge has discretion), the relevant factors determining whether a hearing should be held are the seriousness of the issue and the adequacy of the showing on the issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257-258 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The seriousness of the alleged misconduct is unquestionable. \u201cLitigants are entitled to a decision on the evidence at trial, governed by the rules of evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. at 197, and, \u201c[wjhile the jury may leaven its deliberations with its wisdom and experience, in doing so it must not bring extra <em>facts </em>into the jury room\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>429 F.2d 1019, 1023 (5th Cir.), modified on rehearing, 434 F.2d 831 (1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 922 (1971). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>392 Mass. 28, 40 (1984). Under our cases the taking of an unauthorized view by one or more jurors has long been considered an extraneous matter, <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Worcester, Leicester, &amp; Spencer St. Ry., </em>157 Mass. 579, 581-583 (1893), and one which is of a \u201cvery serious\u201d nature. <em>Markee </em>v. <em>Biasetti, </em>410 Mass. 785, 788 (1991). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 637 (1993) (\u201cpotentially serious\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coles, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 463, 468 (1998) (\u201cpotentially serious\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The showing that is required in these cases appears to be that expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>395 Mass. at 151-152: \u201cThe party seeking judicial investigation must make a <em>color-able showing </em>that an extrinsic influence may have had an impact upon the jury\u2019s impartiality\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guisti, </em>434 Mass. 245, 251 (2001), sets forth the same standard. \u201cIn other words, there must be something more than mere speculation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>395 Mass. at 152. \u201cPostverdict interview[s] should be initiated only if the court finds some suggestion that there were extraneous matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. at 203.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The defendant has, in our view, made such a showing under our cases, and we note that, in the cases cited to us or those we have found, an evidentiary hearing was either held or required (or a new trial ordered) where, postconviction, the alleged extraneous matter first brought to attention was that one or more jurors had taken a view prior to verdict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s arguments that the defendant\u2019s showing Was inadequate are unpersuasive. It claims, inter alla, not only that Harrell\u2019s affidavit is double hearsay, but also that orneases require direct communications from jurors before permitting juror questioning. There is no such requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guisti, </em>434 Mass. at 250 &amp; n.6, 253 (New York attorney who had seen juror\u2019s e-mail messages sent a letter to Committee for Public Counsel Services informing of the misconduct); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>556 F.2d 599, 601-602 (1st Cir. 1977) (affidavit of a reporter who had attended trial stating that he had seen what appeared to be a newspaper under the arm of a juror and, after the trial, several jurors had told him that the jury had discussed earlier publicity concerning the defendants\u2019 State prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Moreover, the policy behind the reluctance to question jurors has no application to first questioning Harrell. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>556 F.2d at 602. In view of the first motion judge\u2019s admonition not to talk to any juror, counsel for the defendant, who had \u201cwithout solicitation obtained] information suggesting that \u2018extraneous matters\u2019 were brought into the jury delibera-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>tians,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. at 203, could not investigate further. Compare <em>ibid. </em>While not conclusive, we also note that, at the hearing before the first motion judge, both the judge <em>and the prosecutor </em>thought that an appropriate affidavit from Harrell, although hearsay, would be a sufficient basis for an evidentiary hearing. \u201cWhere a verdict [may be] the product of misconduct based on extraneous matter, an inflexible rule that bars the best evidence of that misconduct does not serve the interests of providing a fair and just trial for litigants.\u201d <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. at 197 (albeit speaking about evidence from jurors). See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>160 Mass. 395, 397-398 (1894), where a deputy sheriff who had charge of a jury was permitted to testify as to what he heard was said and done by the jury (they had decided the case by lot), the court stating, at 398:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">\u201cIf, on grounds of public policy, the affidavits or the testimony of jurors concerning what took place in the jury room is excluded, as well as evidence of their subsequent declarations on the subject, still we are of opinion that independent evidence should be admitted, and that the consequences to be apprehended from admitting such evidence are less harmful than the consequences of forbidding all inquiry into such a matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s other contentions are also unconvincing. That Harrell was a friend of the defendant\u2019s mother, that he seemed reluctant or at least dilatory in providing an affidavit, or that the affidavit differed somewhat from the mother\u2019s affidavit in that two jurors, rather than one, took a view is not reason to dismiss the affidavit out of hand where such a serious and specific intrusion of extraneous matter is claimed. In contrast to the claims in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 261 (1996), or <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McQuade, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 827, 833-834 (1999), the misconduct here is not vague or general; the affidavit avers that \u201cspecific facts not mentioned at trial concerning ... the matter in litigation were brought to the attention of the deliberating jury . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. at 200. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, the nature of the fences was most relevant in determining whether the defendant could scale them in view of his medical condition after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>automobile accident See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. at 637 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In sum, the motion judge\u2019s \u201cdenial of the motion without conducting any investigation, not even questioning [Harrell], let alone the jurors, was an . . . insufficient response to the serious matters raised by the allegations of the affidavit.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>556 F.2d at 602. The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing. As prescribed by <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. at 201, at the hearing the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the jury were in fact exposed to the extraneous matter. The judge in his or her discretion may decide first to hear Harrell, or to conduct an inquiry including one or more jurors. If the judge finds that the extraneous matter was introduced, the burden then shifts to the Commonwealth to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not prejudiced by the extraneous matter. If the findings at the evidentiary hearing indicate that the jury were exposed to extraneous matter and the Commonwealth does not meet its burden, the defendant shall be entitled to a new trial. Otherwise, the motion for a new trial should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-30\">The defendant was acquitted of the latter charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-13\">The defendant claims that the police did not need this explanation because the car they were following subsequently committed a traffic violation by making a turn without signaling. This led to an attempt by the police to pull the car over and, when that failed, to the high speed chase. The traffic violation might explain the police chase but it would not provide evidence of the initial identification of the defendant in the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\">While denying the motion for a continuance, the judge indicated that at the time the defendant needed the witnesses, he would recess the trial overnight. He also ordered the clerk to have the police serve summonses to the defendant\u2019s witnesses. It turned out that the subpoena with regard to Roxbury Medical Associates could not be served (defense counsel stated the office had apparently moved), but the therapist\u2019s records were brought and admitted in evidence. Also admitted was a letter from Roxbury Medical Associates to the attorney representing the defendant in the matter of his automobile accident, which stated that it was a \u201cfinal medical report.\u201d The physicians could not be served. The therapist at Mattapan and Dorchester Medical Associates, the defendant\u2019s mother, and his probation officer testified concerning the accident and the defendant\u2019s physical condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Not only was there no showing of prejudice to the trial judge, but in the absence of an offer of proof as to the testimony of the witnesses and in view of the evidence that was admitted as to the defendant\u2019s injuries, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>there is also no showing of prejudice on this appeal.
