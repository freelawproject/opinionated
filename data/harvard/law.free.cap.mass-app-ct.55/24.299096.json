On appeal, the plaintiffs make two claims: (1) the permit is invalid both because a zoning board member resigned before the board\u2019s decision was filed with the town clerk and because an administrative assistant signed as proxy that member\u2019s signature on the board\u2019s decision; and (2) the permit violates the town\u2019s by-laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\"><em>Facts. </em>On September 26, 1999, DiVirgilio filed his application for a special permit to allow construction of a supplemental apartment to his single-family house. The apartment was to be located over the garage and it was to contain a living room, kitchen, and bedroom. A door on the side of the garage would lead to interior stairs to the apartment, and an exterior stairway that was to be on the back, leading to a deck and then to the ground, would provide a second means of egress. An attic measuring twenty-one feet by twenty-five feet \u2014 the same dimensions as the apartment \u2014 would exist above the apartment for storage use by tenants. All three members of the zoning board, Ed Sunderland, John Ryan, and Susan Woglom, conducted a site visit and were present at the public hearing held on January 7, 1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board voted unanimously at that hearing to approve the special permit, upon the condition that the house be owner occupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Sometime between this vote of approval and February 1, 1999, the board\u2019s administrative assistant, Lynda Faye, drafted a \u201cZoning Permit\u201d and a \u201cDecision\u201d to reflect what had occurred at the January 7 hearing. Members Sunderland and Ryan signed the \u201cDecision,\u201d while Woglom authorized Faye via telephone to sign it on her behalf. The decision was filed with the town clerk\u2019s office on February 1, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In a letter dated December 28, 1998, Woglom had notified the town select board that she planned to be out of the country for the next year. She wrote, \u201cI will be out of the country from January 1999 to January 2000, and ask that you appoint a temporary replacement for my seat on the Zoning Board of Appeals for that period.\u201d The town clerk received the letter on January 11, 1999, and, in a letter dated January 11, 1999, the chair of the select board appointed a <em>\u201ctemporary Alternate member of the Zoning Board of Appeals </em>... a one year appointment beginning on January 11, 1999 and expiring on January 1, 2000\u201d (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The named plaintiffs appealed to the District Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge rejected the claim that the special permit was invalid because of Woglom-related concerns and also rejected the claim that the grant of the special permit would cause increased vehicular traffic and a diminution of the neighborhood\u2019s residential character and property values. He accordingly found that the grant was in harmony with the purpose and intent of the town by-law and discerned no basis in fact or law for annulling the board\u2019s decision. The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\"><em>Discussion. Validity of special permit. </em>General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 9, requires that a special permit granting authority \u2014 here, the board \u2014 take final action on an application for a special permit within ninety days (unless otherwise extended) of the public hearing on such application. Final action within the meaning of \u00a7 9 occurs when the board records the result of its vote concerning the application with the town clerk. <em>Board of Aldermen of Newton </em>v. <em>Maniace, </em>429 Mass. 726, 731 (1999). In like manner, \u00a7 11 requires that the board, upon the grant of a special permit, issue to the special permit applicant a copy of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>decision, certified by the special permit granting authority and, inter alla, certifying that copies of the decision have been filed with the town clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The plaintiffs do not question the timeliness of the filing of the board\u2019s decision with the town clerk. They contend instead that the special permit was infirm because Woglom was not a member of the board on February 1, 1999, the date the decision was filed with the town clerk. The trial judge rejected this contention because he determined that Woglom, on that date, \u201cwas a duly appointed alternate member of the Zoning Board of Appeals, who had been granted a temporary leave from her duties. Therefore, the decision filed on such date had full force and [effect].\u201d Woglom\u2019s legal status on February 1, 1999, is not dispositive of the issue, however, because the relevant date for ascertaining the validity of the permit is instead January 7, 1999, the date when the board approved the special permit at a public hearing. On that date, Woglom\u2019s status as a member of the board is unquestioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>Yaro </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 587, 590 (1980), we interpreted the open meeting law as requiring a zoning board to deliberate and arrive at its decision under public observation. After such a decision occurs, the filing of the decision is a necessary but ministerial act, simply memorializing the action taken at the meeting. See <em>id. </em>at 591 (\u201c[The law does] not require a board to hold a public hearing for purposes of reducing to writing a decision reached at a meeting which was open to the public and where accurate records of the meeting are kept and the substance of the decision was made known to the public\u201d). Cf. <em>Kay-Vee Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Ludlow, </em>355 Mass. 165, 168 (1969) (final action is complete under subdivision control law when board files a certificate of decision, which is a \u201c \u2018written assurance or official representation, that some act has or has not been done, or some event occurred, or some legal formality [has] been complied with.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [4th ed.]\u201d). Compare <em>Mullin </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brewster, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 144 (1983). The decision and statement of reasons filed cannot vary in substance from the decision taken at the meeting. See <em>Tenneco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>City Council of Springfield, </em>406 Mass. 658, 659-660 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(1990). Thus, where a decision filed simply mirrors the result voted upon at a valid board meeting, as here, the disability of a member subsequent to the meeting does not render the decision void.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">It is uncontroverted that Woglom was a member of the board as of January 7, 1999, the date the board voted to approve DiVirgilio\u2019s application. The decision that was filed thereafter, with her approval, was not infirm even if Woglom was not at the time an active board member. Cf. <em>Nessralla </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>403 Mass. 757, 761 (1989) (judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that were drafted before resignation, but not issued in final typed form until after resignation, were not invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>Signature. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the clerk\u2019s certificate was illegal because it was signed by Faye at Woglom\u2019s behest is without merit, especially given the lack of any statutory edict that the decision be signed by all members. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11; <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Belmont, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1181, 1182 (1989). See also Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 27 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\"><em>By-laws. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the special permit conflicts with the town\u2019s zoning by-laws insofar as the gross floor area of the supplemental apartment exceeds the 600-foot maximum if either the square footage of the staircase or of the attic had been included in the calculation, as plaintiffs argue should have occurred. The contention is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Section 5.011 of the Amherst zoning by-laws provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cSupplemental Apartment \u2014 The Board of Appeals may authorize a Special Permit . . . one supplemental apartment accessory to the use of a one-family dwelling, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">\u201c5.0110 There shall be not more than 600 square feet of gross floor area in the supplemental apartment, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">\u201c5.0111 Any one family dwelling in which a supplemental apartment is constructed shall not be used simultaneously as a Rooming House.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">\u201cGross floor area\u201d is not further defined in the by-laws, but the board, in effect, interprets the term as connoting habitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>space, as it excluded the stairs and attic from its calculation. The reasonable construction that a zoning board of appeals gives to the by-laws it is charged with implementing is entitled to deference. <em>Advanced Dev. Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blackstone, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 228, 231 (1992). See <em>Livoli </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Southborough, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922-923 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The board\u2019s interpretation here is, we think, entirely reasonable, especially given the relatively meager size of the maximum square footage. See <em>ibid, </em>(board\u2019s interpretation of the town bylaw is literally correct and not contextually an unreasonable one). The plaintiffs refer us to <em>Leominster Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>243 Mass. 126, 127 (1922) (\u201ca lease of a floor or story of a building includes its outer walls\u201d), for the proposition that the exterior staircase must be included within the relevant calculation because it is enclosed within the building\u2019s outside walls. That case, however, deals with landlord-tenant relations, and, we think, is without bearing upon the reasonableness of a zoning board\u2019s interpretation of its town\u2019s zoning by-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The plaintiffs allege that the trial judge erred in concluding that they lacked standing to pursue an appeal of the zoning board decision. Although defendant DiVirgilio invited the judge to make such a ruling, it is not at all plain from the decision that the judge in fact made a determination that the plaintiffs\u2019 presumptive standing had been rebutted. See <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719 (1996). Although both parties briefed the issue, we do not reach it given our disposition of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">A prior public hearing on the requested special permit, spread over three nights, was determined to be invalid because of insufficient public notice. The board held a new hearing, which was noticed by publication and mailed to parties in interest. Between the two sets of hearings, the homeowner\u2019s plan was amended to reduce the number of parking spaces from three to two, to increase the density and height of the natural screening of the parking area, and to enclose the stairway leading to the supplemental apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
