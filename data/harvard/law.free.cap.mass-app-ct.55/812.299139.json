The husband also appeals from an order of the court directing him to pay to the wife attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>fees in the amount of $25,000. We affirm the judgment and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>By a judgment of divorce nisi that was entered on September 23, 1982, the parties were ordered to comply with the terms of an agreement that was incorporated and merged in the judgment. The agreement provided, among other things, that the wife would have physical custody of the three minor children of the marriage and that the husband would \u201cpay to the [wjife the sum of $225 per week for alimony and support.\u201d The agreement made no specific provision for the termination of the alimony and child support obligation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The wife filed a first complaint for modification on June 25, 1990, alleging that the husband was making substantially more money than he had been earning at the time of the entry of the divorce judgment, and that the parties\u2019 youngest minor child was a full time student. The parties entered into a written agreement, which was incorporated in a temporary order of the court on February 26, 1991, providing that \u201c[cjhild support shall be payable to the plaintiff in the amount of $275 per week,\u201d and that the wife \u201cclearly does not waive any claim to alimony and retains the right to raise the issue upon the emancipation of the remaining child. . . .\u2019\u2019No judgment was entered on the first complaint for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The present complaint for modification was filed by the wife in November, 1996, and was amended in December, 1997. The amended complaint alleged that the wife \u201cretained the right to raise the issue of alimony upon the emancipation of the remaining child,\u201d which would occur in May, 1998, and that the wife \u201cis in need of support for herself.\u201d By a temporary order that was issued on August 28, 1998, the husband\u2019s child and college support obligations were terminated, but the husband was ordered to pay $300 a week \u201cto meet the present financial needs of the wife.\u201d After a trial on the wife\u2019s amended complaint for modification, the judge made extensive findings, which we summarize below.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The husband, a college professor, is sixty-two years of age. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>The wife, a legal secretary, is fifty-eight. In 1982, the husband earned $34,000 and listed his interest in the former marital home as his only major asset. (Although the husband also had a Commonwealth of Massachusetts pension/retirement plan, the parties\u2019 agreement made no provision for the division of that asset.) The wife, who returned to work shortly before the divorce, earned $5,340 in 1982.\u2019 It appears that the wife\u2019s primary asset at that time was her interest in the former marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">As of February 26, 1991, the husband\u2019s gross weekly income from employment was $1,187.50 ($61,750 a year). The husband\u2019s financial statement reflected assets worth $164,200, including his one-half interest in the former marital residence (which the husband valued at $87,350) and his contributions to an IRA and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts retirement plan. In February, 1991, the wife\u2019s gross weekly income from earnings was $586.54 ($30,500 a year). The value of the wife\u2019s assets was $124,000, including her one-half interest in the former marital home (which she valued at $100,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">At the time of the modification trial, the husband earned $1,584 a week ($82,368 a year) in addition to weekly interest income of $22. His net weekly income amounted to $1,045. The husband\u2019s expenses, exclusive of mortgage and property tax payments<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and alimony, amounted to $752 a week. The husband\u2019s expenses included those of his current wife. The husband valued his assets, including his contributions to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts retirement system,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at $267,506. At the time of trial, the wife earned $644.24 a week ($33,500 a year), plus $70.92 in weekly interest and dividend income. Her net income, exclusive of alimony, was $764.78 a week. Her weekly expenses, exclusive of attorney\u2019s fees and income taxes, amounted to $950. The wife\u2019s assets consisted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the balance of the proceeds from the sale of the marital home ($89,006), an IRA ($12,000), and an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">In issuing the modification judgment, the judge set forth a rationale which, in summary form, indicated (a) that she had given due consideration to the parties\u2019 agreements (and the wife\u2019s retention of the right to seek alimony upon emancipation of the youngest child); (b) that even in the absence of the 1991 agreement, the loss of child support income to the wife in the amount of $14,300 a year constituted a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant consideration of her claim<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (c) that although the wife\u2019s income had increased since the divorce, it had never been sufficient to allow her to provide adequately for her own needs; (d) that the wife should not be required to deplete her own assets in order to maintain herself; and (e) that the wife required alimony in the amount of $275 a week to meet her needs and the husband had the ability to make that payment.</p>\n<p id=\"Ada\">On the wife\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses, the judge, after a hearing, ordered the husband to pay the wife $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">2. <em>Modification of alimony. </em>\u201cTo be successful in an action to modify a judgment for alimony . . . , the [plaintiff] must demonstrate a material change of circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment.\u201d <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981). See <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. 406, 411 (1988).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe change may be in the needs or the resources of the parties ... or in their respective incomes.\u201d <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 760 (1987). \u201cThe determination of the extent and palpability of such change, however, lies in large measure within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Heistand </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>Heistand, </em>384 Mass. 20, 26 (1981). <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 760. <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 223 (2002). In acting on a request for modification, the judge, of course, must weigh all relevant circumstances. See <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 78, 89 (1991). \u201cUnless there is no basis in the record for the judge\u2019s decision, we defer to the judge\u2019s evaluation of the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The husband argues that the judge erred in awarding alimony to the wife \u201cwhere the only material change of circumstances was [the loss of child support income upon the] emancipation of the youngest child and where the wife\u2019s resources were sufficient for her support.\u201d We think the husband reads too narrowly the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. While the judge makes specific reference in her findings to the emancipation of the youngest child and the wife\u2019s loss of child support, it is apparent that the judge, in reaching her decision, also had in mind the history of the proceedings and other relevant circumstances of the parties. Indeed, the judge considered the wife\u2019s request for alimony against the backdrop of the original judgment and the 1991 stipulation and temporary order. See <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 568 (2001) (\u201cWe review the findings to determine whether the judge gave appropriate consideration to the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in their [merged] written agreement . . . and to any changes in their circumstances since the last modification\u201d); <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 739, 744 n.6 (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge also compared carefully the parties\u2019 past and present financial posi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>tians, which showed that the husband\u2019s income (and the value of his assets) had increased since 1982 and 1991 and that the wife was unable to meet her needs despite the increase in her own income.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">To the extent the husband argues that the youngest child\u2019s emancipation was not unexpected and that a modification cannot be based on an anticipated event, it is enough to say that the parties agreed expressly in 1991 that the wife retained the right to raise the issue of alimony upon the emancipation of the youngest child. See <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. 635, 643-644 (1999) (\u201cA judge who modifies a divorce judgment does not write on a tabula rasa. To the extent possible, and consistent with common sense and justice, the modified judgment should take into account the earlier, expressed desires of the parties\u201d); <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 567-568. Moreover, we think it is apparent that the parties\u2019 reservation of the wife\u2019s right to revisit the question of alimony constitutes a tacit acknowledgment that the real financial circumstances of the wife could well change upon the child\u2019s emancipation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AC1\">Finally, notwithstanding the husband\u2019s assertion in his brief that the emancipation of a child \u201cby its very nature implies a <em>decrease </em>of household expenses\u201d (emphasis supplied), the husband, through counsel, acknowledged at oral argument that the emancipation of a child would not automatically compel a reduction in support. In all events, we perceive no sound reason why a child\u2019s emancipation, and the resulting loss of child support to a party, may not, in circumstances such as those presented here, be considered by a judge in determining whether there has been a material change in circumstances that would warrant the imposition of (or increase in) an order for alimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The point is suggested by our decision in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 719 n.2 (1997) (dictum),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and is consistent with the fundamental purpose of alimony, i.e., to provide economic support to the dependent spouse. See <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 760-761, citing <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 623 (1986). There is nothing in <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, supra, </em>that would require a different result in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">As for the husband\u2019s claim that the wife\u2019s resources are sufficient for her support, the judge found specifically that the wife\u2019s weekly expenses exceed substantially her weekly income and that the wife is unable to provide adequately for her needs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the wife possesses assets worth in excess of $100,000 (a portion of which, the judge found, the wife intends to use to purchase a replacement residence), the judge properly could conclude that the wife \u201cshould not be required to deplete her assets in order to maintain herself.\u201d Similarly, we perceive no error in the judge\u2019s failure to attribute income to the wife because one of the emancipated children of the marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>continues to reside with her. Indeed, there was undisputed evidence at trial that the child residing with the wife had committed herself to work for one year in a public interest job at an extremely modest salary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In view of the foregoing discussion, we cannot say that the judge abused her discretion or otherwise erred as matter of law in ordering the husband to pay to the former wife alimony in the amount of $275 a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">3. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The husband argues that the judge abused her discretion by ordering him to pay $25,000 of the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwhere the fees were not strictly conservative\u201d and the court failed to consider all of the factors set out in cases such as <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 543 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1986), and <em>Edinburg </em>v. <em>Edinburg, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 192, 198 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The judicial setting of counsel fees involves a consideration of \u201cnumerous, complex variables.\u201d See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 543. See generally 1 Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 6.4 (2d ed. 1996). It follows that much discretion must be accorded a judge in determining the necessity and amount of attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 543; <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 159 (1996). An award of counsel fees is \u201cpresumed to be right and ordinarily ought not to be disturbed.\u201d <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 39 (1982), quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>361 Mass. 733, 738 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">On review of the judge\u2019s seven-page memorandum of decision on the wife\u2019s motion for counsel fees, we are satisfied that the judge considered all relevant factors, including the ability of the wife\u2019s counsel, the work performed, the results secured, the time spent, the hourly rates, the existence of contemporaneous time records, the financial positions of the parties, and the husband\u2019s obstructionist conduct which prolonged the proceedings and caused the wife\u2019s counsel to engage in extraordinary discovery efforts. It is also clear that the court\u2019s award was grounded on \u201cstrictly conservative principles.\u201d See <em>Pemberton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>v. <em>Pemberton, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 9, 16 (1980). In the circumstances, the judge did not abuse her discretion in fashioning the order for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The modification judgment dated April 13, 1999, is affirmed. The order on motion for attorney\u2019s fees dated July 9, 1999, is affirmed. The wife\u2019s request for double costs and attorney\u2019s fees on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The agreement also contained provisions concerning the sale of the former marital home in which the wife resided. The house was eventually sold at some time subsequent to July, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The husband remarried in 1986. As the home the husband shares with his current wife is owned by her, he did not list real estate as an asset on his current financial statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Although the husband listed the current value of his contributions to the retirement plan at $98,600, the judge found that that was not the present value of his interest. See <em>Dewan </em>v. <em>Dewan, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 97, 99-100 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>399 Mass. 754 (1987), and 30 Mass. App. Ct. 133 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">At trial, the husband took the position that the court was required to \u201cconsider whether there has been a change in the parties\u2019 circumstances since the February 26, 1991 order.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cin the absence of a judgment of modification filed in connection with the complaint filed by [the wife] on June 25, 1990, the court must consider changes in circumstances which have occurred since the [d]ivorce [\u00a1Judgment of September 22, 1982, but the conclusion would in either event be the same.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Both parties have proceeded on the theory that the wife was required to demonstrate a material change in circumstances in the present case. As we have stated, the judge did, in fact, find that there had been a material change in the parties\u2019 circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b840-18\">As we have indicated, the 1982 agreement and judgment provided for unallocated alimony and child support in the amount of $225 a week (which comprised approximately 34% of the husband\u2019s gross income at the time) that was not subject to a specific termination date or event. The judge explained that pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, and absent any modificatian thereof, the wife could have continued to receive alimony after her retirement. Continuing, the court stated that the support provision of the 1982 agreement was fair and equitable in view of the length of the parties\u2019 marriage and the fact that the husband earned substantially more than the wife, who had been a homemaker throughout most of the marriage. The judge also stated that it was reasonable to assume that the parties\u2019 failure to divide the husband\u2019s pension was based on the possibility that the husband would be paying support to the wife from his retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"AYHH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>As for the parties\u2019 modification of support in 1991, the judge noted that the child support payment of $275 a week was equal to only 23% of the husband\u2019s gross income, but that it would no longer be tax deductible by the husband nor would it be included as income on the wife\u2019s tax returns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"asa-dedup-0\">Contrary to the husband\u2019s claim, the judge did not construe the reservation of rights in 1991 as a directive that the wife must be awarded alimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A3F\">The husband, through counsel, stated at oral argument that the emancipatian of a child is a relevant factor in determining whether there has been a material change in the parties\u2019 circumstances. He urged, however, that it can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>not be the sole factor upon which a judge relies. As we have discussed, the husband reads too narrowly the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\">In <em>Buckley, </em>the parties entered into an agreement whereby the wife was to have physical custody of the parties\u2019 daughter and the husband was to have physical custody of the parties\u2019 son. The parties waived past and present alimony but expressly reserved the right to claim future alimony. After the minor daughter left the home of her mother and moved in with her father, the court modified the husband\u2019s support obligation by no longer requiring him to pay to the wife child support for the daughter. On the wife\u2019s complaint for modification seeking alimony, the court ordered the husband to pay ongoing alimony in the amount of $60 a week. We stated: \u201cWhat matters in a modificatian proceeding is the current financial situation of the parties, obligations of support, and whether there has been a material change in circumstances from the time of the divorce . . . These, the trial judge considered here, noting, among other things, the loss of child support income to the wife, the husband\u2019s ability to contribute toward the wife\u2019s support, and the wife\u2019s inability to sustain herself reasonably on her current income.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 719 n.2. The husband in <em>Buckley </em>did not challenge on appeal the judge\u2019s determination that a material change in circumstances had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 722 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b842-26\">As the husband has failed to include in the record appendix the wife\u2019s financial statement filed at the time of the modification hearing, he is not in a position to challenge the judge\u2019s factual findings on the point. See <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>400 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1987). We note also that there is nothing in the judge\u2019s findings to indicate that the wife\u2019s needs were excessive or unreasonable. See <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 761 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b843-9\"> Although the child does not make a financial contribution to the wife, the wife testified that the child \u201cpays her own bills as far as clothing and that sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
