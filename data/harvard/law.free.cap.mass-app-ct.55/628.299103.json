L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, that governs the filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. There is also a tolling provision in \u00a7 41, which extends the statute of limitations if the insurer is paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the injury \u2014 even if no claim has been filed. The question presented is whether the tolling provision of \u00a7 41 applies exclusively to the claim filing for the particular injury for which the workers\u2019 compensation benefits are being paid, or whether that provision may be read to extend the time for filing a claim for a different injury. We hold that the tolling provision of \u00a7 41 is limited to the injury for which the payments are being made. Accordingly, in this case, the plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for a different injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>filed beyond the four-year limitations period, was correctly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">1. <em>Procedural and factual background. </em>The claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits that underlies this appeal arose out of a back injury occurring on October 11, 1990. The plaintiff did not file a claim for this injury with Cigna Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. (Cigna) until August 10, 1995. Cigna denied the claim for failure to file timely. Both at the time of this October, 1990, injury, and at the time the claim was filed with Cigna in August, 1995, Baker was receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. (Liberty) for another back injury arising out of a different and earlier incident that occurred on March 3, 1989.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prior Liberty claim, and the workers\u2019 compensation payments therefor, bear a short explanation to place in context the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the Liberty payments as a basis for invoking the tolling provision for the Cigna claim, and to relate the time sequence for the compensation benefits paid by Liberty, which payments continued past the date of the second injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In connection with the March 3, 1989, back injury, an \u201cemployer\u2019s first report of injury\u201d was filed with Liberty, then the insurer for Komtek Co. (Komtek), Baker\u2019s employer. Over the ensuing approximately nineteen months, Baker was sometimes able to work, but at other times he was out on disability leave. When Baker was out of work at Komtek, Liberty paid temporary total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. This pattern continued to the fall of 1990. Then, on October 11, 1990, at a time when Baker was back at work, Baker experienced severe back pain while leaning over his machine. He left that day and did not return to work thereafter. On October 23, 1990, an \u201cemployer\u2019s supplemental report of injury\u201d was filed with Liberty. This report listed a March 3, 1989, date of injury and indicated that Baker was disabled. Consistent with the date of injury cited in the report, Liberty assumed liability on the claim and treated the October 11, 1990, event as a recurrence of the March 3, 1989, back injury. Upon receipt of the report, and as in the past when Baker had been out of work due to this injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Liberty paid Baker \u00a7 34 temporary total disability payments commencing on October 12, 1990. The \u00a7 34 payments by Liberty continued until September 5, 1995, the date of exhaustion for such benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of that imminent exhaustion, in mid-1995 Baker filed a claim with Liberty for additional benefits under \u00a7 34A for permanent total disability benefits. However, rather than referencing the prior March 3, 1989, injury, this filing listed the second, October 11, 1990, injury as a predicate. In response, Liberty denied coverage because it was no longer Komtek\u2019s insurer in October, 1990. On August 10, 1995, Baker filed a new claim against Ci-gna, the successor insurer. As noted, Cigna denied coverage. Following an appeal, the administrative judge dismissed the Ci-gna claim as beyond the limitations period. This decision was affirmed by the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Baker\u2019s appeal from the reviewing board\u2019s decision was reported by the single justice to a full panel of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">2. <em>Analysis of tolling. </em>That part of the tolling provision of \u00a7 41 at issue states that \u201c[t]he payment of compensation for any injury pursuant to this chapter . . . shall toll the statute of limitations for any benefits due pursuant to this chapter for such injury.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Baker isolates the words \u201cpayment of compensation for <em>any injury\u201d </em>and contends that the Liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>payments, although attributable to the first, March 3, 1989, injury, were nonetheless payments for <em>an injury </em>under the workers\u2019 compensation chapter and thereby tolled the filing of the second claim against Cigna. Under this proffered construction, the \u00a7 41 tolling provision would not be limited to a particular injury, but rather would extend so far as to generally toll the filing requirement in any circumstance where a worker receives ongoing workers\u2019 compensations payments \u2014 even if for a different injury occurring on a different date. We believe that the definitional phrase \u201cany injury\u201d cannot be so read. That the phrase \u201cany injury\u201d is limited to the injury for which payments are being made, and that tolling applies only to that particular injury, is supported by both the text of \u00a7 41 and the broader context of the workers\u2019 compensation statute, chapter 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">We turn first to statutory terms in \u00a7 41. In that section, the phrase \u201cany injury\u201d cannot be isolated from the accompanying context. Rather, the term \u201cany injury\u201d is linked to the ensuing term \u201csuch injury,\u201d that is, the particular one for which the workers\u2019 compensation payments are being made. Even if such a connective link somehow might have been expressed more directly in \u00a7 41, we are not to lose sight of the statutory purpose underlying \u00a7 41 in favor of grammatical perfection. \u201cIf a liberal, even if not literally exact, interpretation of certain words is necessary to accomplish the purpose indicated by the words as a whole, such interpretation is to be adopted rather than one which will defeat the purpose.\u201d <em>North Shore Realty Trust </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>434 Mass. 109, 112 (2001), quoting from <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The terms in the tolling provision of \u00a7 41 must be viewed within the larger chapter 152 statutory framework. That framework reflects a calibrated balance between the notice and filing requirements that protect an insurer against surprise by the filing of indefensibly old claims, and, on the other side of the calculus, the tolling exceptions that protect an injured worker who may feel no need to pursue claim filing because the worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>is receiving payments. Thus, the statute of limitations and the interconnected tolling provision in \u00a7 41 preserve the humanitarian nature and purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation law, see <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914); <em>CNA Ins. Cos. </em>v. <em>Sliski, </em>433 Mass. 491, 493 (2001), while setting deadlines on claim filings so that an insurer will not be prejudiced by lack of notice of a claim brought forth beyond four years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he protection afforded to the insurer by these statutory provisions for prompt notice and filing of claim should not be taken from the insurer lightly . . . .\u201d <em>Clifford\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 129, 131 (1958). For a general discussion of the application of the workers\u2019 compensation limitations period, see <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 910 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Given this balancing of interests between worker and insurer, \u00a7 41 is to be read \u201cin accord with \u2018the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u2019 \u201d <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. at 251, quoting from <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, 395 </em>Mass. 868, 872-873 (1985). To toll the limitations period in the circumstance of an injury for which an insurer is making ongoing payments is in accord with the balanced statutory purposes in \u00a7 41. That construction does not erode the protection afforded an insurer because, in making payments, the insurer presumptively has notice of the injury, has had a timely opportunity to investigate, and has elected to assume liability for the claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The construction also serves the humanitarian purpose of assisting the injured worker: by the ongoing pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ments, the worker is more quickly compensated for the subject injury and, should the insurer stop making payments, the worker is protected by the tolling provision. Thus, the linkage between tolling and the injury on which the payments are being made respects the dual interests of worker and insurer and is consistent with the balance set by the Legislature in \u00a7 41. In contrast, a virtually free-floating tolling provision, not tying the injury to the ongoing payments, is inconsistent with the statutory framework and purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In addition, the construction adopted here is consistent with the legislative amendments in 1985 (see St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7\u00a7 50, 53) that extended the limitations period in \u00a7 41 from one year to four years. Again, those amendments reflected a balancing. In \u201cexchange\u201d for an extension in the limitations term for a worker to file a claim from one year to four years, the Legislature reduced the continuing liability of insurers by repealing the part of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 49, that had provided an indefinite limitations extension based upon a demonstration of mistake, reasonable cause, or absence of prejudice to the insurer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The construction the plaintiff proposes for \u00a7 41 would allow for the migration of time lines that this amendment sought to survey with definite boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Finally, limiting tolling to payments for the subject injury comports with the interpretation of the statute by the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ment of Industrial Accidents and thus \u201c accord [s] deference to [the] administrative interpretation of [the] statute.\u201d <em>Mugford\u2019s Case, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 930 (1998), quoting from <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Engrs. &amp; Scientists </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>389 Mass. 920, 924 (1983). See <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 708, 713 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>Decision of reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The parties stipulated that the Liberty payments were all for the injury of March 3, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We note that Baker also received Social Security disability benefits.

App. Ct. 550, 553 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\">An insurer who questions its responsibility on a claim may make payments and reserve its rights. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), allows an insurer to pay benefits without prejudice to its ability to contest the issue of liability. As in effect during this case, \u00a7 8(1) allowed for such reservation of rights for sixty days; an amendment in 1991 extended the reservation period to one hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>eighty days. See St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 23. After this designated \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d period expires, there are stricter limitations on the ability of the insurer to withdraw from the claim. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(4). In this case, the administrative judge noted that Liberty\u2019s payment of compensation constituted an acceptance of liability. See the reasoning of the reviewing board in <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Fairside Trucking, </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 218 (1994) (where an insurer assumes liability for compensation on a resulting period of disability and voluntarily pays benefits beyond the \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d period provided in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15A, that insurer may bear the burden of proving the claim against the alleged proper insurer). Thus, where there are assumed payments by an insurer, these principles provide extra protection for the insured worker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b657-13\">In fact, it does not appear that the plaintiff would have satisfied the old equitable tolling exceptions. This is not a case of mistake or excusable neglect. The plaintiff was represented by counsel as early as October, 1990. Rather than any mistake, it appears that the plaintiff accepted, to the date of exhaustion, total temporary disability payments under \u00a7 34 based on the first injury. It was only at the end of the tunnel that the plaintiff sought to switch lanes by marking the second and different date of injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
