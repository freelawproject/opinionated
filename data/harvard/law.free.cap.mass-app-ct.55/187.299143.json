L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A) within 1,000 feet of a school zone (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J), the defendant asserts that several errors tainted his trial. Only two of his claims warrant extended discussion: (1) the trial judge abused her discretion in allowing the jury to look through the telescope used by the police officer whose surveillance led to the defendant\u2019s arrest, under what the defendant characterizes as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u201cmisleadingly favorable conditions\u201d; and (2). the trial judge erred in giving, sua sponte, a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction because of the defendant\u2019s failure to call as a witness his former girlfriend with whom, he had testified, he had been virtually the entire evening in question. Discerning no merit in his contentions, we affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The facts established by the evidence reveal the following. Around midnight on August 1, 1999, Detective Sergeant James Fong, a twenty-five year veteran of the Boston police department who had received special drug enforcement training and had made over 1,500 crack cocaine arrests, stood on the fifth floor of the Radisson Hotel parking garage. From that location, Fong was conducting surveillance of the theater district in downtown Boston, using a telescope (described as a \u201cSwift Model 841 Telemaster\u201d) as well as his unaided eyesight while scanning for \u201cdrug activity\u201d in an area where he had been involved in \u201cwell over a thousand\u201d arrests for sales of crack cocaine. According to Fong, there were many open businesses and signs providing multiple sources of artificial lighting that illuminated the area he surveilled, which he described as \u201cvery well lit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">While using his telescope, Fong observed an individual (later identified as James Berger) approach another individual riding an orange mountain bike (later identified as codefendant Jerry Carrasquillo) on Stuart Street. Berger handed Carrasquillo what Fong recognized as United States currency. He saw Carrasquillo turn and point to an African-American male (later identified as the defendant) sitting on a fence about thirty feet from where Carrasquillo stood (and about three hundred feet from Fong\u2019s lookout). Fong then observed Berger walk up to the defendant. Following a brief conversation, the defendant spat an object into his right hand and put it in Berger\u2019s right hand. Berger inspected the object and began walking away. Based on his training and experience, Fong concluded that he had just witnessed \u201cactions consistent with . . . drug activity.\u201d Throughout the incident Fong\u2019s \u201cview [was] unobstructed . . . a straight line view.\u201d \u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Fong immediately radioed his observations to fellow officers waiting on the ground in the vicinity. Two of them proceeded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>stop Berger as he walked toward the Radisson Hotel, only moments after the transaction Fong had detected. They recovered a small plastic bag containing what proved to be crack cocaine in Berger\u2019s right hand and arrested him. Another officer, upon receiving Fong\u2019s description of the defendant (as a black man wearing a blue and white horizontally-striped shirt and blue jeans), saw him moments later entering a \u201c7-Eleven\u201d convenience store on Stuart Street, followed him into the store and arrested him. Upon being searched, the defendant was found to have $190 in cash and a cellular phone. During booking, he gave the police a false name (\u201cDion Ball\u201d). (Carrasquillo was not arrested until almost two hours later, working the same area on his bike, with $312 in cash on his person.) Fong measured the distance from the point of the Berger-defendant transaction to a nearby public school as 760 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"AVc\">The defense case consisted of Berger testifying that someone other than the defendant had given him the crack cocaine and the defendant testifying that he had not been involved in any drug sales on August 1 and had never before seen Berger or Carrasquillo. The defendant claimed that he had been with his former girlfriend, Tasha Johnson, at a nightclub in the theater district from 9:00 p.m. until midnight that evening. Upon leaving the club, they had smoked cigarettes together, after which he had sent her home in a taxi and had then gone into the 7-Eleven to purchase more cigarettes. He explained the large amount of cash found on him as being \u201cchild support\u201d money he had earned at a former job which he had brought for Tasha, who was the mother of his two year old child, but which he had forgotten to give her. When arrested, he called Tasha, who came to the police station and unsuccessfully tried to bail him out. Asked by the prosecutor about Tasha\u2019s absence from the trial, the defendant responded that, though he knew where she was currently living (\u201cin a shelter . . . [with] three kids\u201d), \u201cshe\u2019s going through some problems right now.\u201d He admitted he had given a false name to the police when booked but said he did so because he \u201cwas scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\"><em>The telescope demonstration. </em>The defendant argues that it was reversible error for the judge to permit the jurors to look through Detective Fong\u2019s telescope during trial. That demonstra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tian occurred pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s request, made just prior to the commencement of trial, that Fong (the prosecutor\u2019s first witness) be allowed to set up his telescope for juror viewing following his testimony. Defense counsel objected on the ground that the lighting conditions during the daytime at the courthouse were not the same as those on the evening of the transaction. The judge overruled the objection but assured defense counsel she would instruct the jurors regarding the lighting differences. After a luncheon recess, as Fong set up his telescope prior to opening statements, defense counsel again raised an objection to a demonstration, without stating any reason therefor. The judge noted that the defense objection \u201chas been put on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">At the end of Fong\u2019s direct testimony, he was asked about his use of the telescope. He testified that it could magnify objects between fifteen and sixty times. On the evening of August 1, he had set it to magnify approximately twenty-five times, while he was (he estimated) about three hundred feet from the transaction. He acknowledged that the demonstration would involve viewing a sign outside the courthouse, at that same magnification, which was at most about two hundred feet away; but he explained that there was \u201cno real amount\u201d of difference between the \u201cvery well lit\u201d conditions on August 1 and those in the courtroom. A third defense objection to any telescope demonstration followed, without specificity, which the judge again \u201cnoted,\u201d implicitly overruling it. The judge then instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we are going to have a demonstration of the scope for you. Please keep in mind that when you look through the scope, we will not be able to duplicate the conditions that were in place on the night in question. First of all, this is the daytime, we\u2019re inside a building, so it will be different, but this is just to give you an idea of what it looks like, and <em>this is not so that you can make a determination of exactly the way anything would look. It is simply a demonstration </em>to aid and assist you in determining how the officer who observed \u2014 made the observations looked through the scope and what you believe he would have been able to see. You will make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>[unintelligible] determination yourself with respect to the evidence in this case. <em>This is simply a demonstration. It is not proof of anything.\u201d </em>(Emphases added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">After this instruction, counsel for the codefendant stated that he would join in the defendant\u2019s objection to the demonstration. Neither he nor defendant\u2019s counsel, however, referenced any particular or further ground therefor. The jurors were then led by the court officer one by one to look through the telescope (as did counsel for codefendant Carrasquillo), without comment by judge, counsel, or witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Following the jurors\u2019 viewing of the telescope, they were released for the day (it was apparently mid to late afternoon), with the usual warnings. At that point, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated an objection to \u201cthe admission of any type of demonstration . . . regarding the scope,\u201d to \u201cany . . . admissible evidence regarding the scope,\u201d and to the scope being \u201cadmitted in evidence as an exhibit, to go back into the Jury Room.\u201d The judge reassured her that the telescope would not be admitted in evidence as an exhibit or allowed to be taken into the jury room. Counsel then proceeded to list \u201ca number of reasons why the scope was not going to be the same today as it was that night.\u201d She cited, in addition to the differences in lighting conditions, the shorter distance involved in the demonstration while the telescope remained at the same magnification as used on August 1 (although no evidence or even a description of what, if any, difference the variable of the shorter distance would make was proffered, except for counsel\u2019s speculation that it \u201cmight\u201d produce \u201ca great discrepancy in what the jury will view\u201d) and differences in jurors\u2019 vision that could affect their ability to perceive. Counsel concluded by urging that the jury \u201cshould be given a very strong instruction as to whether or not that should be given any more weight or credibility than any other part of the officer\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The judge said that she \u201cagree[d] with [counsel\u2019s] recommended instructions\u201d but added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c[L]et\u2019s just . . . note at this point that the demonstration has already been done . . . there\u2019s not much that could be done to undo the fact that they\u2019ve already seen what they saw through the scope . . . your more detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>argument comes a little bit too late . . . [though] that does not mean that I would change my ruling, even based on your point of argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Defense counsel did not respond to the judge\u2019s admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In her final instructions, the judge reminded the jury, with respect to the \u201cdemonstration of the scope allegedly used by\u201d Detective Fong, that they \u201cshould keep in mind ... the differences between the actual events and the demonstration\u201d (including lighting conditions, distances, and differences in people\u2019s vision) and \u201cnot allow this demonstration to substitute for your duty to evaluate all of the evidence introduced at trial. You should determine [whether] that testimony concerning the alleged transaction ... is credible or is not credible . . . [T]he scope simply provides a powerful means to view objects [but t]his should not impair your credibility determination. Keep in mind ... it simply was a demonstration for you.\u201d No objection was lodged against this charge, which was immediately followed by a reiterated instruction that the Commonwealth had the burden of convincing the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that it had correctly identified the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">On this record, the defendant failed to preserve his objection to the telescope demonstration. Moreover, he has also failed to establish that, even were we to hold that the judge erred in allowing the demonstration, any prejudicial error (much less any risk of a miscarriage of justice) was occasioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">It is black letter law that objections to evidence, or to any challenged order or ruling of the trial judge, are not preserved for appeal unless made in a precise and timely fashion, as soon as the claimed error is apparent, so as \u201cto afford the trial judge an opportunity to act promptly to remove from the jury\u2019s consideration evidence [or whatever else is claimed to have been improperly presented] . . . which has no place in the trial.\u201d <em>Abraham </em>v. Woburn, 383 Mass. 724, 726-727 n.1 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 669 (1981) (\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of appellate review that a prompt objection at trial is a prerequisite to the presentation of an issue for appellate review\u201d)\u2019; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>668, 674 (1987) (same); Mass.R.Crim.P. 22, 378 Mass. 892-893 (1979) (objector invited to \u201cstate the precise legal grounds of his objection\u201d); Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Crim.P. 22, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 272-273 (West 1995). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>343 Mass. 130, 136 (1961) (objection to an item of real evidence must be made before the item is admitted in evidence); Proposed Mass.REvid. 103(a)(1) (objection should \u201cstat[e] the specific ground of objection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Here the only \u201cprecise\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d ground presented to the judge in a timely manner as objection to the demonstration of the telescope was the difference in lighting conditions. On appeal, the defendant does not focus on that particular objection but rather asserts reversible error occurred by virtue of the allowance of any demonstration at all, because \u201c[t]he trial court knew it could not reproduce Sgt. Fong\u2019s experience of using it when he allegedly saw [the defendant] sell cocaine.\u201d He thus challenges the demonstration per se because \u201cideal conditions\u201d did not prevail and \u201c[n]othing about the view matched the conditions or obstacles Sgt. Fong faced on August 1.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attempt to mount a holistic appellate attack on the demonstration fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">First, he \u201ccannot try a case on one theory and then, having lost on that theory, argue before an appellate court about alleged issues which might have been, but were not, raised at the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 539, 544 (1987). Second, the defendant offers no relevant authority supporting the identity of conditions he posits as a prerequisite for a demonstration, nor does our law demand such identity. A courtroom \u201cexperiment, demonstration, or reenactment\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may be permitted by the trial judge so long as it \u201csufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>resembles the actual event so as to be fair and informative.\u201d <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 173 (1983). \u201cWhether the conditions were sufficiently similar to make the observation [offered by the demonstration] <em>of any value in aiding the jury </em>to pass upon the issue submitted to them [is] primarily for the trial judge to determine as matter of discretion. [The judge\u2019s] decision in this respect will not be interfered with unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>418 Mass. 262, 270-271 (1994) (cited and quoted authorities omitted, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">The defendant fails to establish any abuse of discretion or plain error on the part of the judge in rejecting the sole articulated objection to the telescope demonstration, the difference in lighting conditions. In light of Detective Fong\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that the scene he viewed on August 1 was \u201cvery well lit,\u201d with \u201cno real\u201d difference in the amount of light available then as compared with that in the courtroom,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>telescope was set to the same magnification and that both views were clear and unobstructed, the judge\u2019s denial of that limited objection was well within her broad discretion. It implicitly rested on a finding of sufficient similarity in conditions to make the jury\u2019s observations offered by the nonevidentiary demonstration of some value in evaluating Fong\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The judge\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s belated, amplified critique of the just-completed telescope demonstration was also a proper exercise of her discretion. The defendant\u2019s failure to call the judge\u2019s attention to the additionally asserted problems at the time they could be addressed and corrected, so as to avoid even the possibility of necessitating a new trial, violated the fundamental rules of trial practice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 563-564 (1987). Those added criticisms were particularly untimely, in that they unrealistically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>called for the judge to unring the bell: \u201cThe things thus seen by the jurors could not well be banished from their minds.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 29 (1923). The judge correctly noted that the defendant\u2019s \u201cmore detailed argument comes a little bit too late.\u201d The defendant did not move for a mistrial or seek any other relief at that point except to protest against the telescope being \u201csubmitted into evidence\u201d and to suggest that the jury \u201cshould be given a very strong instruction\u201d regarding the several differences between demonstration and event \u2014 both of which requests the judge granted. Accordingly, it is not now meet for the defendant to attack any aspect of the judge\u2019s discretionary action with respect to the demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Even had the defendant made a more detailed objection in a timely fashion, prior to juror access to the telescope, we would nonetheless uphold the judge\u2019s allowance of the demonstration as nonprejudicial (and, a fortiori, as not creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice). The jury \u2014 properly instructed by the judge to draw upon their common sense and life experience \u2014 could not conceivably have been misled or confused about the essential features of telescopes and the differences between the conditions of the demonstration and those on the evening of the drug transaction. Detective Fong himself, as well as the prosecutor (in direct examination of Fong and in summation), defense counsel (in cross-examination of Fong and in closing argument), and the trial judge (in pre-demonstration and final instructions) all highlighted the several variations from the event presented by the viewing.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The judge\u2019s careful instructions \u2014 not only pointing out those differences but also stressing that the viewing of the telescope was \u201csimply a demonstration,\u201d not evidence and \u201cnot proof of anything\u201d; and that the jury must decide the case \u201csolely on a fair consideration of the evidence,\u201d must \u201cconfine your deliberations to the evidence and nothing but the evidence,\u201d must \u201cnot allow [the] demonstration to substitute for your duty to evaluate all of the evidence introduced at trial,\u201d and must be \u201cfirmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d i.e., \u201cmust be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the identification of the defendant [by Detective Fong] before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>you may convict him\u201d \u2014 which we presume the jury heeded, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 588 (1990), save the day, in any event. They firmly persuade us that, even were the judge\u2019s allowance of the demonstration deemed to have been erroneous, no such prejudice could have resulted as to require reversal. No reasonable juror would have used whatever he or she drew from that demonstration contrary to those instructions or otherwise improperly so as to reduce the high degree of certainty required for conviction of the defendant under the reasonable doubt requirement. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>385 Mass. 660, 668 (1982) (jurors are expected to follow instructions to disregard matters laid before the jury but withdrawn from their consideration); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maltais, </em>387 Mass. 79, 94-95 (1982) (minor legal error in instructions could not create \u201cthe slightest possibility of prejudice to the defendant\u201d because the instructions as a whole clearly and comprehensively provided everything the jury needed to reach a correct verdict); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 232 (1992) (judge\u2019s clear and repeated instructions about the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof and what was and was not evidence eliminated any prejudicial impact of prosecu-torial burden shifting argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In sum, we conclude that no error occurred with respect to the judge\u2019s allowance of the telescope demonstration; but, even if it had, it \u201cdid not influence the jury, or [could have] had but very slight effect,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983), quoting from <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-765 (1946); and we \u201care confident that, if the [presumed] error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. 461, 468 (2000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>The missing witness instruction. </em>The defendant\u2019s challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the trial judge\u2019s giving a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction over his objection, regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to call his former girlfriend, Tasha Johnson, as a witness, is unpersuasive on the instant facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It has, of course, been sagely observed that such an instruction, and the adverse inference permitted by it (that the witness, if called, would not testify favorably to the defendant), should be allowed \u201conly in clear cases, and with caution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134 (1986). The basic lesson of that admonition, however, is that the instruction is inappropriate when the testimony of the uncalled witness would be \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d or otherwise \u201cunimportant\u201d when other witnesses have already corroborated the defense position. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 134-135. The applicable general principle remains, \u201cwhether to give a missing witness instruction is a decision that must be made on a case-by-case basis, in the discretion of the trial judge . . . [whose] decision will be overturned on appeal only if it was \u2018manifestly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 151 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 86 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The judge in this case did not abuse her discretion, much less act manifestly unreasonably, in giving the instruction because this was a \u201cclear case\u201d: the \u201cmissing\u201d testimony would have been central to the defense as the principal corroborative evidence for the defendant\u2019s alibi. The defendant\u2019s own counsel told the jury in her opening statement that the defendant would explain the reason for his presence in the theater district on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>August 1 \u2014 not to \u201cdo any drag deals\u201d but rath\u00e9r \u201cto go out with his girlfriend, to have a nice time, to go to a club.\u201d In her closing, defense counsel reiterated the defendant\u2019s \u201clegitimate reason\u201d for being in the area (\u201cI\u2019m out there with my girlfriend ... having a good time\u201d) and underscored the importance of that fact by declaring, \u201cHe can\u2019t be in two places at once. He can\u2019t be making a [drag] deal over [t]here while he\u2019s in front of the 7-Eleven with his girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsM\">Thus, Tasha Johnson was concededly not just a cumulative or ancillary witness for the defendant but rather his major alibi witness, who \u201ccould have been expected to offer testimony of \u2018distinct importance\u2019 to the defendant\u2019s case\u201d that \u201ccould not be duplicated\u201d by any other witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. at 152-153.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 411 (1995). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 386-390 (2000). The defendant\u2019s own testimony (as well as counsel\u2019s representations to the jury) placed the defendant with Tasha Johnson virtually the entire evening of August 1, up to a few moments before he was arrested in the 7-Eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"ARt\">Even if Tasha could not have provided an alibi for the entire evening, she could have given testimony covering the crucial time period prior to his entering the 7-Eleven, when she was allegedly constantly with him, so that he could not \u201cbe making a [drag] deal\u201d in a different location. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. at 153; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McQuade, </em>46 Mass.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>potential significance of Tasha\u2019s testimony is accentuated by her presumed ability to explain the large amount of cash on the defendant\u2019s person as intended for child support and by her , presumptively greater credibility (than that of the defendant dr Berger), having no apparent motive to lie and being in no jeopardy of losing her liberty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, the judge commit-ted no error in providing a missing witness instruction to the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The defendant relies exclusively on authorities involving views of criminal scenes (none of which, however, supports his contentions), rather than cases involving demonstrations. We note that the law regarding the allowance of views \u2014 it is within the trial judge\u2019s \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d whenever she determines that it would be of assistance to the jury\u2019s better understanding of testimony that has been or may be presented, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>423 Mass. 318, 327 n.8 (1996), and it is not an abuse of that discretion to permit a view even though the conditions at or appearance of the scene have changed or are not identical to those obtaining at the time of the criminal incident, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 401-402 (1944); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>432 Mass. 1, 17 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Do-minico, </em>1 Mass.

Indeed, the demonstration of an object relevant to the particular case, as occurred here, falls literally within the statutory authorization for the allowance of views, G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 35 (\u201cThe court may . . . allow the jury ... to view the premises or place in question or any property, matter or thing relative to the case\u201d). Additiorially, the allowance of the instant demonstration \u25a0\u2014 as to which the judge expressly ruled and instructed that the telescope and the jurors\u2019 experience of looking through it were not evidence or part of the record \u2014 was substantially indistinguishable from the well-established use of \u201cchalks,\u201d in the judge\u2019s discretion, to il-l\u00fastrate testimony and assist the jury in weighing evidence they hear, so long as there are sufficient similarities between the \u201cchalk\u201d and the circumstances of the matter sought to be proved.

App. Ct. 7, 11-12 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-37\">The only authority cited by the defendant that relates to lighting conditians, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296 (1979), does not assist him. There, the court upheld the trial judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a jury view of the rape scene as not constituting an abuse of discretion, because the judge \u201cmight well have thought that a view would be of no aid to the jury, or that potential differences in lighting conditions would render a view misleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. Beyond that statement, no details concerning the motion or the comparative lighting conditions were mentioned by the court in <em>Rodriguez, </em>so that any conclusions regarding the nature of the judge\u2019s discretionary exercise there would be speculative and inapplicable here, where the established circumstances support the judge\u2019s allowance of the view. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the extent lighting conditions at the rape scene in <em>Rodriguez </em>can be gleaned from the body of the opinion, it appears that the scene was in a dimly lit residential area illuminated only by two street lamps approximately one-half block apart and by reflected light from nearby homes. See <em>id. </em>at 300. Another case cited by the defendant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 354 (1984), adds nothing, merely quoting the same language from <em>Rodriguez </em>mentioned above. It, too, involved a rape scene in a dimly lit area, a wooded slope behind the victim\u2019s home, with some light coming from outdoor lights of other buildings near the base of the slope. See 17 Mass. App. Ct. at 355. The limited facts of <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Jewett </em>as to lighting conditions are thus easily distinguishable from those here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>418 Mass. at 271 (demonstration, which was admitted in evidence, consisting of a videotaped simulation of the view a person would have standing at the site where the fatal shots were fired and looking through the defendant\u2019s telescopic rifle sight, was sufficiently similar despite depicting the scene in the fall rather than the winter; would have been of some value in aiding the jury; was informative in showing \u201cwhat the sniper likely observed\u201d; \u201cshed light\u201d on pertinent issues to be proved [there malice and premeditation, here identification]; and was fair in light of the other evidence corroborating the location where the shots were fired); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dominico, </em>1 Mass.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clermy, </em>421 Mass. 325, 331 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pixley, </em>42 Mass.

App. Ct. 130, 134 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 149 n.1 &amp; 150-151 (1999).

No more persuasive is the defendant\u2019s general plaint that the case against him was not so strong (but see note 4, <em>supra) </em>that he \u201ccould be expected to call everyone who had seen him that night.\u201d No person other than the individuals who participated in or were mentioned at the trial were ever identified as having seen the defendant on August 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The other foundational conditions for a missing witness instruction were also present and are not contested. Tasha was \u201cavailable\u201d to the defendant, who knew where she was staying and admitted regular contact with her (indeed, he telephoned her from jail to bail him out on August 1); she could be assumed to be friendly, being both his former girlfriend and the mother of his child; and the defendant provided no reason, plausible or otherwise, for her absence (his vague reference to her \u201cgoing through some problems right now\u201d having been an unresponsive answer to where she was at the time of trial). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. at 150-151; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 134. Finally, as noted above, the Com-monwealth\u2019s case against the defendant was strong enough that he \u201cwould be expected to call [such an important] witness if [he] were innocent. . . .\u201d <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The defendant\u2019s remaining arguments require little discussion. His claim that the prosecutor improperly \u201cvouched for\u201d Detective Fong\u2019s testimony and the power of his telescope (also unobjected to) is misdirected, because all of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks now challenged were fair comments on and sup-ported by the evidence, as well as legitimate responses to the defendant\u2019s closing arguments regarding credibility. No substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice could have occurred in the circumstances of this case. See <em>Com-monwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>411 Mass. 345, 357 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 836, 839-840 (1997). His complaint that the judge\u2019s instruc-tions somehow inadvertently bolstered the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cvouching\u201d amounts to nothing more than conclusory assertion lacking any supportive authority and is inadequate appellate argument that merits no response, see Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); but in any event it is belied by the judge\u2019s careful instructions on evaluating credibility, particularly that the status of witnesses as police officers was an irrelevant factor in that exercise. Finally, his attack on the judge\u2019s instruction regarding the meaning of the presumption of innocence (not objected to at trial) fails, because the Supreme Judicial Court has expressly approved of just such an instruction.
