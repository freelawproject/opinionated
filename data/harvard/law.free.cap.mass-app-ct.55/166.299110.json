However, neither holder of those mortgages had threatened him with foreclosure. Sometime in December of that year or early 1995, the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>mortgagee returned a payment made by Mathias to him and informed him that Peter Domemann, doing business as Argo Financial Services (Argo), had purchased the second mortgage. Soon thereafter, Domemann telephoned Mathias and set up a meeting to discuss the possibility of foreclosure and the means by which to avoid it. Mathias met with Domemann and entered into various agreements with him which he, Mathias, claimed caused him to lose his house in fairly short order. On behalf of Mathias\u2019s estate, the trustee in bankruptcy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought an action against Domemann, alleging fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and violations of G. L. c. 93A. The Superior Court judge construed Mathias\u2019s complaint as being based exclusively on c. 93A, treated the jury\u2019s special verdicts in favor of Mathias as advisory rather than binding, and ordered judgment for Domemann. Concluding that because of the parties\u2019 assent the judge was not bound by the special verdicts but that he erred in failing to consider all the circumstances of the transactions between Mathias and Domemann in deciding the c. 93A action, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">1. <em>The evidence. </em>After reading a magazine advertisement for National Property Associates (NPA), an investment advisory training company, Domemann became interested in becoming an NPA associate and obtained an NPA brochure. As stated in the brochure, NPA\u2019s \u201cprime interest is in the acquisition of real estate at prices far below \u2018Fair Market Value.\u2019 \u201d Its basic concept: \u201cIdentify the property, evaluate it, take control of it and sell it at a profit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">His interest piqued, Domemann, who holds a master\u2019s degree in business administration and marketing from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, enrolled in a three-day training program conducted by NPA. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>completion of the program, Dornemann created Argo. He chose the name of his business (Argo Financial Services) because he intended to offer financial services to lending institutions and, in some instances, homeowners. Doing business as Argo, Dome-mann purchased mortgages and structured contracts with owners of \u201cdistressed\u201d property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Prior to Dornemann\u2019s arrival on the scene, Mathias had owned his house for about thirteen years. The property was encumbered by three mortgages, which had a total outstanding balance of about $62,500, and which required total monthly payments of over $900. A high school graduate who earned his livelihood as a truck driver, Mathias\u2019s weekly net pay was $335. He juggled his monthly mortgage payments by breaking them into two-week periods. Although he was in arrears on the second and third mortgages, neither mortgagee had threatened him with foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In November, 1994, Dornemann, who previously had sought out mortgages for sale from Lenders, Inc., of Massachusetts (Lenders),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mathias\u2019s second mortgagee, examined Lenders\u2019s file on Mathias. At that time, the outstanding balance on the second mortgage was nearly $15,000, and the amount in arrears was over $1,600. Dornemann purchased the mortgage. His decision to do so was based upon the fact that Mathias \u201cfit the profile\u201d of a candidate attractive to him. Although the evidence does not expressly disclose the contents of Lenders\u2019s file, Dornemann testified that the most important reason for his selection of Mathias\u2019s mortgage was Mathias\u2019s payment history, the market value of the property (about $74,000), the equity in the property, and his understanding that foreclosure by Lenders was \u201cimminent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Mathias first learned that Dornemann had purchased his second mortgage in early December, 1994, when Lenders returned his payment and informed him of the change of mortgagees. About a week later, Dornemann called Mathias and arranged a meeting to discuss the possibility of foreclosure on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the mortgage and proposals by which Mathias could salvage his credit and property. They met at Mathias\u2019s home on December 17. Domemann presented Mathias with a written notice of acceleration that contained a demand for past due payments and late charges, $2,036.77, within ten days. Mathias testified that he told Domemann that there was no way possible for him to \u201ccome up with that type of money in that short [a] time.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The notice also provided that failure to pay the past due amount would cause the entire unpaid balance, $17,369.57, to be due immediately and that failure to pay that amount would trigger foreclosure and a public auction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Three days after the meeting, Domemann sent Mathias a letter in which he again warned that if he did not receive the past due amount owed within seven days of the date of the letter, December 20, he would foreclose on the mortgage. Domemann went on in this letter to offer Mathias a plan by which Mathias could prevent foreclosure: \u201cWe can offer you a Plan (let\u2019s call it Plan 1) which stops the foreclosure procedure and lends you money to cover all currently past due payments while you sell your home at a price that is fully acceptable to you.\u201d Dome-mann characterized his plan as a \u201cPurchase and Sell Back Agreement\u201d in that it required Mathias to deed his home to Domemann for one year, during which time Mathias would attempt to sell the property while also making monthly payments of $1,020.34. Domemann would use Mathias\u2019s monthly payments to make payments on the three mortgages, insurance, and taxes. Once Mathias found a buyer for the property, Domemann would sell it back to Mathias who, in turn, would pay Dome-mann the money Domemann lent Mathias to cover the current past due amount on the second mortgage, plus a service fee equal to one-half that current past due amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">According to Mathias\u2019s testimony, he had no intention of selling his home before he met Domemann. Nonetheless, Mathias engaged in further conversations with Domemann <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>which led him to enter into three agreements with him, all dated January 28, 1995: a purchase and sale agreement, a quitclaim deed conveying the property to Domemann, and an agreement for sale of real estate. The three documents consist of eleven single-spaced, typewritten pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The purchase and sale agreement set the purchase price for the property at $62,516, that is, the amount of the balance due on the outstanding mortgages. The agreement for sale of real estate provided that if Domemann had not sold the property within one year, Mathias would buy it back for $67,516. The agreement also required Mathias, as of February 17, 1995, to make monthly payments to Domemann in the amount of $1,024.34.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In turn, Domemann would forebear from foreclosure. Any failure by Mathias to make the required monthly payments would result in an acceleration of the total amount due and trigger Domemann\u2019s right to take possession of the property and sell it of his own accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Twice, at their first meeting in December and at the time of the signing of the documents on January 28, Mathias told Domemann that he could not afford the monthly payment required by Domemann\u2019s plan, which exceeded the total amount of the three mortgage payments he was already attempting to meet by juggling biweekly payments. Mathias testified that because he could not afford a lawyer, he was without legal advice throughout his dealings with Domemann; that although he read the documents, he did not understand them; and that Domemann explained the documents to him and assured him that they were a mere \u201cformality.\u201d Mathias explained that because Domemann assured him that the documents were a mere \u201cformality\u201d of the plan to save his property and because he wanted to stave off foreclosure and salvage what little credit he had, he signed the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">When, on February 17, Mathias failed to make the first payment due under the agreement, Domemann sent him an eviction notice, dated February 24, in which he advised Mathias that he was to vacate the premises on or before March 24, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>intended to sell the property \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d and pay off Mathias\u2019s mortgages. In the notice, Domemann reassured Mathias: \u201cThis situation is not as bad as it may seem. My objective is to use my own real estate agent to sell [the property] as quickly as possible. Once I have sold this property, I will immediately pay off all mortgages held in your name. When this happens [,] you will again have a clean credit record and should be able to successfully apply for new mortgages, loans, etc.\u201d Mathias moved out of his home in April, and Domemann made payments to the first and third mortgagees through May.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In the meantime, on March 2, 1995, Domemann entered into an \u201cexclusive listing agreement\u201d with a real estate broker in which the asking selling price was $80,000. At one point, Domemann received an offer of $67,000 for the property. He never informed Mathias of the offer and, instead, made a counteroffer of $72,000. In any event and for whatever reason, the property was not sold, and Domemann gave Mathias written notice, dated June 12, 1995, that he was canceling their purchase and sale agreement and reconveying the property to Mathias for the cited reason that Mathias had failed to disclose past due property taxes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On August 4, 1995, the first mortgagee, Bristol County Savings Bank (Bristol), after receiving notice of Mathias\u2019s transfer of the property to Domemann, accelerated Mathias\u2019s mortgage and demanded an immediate payment of $40,745.09, plus interest and costs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mathias filed for bankruptcy on September 11, 1995. There the matter apparently stood until June 19, 1996. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>that date, Mathias made a specific and detailed written demand for relief upon Dornemann pursuant to G. L. c. 93A. When Dornemann failed to make any offer of settlement, Mathias, on September 5, 1996, brought this action. In the meantime, Bristol had purchased the property at an August foreclosure sale for $48,900, which it then sold in November for $40,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">2. <em>The complaint. </em>There are six counts to the complaint before us, each of which recites that it is based upon common law or a specific statutory basis as well as G. L. c. 93A. There was also a demand for a jury trial. Our concern is confined to the first and second counts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As to these counts the jury returned special verdicts, finding Dornemann liable for fraud and misrepresentation, breach of contract, and a wilful and knowing commission of an unfair act. The judge declined to accept the special verdicts, decided the matter for himself, and ordered judgment for Dornemann.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">3. <em>The special verdicts. </em>Where the same facts are relied upon as the basis for a claim founded upon common law as well as an accompanying \u201cparallel count under G. L. c. 93A,\u201d <em>Acushnet Fed. Credit Union </em>v. <em>Roderick, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 604, 606 (1988), a trial judge has the \u201cchoice of letting the jury find the facts for both claims, reserving to himself all aspects of the c. 93A claim, or asking the jury for a non-binding advisory as to whether [the defendant] had acted unfairly or deceptively.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>International Totalizing Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>PepsiCo, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 435-436 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">There is, however, cause for concern about the use of an advisory jury when a claim is based exclusively upon G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Augustine </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 903 (1999), citing <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 315 (1983); <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wareham, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(1989); Mass.R.Civ.P. 39(c), 365 Mass. 802 (1974). As observed in <em>Augustine, supra, </em>the concern is as follows. Because \u201cthere is no right to a trial by jury for actions cognizable under G. L. c. 93A,\u201d <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. at 315, the authorization for special verdicts is found in rule 39(c), which reads, \u201d[i]n all actions not triable of right by a jury, the court, except where otherwise provided by law, may upon motion frame issues of fact to be tried by a jury.\u201d Special verdicts returned pursuant to rule 39(c) are binding. See <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Ware-ham, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 401-402, and authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Relying upon <em>Delaney, </em>Mathias argues that the special verdicts returned on the two counts of the complaint before us (see note 11, <em>supra) </em>were binding on the judge and must be reinstated. This argument overlooks the fact that although the record in <em>Delaney </em>was \u201cextremely unclear on the jury\u2019s role in the case,\u201d the court nonetheless concluded that the parties\u2019 failure to object bound them to the trial judge\u2019s procedure. 27 Mass. App. Ct. at 401-402. In the present case, the judge made it quite clear on several occasions that the jury\u2019s verdicts were to be advisory and not binding. Mathias gave no indication that he did not understand or that he objected to the judge\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Whether we deem the claim waived, <em>Delaney, supra, </em>or apply the doctrine of law of the trial, see <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., </em>328 Mass. 595, 599 (1952), our conclusion is the same. The jury\u2019s special verdicts were not binding on the judge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">4. <em>The judge\u2019s decision. </em>\u201cIn reviewing a matter in which the trial judge acts as fact finder, we \u2018accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact as true unless they are clearly erroneous\u2019 . . . [and] we \u2018scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts.\u2019\u201d <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Cohen-Miles Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 438 (2000), quoting from <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 620, 621 (1992). As we read the judge\u2019s decision, his determination that Domemann was entitled to judgment was based more upon conclusions of law rather than upon his findings of fact. Although we see no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion in respect to Mathias\u2019s claim of a c. 93A violation by reason of a breach of contract,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the same cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>said of his reasoning on Mathias\u2019s allegations that Dornemann fraudulently induced him to enter into the agreements in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">As noted at the outset, the judge construed Mathias\u2019s complaint as being brought solely under c. 93A, and he conducted the trial accordingly. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>However, in rejecting Mathias\u2019s claim of fraud in the inducement, the judge confined himself to the question whether Dornemann made any statements inconsistent with the written documents, and he gave no consideration to the circumstances surrounding their execution. In short, his analysis was predicated solely upon common law. He found and concluded that Dornemann never said that he would assume Mathias\u2019s mortgage liability and that Dornemann did not make any misrepresentation in respect to his service fee. The judge also concluded that even had Dome-mann misrepresented any facts, Mathias was precluding from relying upon any such statements because of the \u201cmerger\u201d clause set out in the purchase and sale agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the judge also ruled that Mathias was not entitled to judgment because he failed to show that he suffered any actual damages.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Dornemann cannot take shelter from liability on the claim of fraud in the inducement under the \u201cmerger\u201d clause. \u201cWhether we refer to the clause ... as a merger clause, an integration clause, or an exculpatory clause, the settled rule of law is that a contracting party cannot rely upon such a clause as protection against claims based upon fraud or deceit.\u201d <em>Sound Techniques, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 425, 429 (2000), citing <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Southgate, </em>308 Mass. 170, 182-183 (1941). See <em>Mc-Evoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 712-713 (1990). Further, any failure to show actual damages would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>not preclude an award of nominal damages and counsel fees. See <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 160 (1985) (\u201cunder circumstances where there has been an invasion of a legally protected interest, but no harm for which actual damages can be awarded, we conclude that [c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3),] provides for the recovery of minimum damages in the amount of $25\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Based upon the judge\u2019s decision and the record before us, the only remaining question is whether the judge\u2019s erroneous analysis of Mathias\u2019s allegations of fraud in the inducement requires reversal and remand for purposes of consideration of the evidence in accordance with the purpose and intent of c. 93A. Put another way, we must consider whether a trial judge could reach a different conclusion were he to consider the claim of fraud in the inducement in light of the scope, intent, and purpose of c. 93A rather than confining himself to an analysis controlled by common-law elements of deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">5. <em>Discussion. </em>Because Dornemann\u2019s business facade was such that he was neither a lender nor a mortgage broker, he put his actions outside the express language of any statutory or regulatory prohibitions that might otherwise control. See G. L. c. 140D; G. L. c. 255E; 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 8.00 et seq. (1992). However, whether an act or practice violates a statute or rule promulgated under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, is but one of several factors to be applied to all the circumstances of the transaction (see <em>Schubach </em>v. <em>Household Fin. Corp., </em>375 Mass. 133, 137 [1978]; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Factory Mut. Research Corp., </em>401 Mass. 621, 623 [1988]) in determining whether it is unfair or deceptive. See <em>PMP Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>366 Mass. 593, 595-596 (1975), accepting the standards developed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to 29 Fed. Reg. 8325, 8355 (1964), as approved in <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 244 n.5 (1972).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See also <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Bankers Life Co., </em>389 Mass. 345, 349 (1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(\u201cIn determining whether an act or practice is unfair, as opposed to deceptive, we must evaluate the equities between the parties. . . . What a defendant knew or should have known may be relevant in determining unfairness .... Similarly, a plaintiff\u2019s conduct, his knowledge, and what he reasonably should have known may be factors in determining whether an act or practice is unfair\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">There is a resemblance between the circumstances of the transaction in the instant case and those presented in <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Riemer, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 360 (1993).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There the plaintiff sought damages from a second mortgagee on the basis of alleged violations of G. L. c. 93A. She claimed that the defendant induced her into a loan agreement, the actual terms of which were far more burdensome than as originally described to her, with the assurances that, \u201c \u2018We\u2019ll work with you,\u2019 [and] \u2018We don\u2019t want to own your house.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">As established on cross motions for summary judgment in <em>Hogan, </em>the undisputed facts were as follows. Because the plaintiff was in the process of a divorce and wished to purchase her husband\u2019s interest in the marital residence, she was in need of a loan. She apparently sought assistance from a mortgage broker and was, in turn, referred to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 366 n.6. She made no complaint against the mortgage broker, and confined her allegations to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Both the plaintiff\u2019s loan application and the required disclosure statements established that the monthly payment on the loan would exceed her average monthly income. However, the plaintiff explained to the defendant that she could meet the monthly payment once her business, an airport flower shop, improved and that she anticipated such an improvement within six months. On that basis, she requested that she be given a six-month grace period on the first payment of the loan. The defendant approved the loan and gave her the requested grace period. The plaintiff was represented by counsel \u201c[throughout the closing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">About one month before the expiration of the grace period, the defendant gave the plaintiff a written reminder of the due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>date of her first payment. Because the plaintiff\u2019s business did not meet her expectations during the grace period, she failed to make the first required payment. Sixteen days after the due date for the payment, the defendant declared the entire note due and payable and commenced foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In affirming the grant of summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor, the majority of the court concluded that the undisputed facts established that the plaintiff could show neither the essential elements necessary to sustain an action for misrepresentation nor circumstances sufficient to support a claim of an unfair or deceptive act. <em>Id. </em>at 365-368.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Although accepting the majority\u2019s reasoning in respect to the common-law elements of fraud and misrepresentation, the dissent expressed the view that it was wrong to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendant in respect to the claimed violation of c. 93A. Relying upon the principle that the question of unfairness is essentially a factual question, the dissent concluded that on all the facts, disputed as well as undisputed, the plaintiff was entitled to a trial on her c. 93A claim. <em>Id. </em>at 369-371.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In our view, the circumstances presented in the instant case are far more extreme than those discussed in the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Hogan, supra. </em>We capsulize rather than repeat the evidence recited in detail in part one of this opinion, <em>supra. </em>There was a significant disparity between the parties as to their education and level of sophistication in business matters. Mathias did not initiate contact with Dornemann. Rather, based upon the data contained in Lenders\u2019s file, Dornemann targeted Mathias as a \u201cdistressed\u201d seller, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>sought him out, and took control of his property by following NPA\u2019s recommended procedures, procedures intended to enable \u201cacquisition of real estate at prices far below \u2018Fair Market Value.\u2019 \u201d See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Mathias, unrepresented by counsel due to financial constraints, read but did not understand the agreements. He told Dorne-mann, at least twice, that the amount of the monthly payments under the plan was more than the monthly amount he was currently unable to pay. Notwithstanding Mathias\u2019s expressed concerns and the information gleaned from scrutiny of Lenders\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>file, Dornemann represented that the agreements were a mere formality. Within one month of the date of the agreements and seven days after Mathias failed to meet the first payment due Argo, Dornemann set in process his rights under the agreements: he accelerated the mortgage, evicted Mathias, and, unable to sell the property for the amount he had anticipated, re-conveyed the premises to Mathias.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Because the trial judge erroneously failed to consider the evidence of all the relevant circumstances of the transaction, the matter must be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings. Should the Superior Court judge find and conclude, after consideration of the evidence of all the circumstances of the transaction, that Dornemann\u2019s actions were unfair, deceptive, and in violation of c. 93A, the judge is then to consider the amount of damages due Mathias and whether the actions were wilful and knowing, keeping in mind Dornemann\u2019s response to Mathias\u2019s written demand for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Although Mathias did not prevail at trial, he is entitled to an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, see <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. at 168, the amount of which shall be established in accordance with the procedures detailed in <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We refer to the trustee and Mathias collectively as \u201cMathias.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">As outlined by NPA, the methodology for taking control of targeted property was: \u201cFirst, the Associate usually contacts the property owner prior to the publication of any [foreclosure] notices thus avoiding the vast majority of competitors. Second, the Associate typically will be operating from a position of controlling the ultimate disposition of the property. This enables the Associate to hold the attention of the property owner during negotiations. Finally, the Associate utilizes time proven step-by-step methods of correctly finding, controlling and acquiring these properties. This all but eliminates wasted time and effort.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Domemann testified that it was actually the seller who was \u201cdistressed\u201d and not the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The name of this entity appears in several different forms in the record before us.

Paragraph four lists the three mortgages on the property and goes on to provide: \u201cThe parties hereby acknowledge that they are aware of the fact that the mortgage(s) and/or encumbrances set forth in this Paragraph 4 are, or may be, subject to conditions which shall permit the oblige[e] thereof (the \u2018lender\u2019) upon the sale, transfer or assignment of the Premises, or any interest therein, by Seller, to: (a) Accelerate the payment of the obligation so that the entire amount of principal and interest is immediately due and payable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\">The value of the property apparently had depreciated because of new septic system regulations, effective as of June, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">More particularly, Mathias alleged (1) fraud in the inducement; (2) breach of contract; (3) violation of the so-called \u201cTruth-in-Lending\u201d law; (4) violation of the so-called \u201cReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act\u201d; (5) misrepresentation; and (6) conveyance of realty without appropriate inspection and certification of its septic system. The judge directed verdicts in Dornemann\u2019s favor on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth counts of the complaint. Mathias makes no argument concerning the directed verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b197-5\">At a bench conference during jury impanelment, the judge gave notice of his reading of the complaint and the manner in which he proposed to conduct the trial. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201cSince this is a 93A action, we\u2019re going to try this case as follows: I\u2019m going to try this case to the jury. I\u2019m going to send all issues to the jury. I\u2019m going to \u2014 their decision is going to be advisory only. I will reserve to myself the right to either accept what they do, reject what they do, or alter what they do. Everybody understand that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Counsel for the parties stated that they understood and neither objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Next, the judge gave preliminary instructions to the jury. He informed them that Mathias was alleging a violation of c. 93A, a statute that \u201cprohibits the use of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the course of certain kinds of dealing,\u201d and that they were \u201cgoing to have to determine . . . whether or not there was an unfair or deceptive act or practice committed.\u201d Again, neither party lodged an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">No objection was taken to the formulation of the special questions put to the jury, to which they responded that (1) Domemann knowingly made a false representation of fact to Mathias, intending to induce him to act or refrain from acting in reliance on the false statement; (2) Mathias, to his damage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>justifiably relied on Domemann\u2019s false statement; (3) Domemann did breach his contract with Mathias; (4) Domemann knowingly and wilfully committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice that caused Mathias to suffer damages in the amount of $26,166.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Nor did Mathias take objection to the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury that they could not find liability under c. 93A without first finding either that Domemann was in breach of his contract with Mathias or that Mathias had relied upon a false representation made by Domemann. When the jury returned with their answers, Domemann sought affirmation of his understanding of the effect of the special verdicts: \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding . . . that this is an advisory jury verdict only on the Chapter 93A . . . which is the only count that is in this case . . . .\u201d When the judge responded \u201cyes,\u201d Mathias remained silent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We reach this conclusion notwithstanding that in Delaney, <em>supra, </em>the court chose to put aside the jury\u2019s special verdicts for purposes of analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence. It did so on the basis that the trial judge refused to accept the jury\u2019s special verdicts for the reason that the evidence was, as matter of law, insufficient to support their responses. The record in the present case allows no doubt. Domemann asked and argued for a directed verdict on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence. After hearing argument, the judge denied the motion and decided the matter on the basis of the evidence presented to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">As for the breach of contract count, the judge stated that he had erroneously instructed the jury that this claim was based solely upon the purchase and sale agreement. We agree that the instruction was wrong. See <em>Chelsea Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Florence, </em>358 Mass. 50, 55 (1970); <em>Chase Commercial Corp. </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 248, 250-251 (1992). Based upon the terms of that agreement <em>and </em>the agreement for sale of real estate, the judge concluded that Domemann never assumed Mathias\u2019s mortgages but, instead, took title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201csubject\u201d to them. When Mathias did not make the payments due under the agreement for sale of real estate, he failed to substantially perform his part of that agreement. Consequently, Dornemann was entitled to evict him from the premises without being in breach of the terms of the agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">That clause reads: \u201cThe parties acknowledge that this Agreement has been entered into by them in full reliance on their own investigation and, except as set forth herein, not on any statements, representations or other agreements made by or with the other party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The judge relied upon the so-called \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d rule and concluded that because Mathias could not show that he had any equity in the property, he could not show that he had suffered any damages by reason of Dornemann\u2019s acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">As set out in 29 Fed.
