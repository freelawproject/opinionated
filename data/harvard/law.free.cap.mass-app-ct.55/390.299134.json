The defendant appeals, claiming that the motion judge erred in denying his request for the children\u2019s counseling records, that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument requires reversal, and that the jury instructions on fresh complaint were erroneous. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s proof consisted of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s children, \u201cJames,\u201d age 9, and \u201cSarah,\u201d age 8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> their mother, three fresh complaint witnesses, and a psychiatrist experienced in dealing with victims of childhood sexual abuse. The defense attempted to establish through cross-examination that the children had been subjected to a series of suggestive interviews. Defense counsel argued in her closing argument that the suggestive interview techniques, combined with the mother\u2019s hatred of the father, distorted the children\u2019s memories.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The jury could have found that the defendant touched Sarah indecently and engaged in unnatural sexual intercourse with her, and that the defendant had caressed James\u2019s buttocks and inserted his finger in his rectum on more than one occasion. James and Sarah testified that James had been in the room when his father had licked Sarah\u2019s private parts. According to James, these incidents of sexual abuse happened when he was in the first grade and a \u201clittle bit in the second grade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Their mother testified that she left the defendant on August 18, 1994. On September 15, 1994, she brought the children to a Harvard Community Health facility, where they met, together and separately, with a licensed social worker, Fred Moder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Her children had not told her of any sexual abuse by their father, and she had never seen any such abuse. She learned of the allegations when she was later contacted by the Department of Social Services (DSS).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Moder testified that the mother did not give him any informa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>tian about the defendant sexually or physically abusing the children. While meeting alone with Moder, James disclosed to Moder that his father would lie in bed with him and rub his buttocks under his pajamas. During a follow up visit on September 20, Moder asked James whether his father had inserted his finger into his rectum and James said, \u201cmaybe a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">At her first meeting with Moder, Sarah told him that her father would tickle her. Moder asked her whether the area her father tickled included her private parts. Sarah replied that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">After meeting with the children, Moder advised the mother that he would be contacting DSS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moder filed a report pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Upon receiving Moder\u2019s \u00a7 51A report, Sean Carleton, an investigator for DSS, met with the defendant and advised him of the allegations. The defendant stated that he was physically affectionate with his children and that he had tickled James on his upper back and buttocks, but that the touching had not been sexual.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Carleton interviewed the children. James told Carleton that his father had tickled and rubbed his back and buttocks on more than one occasion and that he did not like it. Carleton did not ask James whether his father had inserted his finger in his rectum.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Sarah cried and would not talk to Carleton alone. She was permitted to sit on her mother\u2019s lap and whisper her answers to her mother. Carleton asked her whether her father had touched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>her in a way that she did not like. Sarah\u2019s crying intensified and she buried her head in her mother\u2019s shoulder. Carleton could hear her whisper to her mother that her father had licked her private parts. Sarah refused to answer any more questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Elizabeth Schon Vainer, an employee of the district attorney\u2019s office, testified that she conducted separate videotaped interviews of the children on October 28, 1994. She stated that in response to her questions, James told her that his father would \u201ctake him into his mother\u2019s bedroom and lie him on the bed and rub his bum and stick his finger up his bum a little.\u201d She testified further that James told her it was difficult for him to tell her this. She asked him how he knew that the finger went in his bottom and he said because it hurt a little. James told her that it happened at two different places they had lived and that the first person he had told was Moder.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Sarah told Schon Vainer that the defendant spread her legs and kissed and licked her \u201cdown there\u201d on one occasion. Sarah told her that James was also in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Dr. Renee Brant testified that when children tell about having experienced child sexual abuse, it is not usually \u201ca one-time, straight forward event,\u201d but rather, a process of gradual, tentative, disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">1. <em>The children\u2019s counseling records. </em>After discovery was completed, the defendant moved to compel production of his children\u2019s records from DSS and counseling records from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (MSPCC), generated after the children\u2019s disclosure. The defendant was in possession of the \u00a7 51A report, the \u00a7 5 IB report, the videotape, and Moder\u2019s notes. The defendant\u2019s motion set forth facts which he alleged supported his claim that the . records contained relevant information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The salient portions of the defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of the motion made pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993) <em>(Bishop), </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">\u201cSince the allegations, the children have been seen regularly by counselors at the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. ... A review of these records by the Court is essential because the allegations first were made in the troubled environment of a recent separation of the parents. Such situations are likely to give rise to false or exaggerated allegations. The records are likely to contain evidence of bias by the mother of the children. Given the children\u2019s reluctance to speak during the taped interview, the records may show evidence of coaching or inconsistent statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">A hearing was conducted on the motion, in which the Commonwealth argued that the records were subject to the social worker privilege. See <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 216, 218 (1995) (Commonwealth is entitled to protect privileged records not required by <em>Bishop </em>to be disclosed). During the hearing, the judge discussed with counsel whether the more stringent standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 226 (1996), applied to the children\u2019s counseling records. The judge issued a decision the next day:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cCertain of the children\u2019s confidential psychiatric[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] records have already been provided to defense counsel including the medical records prepared by the psychiatrist to whom the children originally made their disclosures. This prior disclosure of records suggests that concerns as to the confidentiality of the records requested have less urgency than the confidentiality concerns raised in [Commonwealth] v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 [(1996)]. Moreover, confidentiality was almost certainly not a motivating factor behind any participation in therapy by the children at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>issue.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] Nevertheless, this court feels compelled to deny the defendant\u2019s motion based on the precepts articulated in <em>[Commonwealth] </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 [(1993),] as amplified by more recent judicial pronouncements on the general topic. [Citation to Single Justice opinion omitted.] Cf. [Commonwealth] v. <em>Fuller, supra. </em>In short, the motion is denied based on an insufficienfcy] of relevance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Review on appeal is limited to whether the judge abused her discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 572 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 427 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">a. <em>Privilege determination. </em>The defendant reads the first and second sentences of the motion judge\u2019s decision to mean that the motion judge believed that any privilege the children had in their counseling records may have been waived by the mother\u2019s consent to the assistant district attorney\u2019s disclosure of Moder\u2019s notes, and that he was, therefore, entitled to the records. At the motion hearing, the defendant did not raise the issue of waiver; he argues it for the first time on appeal. An issue not raised below generally will not be considered on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>409 Mass. 675, 678 (1991); Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In any event, we do not construe the language of the motion judge as a finding that the children\u2019s privilege in their counseling records may have been waived. Rather, it appears that the parties and the judge proceeded on the assumption that the records were privileged under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 135A and 135B (delineating the social worker privilege).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In appropriate cases, we may proceed to conduct appellate review where the privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>determination is implied. See <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 174 n.2 (parties proceeded on the assumption that the records were privileged); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>431 Mass. 609, 616 (2000) (same). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, 47 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 792, 795-796 (1999) (court reviewed a <em>Bishop </em>determination despite a lack of written findings); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zane Z., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 143-145 (2001) (judge did not reduce stage one findings to writing, but no reason to remand for written findings without some showing of what might be accomplished).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The Commonwealth\u2019s release, as part of its discovery obligations, of the \u00a7 51A report, the \u00a7 51B report, and the videotape did not constitute a waiver of any of the children\u2019s privileges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 695, 697 n.4, 700 (1997) (although a defendant is entitled to a \u00a7 5 IB report, that fact does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that documents supporting the \u00a7 5 IB report lose their privilege or confidentiality). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>404 Mass. 339, 341 (1989) (defendant entitled to \u00a7 51B report); Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 186-187 &amp; n.2 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 178, 182 n.7 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Nor did the mother\u2019s consensual release of Moder\u2019s Harvard Community Health progress notes operate as a waiver of the social worker privilege in the children\u2019s counseling records from the MSPCC, an entirely separate entity. First, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the mother was aware of the privilege at the time she signed the release. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neumyer, </em>432 Mass. 23, 36 n.16 (2000) (no valid waiver of privilege where record did not indicate that an un-counseled eighteen year old had been informed of her rights with regard to the privilege). See also rule 511 of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence (disclosure does not create a waiver of a privilege if the privileged matter is disclosed under compulsion or if the disclosure was made without an opportunity to assert the privilege).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Second, the privilege protects communications. The fact that Moder\u2019s notes contained, perhaps, the same subject matter as the counseling records does not create a waiver of the children\u2019s privilege in other protected communications. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495, 499-500 (1985) (where a witness testifies about the underlying <em>topic </em>of a privileged communication there is no waiver, but where the witness testifies to the <em>specific </em>privileged communication, there may be a waiver)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>402 Mass. 664, 669 (1988) (witness who testified regarding mental health treatment did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201cnot relinquish all protection by merely testifying to events falling within the subject matter of a privilege\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Neither the case law nor the rules of criminal procedure supports the dissent\u2019s assumption that a defendant is automatically entitled to receive material that is not privileged or for which a privilege has been waived. The defendant still would be required to comply with the rules of criminal procedure concerning discovery or production of evidence from third parties. Any criminal discovery or production motion, whether brought under Mass.R.Crim.P. 14, 378 Mass. 874 (1979), or Mass.R.Crim.P. 17, 378 Mass. 885 (1979), or characterized as a <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>motion, must meet a threshold standard of relevance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Relevance is a requirement for access to even non-privileged records. Nothing in <em>Bishop </em>is to the contrary. Rather, <em>Bishop </em>prescribes a <em>protocol </em>for dealing with records which may contain relevant information and which may be subject to a privilege. The statement in <em>Bishop </em>that \u201c[i]f the judge rules that the undisclosed clinic records are not privileged, then the judge shall release the records to the parties,\u201d <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. at 184, was not intended to do away with the threshold relevance inquiry which precedes application of the <em>Bishop </em>protocol itself. That this is so is apparent from the <em>Bishop </em>court\u2019s handling of the defendant\u2019s claimed entitlement to school records, which were not privileged. Citing Mass.R.Crim.P. 14, the court determined that the sought-after school records were not relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>and denied the defendant access to these records. See <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 186-187.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Where a defendant seeks access to confidential or sensitive material, a balancing test is employed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tripolone, </em>425 Mass. 487, 489 (1997) (court concluded that the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocol applied to communications which were considered by statute \u201cconfidential\u201d but not privileged); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wanis, </em>426 Mass. 639, 644-645 (1998) (citing <em>Fuller, </em>the court held that where a motion for production of internal affairs records is opposed, the defendant must advance a specific, good faith reason for believing that the information is relevant to a material issue in the criminal proceedings and could be of real benefit to the defense before personal information about a police officer is disclosed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neu- \u25a0 myer, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 154, 162 (1999), <em>S.C., </em>432 Mass. 23 (2000) (where the judge concluded that a hotline log was not privileged and that the defendant\u2019s proffer was sufficient under <em>Fuller </em>for in camera review, it was proper for the judge to order production of the hotline records through use of a rule 17(a)(2) subpoena duces tecum). See also G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB; <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>480 U.S. 39, 52-56 &amp; n.9 (1987) (the confrontation clause and the compulsory process clause do not create a constitutionally compelled rule of pretrial discovery; the appropriate analysis is conducted under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">b. <em>Relevancy determination. </em>The motion judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s proffer on relevance was insufficient under <em>Bishop. </em>As we have stated, appellate review is limited to whether the judge abused her discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 572; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 940, 943-944 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Relevancy determinations are case and fact specific. The defendant argues that his affidavit satisfied the relevancy standard, at least, for in camera review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s proffer was comprised of three discemable theories of relevance: first, that the children had been subjected to suggestive interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>techniques by Moder, Carleton, and Schon Vainer; second, that the mother\u2019s ill will toward the father influenced the children to make false accusations; and third, that a troubled environment due to family separation was likely to lead to exaggeration and false charges.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The defendant\u2019s first theory, that the counseling records \u201cmay\u201d show that the children were subjected to additional suggestive interview techniques, fails. While it is true that the children disclosed gradually, first to Moder and then to Carleton, they did so before receiving counseling. The post-disclosure counseling records sought by the defendant were unlikely to demonstrate that the children\u2019s initial disclosures were the subject of later suggestive interviewing techniques. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone </em>Z., 51 Mass. App. Ct. at 146 (concluding that the juvenile did not establish a factual basis for review where counseling was \u201cpost event\u201d and therefore less likely to be relevant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>427 Mass. at 428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(children\u2019s allegations came out in the counseling process). Moreover, to the extent that Moder, Carleton, or Schon Vainer used suggestive interviewing techniques, the defendant was already in possession of that information, as he was in possession of their reports, the videotape, and a transcript of the videotape.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The defendant\u2019s second theory, that the \u201ctroubled environment\u201d of a recent separation is likely to give rise to false or exaggerated allegations, was not supported in any way, either by generalized statistics, studies, expert opinion, or by any specific factual references to the children\u2019s situation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Syrafos, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 211, 215-216 (1995) (defendant\u2019s claim that victims of childhood incest have flashbacks of prior rapes was not supported by record).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">With regard to the third theory of relevance, the mother\u2019s purported ill will toward the father, again the defendant offered no specific factual references in support of this theory. Moreover, there is nothing in Moder\u2019s notes or the DSS reports to support the claim that the mother had manipulated the disclosure.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In our view, the judge did not abuse her discretion when she determined that the defendant\u2019s motion failed to establish sufficient relevance to warrant an in camera review. Here, the defendant\u2019s theory, that the records might contain evidence of the mother\u2019s bias or evidence that the children were led by suggestive interview techniques during counseling sessions, was based on \u201cthe hope that the unearthing of some unspecified information would enable [the defendant] to impeach the witness.\u201d <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. at 182, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Gissendanner, </em>48 N.Y. 2d 543, 549 (1979). This is exactly the sort of fish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ing expedition <em>Bishop </em>was designed to prohibit. Were such allegations sufficient to overcome the privilege, the counseling records of any child who received counseling after a substantiation of abuse and whose parents were divorcing would be subject to court inspection. Although inspection by a judge may be less of an intrusion than inspection by an attorney and subsequent disclosure at trial, <em>Bishop </em>intended that even at this early stage, the moving party must clear a hurdle that is more than just a pleading requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 224-225; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMaria, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 120-121 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In cases in which the privilege has been pierced by a sufficient showing of relevance, the theory of relevance has been grounded in specific facts related to the case, rather than generalizations or unsubstantiated allegations. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>431 Mass. at 615 (affidavit reciting facts surrounding the victim\u2019s suicide attempt nine months after her disclosure, which led to the disintegration of her family, when coupled with the failure to report the incident to police, demonstrated that the records surrounding the incident were likely to contain information relevant to the victim\u2019s credibility). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neumyer, </em>432 Mass. at 32-33 (affidavit set forth sufficient factors to establish that the victim\u2019s conversation with a rape counselor was the \u201cturning point\u201d in the case, thus meeting the <em>Fuller </em>standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The defendant also failed to establish that the information he sought was not otherwise available. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. at 183 n.9; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zane Z., </em>51 Mass. App. at 146. There is no indication in the defendant\u2019s affidavit that he made any effort to obtain this information in his capacity as the children\u2019s parent. Compare 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12.08(4) (1993) (noncustodial parent has the same right of access to \u00a7 51A and \u00a7 5 IB reports as a custodial parent) with 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12.09(5) (1993) (if DSS \u201chas reason to believe that disclosure ... of all or a portion of the social service file would be contrary to the child\u2019s best interest, the Department shall deny access and shall bring to the court\u2019s attention the reason(s) for denying access\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">As noted above, the decision of the motion judge is reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMaria, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 120. Considering the lack of detail in the defendant\u2019s proffer, we cannot say the judge abused her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Finally, the defendant was able to cross-examine Moder, Carleton, and Schon Vainer about their interviewing techniques.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the mother to determine whether she harbored such ill will against the father that she would manipulate the children to cultivate the allegation of abuse. The defendant also had the opportunity to cross-examine the children and explore the circumstances of their disclosure. As a member of the family, the defendant likely had access to information or other family and friends who could have substantiated his theory. The defendant was not precluded from arguing his theory of the case to the jury in closing argument. This case does not present a reasonable risk that nondisclosure of the victim\u2019s treatment records could have resulted in prejudice to the defendant or produced an erroneous conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. at 177; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">2. <em>Other issues. </em>The defendant raised two additional arguments in his brief: alleged defects in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and the trial judge\u2019s instructions on fresh complaint. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s arguments are without merit. Examination of the record reveals that the prosecutor was within the bounds of proper argument and that the instructions adequately conveyed to the jury that fresh complaint evidence may be used only for corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The names are fictitious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Moder testified that the mother\u2019s stated reason for bringing the children to counseling was because she had recently separated from the defendant and was concerned that the children would feel forced to take sides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The mother testified that at the end of her meeting she did not understand that Moder planned to contact DSS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Certain persons (including, but not limited to, physicians, social workers, and teachers) are mandated to report suspected child abuse to DSS.

The court rejected the proposition that testifying about an event would waive the attorney-client privilege and expressly adopted the position that only testimony about the content of the privileged communication would result in a waiver. Although this is not a case of \u201cwaiver by testimony,\u201d but rather of alleged waiver by consent, the reasoning is analogous. The dissent relies on rule 510 of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence as support for the conclusion that the privilege may have been waived by the mother\u2019s consent to the release of Moder\u2019s notes. Proposed Rule 510 states: \u201cA person upon whom these rules confer a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege, if he or his predecessor while holder of the privilege voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>of the privileged matter.\u201d The privileged matter refers to the communication, not the topic of the communication.

The defendant argued that Schon Vainer used suggestive interviewing techniques in the videotaped interview and that if counsel could see the DSS records of the children\u2019s counseling sessions, perhaps there would be additional evidence of suggestiveness. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Before Schon Vainer testified, the defendant again argued that Moder, Carleton, and Schon Vainer used suggestive interviewing techniques and that if DSS had used suggestive techniques in between Carleton\u2019s interview and Schon Vainer\u2019s interview, then he would be better able to challenge Schon Vainer\u2019s testimony. The trial judge denied the motion, observing that there was no link between DSS and Schon Vainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">After the Commonwealth presented all of its evidence, the defendant renewed his motion for the counseling records, arguing that if defense counsel were able to have access to the DSS records, that she \u201cprobably would be able to present to the Court a much stronger case to present to the jury, a much stronger case that these children were seriously influenced by the suggestive investigation process.\u201d The judge again denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The defendant also argued at the motion hearing that in the past she had two cases in which young children had recanted in counseling records, and that the children were under pressure because of the defendant\u2019s bad fathering while struggling with alcohol and drug abuse, and that the \u201cmother was suffering from depression and stress from all of this. . . .

In my view, the majority has effectively submerged the key issue here: whether the trial judge made a proper initial determination, required by <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169, 179-183 (1993), whether the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (MSPCC) and the Department of Social Services (DSS) counseling records were, in fact, privileged. Moreover, the majority says little or nothing about the heretofore vaguely defined standards relevant to making such a determination. These issues are crucial to assessing the defendant\u2019s claims. However, on the record before us, there are simply too many unanswered questions to permit meaningful review of these points. The only prudent course, therefore, would be to remand the case to the Superior Court for a further hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for production of the contested counseling records.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The majority, however, rejects the necessity for even this brief detour. Given the extraordinary power of <em>Bishop </em>and its cognate cases to deprive a defendant of a cornerstone constitutional right \u2014 the right to marshal all relevant evidence in his defense \u2014 special care must be taken to ensure that all procedural safeguards mandated by these decisions are strictly enforced. Here there were irregularities, as the majority concedes. Due process requires correction of these missteps before the defendant\u2019s rights are set aside. For this reason, I respectfully dissent. I set out my analysis at some length, since this issue likely will recur in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">1. <em>Adequacy of privilege determination. </em>At the time the defendant\u2019s motion for production of the complainants\u2019 counseling records was considered, the standard for determining whether these particular forms of potentially privileged documents were susceptible to discovery was provided exclusively by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, supra. </em>That is to say, the additional burdens imposed on a defendant seeking access to privileged records imposed by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 226 (1996), had not yet been made applicable to materials other than those described in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Commonwealth concedes, and as the majority concludes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the DSS and MSPCC records sought here are not rape counselor records as defined by that section. Rather, the parties stipulated at trial, and agree on appeal, that the records were subject only to the social worker privilege as expressed in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 135A and 135B. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>435 Mass. 183, 185 &amp; n.1 (2001) (applying <em>Bishop </em>to cases tried before <em>Fuller </em>principles were deemed to control proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Under <em>Bishop, </em>the motion judge was required first to assess whether the documents sought were subject to any privilege and, if so, to determine whether the privilege had been waived. As noted already by the majority, the judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201cThe defendant here is accused of molesting his own children and asks this court to order production of DSS and counselling records generated since the children \u2018disclosed\u2019 the alleged abuse. Certain of the children\u2019s confidential psychiatric records have already been provided to defense counsel including the medical records prepared by the psychiatrist to whom the children originally made their disclosures. This prior disclosure of records suggests that concerns as to the confidentiality of the records requested have less urgency than the confidentiality concerns raised in <em>[Commonwealth] </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 [(1996)]. Moreover, confidentiality was almost certainly not a motivating factor behind any participation in therapy by the children at issue. Nevertheless, this Court feels compelled to deny the defendant\u2019s motion based on the precepts articulated in <em>[Commonwealth] </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 [(1993)] .... In short, the motion is denied based on an insufficien[cy] of relevance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Unfortunately, the motion judge\u2019s order confuses and conflates the initial analytical steps mandated by <em>Bishop. </em>Specifically, she failed to comply with <em>Bishop\u2019s </em>basic procedural mandate that a motion judge, having found the existence of a privilege, must provide detailed written findings explaining the specific type, nature, and basis of the applicable privilege. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. at 181. Merely reciting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>existence of a privilege, without more, is an insufficient basis, as matter of law, for denying a motion for production of confidential records. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>427 Mass. 427, 429-430 (1998). The motion judge\u2019s findings were simply not sufficiently detailed to meet the <em>Bishop </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">As a result of this procedural shortcoming, we cannot be sure how (or whether) the judge dealt with the evidence suggesting that any privilege with respect to the children\u2019s counseling records had been waived. As conceded by the majority, and as observed by the motion judge, the defendant received copies of the counseling records of Fred Moder, the clinical social worker to whom both children made the initial reports of abuse. These materials contained significant information, both about the nature of the abuse allegedly suffered by the children, as well as the children\u2019s reactions to same.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">While adverting obliquely to the possible effects of these disclosures on the status of the children\u2019s privilege (\u201c[tjhis prior disclosure of records suggests that concerns as to the confidentiality of the records requested have less urgency than the confidentiality concerns raised in [Commonwealth] v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 [(1993)]\u201d), the judge makes no definitive findings of fact or rulings of law on the issue. Rather, the motion judge\u2019s order suggests she may have believed that it was unnecessary to reach the privilege question because, in her view, the defendant had failed to satisfy the relevance requirements of <em>Bishop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The majority takes note of the serious procedural defects in the motion judge\u2019s handling of the privilege determination, concluding that \u201c[t]he motion judge\u2019s written decision <em>combined the privilege determination stage with the relevancy determination stage\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>Ante </em>at note 9. However, the majority then condones this fatal failure to abide by the plain mandate of <em>Bishop </em>by speculating that the judge may merely have been wrestling with the question of whether <em>Bishop </em>afforded the correct standard for review, or whether the elevated standard in <em>Fuller, </em>as discussed above, applied. The basis for this speculation is elusive to say the least. In any event, and much more important, neither <em>Fuller, </em>nor any case postdating <em>Bishop, </em>relieves a motion judge of his duty to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>separately, as a threshold matter, whether counseling documents subject to a production request are privileged. The bottom line is that, regardless of the reason, the judge failed to follow required procedures; due process entitles the defendant to more.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">By passing over the question of privilege because, in her view, the defendant would be unable to prove relevancy, the motion judge may have missed the dispositive issue here. At common law, the voluntary disclosure of privileged material constitutes a waiver of the privilege. This principle is echoed in rule 510 of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence, which provides that \u201c[a] person upon whom these rules confer a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege, if he . . . voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter.\u201d This concept is most commonly applied in the criminal law context in connection with the various testimonial privileges, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495, 499-500 (1985), but applies with equal force to the release of confidential records. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>402 Mass. 664, 667 (1988). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 584 n.2 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Needless to say, the mere fact that some privileged documents have been disclosed does not automatically destroy the privileged status of cognate materials \u2014 here the DSS and MSPCC reports. However, there is a serious question in this case \u2014 and one not adequately addressed by the motion judge in her order \u2014 whether the release of Moder\u2019s records amounted to a voluntary waiver of privilege with respect to all counseling records connected with the charged assault. As noted already, this question of whether a privilege attaches to the documents sought by the defendant is a crucial threshold issue on which the applicability of the entire <em>Bishop </em>regime hinges. All ambiguities on this point, therefore, need to be erased before we can begin to determine whether <em>Bishop </em>was correctly applied in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">To justify the motion judge\u2019s actions, the majority relies on the dichotomy between concepts of privileged \u201csubject matter\u201d and privileged \u201ccommunications.\u201d In essence, the majority takes the position that even if the victims here voluntarily consented, through their guardian, to the release of Moder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>counseling records, and even if the information in these materials were identical to the material contained in the DSS and MSPCC reports, nonetheless there would be no waiver. In the majority\u2019s view, each separate communication of confidential material carries with it a discrete privilege that must be individually waived. Thus, in the majority\u2019s view, if a sexual assault victim relates precisely the same information to three doctors, each of whom produces a separate record of the conversation, the voluntary disclosure of two of the reports would not constitute a waiver of confidentiality with respect to the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">As a basis for this view, the majority relies on two cases, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>402 Mass. at 669, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. at 500, neither of which, in fact, supports the majority\u2019s approach. Both <em>Clancy </em>and <em>Goldman </em>stand for the well-settled principle that \u201ca witness does not relinquish [a privilege in a confidential record] ... by merely testifying to events falling within the subject matter of a privilege.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>402 Mass. at 669. As the Supreme Judicial Court stated in <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. at 499-500:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201c[there are] two distinct scenarios. In the first, a witness testifies as to events which happen to have been a topic of a privileged communication. In the second, the witness testifies as to the specific content of an identified privileged communication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Privilege is <em>not </em>waived in the first situation, the court concluded, but it is in the second. See <em>Goldman, supra </em>at 500. Neither case, however, has anything to say about whether expressly waiving a privilege with respect to a confidential communication also waives any privilege inhering in the same communication made to a different confidante.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u25a0 Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, the general rule in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, is that once a communication is conveyed to a third party, any privilege in the communication is destroyed. See Liacos, Brodin, &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 13.4.5 (7th ed. 1999); <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>250 Mass. 41, 44-45 (1924). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>367 Mass. 454, 460-461 (1975). The policy basis for such an approach is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>plain: confidentiality rules are designed to promote full discussion of private, possibly embarrassing information with confidential counselors by assuring that the substance of the communication will remain private. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>416 Mass. at 176. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>387 Mass. 424, 428 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Once the details of a confidential communication have been publicly disclosed, no policy interest is served by continuing to protect that communication with a privilege, at least where disclosure was consensual on the part of the privilege holder. This is equally true whether the communication was made to one or more confidantes. Once the communication is made public, the basis for the privilege disappears with respect to all recipients of that communication. This view is entirely consistent with rule 510 of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence which, as noted, provides that a privilege dissipates if the privilege holder \u201cvoluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter.\u201d See also Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 503(a)(3) (communications confidential if not intended to be conveyed to others).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 571 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 427 (1998): \u201cThe <em>Bishop </em>protocols have not altered the traditional recognition that testimonial privileges, which have the effect of inhibiting full disclosure of the truth, are exceptional and to be strictly construed.\u201d We added in <em>Pare, </em>quoting <em>Bishop </em>itself, that to assure a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial, any doubts as to the applicability of a privilege must be resolved \u201cin favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. at 177. The majority\u2019s expansive concept of privilege directly opposes these concepts. If the DSS and MSPCC records here are substantially cumulative of Moder\u2019s reports, due process requires that they all be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">2. <em>Standard for finding waiver of privilege. </em>To the extent the question of waiver of privilege is largely a fact issue that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, I believe, as noted already, that the only option here is to remand the matter to the motion judge for a further hearing. The subject matter of such a hearing would be two-fold: first, the motion judge would consider whether it appears from the record before her, supplemented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>any additional materials the parties may wish to adduce, that Moder\u2019s records and reports constitute a \u201csignificant\u201d (quoting proposed rule 510) portion of the otherwise privileged counseling materials in this case. To this end, the motion judge must assess whether the documents already disclosed are similar in character, scope and form to the documents still sought by the defendant, or whether they merely constitute a small and insignificant subset of the main body of privileged materials, with but little overlap and slight affinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">If the judge were to find that a significant part (as defined above) of the corpus of otherwise privileged materials here has been disclosed, she should then consider a second, separate issue: whether the disclosure was knowing and voluntary vis-a-vis the two child victims, <em>in whom the privilege resides. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neumyer, </em>432 Mass. 23, 35 n.15 (2000). Where a child is too young or otherwise is unable to engage in meaningful consultation about the merits of waiving a privilege, it is permissible for a court to permit a parent to waive (or refuse to waive) the privilege on the child\u2019s behalf. If, as it appears, the victims\u2019 mother voluntarily consented to the release of the privileged documents surrendered to the defendant \u2014 a point that must be verified at the hearing \u2014 her action likely can be imputed to the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">However, where the interests of child and parent diverge, a court is required to appoint a guardian to safeguard the child\u2019s interests in maintaining the confidentiality of privileged records. See <em>Adoption of Diane, </em>400 Mass. 196, 202 (1987). Cf. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (regarding appointment of guardians for the purpose of asserting a patient\u2019s privilege). Although there is nothing in the record here supporting such an inference, if it emerges at the hearing that there is good reason to believe that the victims\u2019 mother was motivated by concerns at odds with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>best interests of the children when she agreed to release Moder\u2019s records and reports, then the motion judge cannot find any waiver in the disclosure of those materials. Again, the privilege belongs to the children; only they, or those properly authorized to act on their behalf, can waive the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">If the motion judge were to determine there has been a waiver of the privilege, the defendant would be entitled to examine all of the materials sought in his original discovery order. Based upon that review, the defendant could then file a motion for a new trial, setting out precisely how the newly disclosed materials might have advanced his defense. A new trial would be required here only if an improper failure to disclose the requested materials resulted in actual prejudice. Absent prejudice, no relief would be required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>431 Mass. 609, 617 (2000), might be read to suggest that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 226 (1996), was intended to encompass a broader range of privileged documents than those defined by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J. However, a close reading of <em>Fuller </em>reveals no such express intention. Indeed, the decision, while allowing that <em>Bishop </em>applies to all forms of privileged material, discusses at length why \u00a7 20J docu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>merits, as opposed to other types of privileged material, should be subject to a stricter rule.
