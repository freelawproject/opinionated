L. c. 266, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His appellate issues are that (1) the identity of the informant described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>in the search warrant affidavit should have been disclosed; (2) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not pursuing a <em>Franks </em>or <em>Amral </em>hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (3) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">1. <em>Background of the informant information and the search warrant. </em>On February 7, 1996, an informant told Detective Lally of the Boston police department about a plan in the works by which the defendant and three other men, while masked and armed with semiautomatic handguns, would rob an Oriental rug store in the Brighton section of Boston. The defendant was familiar with the target store because he operated an antiques store nearby. With one of the other conspirators, the defendant cased the store to appraise the rugs and check out potential security. The booty was to be fenced by the defendant. It was a part of the plan to steal a van to use for transporting the Oriental rugs. To that end, the informant and a confederate delivered to the defendant\u2019s home a stolen white Chevrolet Astro van, which was reported stolen by its owner on January 29, 1996. (For reasons that will become apparent in a moment, the loading capacity and make of the pilfered van were of more than stylish interest, but rather were a match to a white Chevrolet Astro van owned by the defendant\u2019s wife.) According to the information provided by the informant for the search warrant, the informant and another drove the stolen Astro to the defendant\u2019s farmhouse on January 31, 1996, where it was to be held for the planned robbery. The Astro was parked in the middle bay of the defendant\u2019s large garage. The informant and his companion then met with the defendant to discuss the matters afoot concerning the robbery plan. The defendant displayed semiautomatic handguns to be used in the robbery. The meeting then ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The planned robbery never occurred. Instead, within a week after the delivery of the stolen Astro, the informant turned to the State\u2019s side. On February 7, 1996, the informant met with the police and laid out the plan and the instrumentalities to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>used to effect the heist, including information about the stolen Astro and guns being held at the defendant\u2019s house. On the same day the informant provided the information, February 7, 1996, the police obtained and executed a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s home. The stolen Astro was found in the garage. There was obvious damage to the steering column and ignition, including a hole through which the ignition could be jump-started. In addition, execution of the warrant yielded forty-five boxes of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">2. <em>Disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity. </em>The defendant contends the trial judge should have ordered disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity because the informant was a peg in a potential trial defense that the defendant was \u201cset up.\u201d The defendant\u2019s theory goes something like this: The defendant surmises the informant was John Doe<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because Doe delivered the Astro to his house. If this guess had been confirmed by disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity, then, or so the defendant argues, he would have been able to advance a defense that Doe, who had pending unrelated charges, was seeking to curry favor with the government by a \u201cset-up\u201d of the defendant as the \u201cfall guy.\u201d To do so, Doe misled the defendant and his wife to believe that the Astro rightfully belonged to Doe. Except for this set-up, the defendant had no idea the van was stolen. This claim of error in the nondisclosure of the informant \u2014 even if the informant was, in fact, Doe \u2014 does not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We state the pertinent principles concerning disclosure of informants and then explain why these legal principles did not warrant disclosure in this case. At trial, the standard for determining whether an informant\u2019s identity should be disclosed is predicated on a showing of materiality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe cases that have required disclosure at trial have all done so on a standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>materiality or something roughly akin thereto.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>406 Mass. 565, 571 (1990). See generally <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 60-62 (1957).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is a general principle that materiality may exist \u201cwhere the informer is an active participant in the alleged crime or the only nongovernment witness, [and] disclosure usually has been ordered\u201d in such circumstances. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 572.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the \u201cproper inquiry [at trial] concerns whether disclosure would have provided material evidence needed by the defendant for a fair presentation of his case to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>While a superficial cut appears to lend some depth to the proposition that the informant was subject to disclosure because he was an active participant when the Astro was delivered, a slightly deeper cut to the offense elements and their proof in this case (by independent evidence, including nongovernment witnesses) makes clear that the informant was neither an active participant in, nor a material witness concerning the crime of possession of the stolen motor vehicle. The elements of possession of a stolen motor vehicle under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28, require proof that (1) the vehicle is stolen, (2) the defendant possessed the vehicle, and (3) the defendant knew that the vehicle was stolen.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 191, 193 (1979). On these elements, the informant was not a material witness, for \u201c[t]he Commonwealth [did] not need the testimony of the confidential informant at trial to prove its case on the possessory offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>John, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 702, 704 n.1 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The three elements of the possession offense were proved at trial without any material evidence involving the informant, who was not even actively present during the period of possession, having disappeared from the scene after the delivery. For the first element, the Commonwealth proved that the Astro belonged to another person, who reported it stolen. For the second element, the defendant\u2019s possession was proved at trial by evidence of the February 7 seizure of the Astro in his garage; evidence that the Astro had been held at the defendant\u2019s home for at least four days, which was established by the introduction of weather service records documenting six inches of snow on February 3, 1996, and the fact that there were no tire tracks from the garage door four days later, as of February 7; evidence that two of the defendant\u2019s employees had seen the Astro there; and the wife\u2019s admission that the Astro was held in their garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">For the third element of proof, that the defendant knew the Astro was stolen, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>and again was independent of the informant\u2019s delivery of the van, rendering that act of diminished consequence. \u201c[T]he trier of fact [may] infer knowledge [that a vehicle is stolen] from circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. 132, 136 (1984). Here the circumstantial evidence proving that the defendant knew of the stolen nature of the van included observable damage to the ignition and steering column, which bore a hole indicating that the theft was accomplished by defeating the locking mechanism so as to enable ignition. In addition, the rightful owner\u2019s license plates had been removed from the Astro. That fact had relevance in connection with mysterious circumstances involving the plates registered to the wife\u2019s similar van, her loss of memory concerning what had happened to her \u201cbroken\u201d white Astro, and why its plates were found in the garage nearby the stolen Astro \u2014 all of which gave rise to a strong inference that the wife\u2019s plates had been removed from her Astro in order to switch them to the stolen Astro. As a result of such a switch, if the police were to see the stolen Astro and run the plates, the resulting computer registration inquiry would not turn up the Astro, now re-attired with the wife\u2019s plates, as a stolen vehicle. Finally, the coup de grace establishing the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the van as stolen came from his efforts to elicit penurious testimony from his two employees to explain away the van\u2019s presence. Bertrand Bab-bin, a reluctant witness who worked for the defendant\u2019s antiques business and lived at the house, testified that the defendant had solicited him to say that Babbin was responsible for renting out the garage bays. A Randolph detective who had interviewed Babbin testified that Babbin told him that the defendant had asked Babbin to testify that, when the Astro van was delivered, the defendant was not at home. Babbin declined the defendant\u2019s invitation to lie and, instead, testified that the defendant, and not Babbin, was responsible for any rentals of the garage. Anthony Velez, another employee of the defendant, described the defendant\u2019s fictitious explanation to him to the effect that the van belonged to a friend of the defendant and that he was considering purchasing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In light of all of this evidence, the informant\u2019s involvement in the \u201cacquisition of possession [was] not crucial to a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Crawley </em>v. <em>Rundle, </em>312 F. Supp. 15, 17 (E.D. Pa. 1969).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Put another way, the crime was a possessory offense and was proved long after the informant had left the scene. The informant was not \u201cplaced by the prosecution in a central role in the case\u201d and thus was not \u201ccentral to the defense.\u201d Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Choice, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 909 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Furthermore, disclosure of the informant was not required in order to \u201cprovide[] material evidence needed by the defendant for a fair presentation of his case to the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>406 Mass. at 574. The defendant, as noted, contends that disclosure was critical to a set-up defense that he would have proffered at trial. But, even assuming that disclosure would have confirmed the defendant\u2019s suspicion concerning Doe as the informant, that Doe had delivered the Astro to the defendant\u2019s home was a known fact \u2014 indeed, the defendant\u2019s wife so testified. Thus if the defendant\u2019s theoretical defense rested on establishing that Doe had engaged in deception when he delivered the Astro, then the defendant could have called Doe as a witness. Further, as described in part 3, <em>infra, </em>the defendant could have called as a witness James Rondinelli, who was also present at the delivery. Nothing precluded the defendant from calling these two witnesses. Moreover, even were a set-up defense to be built on the opening act of delivery, proof concerning the defendant\u2019s after-acquired knowledge that the Astro was stolen and his continuing possession would still constitute a crime under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28, whether or not, in the original act of delivery, Doe suggested he had rightful possession. Stated from a different perspective, the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the Astro was stolen was proved by strong evidence developed <em>subsequent to, </em>and independent of, the original act of delivery. For these reasons, we conclude that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">3. <em>The ineffective assistance claim. </em>The defendant argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>he had ineffective legal assistance because (1) defense counsel twice failed to renew a motion for disclosure of the informant, first when he learned at trial that Doe had been incarcerated on February 1, 1996,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and then again, following the production during trial of police interview reports with another man involved in the planned robbery, James Rondinelli; and (2) counsel did not renew motions for a <em>Franks </em>or <em>Amral </em>hearing after the production of the Rondinelli reports. Because we conclude that these motions would not have prevailed, no ineffective assistance of counsel resulted from the failure to file them.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We have already addressed the first point concerning disclosure of the informant. We are not persuaded that the additional information that Doe was jailed on February 1 or the information in the Rondinelli police interview reports alters the calculus against disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity as analyzed in part 2, <em>supra. </em>The defendant\u2019s \u201cadd-on points\u201d that the late disclosure solidified his set-up defense do not change the controlling legal principles. Because a motion for disclosure would not have prevailed, counsel was not ineffective in not renewing such a motion. Put another way, the defendant did not lose \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defen[s]e.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We also are not persuaded that the information concerning the date of Doe\u2019s incarceration, or an inconsistency in one of the Rondinelli reports concerning Doe\u2019s actions at the time of the delivery of the Astro \u2014 even assuming Doe was, in fact, the informant \u2014 would have been sufficient basis for a <em>Franks </em>or <em>Amral </em>hearing. Therefore, it was not ineffective assistance of counsel to have failed to renew motions for such hearings. To warrant a <em>Franks </em>hearing, \u201cthe defendant [must] make[] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit . . . .\u201d <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-156 (1978). To warrant an <em>Amral </em>hearing, the defendant must make a showing that \u201ccast[s] a reasonable doubt on the veracity of material representations made by the affiant concerning a confidential informant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amral, </em>407 Mass. 511, 522 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The defendant satisfied neither of these threshold showings. That Doe was incarcerated on February 1, 1996, is not inconsistent with the affidavit. The affidavit provides no reference as to where the informant was on February 7, 1996, when he met with Detective Tally. He could have been in jail or \u201con the street.\u201d Moreover, that Doe was incarcerated on February 1, 1996, does not render false Detective Tally\u2019s statement that the informant delivered the van to the defendant on January 31, 1996, and that his confederates planned the robbery to occur sometime thereafter. The defendant\u2019s assertion that Doe \u201cexpected to stay in jail for at least seven months\u201d not only lacks evidentiary support, but also fails to demonstrate any material misrepresentation in the affidavit. Finally, that one Rondinelli report stated that Doe left the scene after delivering the stolen Astro (making no mention of any meeting with the defendant), while in contrast, according to the search warrant affidavit, the informant described a meeting after delivery of the van wherein the defendant displayed firearms, did not cast reasonable doubt on the material representations of Detective Tally. Even assuming the accuracy of the Rondinelli description, a point we need not reach (but see <em>infra), </em>a bare contention that the <em>informant </em>was mistaken or lied does not meet the necessary threshold showing that the <em>affiant </em>lied. \u201c[A] <em>Franks </em>hearing ... is not designed to impeach the informant\u2019s veracity.\u201d <em>Amral, supra </em>at 519 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Similarly, the defendant\u2019s contention that counsel should have also requested an <em>Amral </em>hearing does not pass muster. Even if defense counsel had filed an affidavit documenting the information regarding Rondinelli\u2019s statements and Doe\u2019s incarceration, an <em>Amral </em>hearing was not warranted because such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>a showing would not have \u201ccast a reasonable doubt on the veracity of material representations made by [Detective Lally] concerning a confidential informant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522. Rondinelli, who was on the defendant\u2019s witness list, was available to testify. The defense chose not to call him. In fact, Rondinelli was called to testify in the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal case and, according to the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer, if permitted to testify, Ron-dinelli would have described among other things, the defendant\u2019s solicitations that he lie about what had transpired. However, because of the Commonwealth\u2019s violation of a sequestration order, the defense sought, and obtained, his exclusion as a witness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">4. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>Neither of the closings in this case was a model for trial practice, and several of the prosecutorial remarks that the defendant challenges on appeal were in direct counterpoint to, and responsive to, the improper argument of defense counsel. That having been said, viewing both the discrete points the defendant would highlight and the prosecutor\u2019s closing as a whole leads to the conclusion that the challenged remarks neither individually, nor cumulatively, rise to the level of creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice \u2014 the standard that applies, there having been no objection. We address the defendant\u2019s main contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The defendant asserts that the prosecutor sought to incite the jury to punish him for exercising his right to a jury trial and conveyed personal expressions concerning his guilt by the following argument: \u201cDefense counsel is right. We are advocates of justice in this system. And the Commonwealth also wants you to do justice. Don\u2019t be fooled by this man. This man is trying to pull the wool over your eyes. This is a charade. He is trying to make a mockery of this justice system.\u201d These statements are not reasonably construable as \u201cinferentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>attacking] the defendant for asserting his right to trial\u201d or \u201ccalling on the jury to punish him for exercising that right.\u201d Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 538 n.5 (1991). It was also \u201cnot improper for the prosecutor to suggest to the jury that the defendant attempted to \u2018fool\u2019 them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 388 (1992). Particularly is this so, where, as here, the prosecutor\u2019s comments about not being fooled were in direct response to defense counsel\u2019s inappropriate argument that the Commonwealth had not properly conducted the investigation and had lost photographs of the stolen van, which defense counsel in closing designated as \u201cthe most crucial piece of evidence\u201d and argued would have exonerated the defendant by showing that the damage to the ignition switch was limited and would not have been noticed by the defendant. This part of defense counsel\u2019s argument was inappropriate and unfair, in that the photographs were lost by defense counsel\u2019s office when the detective provided the originals to that office. So viewed, the prosecutor\u2019s counterpoint about an attempt at foolery was not misplaced. On a final note concerning the photographs, the Commonwealth concedes that the prosecutor\u2019s remark that \u201cthese pictures would clearly show you that the defendant had to have known that this car was stolen\u201d was erroneous. But, in this full pictorial gallery with both closings distorting the background concerning the missing photographic evidence, we do not think this remark unfairly influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. Turning to a different issue, the prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical remarks inquiring three times whether the jury was \u201coutraged\u201d were, we agree, overwrought. But here again, the remarks were directly tied to defense counsel\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s efforts to suborn perjury from Babbin were much ado about nothing. Defense counsel portrayed the solicitation to lie in reductionist terms, suggesting that \u201cBill Youngworth came to him and suggested to [Bobbin that he state] that you rent out the garages. So what?\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s retort, thus, had an etched backdrop: \u201cAnd the defense counsel says to you, so what? Are you outraged? He [the defendant] asked [Bobbin] to take the stand and he to all of you.\u201d When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>viewed in this context, this overstatement did not pose a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-16\">On the possession conviction, the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of from two to three years.

The defendant filed a pretrial motion for disclosure of the informant, which the motion judge denied. The disclosure issue is also presented in connection with the trial, in that the defendant claims that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not renewing the disclosure motion at trial. (See part 3, <em>infra.) </em>Both the United States Supreme Court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Supreme Judicial Court have \u201cdistinguished between the need for disclosure at a pretrial suppression hearing and at the trial proper,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>406 Mass. 565, 570 (1990), citing <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 60-61 (1957), and, in so doing, \u201chave maintained the distinction between a demand for disclosure at a pretrial hearing, where the issue is probable cause for arrest or a search, and a demand for disclosure at trial, where the issue is the defendant\u2019s ultimate guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 571. \u201cGenerally nondisclosure of a source of information, which . . . bears on a preliminary question, such as the suppression of evidence, is more readily tolerated than the nondisclosure at trial of a source of evidence, where guilt or innocence is directly involved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>413 Mass. 521, 532 (1992). In this case, however, the differing standards for the pretrial and trial stages merge because the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion presented the same grounds that he asserts should have compelled disclosure at trial (had his attorney renewed the disclosure motion). Given this, we have considered the issue of disclosure under the trial standard of materiality. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 570-572.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b57-9\">In determining whether an informant\u2019s identity is to be disclosed, a court engages in \u201cbalancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense.\u201d <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. at 62. Part of that balance involves weighing potential danger to the informant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>John, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 702, 706 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>365 Mass. 534, 544 (1974). In this case, the Commonwealth brought to the court\u2019s attention that the defendant\u2019s lengthy record included crimes involving violence: the prior convictions noted were for armed robbery, unlawful possession of a firearm without a license, and drug related offenses. The prosecution also cited the semiautomatic handguns that the defendant was to supply for the planned robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\">The facts in this case stand in contrast to <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. at 63 (disclosure required where informant was the sole percipient witness to, and participant with defendant in, drug transaction, and indictment did \u201cnot charge mere possession\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 500, 503 (1973) (informant arranged drug sale and was the only nongovernment witness present at sale); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Choice, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1999) (similar circumstances).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Although the indictment charged in the broad terms of G.

Supp. at 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\">At the hearing on the motion for disclosure, which was held fifteen months before trial, defense counsel named Doe as the most likely candidate as the informant and noted that Doe was about to go to jail near the date, February 7, 1996, that the search warrant was executed. Yet, the defendant claims prejudice because he says that he did not learn that Doe was jailed on February 1, 1996, until the first day of trial over a year later on September 23, 1997. Even assuming that to be so, the inaction by the defendant in not seeking to determine Doe\u2019s status in the intervening year and one quarter after the suppression hearing offers little to support the purported importance of Doe to the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Defense counsel also filed a motion to dismiss based on the sequestration violation and the delayed disclosure of the Rondinelli reports, which, the defendant contended, were exculpatory. The trial judge denied the motion. The defendant contends the judge did not make a specific ruling on the delayed disclosure part of the motion, and his counsel was ineffective in not pursuing such a ruling. It is clear from the record that defense counsel fully presented the claim of delayed disclosure, arguing the point at length. This claim of ineffective representation is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
