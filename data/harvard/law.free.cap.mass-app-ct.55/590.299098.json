The context of our decision follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">After a District Court bench trial, the defendant was convicted under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23, of operating a motor vehicle after the revocation of his license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That trial had followed the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a police stop of his vehicle. By stipulation, the only evidence before the judge at both the motion hearing and the trial were facts recorded in a police report and in several documents marked as exhibits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In distilled form, that evidence established that at about 2:48 a.m. on October 12, 1999, police Officer Maureen Glynn was driving a marked cruiser on a public way in Douglas. Traveling in front of the cruiser was a brown Ford Thunderbird. Nothing in the operation of the Thunderbird or its appearance was suspicious or unlawful. Officer Glynn contacted \u201cdispatch\u201d and asked that the registration displayed on the Thunderbird\u2019s Massachusetts number plates (\u201c3252FW\u201d) be checked \u201cthrough LEAPS.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon being advised by \u201cdispatch\u201d that the plates belonged on a blue Ford Taurus, Officer Glynn stopped the Thunderbird. She informed the defendant, who was the operator of that vehicle, that he was being stopped due to the plate discrepancy and asked him for his license and registration. The defendant responded that he did not have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>registration or license with him. He went on to identify himself by name, date of birth, and operator\u2019s license number, and explained that his son recently had acquired the Thunderbird and transferred his plates to it. Upon learning that the defendant did not have any documentation to support his explanation, Officer Glynn relayed the defendant\u2019s license information to \u201cdispatch\u201d and was informed that the defendant\u2019s license had been revoked for operating under the influence. The defendant acknowledged the revocation and was then arrested by Officer Glynn for \u201coperating with a revoked license.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The threshold issue in our review of the denial of the motion to suppress is whether Officer Glynn\u2019s use of information appearing on the number plates of the Ford Thunderbird, without benefit of a warrant, constituted a \u201csearch\u201d of the defendant in the Fourth Amendment sense of that word.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The answer to that question turns on whether the defendant sustained his burden of establishing that Officer Glynn\u2019s \u201cactivity intruded on [his] reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. 540, 544, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 832 (1990). Only if he proves that such an intrusion occurred does the burden shift to the government to show that the search was constitutionally valid. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant sustains his initial burden if he proves \u201cthat he had a subjective and objectively reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamacos, </em>409 Mass. 635, 638 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Not surprisingly, the record is silent as to whether the defendant had subjective privacy expectations with respect to the number plate. Even if we make the unlikely assumption that he harbored such thoughts, the determinative issue is whether such expectations are reasonable. That question generally is framed in terms of \u201cwhether society is prepared to recognize such an expectation as reasonable,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamacos, supra </em>at 639, and is treated on review as presenting a question of law. See <em>id. </em>at 639-640; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krisco Corp., </em>421 Mass. 37, 41-42 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Societal beliefs, reflecting our common sense, undoubtedly support the conclusion that it is unreasonable to claim privacy in that which one consciously places in public view. That conclusion is expressed in the established principle that \u201c[wjhat a person knowingly exposes to the public . . . is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967). The applicability of that principle to what is displayed on the outside of a motor vehicle is well recognized. \u201cThe exterior of a car . . .is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine it does not constitute a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Class, </em>475 U.S. 106, 114 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In pertinent part, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 6, requires that \u201c[ejvery motor vehicle or trailer . . . when operated in or on any way in this commonwealth shall have its register number displayed conspicuously thereon by the number plates furnished by the registrar [of motor vehicles] . . . .\u201d That the plate display is mandated does not affect our analysis. In analogous circumstances involving statutorily required display of a vehicle identification number or inspection sticker, our courts have held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass. 169, 173 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Navarro, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 214, 219-221 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 386, 391 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Given the defendant\u2019s explanation to the officer relating to his son\u2019s recent transfer of the number plates to the Thunderbird, he understandably does not argue that he was unaware of their display on the vehicle while he was its operator. In any event, we believe that knowledge of the fact that plates are displayed on a motor vehicle may be imputed, as matter of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>to its operator. Accordingly, we hold that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the number plate viewed by Officer Glynn and that its examination, therefore, was not a search in the constitutional sense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Similarly, because records of the Registry of Motor Vehicles are open to public inspection, see <em>Direct-Mail Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>296 Mass. 353, 355 (1937), a police-instigated search of registration data contained in those records does not implicate any privacy right. See also G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 30 &amp; 30A; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkerson, </em>436 Mass. 137, 141-142 (2002). There is no suggestion in the record that Officer Glynn\u2019s decision to check the number plate was based on the defendant\u2019s apparent race or ethnicity or was anything but random.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While random police <em>stops </em>of motor vehicles to check licenses and registrations violate the Fourth Amendment, see <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648 (1979), random computer <em>checks </em>of number plates do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The other issues raised by the defendant are without merit. Merely following and \u201cobserving\u201d a vehicle does not constitute pursuit and, therefore, does not implicate constitutional protections. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 116-117 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 790 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 138 (2001). Once Officer Glynn learned of the number plate discrepancy, she had an objective basis for suspecting that the Ford Thunderbird was stolen and she, therefore, was justified in stopping the vehicle and asking the defendant to produce his license and the vehicle\u2019s registration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 244 &amp; n.15 (1983); G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25. The defendant\u2019s inability to supply those documents or to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>any documentary support for his explanation of recent plate transfer justified the officer\u2019s further request for information. The response from \u201cdispatch\u201d that the defendant\u2019s license was revoked provided probable cause to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 6, first sentence, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 700, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The defendant\u2019s sixty-day house of correction sentence was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The documents, other than the police report, generally relate to the other charges against the defendant, see note 5, <em>infra, </em>which are not at issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">There is nothing in the record with respect to the identity and function of LEAPS. The Commonwealth\u2019s brief states that \u201c[t]he Law Enforcement Agencies Processing System (LEAPS), also known as the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS), is a computer-based data storage and communications system maintained by the Criminal History Systems Board and used by police and other criminal justice personnel to access law enforcement data from the Registry of Motor Vehicles and the FBI\u2019s National Criminal Information Center (NCIC).\u201d The defendant made no argument below as to the reliability of that system or the validity of its use by police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tremblay, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 456 (2000), in which this court describes a call made by a State trooper \u201cthrough a police dispatcher to the Registry of Motor Vehicles and the \u2018NCIC/LEAPS\u2019 computer system (with a database of VIN numbers of cars reported stolen).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The defendant later was also charged with operating an unregistered motor vehicle (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9), and attaching a license plate assigned to another vehicle (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23). He was found not responsible with respect to the \u00a7 9 charge, and the \u00a7 23 charge was dismissed by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was expressly grounded on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. His passing reference to art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, made for the first time in his brief in this appeal and without claim that it provides greater protection than the Fourth Amendment, is not sufficient to compel an art. 14 analysis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. 540, 542, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 832 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 543 n.3 (1991). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>422 Mass. 504, 506 n.1, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 877 (1996). In any event, although art. 14 has been interpreted as according greater protection to the occupants of vehicles than the Fourth Amendment, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662-663 (1999), we discern no basis in the circumstances for concluding that art. 14 provides extended protection with respect to what is displayed on the exterior of vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Several jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion with respect to displayed number plates. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walraven, </em>892 F.2d 972, 973-976 (10th Cir. 1989); <em>Olabisiomotosho </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>185 F.3d 521, 529 (5th Cir. 1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>137 Ariz. 278, 287 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Richter, </em>145 N.H. 640, 640-641 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Myrick, </em>282 NJ.
