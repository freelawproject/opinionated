L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a), and violation of \u00a7 32A within 1000 feet of a school, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. In an effort to bolster his claim that his pretrial motion to dismiss the school zone charge had been erroneously denied, the defendant filed a postconviction motion to correct the record, seeking to have the trial judge rule (a) that the docket entry indicating that an application for a complaint had been filed was erroneous; and (b) that there was no record that he had been given a bail hearing or probable cause hearing of the kind, or within the time, required by <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>416 Mass. 221 (1993), and Trial Court Rule XI, Uniform Rule for Probable Cause Determinations for Persons Arrested Without a Warrant (1994) (Uniform Rule XI).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The defendant challenges the denial of his motion to correct the record, the denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss, and the admission in evidence of an opinion of a police officer that the drugs found were \u201cintended for . . . distribution.\u201d We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and the denial of his postconviction motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">1. <em>Postconviction motion to correct the record.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant\u2019s two claims involving the record were first raised in the postconviction motion. Those claims are (1) that despite a docket entry to the contrary, there was no \u201capplication\u201d for a complaint; and (2) that the defendant had no bail or probable cause hearing until February 16, although he was arrested on February 12. Because Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(c), 378 Mass. 871 (1979), requiring that such motions be brought before trial, was not complied with, these arguments are waived. In any event, the denial did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">While the defendant urges that Dist./Mun.Cts.R.Crim.P. 2(a) (1996), set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was not followed, the record does not support his claim. The rule requires that prior to the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>suance of a criminal complaint begun by warrantless arrest, the clerk-magistrate must obtain from the police department a \u201cwritten statement describing the facts constituting the basis for the arrest.\u201d Here, the judge considered that the State police report, together with the booking sheet of the Brockton police department showing the defendant\u2019s arrest on the two charges, in effect had satisfied the rule. The State police report set forth in some detail that the defendant had been the target of a month-long narcotics investigation and that a search warrant had been obtained to search his car and his apartment. After drugs were found in both places, the report states, the defendant was taken to the Brockton police department, where he was booked and advised of his rights. In view of the report and the booking sheet, the rule requiring a written statement constituting the basis for the arrest was satisfied whether or not a formal \u201capplication\u201d was on file. The judge did not err in refusing to change the docket entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">There was also no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in not changing the docket, which, by omission of any entry, already reflected the absence of a bail hearing or a showing of probable cause to arrest prior to February 16. Rather than a docketing mistake, the problem was the failure to have a prompt judicial determination of probable cause or to admit the defendant to bail within the requisite time period. See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>416 Mass. at 238-241; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viverito, </em>422 Mass. 228, 230-231 (1996); Uniform Rule XI.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">That the defendant showed a <em>Jenkins </em>violation would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>have been enough to require dismissal even if the claim had been timely made. He must demonstrate prejudice in \u201cthe subsequent trial and the interference with procedural rights therein.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viverito, supra </em>at 231. As the defendant did not raise this issue prior to trial when an eviden-tiary hearing could have been held, the judge correctly considered the claim to be untimely and to require no action. The defendant\u2019s assertion that he was prejudiced because the police did not measure the distance from the school to his home until much later, and that he would have been able to show that there was not probable cause for the school zone violation, is without merit. Not only would the police in all likelihood have taken the necessary measurements of the distance between the defendant\u2019s apartment and the school prior to any hearing, but the purported prejudice had \u201clittle to do with the evidence to be adduced at trial.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"akx-dedup-0\"><em>2. Pretrial motion to dismiss. </em>The defendant correctly claims that at the time of the issuance of the complaint, the clerk-magistrate was not presented with facts showing probable cause for the school zone violation. The police report made no mention of the fact that the defendant\u2019s apartment was within 1,000 feet of a school. However, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, neither Dist.ZMun.Cts.R.Crim.P. 2(a), nor Standard 2:04 of the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975) (standards), requires, in cases commenced by warrantless arrest, that probable cause for each of the charges be shown prior to the issuance of a criminal complaint. That showing is to be made at the probable cause determination, see Uniform Rule XI(d), not at the time of the issuance of the complaint. Although rule 2(a), see note 3, <em>supra, </em>requires police to show the <em>basis for the arrest, </em>there is nothing in the rule that requires, as does Dist./Mun.Cts.R.Crim.P. 2(b) (1996), applicable to cases not commenced by warrantless arrest, that \u201ceach police and civilian complainant shall, on the Application for Criminal Complaint, provide the information to support the <em>issuance of the </em>complaint\u201d (emphasis supplied). See Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 66.5, at 625 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The standards set forth an even starker distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the duties of a clerk-magistrate after an arrest and the duties in cases not involving an arrest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As to the former, the commentary to Standard 2:04 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">\u201cIn the case of a person under arrest, it is not the Clerk\u2019s function to review whether there was in fact probable cause for the arrest, nor to judge whether the Commonwealth ultimately will fail in its prosecution of the case. Only the judge can review these matters when the accused is brought before [the judge]. The Clerk\u2019s function in arrest cases is largely administrative; it is designed primarily to insure prompt preparation of the Complaint for use in the courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Commentary to Standard 2:04 of the District Court Standards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975). In cases not involving an arrest, on the other hand, the commentary to Standard 3:00 states that the magistrate\u2019s role is \u201cto determine whether probable cause exists for issuing process requiring the accused to appear to answer a criminal charge.\u201d Commentary to Standard 3:00 of the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiBennadetto, </em>436 Mass. 310, 314 (2002), citing commentary 1 to Standard 3:17 of the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">While Dist./Mun.Cts.R.Crim.P. 2(a) requires a written statement describing the facts constituting the basis for the arrest, and the standards seem to require only oral testimony, see Standards 2:03 and 2:04 of the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975), nothing in the rule<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> suggests that the long-standing distinction in the function of the magistrate in arrest and nonarrest cases has changed so as to require him or her to find probable cause to arrest in arrest cases. In any event, the clerk-magistrate was here provided with a description of facts showing probable cause to arrest for the primary narcotics violation. More was not required. There was no error in denying the motion to dismiss. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, no showing of probable cause of the school zone violation was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">3. <em>Opinion evidence. </em>The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the trial judge erroneously permitted a State police trooper to testify that the drugs the search uncovered were \u201cintended for. . . distribution.\u201d The testimony should not have taken this conclusive form and should have been limited to an explanation of the methods and practices of distribution, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 581 (1998), or, at most, the officer should have been permitted to testify that the drugs as they were packaged and located were consistent with distribution. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, ante </em>741, 745-746 (2002). Here, however, because there was no objection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>the testimony, and because the officer carefully explained that distribution could be inferred from the method of packaging and the location of the drugs, testimony generally admissible, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labitue, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 914 (2000), the conclusion was not significantly more prejudicial than the explanation and did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion to correct record affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The defendant was arrested on February 12, 1999.

This requirement may be satisfied by providing to the clerk-magistrate a copy of the arresting officer\u2019s police report at the time the Application for Complaint is filed or by setting forth the statement in the space provided on the Application for Complaint, with an additional sheet or sheets attached to the Application as may be needed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-24\">In his motion to correct the record, the defendant stated that he was informed by an assistant clerk that it is the policy of the Brockton District Court clerk-magistrates not to hold a probable cause hearing if a defendant has been arrested pursuant to a search warrant. If that is the practice, it would seem to be counter to Uniform Rule XI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">In the case of an arrested person the application is termed \u201capplication for complaint.\u201d In the case where the person has not been arrested, the application is called an \u201capplication for issuance of process.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Standard 2:00 of the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\u201cPurpose of the Complaint Procedure in Arrest Cases.

An Application for Issuance of Process may be presented by lay persons or police officers, and requests the authority of the court to make an arrest or order a summons to issue. It requires the magistrate to exercise a good deal of discretion in deciding whether to authorize the commencement of a criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\">\u201cThe Application for Complaint, on the other hand, does not call on the magistrate to exercise substantial discretion. It does not call on the court to issue process, the arrest already being an accomplished fact. Nor does it require the Clerk or Assistant Clerk to approve the validity of the arrest or assess the potential strength of the prosecution. The purpose of the Application is simply to capture case information necessary to prepare the documents needed to proceed in the courtroom. It is merely an aid to the court in facilitating the preparation of the Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">\u201cThe Complaint procedure in arrest cases does not include the probable cause determination discussed by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>[420 U.S. 103, 113-114] (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The rule, which was promulgated subsequent to the standards, uses the term \u201ccomplaint\u201d in both warrantless arrest cases and in cases not involving an arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
