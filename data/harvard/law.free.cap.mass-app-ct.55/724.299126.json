We vacate the judgment below that the husband was not in contempt of the modified decree and remand to the trial court for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-26\"><em>Background. </em>The parties, Kathie Stabile and Gerald Stabile, Jr., were divorced on December 10, 1993. At a later point, they agreed to a modification of the divorce decree by the addition of terms contained in a stipulation signed by them and their attorneys. On December 18, 1996, the Probate and Family Court entered a modified judgment of divorce that incorporated by reference the signed stipulation, which read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\u201cBeginning in 1997, the Defendant [Gerald] <em>will use his best efforts to[</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>maintain a college and/or trust fund for each of the parties\u2019 minor children, and shall contribute $10,000.00 annually to each fund by December 31st of that year\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On July 27, 1998, Kathie filed a contempt complaint alleging, among other things, that Gerald had failed to maintain a fund for the future education of either minor child as called for by this provision. At the contempt hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kathie asserted that Gerald\u2019s income had more than doubled since the modified order entered, but that he had nonetheless failed to set up any of fund for their children\u2019s higher education. Gerald responded that he had hoped to exercise certain stock options, which ultimately failed to materialize, to establish those funds. He acknowledged that he had not yet established a college fund for either child.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The judge concluded that Gerald was not in contempt, stating that the terms of the stipulation relating to the maintenance of college funds were not \u201cclear and unequivocal as to the duties and obligations of the defendant.\u201d Consequently, Kathie \u201cdid not meet her burden of proving a clear and undoubted violation of a clear and unequivocal order of\u201d the court. The court subsequently denied Kathie\u2019s motion for reconsideration and clarification, in which she asked the court to specify how the contested provision was not \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>Kathie asserts on appeal that the provision requiring Gerald to maintain college funds for each of their minor children was neither unclear nor equivocal. Moreover, she contends that Gerald made no effort whatsoever to comply with its terms despite his obligation to do so. Gerald, on the other hand, claims that his obligations are unclear, and the order ambiguous, due to the substitution of the phrase \u201cwill use his best efforts to\u201d for the word \u201cshall\u201d with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>maintenance of college funds. Specifically, he claims that an inconsistency exists between the requirement that he <em>shall </em>pay $10,000 annually into each fund and the provision that he use his \u201cbest efforts\u201d to maintain the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We discern no ambiguity or inconsistency here. Looting no further than the express language of the parties\u2019 stipulation adopted by the court, we conclude that the command of the modified divorce decree was sufficiently clear and unequivocal to support a claim for contempt against Gerald. The modified order requires Gerald not only to use his best efforts to maintain college funds for each of the parties\u2019 minor children, but also to contribute $10,000 annually to each child\u2019s fund. In order to discharge those responsibilities, he is necessarily under an obligation first to establish college funds for each child.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">For civil contempt to be found, \u201cthere must be a clear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.\u201d <em>Sax </em>v. <em>Sax, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 765, 771 (2002), quoting from <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 36 (1972). The command must be clear and unequivocal to the extent that it can be understood by the person subject to it \u201cwithout resort to the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Inspector of Bldgs, of Provincetown </em>v. <em>Eder, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1011, 1011 (1981). An ambiguity does not arise merely because an order, otherwise clear, may require \u201csome legal interpretation.\u201d <em>Sax </em>v. <em>Sax, supra </em>at 772, quoting from <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 567 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Indefinite and uncertain language cannot support a complaint for contempt because of a lack of fair notice to the person subject to the order, and because \u201cambiguity carries with it the potential for becoming \u2018an instrument of [judicial] severity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sax </em>v. <em>Sax, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>374 Mass. 79, 89 (1977). Consequently, we ordinarily resolve ambiguities in divorce decrees in favor of the person charged with contempt. <em>Sax </em>v. <em>Sax, supra, </em>citing <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>368 Mass. 144, 147 (1975), and <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Provincetown </em>v. <em>Eder, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">While vague or ambiguous language in a judicial decree cannot constitute a \u201cclear and unequivocal command,\u201d <em>Sax </em>v. <em>Sax, supra </em>at 771, a party\u2019s self-serving characterization of a provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>sion as \u201cambiguous\u201d does not make it so. \u201c[A]n ambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other.\u201d <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 462, 466 (1995). See <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 266, 269 (1996) (party\u2019s interpretation of insurance policy language \u201cappear[ed] to represent a strained attempt to create ambiguity where none exists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Axa\">Gerald claims that an ambiguity was injected into the stipulation by the replacement of the original typed word \u201cshall\u201d (maintain a college and/or trust fund) with the handwritten phrase \u201cwill use his best efforts to\u201d (maintain a college and/or trust fund). He asserts that the removal of the command, \u201cshall,\u201d and the insertion of the more permissive words, \u201cwill use his best efforts to,\u201d render his duties under the order unclear and, at best, discretionary rather than mandatory. Consequently, he argues, the order does not require that he establish such funds, but merely that he use his \u201cbest efforts\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"aim-dedup-0\">Even if the order were to require only that Gerald use his \u201cbest efforts\u201d both to establish and maintain college funds, there is no resulting ambiguity regarding his duties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As this court has stated, we \u201cassume a construction of \u2018best efforts\u2019 in the natural sense of the words as requiring that the party put its muscles to work to perform with full energy and fairness the relevant express promises and reasonable implications therefrom.\u201d <em>Macksey </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 463, 472 (1994). See <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Dukakis, </em>675 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1982) (upholding provision in consent decree requiring state officials to \u201cuse their best efforts to insure. . . full and timely financing\u201d before making cuts in services subject to that decree); <em>Triple-A Baseball Club Assocs. </em>v. <em>Northeastern Baseball, Inc., </em>832 F.2d 214, 225-226, 228 (1st Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>U.S. 935 (1988) (\u201cbest efforts\u201d is the equivalent of acting in good faith, although it does not mean every conceivable effort).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The term \u201cbest efforts\u201d thus helps to delineate, rather than to obscure, Gerald\u2019s responsibilities under the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Gerald also claims to espy an ambiguity when the requirement that he use his \u201cbest efforts\u201d to maintain college funds is juxtaposed with the provision that he <em>\u201cshall </em>contribute $10,000.00 annually to each fund\u201d (emphasis supplied). Yet there is an inconsistency between these provisions only if they are read as suggested by Gerald: that he must contribute $10,000 annually to a fund that he may choose not to establish. The command that Gerald contribute $10,000 annually presupposes, at a minimum, the existence of the college funds. As we have noted, the specification in the order that he use his \u201cbest efforts\u201d to maintain such funds does not relieve him of his duty to provide college funds for the minor children. Rather, the phrase clearly and unequivocally indicates the measure of exertion that he is to apply to the task at hand. The provision that he use his \u201cbest efforts\u201d comprehends the establishment of such funds. Rather than give rise to an ambiguity, the requirement that he deposit $10,000 annually into each account further confirms that he is to establish such funds in the exercise of his \u201cbest efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We conclude that the terms to which Kathie and Gerald stipulated in 1996 were clear and unambiguous when they agreed to them, and that they are no less so now. The modified order clearly and unequivocally requires Gerald to establish a \u201ccollege and/or trust fund\u201d for each of his minor children and to contribute $10,000 to each fund annually while maintaining each account with <em>the </em>use of his \u201cbest efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that Kathie satisfied her burden of proof that the provision in issue was \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d and we vacate the judgment below. We also remand the matter for a determination whether or not there was a \u201cclear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>undoubted disobedience\u201d of the modified decree and of what relief, if any, shall be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\">The term \u201cshall\u201d was crossed out and the words \u201cwill use his best efforts to\u201d were handwritten into the otherwise typed \u201cStipulation of the Parties for Judgment.\u201d It is uncontroverted that the substitution was done at Gerald\u2019s request.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-11\">The parties agreed to forgo an evidentiary hearing and proceeded, instead, on representations of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A5M\">At the time of the filing of the complaint for contempt, the modified judgment had been in effect for over a year and one-half. If Gerald was uncertain about his obligations under the agreement, the proper remedy would have been to bring an action requesting clarification. See <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Mental Retardation (No. 1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 451 (1997), citing <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>374 Mass. 79, 91 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">In any event, the provision that Gerald use his \u201cbest efforts\u201d relative to maintaining college funds for his children suggests that, at a minimum, he will exert more than \u201cno effort.\u201d As we state below, we leave it to the trial judge to determine whether Gerald\u2019s failure to establish college funds constituted his \u201cbest efforts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
