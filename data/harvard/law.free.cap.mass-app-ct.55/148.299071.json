While being booked, the defendant recognized Williamson from the neighborhood in which they both lived. He told Williamson that he did not know it was him, and asked him to \u201csquash this.\u201d When Williamson responded with disbelief, the defendant informed Williamson that he knew what kind of car the officer drove and where he lived, and that he intended to \u201cget\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Following a jury trial in Superior Court in June, 1998, the defendant was convicted of breaking and entering a motor vehicle at night with intent to commit a felony, intimidation of a witness, unlawful possession of a firearm, and unlawful possession of ammunition. The defendant was acquitted of armed assault with intent to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erred when she (1) denied his motion to suppress the statements he made to Williamson during the booking; (2) refused to conduct individual voir dire of two jurors who were related to police and law enforcement officials; (3) instructed the jury that they could convict him on implied as well as express threats; and (4) refused to allow him to cross-examine a police officer witness regarding police culture. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the statements he made to Williamson while being booked. We summarize the facts found by the judge in her ruling on the defendant\u2019s suppression motion supplemented by uncontroverted facts adduced at the hearing that are referenced in note 1, <em>infra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 670 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">During the booking process, before he received Miranda warnings, the defendant responded to the booking officer\u2019s questions until Williamson entered the booking area. Upon seeing Williamson, the defendant said, \u201cYo, Carlton. I didn\u2019t know it was you. Let\u2019s squash this.\u201d Williamson responded, \u201cYou just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>shot at me.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant then became angry and said, \u201cI know where you live. You drive a Berna [i.e., a BMW automobile]. We\u2019re going to take care of you. I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfirst statement was spontaneous and unprovoked,\u201d and that the latter statements were also volunteered. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><em>Miranda </em>does not protect volunteered statements. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478 (1966) (\u201cVolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>422 Mass. 269, 271 (1996). The defendant\u2019s first statement \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was you\u201d \u2014 was voluntary and unprovoked. Williamson\u2019s response to the defendant was not an improper interrogation, as the defendant asserts, but rather a natural reflex invited by the defendant\u2019s comments. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>422 Mass. at 271 (detective\u2019s response to volunteered comment a natural reflex action). Similarly, the defendant\u2019s subsequent comments, although incriminatory, were volunteered, and were not the product of any improper probing. <em>Ibid. </em>By threatening Williamson, the defendant did not respond to any question, but simply pursued his initial request to \u201csquash this\u201d using a different, more aggressive, tactic. The defendant\u2019s statements were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">2. <em>Voir dire on jurors\u2019 relationship to law enforcement or police officers. </em>Relying on G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant argues that the judge should have conducted individual voir dire of two jurors, both of whom indicated a relationship with law enforcement officials on their juror questionnaires. During im-panelment, in addition to the questions required by statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>judge asked all prospective jurors whether they could be fair and impartial and informed the panel that the case dealt with assault with intent to murder a police officer. The judge also asked the potential jurors whether they \u201cwould weigh the testimony of a police officer differently from that of a civilian simply because the person was a police officer?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither of the two prospective jurors who were related to law enforcement officials raised issues in response to these questions. When the defendant requested additional questioning of these two jurors, the judge refused, stating that although one juror\u2019s brother was an assistant district attorney and the second juror\u2019s sister was a State police trooper, she would not \u201cfurther inquire simply because of their relationship to someone who is in law enforcement.\u201d The defendant used all of his peremptory challenges prior to the conclusion of the impanelment process, including two challenges to remove the two jurors in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u201cUnder G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, the judge must examine the jurors individually when it appears that issues extraneous to the case might affect the jury\u2019s impartiality. . . . Ordinarily, it is for the judge to determine whether the jury might be influenced by an extraneous issue, and we will not disturb that determination \u2018unless the complaining party demonstrates that there was a substantial risk that the case would be decided in whole or in part on the basis of extraneous issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>La-Faille, </em>430 Mass. 44, 50-51 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grice, </em>410 Mass. 586, 588 (1991). Here, the defendant recognizes that \u201cthere was no extraneous influence that required individual voir dire of the entire venire.\u201d He argues, however, that there was a substantial risk of extraneous influence regarding jurors with family ties to law enforcement officials because they \u201ccould have viewed Officer Williamson as a surrogate for their siblings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We have been presented with no Massachusetts appellate court decisions in which a potential juror\u2019s family tie to law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>enforcement has been deemed by itself to be an extraneous influence. Nor have we identified a case in which a substantial risk of extraneous influence has been found to arise from a judge\u2019s failure to conduct additional questioning of a juror with such a relationship. Rather, potential jurors\u2019 family ties to public safety officials have generated recommended, but not required, practices. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 680, 684 (1987) (\u201cthe judge would have been prudent to have inquired more closely of all jurors who acknowledged having relatives engaged in law enforcement\u201d). This approach reflects respect for the trial judge\u2019s discretion and responsibilities in juror selection while recognizing the value of, and encouraging, questioning sensitive to the possibility that bias may arise out of the family relationship. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We likewise conclude in the instant case that the defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a substantial risk of extraneous influence, and that the judge did not abuse her discretion where (1) she asked the potential jurors collectively whether they would treat the testimony of police officers differently from that of a civilian; (2) the two potential jurors at issue did not indicate that they would treat police officer testimony differently in response to collective questioning; and (3) the defendant has offered nothing more than the fact of the family relationships and speculation about the bias they may have engendered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We observe, however, that the judge would have been \u201cprudent\u201d to have conducted the follow-up questioning requested in this case, which involved shots being fired at a police officer who would be a key witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 684. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 364 (1991) (\u201cappellate decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>have consistently encouraged trial judges to respond generously to motions that they question jurors individually about possible prejudice\u201d). This follow-up could have been done efficiently at sidebar.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It could also have provided the judge with more information to guide the exercise of her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">3. <em>Broadening the indictment for intimidation of a witness. </em>The defendant argues that he may have been convicted of a crime for which he was not indicted in violation of art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. The defendant was indicted under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, in May, 1996, for willfully endeavoring \u201cby intimidation, force and threats of force\u201d to interfere with a witness, Williamson. In September, 1996, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, was amended. Among other things, the amendment inserted the phrase \u201cexpress or implied\u201d before the word \u201cthreats.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> St. 1996, c. 393, \u00a7 2. The defendant argues that the judge added an additional theory of criminal liability when she charged the jury that the offense required interference through \u201cexpress or implied threats of force.\u201d The defendant asserts, as he did at trial, that the judge should have strictly followed the language of the indictment and charged the jury that the second element of the offense was \u201cthreats of force,\u201d which, he claims, only applies to express threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We conclude that the judge\u2019s charge did not introduce a new theory of criminal liability to the jury. The word \u201cthreat,\u201d without modification, has been held to encompass implied as well as express threats in interpretations of other statutes containing the word. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 725 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 980 (2001) (jury permitted to conclude that fathers\u2019 rights advocate \u201cthreatened to commit a crime\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, when he said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cWatch out, Counselor\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strahan, 39 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929-930 (1995) (evidence sufficient to prove threatening to commit a crime when defendant, a well-known crusader for whales, said he was \u201cassessing the enemy\u201d and \u201cjust looking for a place to put a hole in the boat\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliffe, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 583 (1999) (defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cDrop the charges,\u201d in conjunction with his accompanying actions and demeanor, sufficient to constitute threat of harm). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 696 (1982) (court interpreting the criminal statute dealing with rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, construes the phrase \u201cthreat of bodily injury\u201d to include threats that are either \u201cinferred or expressed\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 727 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The word \u201cthreat\u201d has been defined in a variety of similar ways throughout case law. See <em>Planned Parenthood League </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994) (threat \u201cinvolves the intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm\u201d); <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wareham, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 409 (1989) (\u201cacts or language by which another is placed in fear of injury or damage\u201d). See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1489 (7th ed. 1999) (defining threat as \u201ca communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another or on another person\u2019s property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In analyzing whether a threat is made, we do not parse the words alone, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. at 725, nor do we draw distinctions between express and implied threats. Rather, we \u201cconsider the context in which the allegedly threatening statement was made and all of the surrounding circumstances\u201d to determine whether the statement was a threat. <em>Ibid. </em>Demeanor and tone play a part, as does the personal history of the speaker, the relationship of the parties, and the timing, subject matter, location, and other conditions of the exchange. We conclude that the statutory change was merely a clarification, reflecting the court\u2019s analysis of threats as contextual and not just a parsing of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In any event, there is no question that the threat was express in the instant case. At trial Williamson testified, and the jury could have found, that the defendant said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>care of this. I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is an express threat. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>412 Mass. 318, 320 n.1 (1992) (where evidence of threats included phrase, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you\u201d). Indeed, the defendant\u2019s further statements to Williamson to the effect that he knew where the officer lived and the kind of car he drove by themselves left no doubt that the defendant\u2019s purpose was to place Williamson in fear of injury or damage if he did not \u201csquash\u201d the charges. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. at 725-726; <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wareham, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 409. The judge\u2019s jury charge did not broaden the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">4. <em>Failure to allow cross-examination on police culture. </em>The defendant argues that his constitutional rights to cross-examine a witness were violated when the judge refused to allow him to question a Boston police officer regarding the \u201cfraternity, codes, and culture of the Boston police.\u201d During the trial, at sidebar, the defense attorney expressed his belief that Boston police officers operated under a \u201ccode of silence,\u201d which required that they unquestioningly support each other\u2019s testimony. He stated that he found Officer James Naughton\u2019s excellent memory incredible given how long ago the incidents had occurred and his recent review of Williamson\u2019s report of the incident. He sought to ask Naughton questions regarding police culture.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The judge declined the request, noting that defense counsel should ask Naughton for an explanation of his ability to remember with such detail before pursuing a \u201ccode of silence\u201d line of questioning. If the witness could not furnish an explanation, the judge said, she might allow defense counsel to inquire further into the basis for the officer\u2019s memory. When further so questioned, Naughton indicated that it was because of the \u201ctype of situation\u201d it was and that there were many police officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>present at the scene. After this explanation, the judge denied defense counsel\u2019s request to pursue his line of questioning regarding police culture.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The defendant correctly asserts that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to cross-examine a witness to show bias. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316-317 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>431 Mass. 535, 538 (2000). However, a judge also has broad discretion to control the scope and extent of cross-examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, </em>419 Mass. 392, 400, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 861 (1995). A defendant must make a \u201cplausible showing\u201d to support his claim of bias. <em>Id. </em>at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In the present case, the defendant did not make a plausible showing that the witness\u2019s testimony was influenced by a police \u201ccode of silence.\u201d Other than the defendant\u2019s own speculation, there was no support for the inquiry. Furthermore, the judge did not, as the defendant asserts, \u201cbar all inquiry\u201d into the area of possible bias, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tam Bui, </em>419 Mass. at 400, but remained open to the line of questioning until the witness offered a reason for his detailed memory. Considering that a police officer would likely remember a call regarding shots being fired at a fellow officer and that defense counsel presented no basis for his inquiry into police culture, the judge did not abuse her discretion by excluding such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The judge found that Williamson said, \u201cYou just shot at me.\u201d Williamson testified that he said, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. How can we squash this? You guys just shot at me.\u201d Williamson\u2019s testimony contains a rhetorical question. The judge\u2019s recounting of the officer\u2019s statement and the officer\u2019s own recounting of it express the same sentiment; neither could be construed as an interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">As provided in G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, \u201cUpon motion of either party, the court shall . . . examine on oath a person who is called as a juror ... to leam whether he is related to either party or has any interest in the case, . . . or is sensible of any bias or prejudice, therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The judge was not required to ask this question. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 291 (1984). However, \u201cordinarily a trial judge should comply with a defendant\u2019s request to ask prospective jurors whether they would give greater credence to police officers than to other witnesses, in a case involving police officer testimony.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szczuka, </em>391 Mass. 666, 672 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We further note that the two potential jurors at issue were ultimately not seated as jurors. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 684 (potential juror in question ultimately seated and \u201cparticipated in final deliberations\u201d). The other potential jurors who raised their hands in response to the judge\u2019s collective questioning regarding whether they would treat the testimony of police officers differently from that of a civilian were also not seated as jurors. Finally, the jury acquitted the defendant of the most serious crime, involving an armed assault with intent to murder, with the intended victim being the police officer. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>429 Mass. 609, 616 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munafo, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 597, 603 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Needless to say such questioning is best done in a manner that avoids the airing of personal views within earshot of the entire jury pool. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass. 340, 353-354 n.12 (1980) (\u201cCollective questioning on sensitive issues may not elicit a response from some jurors who would respond in private\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaFaille, </em>430 Mass. at 57-58 (Ireland, J., concurring) (observing that individual voir dire elicits biases jurors might not reveal when questioned in a group).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Two other unrelated changes were made to G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, in 1996. See St. 1996, c. 393, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Officer Norita Landrum, the booking officer, testified at trial that the defendant said, \u201cI\u2019ll get him.\u201d Officer Eric Bradshaw testified that the defendant made references to the car Williamson drove and the house Williamson lived in. Any possible doubts are eliminated by the context in which the remarks were made. At trial, Williamson testified that the defendant had just been arrested and been part of a chase leading to shots being fired at Williamson. He further testified that the defendant had become increasingly agitated during the exchange at the police station.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
