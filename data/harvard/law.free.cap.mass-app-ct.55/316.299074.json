Civ.P. 49(a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974) (any omitted issue, based on the pleadings or the evidence, is \u201cdeemed to have [been answered] in accord with the judgment upon the special verdict\u201d). Judgment was thereupon entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The central issue at trial of this action was whether the plaintiff met his burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s negligence in the prior action was a substantial factor in producing plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Upon review of the proceedings below, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s answers to the special questions, and that there is no merit to the plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments regarding the conduct of the trial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment. However, we vacate the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendants\u2019 posttrial motion for costs under Mass.R.Civ.P. 68, 365 Mass. 835 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">1. <em>Summary of facts and proceedings in the prior action. </em>Our discussion of the issues on appeal requires a summary of the evidence from which the jury could have found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>defendants\u2019 failed representation was not a substantial factor in producing a loss or injury to the plaintiff in the prior action. In a legal malpractice case, \u201c[t]he client need not show a perfect claim. But the client must show at least that he has lost a probability of success as a result of the attorney\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Colucci </em>v. <em>Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, P.C., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 107, 113 (1987). See <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 647 (1986) (\u201c[a] plaintiff who claims that his attorney was negligent in the prosecution of a tort claim will prevail if he proves that he probably would have obtained a better result had the attorney exercised adequate skill and care\u201d). The failure to make such a showing in the second part of the trial requires judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The plaintiff, who had received a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was an adjunct professor of engineering at Boston University, engaged Sachs \u2014 then employed by Shearson \u2014 as his broker in July, 1979. After some discussion, Sachs recommended a program of \u201ccovered call\u201d options.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In December, 1979, Sachs left Shearson for Bache, and the plaintiff moved his account to Bache to continue dealing with Sachs. The plaintiff continued trading in options until May, 1981, when he closed his account with Bache and opened a new account with Merrill Lynch, where his trading practices continued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In November, 1981, after suffering substantial trading losses, the plaintiff engaged the defendants to prosecute his underlying claims against Bache and Sachs. The defendant, Philip J. Crowe, Jr., was the attorney in charge of the case. The prior action was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and discovery proceeded between 1982 and 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The Federal judge in the prior action held a final pretrial conference on June 30, 1986, during which he recommended a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>settlement figure of $100,000. The docket entry for July 7, 1986, states that Bache\u2019s counsel notified the court that the settlement proposed by the judge was acceptable to Bache.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The last docket entry in the prior action is dated September 11, 1986. The entry states, \u201cCall made to Mr. Crowe re: settlement. Mr. Crowe to confer [with] plaintiff and report back.\u201d There were no further docket entries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, the plaintiff had rejected the settlement proposal, and an attorney in the defendants\u2019 office testified that she notified the Federal judge\u2019s docket clerk that the case \u201cwasn\u2019t going to settle.\u201d On the facing page of the docket sheet, the following handwritten notation appears: \u201cClosed 6-30-86.\u201d Notice of this notation was not given to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">On November 13, 1991, Bache filed a motion for summary judgment. Counsel for Bache had already notified Crowe by letter that the District Court docket sheet \u201cindicates that the case was \u2018closed\u2019 on June 30, 1986.\u201d Crowe filed an opposition to the motion, but all the papers regarding the motion were erroneously filed by the Federal judge\u2019s clerk, and the motion was never heard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Crowe admitted that neither he nor any attorney in his firm did anything to determine the status of the case between 1986 (at the final pretrial conference with the Federal judge) and 1991 (when Crowe filed an opposition to Bache\u2019s motion for summary judgment). Crowe eventually withdrew his appearance on December 7, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Seven years after the case was closed, i.e., on November 22, 1993, the Federal judge\u2019s court room deputy clerk notified plaintiff\u2019s counsel (successor to the defendant, Crowe) of the following, in response to counsel\u2019s inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201c[I]t appears that the captioned action was dismissed as having been reported settled by counsel for the parties. Inasmuch as there has been no recorded action in this mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ter since 1986, the court had assumed that the settlement had been consummated by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201cThe court also has no record of ever receiving a motion for summary judgment or an opposition thereto ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cIf you intend to pursue this action, I would suggest that you file a motion to reinstate it to the active docket list, with a report to the court as to what happended <em>[sic] </em>to the settlement negotiations as reported to the court in 1986.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">There does not appear to be any basis for the deputy clerk\u2019s statement that the case had been reported settled by the parties, and therefore there does not appear to be any basis for the judge\u2019s assumption that the settlement had been consummated \u2014 if that, in fact, is what the judge had assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">On January 12, 1994, successor counsel for the plaintiff, who had been engaged in November of 1992, filed a motion through local counsel to reopen the case. Counsel met with the Federal judge and described the circumstances as counsel understood them. The judge denied the motion to reopen the case and refused to consider Bache\u2019s cross motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution, which was then before the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The plaintiff appealed the denial of his motion to reopen his case. There followed the mandatory appellate settlement process in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The plaintiff agreed to settle his claim against Bache and Sachs in consideration of the sum of $50,000, the appeal was dismissed, and the prior action ended. This legal malpractice case ensued whereby the plaintiff now seeks to recover the balance of his alleged losses from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s underlying claims were never brought to trial in the prior action. There does not appear to have been any order of dismissal under rule 41.1 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (1990) (dismissal for want of prosecution). In addition, there was no final judgment entered under rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">2. <em>Discussion of the merits of this case. </em>The negligence of the defendants in failing to obtain a trial of the plaintiff\u2019s case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>not disputed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As noted above, the central issue on appeal is whether the plaintiff met his burden of proof that there was a causal connection between the defendants\u2019 negligence and the harm allegedly suffered by the plaintiff. <em>McCann </em>v. <em>Davis, Malm &amp; D\u2019Agostine, </em>423 Mass. 558, 559 (1996). See <em>Colucci </em>v. <em>Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, P.C., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 111 (plaintiff must show that attorney\u2019s negligence was proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s loss).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Here, the plaintiff needed to establish the required causal connection by showing that, but for the negligence of the defendants in failing to obtain a trial in the prior action, he probably would have been successful in the prosecution of his claims against Bache and Sachs. <em>Colucci </em>v. <em>Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, P.C., supra </em>at 113. <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra </em>at 647. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 431 (1965) (\u201cthe actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if (a) his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm\u201d). Absent such a showing, the plaintiff would have failed to prove that the defendants\u2019 negligence, in failing to obtain a trial in the prior action, was a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury. The judge so instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We summarize the evidence presented in this case from which the jury, in arriving at their negative response to the second question, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>could reasonably have concluded that the plaintiff failed to prove that he probably would have established in the prior action, by a preponderance of the evidence, the validity of his claims against Bache and Sachs.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The claims made by the plaintiff in the prior action were that (i) the plaintiff was an unsuitable investor for the covered call options trading recommended by Sachs, and (ii) the securities transactions consummated by Bache for the plaintiff\u2019s account were neither authorized nor approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s securities expert, Michael Nolan, testified that covered call option writing which Sachs, when employed by Shearson, suggested to the plaintiff and in which the plaintiff continued trading while at Bache, was suitable for a person of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s age; that the plaintiff was \u201cclearly smart enough to understand the risks of options, of covered call writing\u201d and \u201csmart enough to understand the potential rewards from [covered call writing]\u201d; and \u201cthat the National Association of Securities Dealers consider^] covered call writing to be a conservative option strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defendant\u2019s expert, Henry Ferguson, testified that the plaintiff was \u201cabsolutely suitable\u201d to trade in covered call options. \u201cHe would have been approved at any firm I\u2019ve ever worked for or represented . . . [b]ecause he met the criteria. First of all, a covered writing is deemed to be one of the more conservative strategies. He\u2019s doing it on a cash basis, meaning he owned the underlying security.....He was financially capable. I believe at the time he was 48 years-old, [and] certainly intelligent. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">There was also evidence presented from which the jury could reasonably have concluded that the plaintiff authorized or approved the transactions at issue, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s claims. For example, the plaintiff acknowledged at trial that Sachs repeatedly spoke with the plaintiff about the options transactions at issue and that the plaintiff authorized every trade except the first one.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The plaintiff also acknowledged that he never looked at the account statements that he received from Bache and that he did not look at the confirmation slips he received from Bache that covered each transaction. Michael Nolan, the plaintiff\u2019s expert, added the following testimony. When asked \u201cif [the plaintiff] did not review any of the account statements, any of the confirmations at Shearson or Bache, he was not acting as a reasonably prudent investor should, is that correct?,\u201d Mr. Nolan answered, \u201cI believe that\u2019s correct. I\u2019m not sure if he was reasonably prudent. That sounds a little legalistic to me. But for his own protection he should do it .... I would think an investor would want to read the statements that are sent to him by the brokerage firm because that allows them to see if there is anything in dispute at an earlier time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">In sum, there was sufficient evidence presented in this case for the jury to find that (i) the plaintiff was not an unsuitable investor for trading in covered call options, and (ii) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>plaintiff did not fail to authorize or approve the securities transactions at issue. It follows that the jury could reasonably have concluded that the defendants\u2019 negligence in failing to have the plaintiff\u2019s case scheduled for trial was not a substantial factor in the likely unfavorable outcome of his claims against Bache and Sachs. It follows, too, that the dispute about the likely success of the appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, seeking a trial, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to show a probability of success on his Federal securities claims is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">3. <em>Discussion of plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments. </em>The plaintiff devoted a substantial portion of his brief to the proposition that the Superior Court judge erred in not ruling on the issue of the likely outcome of the appeal to the United States Court of Appeals in the prior action. We need not reach that issue because the jury\u2019s answer to the second special verdict question disposes of the issue. Moreover, the Federal appeal terminated when the plaintiff settled with the defendants in the prior action. The plaintiff presented no evidence at trial, and makes no argument here, that the plaintiff\u2019s final settlement with the defendants in the prior action was \u201ctoo low.\u201d See <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. at 647 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The plaintiff also challenges the Superior Court judge\u2019s instructions concerning the alleged unsuitability of the plaintiff as an investor in covered call options. At trial, the case was submitted to the jury on six questions. The first and second questions are reproduced in note 3, <em>supra. </em>The third question, directed to the plaintiff\u2019s damages, was only to be answered if the answer to the second question was answered in the affirmative; therefore the third question was properly left unanswered. The fourth, fifth, and sixth questions, directed to the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, were also properly left unanswered. We have been directed to no part of the record that discloses that, before the jury retired, the plaintiff demanded that further questions be submitted to the jury. See Mass.R. Civ.R 49(a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974). Thus the plaintiff\u2019s case, in its entirety, was submitted to, and answered by, the jury in response to two questions: were the defendants negligent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>was that negligence a substantial factor in producing the plaintiff\u2019s loss or injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The jury answered the first question in the affirmative, and the second question in the negative. The verdict slip instructed the jury that if the second question was answered in the negative, the jury were to \u201cstop here, sign the verdict slip, and return to the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The jury did exactly as instructed. Where the plaintiff failed to request an additional question regarding his suitability, the trial court is deemed to have made a finding on the omitted issue consistent with the judgment on the special verdict questions that were answered, i.e., that the plaintiff was a suitable investor and the negligence of the defendants did not cause any harm allegedly suffered by him. See <em>Hawco </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>398 Mass. 1006 (1986); <em>Velleca </em>v. <em>Uniroyal Tire Co. </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 247, 251 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In sum, we have carefully reviewed the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury in light of the evidence at trial, and we find no prejudicial error. See <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Reisman, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 118, 121-122 (1995) (\u201c[ajppellate courts have traditionally accorded the trial judge considerable discretion [in] framing jury instructions, both in determining the precise phraseology to be used . . . and in determining the appropriate degree of elaboration needed .... In testing the sufficiency of a change <em>[sic], </em>we will read it as a whole ... to ascertain whether the judge has clearly, adequately, and correctly explained to the jury the principles that ought to guide and control their action\u201d). There was a fair trial of claims which began more than twenty years ago, and the judgment for the defendants must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">After a posttrial motion, the Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to recover their costs under rule 68 (offer of judgment). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 68, 365 Mass. 835 (1974). In brief, rule 68 provides that when the recipient of the offer (the offeree) does not (as the plaintiff here did not) accept the offer of judgment within ten days after service of the offer, the offer is deemed to have been withdrawn. \u201cIf <em>the judgment </em>exclusive of interest from the date of offer <em>finally obtained by the offeree </em>is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>In <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>August, </em>450 U.S. 346, 352 (1981), the United States Supreme Court, emphasizing the clause of the rule which we have emphasized in the preceding paragraph, held that \u201cit is clear that [Rule 68] applies . . . only to judgments obtained by the plaintiff. It therefore is simply inapplicable to this case because it was the defendant that obtained the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Here, the plaintiff failed to obtain a judgment, and his appeal was subsequently dismissed following settlement. \u201cIn construing [the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure] we follow the construction given to the Federal rules \u2018absent compelling reasons to the contrary or significant differences in content.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, </em>426 Mass. 410, 414 (1998). We see no compelling reason or significant difference in content that would oblige us not to follow <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>and therefore we are guided by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the rule. \u201c[T]he plain language of Rule 68 confines its effect to . . . [a] case ... in which the plaintiff has obtained a judgment for an amount less favorable than the defendant\u2019s settlement offer.\u201d <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>August, </em>450 U.S. at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The order allowing the defendants\u2019 posttrial motion for costs is vacated, and a new order is to enter denying the motion. The judgment in all other respects is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-17\">The plaintiff identified his underlying claims in the prior action as ones of federal unsuitability and unauthorized trading in securities. In his treatise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>entitled Fundamentals of Securities Regulation, Professor Louis Loss cites, among numerous sources, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) Rules of Fair Practice \u00a7 2310(a), as amended in 1990, for a description of the doctrine of unsuitability: \u201cIn recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security, a member shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for such customer upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by such customer as to his other security holdings and as to his financial situation and needs.\u201d Loss, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation 1012 (4th ed. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\">We quote the special verdict questions: \u201cQ.l.
