Because the prosecutor\u2019s argument went too far, too often, and the judge\u2019s instructions did not go far enough, we are constrained to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">This was a two-witness case. The complaining witness testified that as she was leaving her apartment in Cambridge on the evening of the incident, the defendant grabbed her, gripped her face in his hands and put his lips over hers. He attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>stick his tongue into her mouth, but she clenched her teeth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She said that earlier in the day she had given the defendant a cigarette and later had exchanged pleasantries with him. The defendant, taking the stand in his own defense, testified that he and the complainant had had friendly conversation twice that day and that the contact between them was consensual. According to the defendant, when he approached the complainant while he was panhandling for money, he told her it was his birthday, and she responded by giving him a hug.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">This case turns on prosecutorial misconduct. The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s persistent presentation of the defendant as a \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine-dealing, drug- and alcohol-abusing thief, coupled with the prosecutor\u2019s invitation to the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s character and the prosecutor\u2019s complete disregard of the judge\u2019s explicit order to refrain from argument about the defendant\u2019s supposed guilty conscience, pushed the jury in a direction that proper argument would not have taken them. Credibility could not have been more central to the outcome. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 520 (1987) (\u201cThe basic issue at trial was the credibility of the victim and the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly used the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for distributing cocaine to attack his character through repeated statements during her cross-examination of the defendant \u2014 couched as questions to which the prosecutor sought an affirmative response \u2014 that he was a \u201ccrack dealer,\u201d and by arguing during summation that the jury consider the defendant\u2019s character in connec- . tian with the fact that \u201c[hje\u2019s a crack dealer\u201d and \u201ca thief.\u201d The defendant also contends that during closing argument the prosecutor misstated evidence when she twice described the defendant as having admitted he had stolen a knife. Finally, he argues that the prosecutor impermissibly adverted to evidence of his consciousness of guilt, although she had been ordered by the judge not to do so (the prosecutor having failed to respond to discovery requests regarding this issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">When a defendant raises a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u201cwe consider (1) whether the defendant seasonably objected; (2) whether the error was limited to collateral issues or went to the heart of the case; (3) what specific or general instructions the judge gave the jury which may have mitigated the mistake; and (4) whether the error, in the circumstances, possibly made a difference in the jury\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>432 Mass. 404, 422-423 (2000). The defendant\u2019s only objection was lodged in connection with the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument characterizations of the defendant as a thief and his purported admissions to having stolen the knife. We begin by reviewing the preserved claims for prejudicial error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The prosecutor misstated the evidence. Contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s assertions (\u201cHe told you he stole it. Those were his own words; I stole it. I was grabbing food and I stole the knife\u201d), the defendant did not say he had stolen a knife and the evidence does not justify such an inference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 270 (1994). The sole reference to a knife came during direct examination of the defendant. He testified that following the incident, at about 7:00 p.m., he returned to a Salvation Army shelter too late to get a bed for the evening. He attempted to get something to eat but was told he had to leave the shelter. A police officer came in and told him to sit on the floor, next to a soda machine. The officer found a knife on the defendant\u2019s person. The defendant testified, \u201cI must have \u2014 you know, at that point I had like a serrated knife, cause I grab a knife and fork and tried to get me something to eat when I went in there, while they was telling me to get out.\u201d This was not evidence from which it could reasonably be inferred that the knife in the defendant\u2019s possession at the time he was detained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and (apparently) searched had been stolen by him, and there was no other evidence from which this inference could have been drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Even if there had been evidence that the defendant was a thief, the use made of such evidence in the prosecutor\u2019s closing would still have been improper. \u201cIt is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The prosecutor impermissibly told the jury that they could consider the defendant\u2019s character when drawing their conclusions as to his guilt. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201cNow, I want you to take in consideration of defendant\u2019s character. He\u2019s a crack dealer. He was dealing crack cocaine in 1998. That\u2019s the year of this incident, 1998. He was convicted of dealing crack cocaine. Now, [defense counsel] says that happened a couple of years ago, no, 1998 he was convicted of dealing crack cocaine. Take that into consideration when you\u2019re assessing his testimony on the stand. He was drinking. He told you that. He did crack that day. Take that into consideration. He also stole a knife that day. So, he admitted to you on the stand that he stole a knife. He\u2019s a thief now, too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We do not agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to character was inadvertent and that the intended use of the word \u201ccredibility\u201d is clear in context. Not only did the prosecutor plainly direct the jury \u201cto take in consideration of defendant\u2019s character,\u201d but the thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was that the jury consider the defendant\u2019s character as a dealer of cocaine, as a drug and alcohol user, and as a thief, and was improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 525. The prosecutor made no mention here of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction as a basis for assessing credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Proceeding from her erroneous remarks regarding the defendant\u2019s character as a crack cocaine dealer and user, and a thief, the prosecutor then invited the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s alcohol drinking and drug taking upon his \u201cability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to perceive,\u201d and the fact \u201cthat\u2019s he\u2019s on probation,\u201d in light of his \u201cmotive when [he was] testifying.\u201d We take note of the prosecutor\u2019s persistent use of prejudicial labels when referring to the defendant. Repeated references to the defendant as a \u201ccrack dealer,\u201d drug and alcohol user, thief and probationer were made for their \u201cemotional impact,\u201d serving primarily \u201cto make it less likely that the jury [would] return a verdict based on fair, calm consideration of the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 470 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Finally, the prosecutor made closing statements adverting to the complainant\u2019s comments that she observed the defendant \u201ccrouching\u201d in a manner suggesting that the defendant did so because he had something to hide. The judge had ordered the prosecutor to refrain from making such argument, and the argument should not have been made. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monte-calvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 56-57 (1975) (judge must intervene where argument is improper, especially where \u201cjudge has previously excluded the particular argument as improper\u201d). Further, the evidence that formed the basis for the inference of consciousness of guilt was thin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the jury were given no instruction on the subject.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Person, </em>400 Mass. 136, 142 (1987) (reversal required where prosecutor asked jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>draw consciousness of guilt inference not fairly warranted from evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument, that the prosecutor touched only tangentially on the inference of a guilty conscience and that the jury had heard testimony of crouching from the defendant as well as from the complainant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> misses the point. The judge had specifically ordered the prosecutor not to argue that this evidence exhibited consciousness of guilt because the Commonwealth had, in response to a discovery request, stated it was unaware of any evidence of consciousness of guilt, but then had proceeded to elicit the testimony regarding \u201ccrouching\u201d or \u201chiding.\u201d Implicit in the judge\u2019s order was the determination that such argument would be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant in the circumstances. Notwithstanding the order, the prosecutor made this final statement in her closing: \u201cThe last and final thing that is a concern about the defendant\u2019s story is the fact that he was crouched. Crouched down at a Coke machine. If this was a hug, as he suggested, why was he crouched down?\u201d The statement signified that the defendant was hiding and that he did so because he had a guilty conscience. Although the judge immediately admonished the prosecutor to \u201cmove on,\u201d it came too late to prevent the improper suggestion being conveyed to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Estrada, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1987) (where outcome of trial turns on credibility, court cannot overestimate effect on jury of argument tending to show consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Nor was the impact of the prosecutor\u2019s improper final argument mitigated by the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury, issued at the conclusion of the argument, that referred only to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>improper use of the defendant\u2019s cocaine conviction. The judge began by stating that \u201cthere is <em>one </em>thing I want to correct about [the prosecutor\u2019s] argument\u201d (emphasis supplied). The ensuing instruction made no mention of the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements regarding the knife,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> nor the impermissible suggestion that guilt might be based on his character as a thief, nor the prosecutor\u2019s improper allusion to the supposed evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilty conscience. By focusing only on the cocaine conviction, the curative instruction may have appeared to endorse the rest of the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 522. We are not persuaded that the general instruction informing the jury to consider only evidence introduced at trial, and that argument was not evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was sufficient to overcome the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct \u2014 misconduct sufficient to defeat even a strong case for the Commonwealth. The prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the evidence and inappropriate characterization of the defendant as a thief were errors objected to by the defendant, and when considered in light of numerous other prosecutorial missteps and the absence of adequate curative instructions, require reversal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The defendant makes no claim on appeal that these facts do not support his conviction of indecent assault and battery pursuant to G.

Defense counsel\u2019s objection to the testimony was overruled. We do not decide this issue because the evidence at any retrial would not necessarily be the same as that presented at trial. We note only that to the extent the testimony was relevant to and focused on the defendant\u2019s sudden departure from the scene, it was not hearsay. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence, \u00a7 8.2 (7th ed. 1999). By contrast, to the extent the testimony was introduced as an assertion that the complainant was not in fact \u201call right,\u201d it would likely fall within the hearsay rule.

This knowledge was gained from the defendant\u2019s own testimony on direct examination. The jury were told how to assess this evidence, as well as all of the other evidence, by a judge who provided thorough, and when needed, immediate curative instructions, which the jury presumably followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>Actions by the judge prior to testimony being taken. </em>The judge thoughtfully ruled on a motion in limine to disallow the Commonwealth from introducing prior convictions of armed robbery, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery on a police officer. She also allowed partial individual voir dire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, she asked additional questions of the venire to ensure the jury was impartial. Once the jury were selected, she instructed them, among other things, at the outset, prior to any evidence being presented, about the presumption of innocence and the burden of the Commonwealth to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. She pointedly told them the opening statements and closing arguments were not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\"><em>The strength of the case. </em>Identification was not an issue. The victim, who stood four feet, eleven inches tall, came into contact with the defendant, whom she had never seen before, on three occasions on the day of the incident. In the late morning, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the victim was sitting on a park bench, talking with a male friend and enjoying the fall weather, the defendant approached, asking for a cigarette. After the victim gave him one, he left, only to remain in the area. She thought him \u201ca little strange.\u201d She next saw him a few hours later while walking her dog. The defendant approached her and they engaged in some small talk. While the victim did not wish to do so, being cordial, she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">At 7:00 p.m. when she was walking to a restaurant to retrieve a take-out order for her daughter, \u201c[a] person came up to me and grabbed me like this, very tightly.\u201d Her face was gripped so tightly that \u201cI had cuts inside my mouth from my teeth.\u201d The defendant shoved her toward a bench, and \u201che was trying to stick his tongue in my mouth, and I kept my teeth shut.\u201d The victim described the incident as \u201cso traumatizing ... I was in \u2014 so much fear, I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.\u201d They struggled, the defendant\u2019s hand over her face, he still trying to enter her mouth. He told her he had a \u201cpiece,\u201d which the victim took to mean \u201ca gun or a weapon.\u201d Upon hearing that, she started kicking vigorously. Finally, a couple happened by, the male asking if she was all right. The defendant immediately fled \u201cvery quickly.\u201d The victim continued, \u201cI got up, I thanked the couple, because I was so grateful. I wish I got their names. And I ran into my apartment and I called 911.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The police arrived and spoke with her. Shortly thereafter, they entered a homeless shelter which was next door to her apartment building. There she identified the defendant, who \u201cwas crouched in the comer, you know, down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The defendant took the stand and stated that the male with whom the victim had been seated earlier in the day was a drug dealer. Testifying that he was a former cocaine addict, he admitted saying to the victim that he had a \u201cpiece,\u201d but explained that he was referring to a piece of cocaine. He also admitted having a knife in his possession, explaining that he had gone to the Salvation Army to get some food, \u201cwhen they told me I had to leave. I must have \u2014 you know, at that point I had like a serrated knife, cause I grab a knife and fork and tried to get me something to eat . . . .\u2019\u2019He denied the incident, although he did say that when the couple happened by, the victim was hugging him.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>On cross-examination, to counter the defendant\u2019s assertion that the victim\u2019s male friend was a drug dealer, the prosecutor asked, \u201cMr. Daley, you\u2019re the crack dealer, aren\u2019t you, you\u2019re the one that\u2019s the crack dealer, not the person that [the victim] was with?\u201d When the defendant denied it, he was somewhat in-artfully impeached with his conviction for distributing crack cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He explained, \u201cI was dealing crack [cocaine] so I could smoke it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">This portion of the transcript, on which the majority places much concern, consists of barely three quarters of a page out of nineteen pages of cross-examination. The judge at length and forcefully limited the scope of this testimony in her instructions, which juries are presumed to follow. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 29 (1996), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 859 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Just before the conclusion of her cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to question the defendant regarding to what he had testified on direct, namely, that he was currently on probation. When she attempted to establish that he had an interest in the outcome of this case as it would undoubtedly affect his probationary status, the judge, out of an abundance of caution, disallowed this line of questioning. What the prosecutor sought to accomplish was appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 368 (1991) (an interest in the outcome of the case is a criterion for assessing credibility). That the trial judge, in her discretion, disallowed it is indicative of the eminently fair manner in which she conducted the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\"><em>The closing argument. </em>While certain aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s closing were improper, they were more than adequately addressed by the judge in her final instructions. Indeed, at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the judge immediately, without request from defense counsel, forcefully and at length instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the Jury, there is one thing I want to correct about [the prosecutor\u2019s] argument. She said that you may consider the defendant\u2019s character, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that was completely inappropriate argument. She then [alluded] to a prior conviction. Let me tell you the reason that I admitted that prior conviction. It was admitted for one purpose, and one purpose only. It was admitted for the purpose of helping you decide whether or not to believe the defendant\u2019s testimony, and how much weight, if any, to give it. You must not draw any inference of guilt against the defendant because of that prior conviction. The fact that the defendant was once found guilty of another crime does not mean that he is guilty of this charge, and you must not consider the prior conviction to be any indication of guilt on this charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201cYou may consider his prior conviction solely to help you determine whether or not he is a truthful witness. His character is not at issue here, whether he was in the past was a crack dealer. He\u2019s not charged with dealing crack in this case. The sole question for you to decide is whether or not the Commonwealth has sustained its burden of proof with regard to the crime which he is charged with, and certainly you may assess his credibility. In that connection, you may consider that prior conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The instruction was more than adequate to dispel the taint of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The majority speculates that the judge\u2019s failure to address specifically whether the knife was stolen somehow \u201cmay have appeared to endorse the rest of the prosecutor\u2019s argument.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 94. One might equally speculate that the jury would view the prosecutor in a somewhat harsh light given the judge\u2019s condemnation of her remarks within seconds of her sitting down. Regardless, it is improper for this court to speculate about what the jury may or may not have thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The judge told the jurors in the clearest terms on numerous occasions that closing arguments are not evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>were given thorough and clear instructions on a relatively simple case about the roles of the parties, whose memory controls, the burden of proof, the presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt and so forth. Demonstrating the close attention paid the case, the jury, during their deliberation, returned with thoughtful questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">What it comes down to is simple: were the jury capable of fairly and impartially listening to the evidence, applying the thorough and proper instructions of the judge throughout the trial, and rendering a fair, just and correct verdict? Given the facts of this case, they were.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This being the case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> Among the areas explored individually was the ability of the potential juror to assess the credibility of the witnesses, including that of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The defense attorney, on direct examination, had elicited that the defendant had been convicted of the crime and was on probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The judge instructed the jury on this point prior to trial, prior to closing, and during her final instructions. While not taken into account here, it should be noted that the video tape shown to potential jurors upon their arrival in court for jury duty also includes this admonition, as does The Trial Juror\u2019s Handbook, which states, \u201cThe opening statements and closing arguments are not evidence.\u201d The Trial Juror\u2019s Handbook, Oflice of Jury Commissioner for the Commonwealth H-6 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Presumably, had the Commonwealth met its discovery obligations, the consciousness of guilt evidence would have been admitted by the judge. When discussing the evidence, the prosecutor did tell the judge she was \u201cnot going to make an argument in the sense, I might ask the jury to draw on their common hfe experiences, but I\u2019m not going to make a specific argument that this is an indication of his guilt to the jury.\u201d In her closing, she noted that the defendant, <em>as was testified to, </em>was crouched down by a soda machine. When she asked why this was so if the two had merely hugged, as the defendant had testified, the judge interrupted and admonished her in front of the jury (\u201cyou said you were not going to argue this. So, you\u2019d better move on\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
