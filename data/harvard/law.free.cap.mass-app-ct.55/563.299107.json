L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>jury returned a guilty verdict on one indictment, and a not guilty verdict on the other. The defendant now claims that the evidence that he forced his tongue into a fourteen year old girl\u2019s mouth was insufficient to establish the offense of indecent assault and battery, and that because it is not possible to tell which alleged incident supported the one guilty verdict, his conviction must be reversed. He also claims error in the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct that an indecent touch must be proven as to the \u201ccomplainant\u2019s private parts . . . such as \u2018the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs or pubic area.\u2019 \u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><em>Background. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. Tiffany (a pseudonym), a fourteen year old female, spent the night, for the first and only time, at the home of her friend, Alice (a pseudonym). On the following afternoon, Alice\u2019s stepfather, the defendant (in his mid-thirties) was running some errands around the house and at some point, while doing laundry, called from the basement of the home requesting an extension cord. Tiffany took the cord to the basement and, after a brief conversation, the defendant \u201cgrabbed [her] hand. . . pulled [her] towards him and . . . started kissing [her] . . . [o]n the lips, with his tongue.\u201d Tiffany testified that the defendant \u201chad his tongue out of his mouth and put his tongue in [her] mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">When Tiffany was touched, she was \u201cscared,\u201d \u201cin total shock,\u201d and did not know what to do. After the touching, she physically \u201cpushed him away\u201d and told him not to do that. The defendant then held her hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody. I don\u2019t want news to travel.\u201d Tiffany further testified that she did not expect the defendant to kiss her, had never kissed the defendant in the past, and had never talked to the defendant about kissing her. Tiffany subsequently returned to the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant called for Tiffany to return to the basement. Instead of complying, she went upstairs to the second floor, ostensibly \u201cto go to the bathroom,\u201d but actually she went to Alice\u2019s bedroom, from which she telephoned her mother to request a ride home. While she was in Alice\u2019s bedroom, the defendant knocked on the door and Tiffany opened it \u201cbecause [she] didn\u2019t know what else to do. [She] didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>know if it might have been [Alice].\u201d When she opened the door, the defendant appeared, took Tiffany\u2019s hand, pulled her toward him and touched her in the same way as before, with his tongue and on her lips. Tiffany told the defendant not to do that and attempted to push him away, but the defendant held her closer and placed his hand down her shirt and into her bra. She testified that he touched her breast and the nipple of her breast. Tiffany again resisted, and the defendant withdrew his hand from her shirt, held her hand and told her not to tell anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><em>The forced mouth and tongue touching. </em>The defendant first claims that there was insufficient evidence to establish the indecency element of indecent assault and battery under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H, as to the forced touching in the basement. He argues that his behavior may have been offensive, but was not indecent because the touching did not involve \u201cportions of the anatomy commonly thought private,\u201d whereas the word \u201cindecent\u201d must be read very narrowly and, in consideration of case law, be restricted to the touching of \u201cthe breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and pubic area of a female.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 59 (1982). The defendant argues that the contact in the basement was not indecent because it was brief and nonviolent, and although it was without consent, was not a touching of the \u201csexual or other intimate parts\u201d of Tiffany\u2019s person. We hold that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s behavior in the basement and in the second floor bedroom was sufficient to establish separate offenses under the statute, even though the jury found him not guilty of one of the matching indictments. Accordingly, it makes no difference which incident was the basis for the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, 399 </em>Mass. 668, 676 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cThe type of conduct that constitutes indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen years of age is not defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 184 (1991). This court, however, has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cThe test for indecent assault and battery . . . is an objective one that is bounded by \u2018contemporary moral values\u2019 \u201d .... The measure of indecency is \u201ccommon understanding and practices.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>App. Ct. 290, 300 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass. 508 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 59 (1982). A touching is indecent when, judged by the \u2018normative standard\u2019 of societal mores, it is \u2018violative of social and behavioral expectations,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 580-581, 589 (1997), in a manner \u2018which [is] fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values . . . [and] which the common sense of society would regard as immodest, immoral and improper.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 184 (1991), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 43 (1985). So defined, the term \u2018indecent\u2019 affords a \u2018reasonable opportunity for a person of ordinary intelligence to know what is prohibited.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 302, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, </em>396 Mass. 653, 655 (1986).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 313, 314-315 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">When evaluating evidence of alleged indecent behavior, we consider all of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 316. Further, the list of anatomical parts and areas referred to in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, supra </em>at 185, and the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court, Instruction 5.403 (1995), as being private areas has never been declared to be exhaustive as the defendant contends.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such sources may be read to include other parts of the body \u2014 whether clothed or unclothed \u2014 that, if intentionally and unjustifiably touched, would violate \u201cour contemporary views of personal integrity and privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavigne, supra </em>at 315. Intentional, unjustified, and nonconsen-sual insertion of one\u2019s tongue into the mouth of another can, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>under certain circumstances, constitute such \u201cassaultive conduct which society deems indecent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In this case, there is a considerable age disparity between the defendant (mid-thirties) and the victim (fourteen), and an obvious disparity in experience and sophistication. There was also an authority disparity: the defendant was the stepfather of the victim\u2019s friend. Further, the first forced tongue insertion took place surreptitiously in the basement while others were upstairs and unaware. It was, moreover, effected by a degree of force \u2014 the defendant \u201cgrabbed\u201d the victim, pulled her to himself, and forced his tongue into her mouth. The victim retreated, was frightened, and verbally expressed her lack of consent to the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Also, prior to the forced touching in the basement, somewhat secretive conversations between the defendant and the victim included provocative remarks by the defendant to the victim, such as, \u201cIt will just be our little thing. When I smile, you smile back, and we will know what we\u2019re saying\u201d and, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, but I think you\u2019re pretty. ... I don\u2019t want word to travel or anything, but what do you think of me?\u201d Furthermore, after the complained-of behavior in the basement, the defendant instructed the victim to remain silent as to what had just occurred. In consideration of all these circumstances, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to establish the elements of the crime under the relevant standard. See <em>Commonwealth v</em>. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\"><em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant also complains that the judge erred in refusing to include in the jury charge certain language from the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction. Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 59, the defendant requested the judge to charge the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201c[a]n \u2018indecent\u2019 assault and battery is one which involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the touching of the complainant\u2019s private parts. It must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally and without justification touched the private areas of the complainant such as \u2018the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs or pubic area of a female.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The judge\u2019s instructions properly stated the elements of the crime and he correctly instructed the jury that, \u201c[f]or example... it has been determined that the unconsented to fondling of a woman\u2019s breast, touching her buttocks, or reaching between her legs <em>may </em>constitute an indecent assault and battery\u201d (emphasis supplied). The defendant\u2019s proposed instruction would have effectively constrained the definition of the offense by requiring the Commonwealth to prove the touching of specific body parts. Our use of such language in <em>De La Cruz </em>was merely illustrative of possible examples of indecent touching and was not meant to be limiting. Because requiring such proof alters the accepted meaning of the term \u201cindecent,\u201d the judge \u201cappropriately rejected the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The defendant argues that the word \u201cindecent\u201d must be more narrowly construed because it is used in a criminal statute, and that the cases and the Model Penal Code intimate, imply, or suggest that indecent assault and battery is restricted to an exclusive list of anatomical parts that, at the very most, can include only \u201cprivate parts,\u201d as that phrase has been commonly understood, which is essentially the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, pubic area and inner thigh. These authorities do not support the proposition that the Legislature intended indecent assault and battery to apply only to the touchings mentioned in the defendant\u2019s proposed exclusive anatomical list.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\">\u201cIt has been held that the intentional, unjustified touching of private areas <em>such as </em>\u2018the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and pubic area . . .\u2019 constitutes an indecent assault and battery\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 184, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">\u201cAn assault and battery is \u2018indecent\u2019 if it involves touching portions of the anatomy commonly thought private, <em>such as </em>a person\u2019s genital area or buttocks, or the breasts . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court, Instruction 5.403 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412 (1990), the defendant inserted his tongue into the victim\u2019s mouth, and raped her vaginally and anally. Upon an appeal addressing only the issue of duplicative convictions, and not considering the sufficiency of evidence or the definition of indecent assault and battery, the court commented that \u201c[t]here is evidence of two distinct acts of rape and one act of indecent assault and battery <em>in this scenario\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 418.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
