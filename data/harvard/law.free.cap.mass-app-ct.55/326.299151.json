L. c. 152, \u00a7 34), partial disability benefits (\u00a7 35), and permanent total disability benefits (\u00a7 34A). The question raised by the employee\u2019s appeal is whether he was required, once he was found to be permanently and totally disabled, to exhaust his temporary benefits under \u00a7 34 before collecting the higher benefits of \u00a7 34A, as well as the cost of living benefits of \u00a7 34B. The reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (board), with one member dissenting, concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>he was required to exhaust his \u00a7 34 temporary benefits before being entitled to permanent benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">There is no dispute about the facts as set forth by the administrative judge and the board. The employee sustained a traumatic brain injury on October 22, 1996, while working for his employer, when the hook at the end of a crane \u201csmashed into [his] head.\u201d Although the employee did not testify at the hearing before the administrative judge, he did appear with his attorney, and the administrative judge found that he was \u201cclearly severely incapacitated in his functioning.\u201d Based on the medical evidence before him, the administrative judge also found that the employee was \u201cpermanently totally disabled as of November 24, 1997.\u201d The parties stipulated to the industrial injury, to the employee\u2019s base average weekly wage, and to his total incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We turn to the two provisions providing benefits for total incapacity. In 1991 there was a substantial revision of the act. Sections 34 and 34A, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7\u00a7 59 and 60, provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Section 34 (temporary total incapacity):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201cWhile the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total, during each week of incapacity the insurer shah pay the injured employee compensation equal to sixty percent of his or her average weekly wage before the injury, but not more than the maximum weekly compensation rate . . . .[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\u201cThe total number of weeks of compensation due the employee under this section shall not exceed one hundred fifty-six.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Section 34A (permanent total incapacity):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">\u201cWhile the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is both permanent and total, the insurer shall pay to the injured employee, <em>following payment of compensation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>provided in sections thirty-four and thirty-five, </em>a weekly compensation equal to two-thirds of his average weekly wage before the injury, but not more than the maximum weekly compensation rate nor less than the minimum weekly compensation rate.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The board interprets the italicized words as a 1991 reinstatement of the exhaustion requirement that was in effect prior to 1985.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the board\u2019s view, the employee must receive lower benefits for three years (156 weeks) under \u00a7 34 before receiving \u00a7 34A benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The pre-1985 version of \u00a7 34A, however, unlike the 1991 revision of 34A, specifically provided for an exhaustion requirement, stating that \u00a7 34A payments would begin \u201cfollowing payment of the maximum amount of compensation provided in sections thirty-four and thirty-five, or either of them . . . .\u2019\u2019As the dissenting member of the board noted, \u201cTo read the disputed statutory phrase (\u2018following payment of [maximum] compensation provided in\u2019 \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35) as an exhaustion requirement, one must add the word \u2018maximum\u2019 to the Legislature\u2019s 1991 amendment. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In its present form, without the word \u201cmaximum,\u201d the provision has a sensible meaning. Until a seriously injured employee\u2019s condition has stabilized and it is known whether the employee\u2019s condition will improve, he or she will in the usual course first receive payments under \u00a7 34. Thereafter, sometimes the employee\u2019s condition will improve, and he or she will receive partial payments under \u00a7 35. There are also occasions when the condition of an employee receiving \u00a7 35 payments will worsen, and, therefore, he or she may be entitled to total incapacity benefits after receiving partial incapacity benefits. Where, as here, the statute read literally makes sense and where the Legislature had the clear model of the pre-1985 provision, we see no reason to add words to \u00a7 34A.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Moreover, not requiring exhaustion seems more consistent with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 34B. Section 35 provides that, in the absence of an agreement by the insurer or a finding by an administrative judge, the number of weeks an employee may receive benefits under \u00a7 34 and \u00a7 35 shall not exceed 364. The board\u2019s interpretation would require a permanently totally incapacitated employee who had previously received partial benefits to exhaust both the \u00a7 34 and \u00a7 35 payments and, therefore, to wait at least seven years before receiving payments under \u00a7 34A or a cost of living adjustment under \u00a7 34B.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nothing suggests that the Legislature had such a harsh intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The provisions of \u00a7 34B that provide for a cost of living adjustment also seem incongruous with the three-year exhaustion requirement determined by the board. That provision which, in relevant part, is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was also revised in 1991, and, specifically referring to \u00a7 34A, envisions the possibility of a cost of living increase for an employee receiving benefits under \u00a7 34A prior to the expiration of the three-year period during which payments may be made under \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The majority of the board considered the language of \u00a7 34A to be unclear and relied on the Legislature\u2019s main objective of saving costs in reaching its decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Reliance on cost savings to interpret each provision of the act would in one fell swoop nullify the traditional statutory construction of c. 152. As recently as in <em>CNA Ins. Cos. </em>v. <em>Sliski, </em>433 Mass. 491, 493 (2001), the Supreme Judicial Court explained the purpose of the chapter and how it should be interpreted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201cWe have long recognized that the workers\u2019 compensation statute was enacted as a \u2018humanitarian measure\u2019 in response to strong public sentiment that the remedies afforded by actions of tort at common law did not provide adequate protection to workers who were the victims of industrial accidents. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21, 27 (1979). We have stressed that the statute should be given a broad interpretation, viewed in light of that purpose. <em>Roberge\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 506, 509 (1953).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">While \u201c[a] reviewing court accords due weight and deference to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute within its charge, <em>Massachusetts Med. Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988), . . . \u2018[t]he duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u2019 <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 344 (1964).\u201d <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Cecil, </em>431 Mass. 410, 413 (2000). In view of the long-standing tradition of construing c. 152 in light of its beneficial purpose, we decline to add the word \u201cmaximum\u201d to language contained in \u00a7 34A based on a general legislative intent to save costs or reduce a backlog. For us to insert such additional language requires a far clearer legislative directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the reviewing board dated April 14, 2000, is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ment of Industrial Accidents to issue an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-11\">The reviewing board affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to dismiss, as premature, the employee\u2019s \u00a7 34A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The material deleted states: \u201cunless the average weekly wage of the employee is less than the minimum weekly compensation rate, in which case said weekly compensation shall be equal to his average weekly wage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">From 1935 to 1945, there was no exhaustion requirement in \u00a7 34A. A 1945 amendment, St. 1945, c. 717, required exhaustion. The payments at the time of that amendment were higher under \u00a7 34 (two-thirds of average weekly wage) than under \u00a7 34A (one-half of average weekly wage). In 1949, St. 1949, c. 520, \u00a7 2, increased \u00a7 34A benefits to two-thirds of the average weekly wage. In 1985 the exhaustion requirement was deleted. St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>Constant </em>v. <em>Family Planning Council, </em>11 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 550 (1997), a case in which the employee had exhausted her \u00a7 34 benefits, the reviewing board held that an insurer had to pay \u00a7 34A benefits without requiring the exhaustion of benefits under both \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, pointing out that there was no specific language regarding exhaustion per se, and that to argue that the word \u201cand\u201d created a dual exhaustion requirement would lead to an absurd result, e.g., a person who is in a permanent coma would be. required to wait and receive all \u00a7 34 and \u00a7 35 benefits before receipt of \u00a7 34A benefits. The board in <em>Constant </em>specifically noted that it did not need to reach the issue of entitlement to \u00a7 34A benefits when neither \u00a7 34 nor \u00a7 35 benefits is paid to the statutory maximum as the employee had exhausted her \u00a7 34 benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u201cOctober first of each year shall be the review date for the purposes of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u201cAny person receiving or entitled to receive benefits under the provisions of section thirty-one or section thirty-four A whose benefits are based on a date of personal injury at least twenty-four months prior to the review date shall have his weekly benefit adjusted, without application, in accordance with the following provisions . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Indeed, if the intent had been to require exhaustion of \u00a7 34 benefits, \u00a7 34B would more properly have been written as follows: \u201cAny person receiving or entitled to receive benefits under the provision of \u00a7 31 whose benefits are based on a date of personal injury at least twenty-four months prior to the review date, or any person receiving or entitled to receive benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>under \u00a7 34A, shall have his benefits adjusted ....\u2019\u2019 If there were an exhaus-tian requirement, the twenty-four month period would not be needed with respect to \u00a7 34A, as there would be at least a three-year period before an employee would be entitled to those benefits under the board\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The board also noted that another major goal of the 1991 legislation was to reduce the backlog of cases and that requiring exhaustion accomplishes this purpose by delaying litigation of \u00a7 34A claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
