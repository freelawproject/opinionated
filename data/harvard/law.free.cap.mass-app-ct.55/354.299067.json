L. c. 209A, is that the restrictions contained in the order are unreasonable and unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order, dated October 31, 1997, is permanent and requires the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>stay at least 500 yards from the plaintiff and one mile from her home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Prior to issuing the order in question, the judge, who was familiar with the case, having presided over the parties\u2019 divorce and having issued or extended orders under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> held a hearing and heard from both parties, individually.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The gist of the defendant\u2019s statements, in support of his motion to change the 500-yard and one-mile restrictions, was that his mother, his friends, and his business contacts lived within the one-mile radius of the plaintiff\u2019s home and that he would be precluded from visiting his family and from conducting business in the town in which he had lived his whole life. The plaintiff, on the other hand, in opposing a change of the geographic restrictions of the order then in place, made the following points: over a period of ten years, including when she had been pregnant with her first child, the defendant repeatedly beat and threatened her. He also threatened her brothers and father. He was in prison for various charges including assault and battery against her and for possessing a machine gun and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>silencer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She stated that the children were afraid of the defendant, and she was very fearful of him, even now in court, and would never feel safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In deciding whether to modify or renew an abuse prevention order, a judge\u2019s discretion is \u201cbroad.\u201d <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633, 635 (2000). See Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 57.7 (2d ed. 1996). His or her statutory authority is based on \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s public policy against domestic abuse \u2014 preservation of the fundamental human right to be protected from the devastating impact of family violence.\u201d <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 327 (1999). The determination of what distance is sufficient to provide an appropriate zone of protection for an abused person or family depends upon the facts of each case and the judge\u2019s assessment of the threat posed by the abuser. In view of the criminal assaults and batteries upon the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s prior illegal possession of a machine gun, the judge did not exceed the wide discretion accorded him by G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3, in concluding that the circumstances warranted the relief ordered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The defendant speculates that he may unknowingly be in violation of the 500-yard order. While 500 yards is a long distance,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s fears are not supported by our cases. He \u201ccannot be convicted of violating a \u2018no contact\u2019 [or \u201cstay away\u201d] order issued under c. 209A where the contact occurs in circumstances where [he] did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know,\u201d of the proximity of the plaintiff or his children. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>54 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>App. Ct. 488, 493 (2002). This is consistent with the \u201c \u2018longstanding\u2019 common-law principle that, absent contrary indication from the Legislature, we assume that the Legislature did not intend \u2018to make accidents and mistakes crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finase, </em>435 Mass. 310, 315 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>427 Mass. 385, 388 (1998). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The defendant also claims that the order is invalid on two other grounds. Without in any way suggesting that these claims have merit, we do not reach them. His contention that an order by another judge extending an earlier c. 209A order for one week to October 31, 1997, to allow the judge familiar with the case to act on the permanent terms of the order, was invalid is not properly before us. At the hearing on October 24, 1997, when the judge indicated she would extend the order, the defendant acquiesed to the extension or at least waived any objection to it. We also do not reach the defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments as they were raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Since we find no abuse of discretion in the October 31, 1997, order, that order is affirmed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-15\">We acknowledge the helpful brief of amici curiae the Women\u2019s Bar Association of Massachusetts, the Domestic Violence Council, Inc., and Jane Doe, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The order contained the same terms as a previous order issued under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B, which on its face stated that it was agreed to by the parties. Although the defendant did not attempt to have the order corrected to show that he had not agreed to its geographic terms (he had agreed to its permanency), we do not base our decision on whether the defendant agreed to the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The order contained in the record appendix indicates it was issued on June 3, 1997, and vacated on July 31, 1997, when another order entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Portions of the October 31, 1997, hearing are inaudible and it may be that the parties were not under oath. Neither party raises any objection on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Both parties filed motions to include additional material in the record on appeal, and each opposed the other\u2019s motion. The plaintiff sought to file a supplemental appendix which included, among other things, her affidavits in support of the several abuse prevention orders that were issued since 1995; the defendant wanted to include the transcript of the hearing at the divorce proceeding in support of his contention that he did not agree to the geographic terms of the G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34B, order. Since we do not base our decision on the defendant\u2019s agreement to the terms of the c. 208 order, and since the statements of each of the parties at the October 31, 1997, hearing set forth their contentions and were transcribed, we deny both motions to supplement the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In his brief, the defendant acknowledged that at the time of the June 3, 1997, hearing, when he had been brought to court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus, he was incarcerated at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, on a sentence for possessing a machine gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Had the record not indicated the extreme danger posed to the plaintiff, particularly by the defendant\u2019s possession of a machine gun and silencer, the imposition of such a great distance in a \u201cstay away\u201d order should have been accompanied by findings explaining the unusual order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\">See Commentary to \u00a7 4.0 of the Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Prevention Proceedings at 59 (Dec. 2000), pointing out that an order which requires the defendant to stay a great distance away from the plaintiff is difficult to enforce, and that an order up to 100 yards is usually sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The plaintiff seeks legal fees under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 38. Those provisions do not apply to this case. In the absence of any claim under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 <em>3(f), </em>we do not consider whether that section may be applicable to these proceedings. See <em>Gustin </em>v. <em>Gustin, </em>420 Mass. 854, 858 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
