We conclude that this judgment reflected an abuse of discretion and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\"><em>Background. </em>The facts underlying the judgment, as found by the probate judge and stipulated by the parties, are essentially undisputed. The Katzes were married in June, 1956, separated in May, 1970, and divorced in June, 1983, when Charlotte was forty-eight and Nathan fifty-one. The marriage produced three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>children, two of whom were minors at the time of the divorce. The divorce judgment provided, inter alla, that Nathan pay unallocated alimony and child support to Charlotte in the amount of $550 per week. No express time limit or conditions subsequent were placed upon Nathan\u2019s alimony obligation in that judgment, nor was there any agreement between the parties relating to alimony. Charlotte also received sole ownership of the marital home in Quincy, while Nathan retained a Brookline condominium that he had purchased some time in the 1970\u2019s (and at some later date placed in an undisclosed type of tenancy with the woman who became his second wife). In addition to other obligations, such as paying for the two minor children\u2019s education, Nathan was ordered to pay Charlotte\u2019s life and health insurance premiums and to give her a lump sum of $100,000 on January 31, 1993, pursuant to the terms of a $315,000 promissory note then payable to Nathan by his employer. At the time of the divorce, Nathan was employed in a family retail business, earning $86,000 per year. Charlotte was a homemaker and primary caretaker of the children, had not been employed in sixteen years, and had no marketable skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Nathan remarried in 1983, soon after the divorce. Over the next nine years, he complied with all of the terms of the 1983 divorce judgment. By 1991, he was earning $125,000 a year from the family business. In January, 1992, however, he was effectively forced out of the business and into early retirement at age sixty (although he remained a \u201cconsultant\u201d receiving $96.15 per week from the business, plus a $3,000 per year \u201cclothing allowance\u201d and an all-expenses paid automobile, for the next five years). Alleging materially changed employment and financial circumstances, Nathan filed for modification of his support obligation that same month, seeking to reduce it to $175 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">He obtained a temporary order that cut his payment to $450 per week, all of which represented alimony (the youngest child having become emancipated). While earning interest and consultant income of approximately $520 per week, Nathan claimed weekly expenses of $1,288, including the cost of Charlotte\u2019s alimony ($450) and insurance ($54.03). Although his assets then totaled $732,470 (which included his interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the Brookline condominium, the outstanding mortgage for which was his only liability) and he had been living \u201ca comfortable lifestyle,\u201d he contended that, with the significant reduction in his income, he had to begin using his assets to meet his expenses and that, without relief, he would deplete those assets in ten years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Charlotte\u2019s assets then amounted to $196,000, consisting entirely of her equity in the marital home and an anticipated $100,000 lump sum payment from the promissory note (from which, the judge noted, she would be paying off her existing liabilities of $25,519, exclusive of mortgage debt). Her estimated income was $515 per week, consisting of the $450 alimony and interest income from the $100,000 payment, while her weekly expenses were $546. The net result had been a reduction in her standard of living to \u201ca spartan lifestyle.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a8i-dedup-0\">In her March, 1993, decision on Nathan\u2019s first complaint for modification, the judge permanently reduced his alimony obligation to $450 per week. As rationale for rejecting the more drastic alimony decrease that Nathan desired, the judge noted that \u201cNathan\u2019s financial security is set for the foreseeable future\u201d while \u201cCharlotte is almost totally dependent upon Nathan for her support\u201d; that Nathan will be enjoying financial benefits from his former employer for another four years; and, most significantly, that he \u201cwill be relocating to Florida where he expects the cost of living to be less expensive.\u201d She praised Nathan\u2019s \u201ctaking steps to preserve his resources by making such a move,\u201d while admonishing Charlotte that she \u201clikewise has an obligation to maximize the use of her resources\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(although she recognized that Charlotte \u201chas little opportunity for [acquiring] other income\u201d or assets) and warning Charlotte that she \u201cneeds to plan now for the possibility of a further reduction\u201d should Nathan \u201cspend down his resources more quickly than I project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Following the 1993 modification, Nathan purchased a condominium in West Palm Beach, Florida, utilizing $112,000 of his investment funds (because of his claimed inability to qualify for a mortgage without a steady source of employment income). As he had eventually done with the Brookline condominium, Nathan took the West Palm Beach residence as a co-tenant with his second wife (the record does not indicate the exact nature of that concurrent ownership). He did not, however, fully \u201crelocate\u201d in Florida, as had been envisioned during the 1993 modification hearing, but continued to maintain his Brookline home. He and his second wife lived eight months of the year in West Palm Beach, then spent the remainder of their year (June through September) in Brookline. Nathan said that he went to Florida for health reasons<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and returned to Brookline for health reasons, \u201cplus ... to spend time with\u201d his second wife\u2019s mother, who lived in the Boston area.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Nathan filed a second complaint for modification, requesting \u201creducing or terminating\u201d his alimony obligation to Charlotte, in September, 1996. The complaint was heard over a year later by the same judge who had presided over the 1993 modification and who made the following findings. Since the 1993 modification and the purchase of the West Palm Beach condominium, Nathan\u2019s assets had decreased to $478,293.29 (which included his \u201cV2 interests\u201d in the Brookline and West Palm Beach condominiums, the total equity in which was $307,700). His weekly income was now $515.58, of which $297.28 was from interest income on his investments and $218.30 from Social Security benefits. His weekly expenses were $1,450.07, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ing the $450 per week alimony to Charlotte and $54.03 per week for her health insurance (an obligation that was, however, to expire in eighteen months when Charlotte would turn sixty-five). Nathan\u2019s nonmortgage liabilities had gone from zero to $26,600, all reflecting credit card debt; his mortgage balance on the Brookline condominium had declined to $23,000. Nathan had to withdraw funds from his investments in each of the years since 1993 to support himself and his second wife and meet his obligations to Charlotte;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and if that rate of withdrawal persisted, the judge concluded, \u201chis retirement assets will be depleted in or within four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Charlotte\u2019s assets as of the 1997 hearing were $176,066.24, $129,217.37 of which consisted of her equity in the Quincy home and $34,364.21, the remainder of the $100,000 she had received in 1993. Her weekly income was then $575.80 ($450 in alimony, $106.15 in Social Security benefits, and $19.65 in interest income). Her weekly expenses had increased to $622.75, $174.81 of which were her continued mortgage payments on a mortgage balance of $60,382.63). Her liabilities, exclusive of the mortgage debt, consisted of $5,500 owed on several credit cards and $5,000 owed to her lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On these facts, the judge found that Nathan\u2019s lifestyle had \u201cdeclined\u201d to the level of \u201cmodest,\u201d while Charlotte\u2019s had not changed since 1993. The judge noted that Charlotte (then almost sixty-four) as well as Nathan (then almost sixty-six) continued to have \u201cserious health problems\u201d (hers including asthma, \u201cDe-ceuvrans Feno Sinuvitis\u201d [a hand condition], severe back problems, and migraines) and found both of them to be unemployable. With respect to Nathan\u2019s continued maintenance of both the West Palm Beach and Brookline residences, the judge found that keeping the Brookline condominium was less expensive for Nathan than would be paying for a motel room or renting an apartment in Boston when he and his current wife came north during the summer months.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The judge praised Nathan\u2019s frugality in the face of the decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>in his lifestyle<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but was unremittingly critical of Charlotte\u2019s money management, citing her opting to collect Social Security benefits at age sixty-two, rather than awaiting a larger benefit at sixty-five; spending over $56,600 of the $100,000 from the promissory note over the prior four years<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rather than \u201cmost efficiently managing] the funds she received\u201d; refinancing her home but inexplicably achieving a net saving of only approximately $10 per month; carrying a credit card balance at \u201chigh finance charges\u201d while retaining a savings account that the judge assumed \u201cyields a significantly lower rate of interest\u201d; allowing her adult daughter, Dayle, who worked and was capable of paying rent, to continue living with her rent-free<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ; and not being willing to rent a room in her house in order to obtain additional income and help defray expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The judge concluded that Nathan had suffered a substantial change in circumstances since 1993 and ordered his alimony obligation to Charlotte to be terminated as of July, 1999, after periodic $100 reductions. In addition to Charlotte\u2019s criticized improvidence in managing her assets and \u201callowing] herself to be dependent on Nathan for her support, despite the possibility that his support could end\u201d at any time upon his death, the judge\u2019s rationale rested upon her determination that \u201cNathan is already using his assets to support himself and his wife, Maureen . . . [and] should not be required to reduce his assets to zero by paying a support obligation he no longer has the ability to pay. . . . This is one of those unfortunate cases where both parties have needs, and there is simply not enough money to go around.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s subsequent motion to amend the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and judgment was denied without hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>Notwithstanding the breadth of discretion possessed by Probate Court judges when dealing with complaints for modification of alimony pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37, see <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981), the termination of Charlotte\u2019s alimony constituted, on this record, an abuse of that discretion and legal error. The judge failed to evaluate and balance, fairly and equitably \u2014 as was required \u2014 all of the circumstances relevant to the totality of the parties\u2019 situations, see <em>id. </em>at 370-373, 376, and to keep in mind \u201cthe fundamental purpose of alimony: to provide economic support to the dependent spouse.\u201d <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 623 (1986). See <em>Grubert </em>v. <em>Grubert, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 811 (1985) (even \u201cscrupulous and careful\u201d effort by the probate judge is inadequate if it failed \u201cadequately to take into account traditional alimony considerations and resulted in an inequitable award\u201d); <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 760 (1987) (modification decision must be based upon a balancing of all the financial and equitable factors); <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 570 (2001) (modification must be \u201cconsistent with common sense and justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u201cIt is apparent that [Charlotte] will not be able to satisfy her basic needs,\u201d <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, supra </em>at 761, as a result of the judge\u2019s termination of all alimony payments by Nathan, given hfer weekly expenses of over $620 (approximately $175 of which was for mortgage payments alone) with a meager weekly income of approximately $106 in Social Security benefits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>$20 of interest income.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the dependent spouse\u2019s \u201cneed for support and maintenance [is to be evaluated] in relationship to the respective financial circumstances of the parties . . . [and] grounded in the supporting spouse\u2019s ability to pay,\u201d <em>Gott-segen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, supra </em>at 624, th\u00e9 judge\u2019s analysis fell seriously short of the requisite full, fair and equitable consideration in several respects: by disparately treating Charlotte\u2019s and Nathan\u2019s financial situations; by ignoring assets available to Nathan for continued (if reduced) support of Charlotte; by overlooking the reality that Nathan\u2019s claim of impending impoverishment by virtue of having to pay anything at all to Charlotte rested upon his having incurred self-imposed, voluntarily assumed expenses with full knowledge of his legal obligation to support his former wife; and by failing to give any consideration to the feasibility of Nathan\u2019s providing a continued, if lesser, amount of support to Charlotte.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The judge\u2019s flawed rationale supporting her termination decision flowed in large part from her employment of a double standard in analyzing the parties\u2019 respective circumstances. A fundamental defect was her glossing over the fact that Nathan\u2019s move to West Palm Beach while retaining his Brookline condominium not only resulted in his maintaining two homes year-round, but also constituted a conversion of his investment assets into a non-liquid second home that effected both a size-able reduction of his investment assets and income and an increase (not a decrease, as he had represented in 1993) in his living expenses. Despite the financial imprudence of Nathan\u2019s conduct \u2014 which put him in the position of supporting <em>three </em>households \u2014 the judge entirely passed over it and reserved her adverse comments for Charlotte\u2019s not becoming more self-supporting by better management of her limited assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The judge particularly reproved Charlotte for not obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>(for reasons not appearing in the record) a better deal on the refinancing of her mortgage and for not having more profitably invested the $100,000 payment since 1993, but instead using much of it to pay various expenses (see note 6, <em>supra)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(none of which, however, the judge found to have been excessive, unreasonable, or inappropriate).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, the judge criticized Charlotte for having chosen to receive Social Security benefits at 62 rather than 65 (when a higher benefit would have been available) as an example of her failure to maximize her resources (although Nathan had in fact done likewise). The judge chided Charlotte for maintaining a credit card balance of $5,500 at unstated interest rates assumed to be significantly higher than the interest (also undisclosed) that she earned on her savings account, but said nothing about Nathan\u2019s having increased his credit card debt from zero to $23,600 since 1993 (carried at interest rates not made part of the record).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">A particularly noteworthy inconsistency can be seen in the judge\u2019s chastising Charlotte for not requiring her live-in adult daughter to pay rent and not taking in a boarder for additional income, yet ignoring the fact that Nathan never attempted to secure rental income for the eight months (approximating the normal academic year) his Brookline property stood vacant or for the four months his West Palm Beach condominium was empty. The judge thus one-sidedly applied the principle that \u201c[a] party has no right to waste an asset deliberately or ignore a feasible source of income . . . .\u201d <em>Pagar </em>v. <em>Pagar, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4 (1980). (A related incongruity can be seen in the judge\u2019s approving observation that Nathan, who had managed his affairs so as to be able to live in Florida during the winter and New England during the summer, \u201csaved money\u201d because he \u201ctakes no vacation,\u201d one of several cost-saving measures the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>judge lauded Nathan for achieving, without mention of any of the sacrifices and privations Charlotte had presumably experienced in maintaining her \u201cspartan\u201d and \u201cfrugal lifestyle.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">An even more significant deficiency in the judge\u2019s evaluation was her failure to consider the extent to which Nathan\u2019s two properties could be utilized in reckoning his support obligation. Capital assets should be used to evaluate a supporting spouse\u2019s ability to pay alimony in a modification proceeding. See <em>Krokyn </em>v. <em>Krokyn, </em>378 Mass. 206, 213-216 (1979); <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. at 375-376; <em>Pagar </em>v. <em>Pagar, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 8; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 51, 53 (1997). \u201cCommon sense and basic concepts of fairness support the notion that ownership of a valuable asset demonstrates ability to pay without further inquiry as to whether payment can be enforced directly against the asset. . . . The law does not require that an obligor be allowed to enjoy an asset \u2014 such as a valuable home or the beneficial interest in a spendthrift trust \u2014 while he neglects to provide for those persons whom he is legally required to support.\u201d <em>Krokyn </em>v. <em>Krokyn, supra </em>at 213-214.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, the judge did not consider the income, potential income, or assets of Nathan\u2019s second spouse in assessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Nathan\u2019s overall financial capability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Bak </em>v. <em>Bak, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 623 (1987); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra </em>at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The judge\u2019s conclusions that Nathan will \u201cbe required to reduce his assets to zero\u201d within four years and \u201cno longer has the ability to pay\u201d any support obligation were unsupported and manifestly erroneous in light of the facts of record and applicable legal principles. So was her effective determination that Charlotte \u201ccould maintain herself without [any] assistance from the [former] husband.\u201d <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 758 (1990). Such a view was not only dismissive of the penury into which Charlotte was being thrust, contrary to public policy (see note 9, <em>supra), </em>but also disregarded the fact that, to a significant extent, the \u201climits on [Nathan\u2019s] ability to provide [continued] support to [Charlotte] are self-imposed . . . [and reflect] an obligor\u2019s ability to manipulate his resources to avoid his legal obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759. Cf. <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. at 372 (an obligor\u2019s personal aspirations \u201cmust be balanced against his obligations to support his former [as well as] present families\u201d); <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 874, 875 (1981) (the fact that an obligor whose income had diminished chooses to use his assets to satisfy other creditors rather than pay alimony is no defense to a contempt action for failure to pay).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The judge\u2019s rationale for termination appears to have sympathetically heeded Nathan\u2019s plaintive protests of hardship.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It neglected, however, the following mandates: that the abrupt termination of otherwise unconditional and indefinite alimony<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> demands \u201cclear and adequate explanation,\u201d <em>Bowring </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>399 Mass. 265, 268 (1987); and that an arbitrary limitation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the duration of an alimony obligation to a spouse whose needs are current and predictable is unwarranted when based on an assumption of future events, the occurrence of which is uncertain or unpredictable. See <em>Goldman </em>v. Goldman, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 612-613 (1990); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922-923 (1990); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 80-81 (2000). The judge erroneously accepted the underlying premise of Nathan\u2019s effort to end his support of Charlotte, viz., his right to prefer his second family over his first (see note 15, <em>supra). </em>To the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cWe do not believe that the [former husband] ought to be permitted to shift to the public the obligation he assumed when he married [his first wife]. It may be that because of his second marriage he will suffer some financial hardship, but the short answer to that is that he must have entered into the second marriage conscious of his obligations to his former wife so that the second marriage with its attendant obligations affords him no relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\"><em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>325 Mass. 573, 578 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Of course, a support provider does not \u201chave to deplete his total liquid or other assets in an effort to meet his support obligations.\u201d <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. at 375. Nathan\u2019s ability to pay, when considered in the context of the entirety of the parties\u2019 respective financial situations and upon an evenhanded balancing of the equities, may well have become sufficiently straitened to warrant some, perhaps a substantial, lessening of his alimony obligation. We now simply hold that when, at the time of the hearing on the complaint for modification, the evidence established the existence of valuable and potentially income-generating assets that were available to Nathan to pay some level of support without in fact impoverishing him, as well as the likely reduction of Charlotte to poverty, if not destitution, in the absence of any alimony, the termination of Nathan\u2019s alimony obligation without appropriate consideration of all the relevant circumstances constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment on the 1997 complaint for modification and remand this case to the Probate and Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The order of alimony established by the 1993 modification judgment is reinstated as of the date of this opinion and is to stand until revision by a probate judge, who shall take into account, inter alla, whether any retroactive amounts shall be due. Neither party is to have the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Nathan\u2019s 1993 prediction of destitution within a decade was found to be speculative and exaggerated.

Satisfaction of obligations to Charlotte totaled $26,208 per year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b501-5\">She observed: \u201cHe uses coupons to save money at the supermarket, dines out infrequently ... no longer attends sporting events or the theater.\u201d She also took special note of the fact that he \u201ctakes no vacation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The expenditures were her attorney\u2019s fees, taxes, part of her mother\u2019s funeral expenses, an $8,500 automobile, window replacement in her home, and credit card payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\">What Dayle did and how much she earned were not put into the record. The judge did find that Dayle had helped pay for certain home improvements, including new kitchen wallpaper, a new boiler, a new refrigerator, and a new television set, and that she \u201c\u00bfso leaves money for groceries.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The judge also dismissed a complaint for contempt Charlotte had brought in response to Nathan\u2019s second complaint for modification, arising out of Nathan\u2019s failure to have paid two months of medical insurance premiums and alimony arrearages in the amount of $2,700. Nathan had, however, fully paid these amounts by the date of the modification hearing, and the judge credited his testimony that his failure to pay had been caused by temporary delays in his receipt of interest income and, therefore, had not been wilful. The judge also denied Charlotte\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees in connection with the contempt proceeding. Charlotte has also appealed those rulings, but we discern no abuse of discretion or other error of law and consequently affirm them. See G. L. c. 215, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34\u00c1; <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 900 (1979); <em>Giannetti </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 960, 961 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Charlotte\u2019s weekly income would provide her with an approximate gross annual income of $6,552, which placed her well below the poverty level of $8,240 for a single person in 1999, when her payments were ordered to cease (see Annual Update of the Health &amp; Human Services Poverty Guidelines, 64 Fed. Reg. 13,428 [1999], of which we take judicial notice), raising the undesirable prospect of her becoming a public charge \u2014 a result to be avoided as a matter of public policy. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>325 Mass. 573, 578 (1950); <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 437 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In 1993, the judge had recognized that Charlotte would be using a size-able portion of that payment to pay off existing liabilities (see discussion, <em>supra </em>at 474). At no point did the judge indicate how Charlotte should have \u201cmost efficiently manage[d] the funds she received,\u201d except to charge, unspecifically, that Charlotte\u2019s expenditures reflected \u201clittle planning.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The judge said nothing about Nathan\u2019s undocumented use of the $3,000 \u201cclothing allowance\u201d or the $5,000 in \u201cconsultant\u201d fees he had received from his former employer through 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Nathan\u2019s fleeting statement in his appellate brief that his property interests cannot be sold without the approval of his current wife is both factually and legally unsupported, as well as irrelevant under the authorities cited above. The judge\u2019s findings and Nathan\u2019s financial statements state merely that Nathan has a \u201cVz interest\u201d or \u201c50% share\u201d in the equity of each property. To the extent Nathan attempts to make a legal point in his favor, it constitutes inadequate appellate argument we need not address. Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Nonetheless, since Nathan owned the Brookline property, the more valuable of the two, before his remarriage, for alimony purposes \u201c[i]t would be manifestly unfair to permit him to hide behind ... his [presumed] transfer of [some interest in] the home into [his second wife\u2019s] name, to evade his [alimony] obligation to [his first wife] . . . [by such a] self-imposed [encumbrance].\u201d <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra </em>at 55. Moreover, even if Nathan and his second wife held the property as tenants by the entirety \u2014 which may be the unarticulated basis for the statement \u2014 it would not avail him; the assets, both in Massachusetts and Florida, should still be taken into consideration. <em>Krokyn </em>v. <em>Krokyn, supra </em>at 210-214. See <em>Shwachman </em>v. <em>Meagher, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 428, 430-432 &amp; n.4 (1998) (either spouse can convey or encumber his or her interest in a tenancy by the entirety created after February 11, 1980, without the other\u2019s consent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The judge\u2019s findings are silent as to the second wife\u2019s age, health status, educational background, job experience, and employment or income potential at any time relevant to these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Nathan testified, \u201cI\u2019ve had stress in my life every day thinking about the monies I have for the future, and I want some finality to this. ... I can\u2019t afford it health wise, or financial wise. ... I want some finality to it. I\u2019ve worked for forty-five years. I deserve some consideration, and my [current] wife deserves some consideration as well.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\">As noted above, the original judgment reflected no expectation or intention that Nathan\u2019s alimony obligation was to end short of his death or clearly established inability to pay.
