That policy provided the maximum amount of liquor liability coverage \u2014 $500,000 per claimant/$l million per occurrence \u2014 and insured QMC\u2019s Aquarius Lounge located in Quincy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">After substantial dram shop claims had been made against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>that policy, the LLJUA commenced this action against QMC, claiming QMC was not qualified to obtain $500,000/$ 1 million coverage because it did not have an equivalent amount of general liability insurance for the insured premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As stated in the LLJUA application form, this was a condition to obtain insurance coverage above the $100,000/$200,000 minimum limits from the LLJUA. QMC and its insurance broker, AIM Insurance Agency, Inc. (AIM), had jointly prepared the application form in requesting insurance from the LLJUA. By im-pleader, AIM found itself on the receiving end of claims by the LLJUA alleging misrepresentation and a violation of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">After a jury-waived trial, a Superior Court judge made detailed findings of fact and concluded that AIM had neither made any false statement nor acted in violation of c. 93A. We affirm the Superior Court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">1. Background.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The LLJUA was created by St. 1985, c. 223, to provide liquor liability insurance to sellers and distributors of alcohol who are unable to purchase insurance in the open market. See <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 316, 318 &amp; n.1 (1995); <em>Bolden </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor Caf\u00e9 of Worcester, Inc., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 57 n.3 (2000). An LLJUA policy guards only against the specific risk of an insured\u2019s negligent distribution, sale or service of alcohol,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and such coverage shall not \u201cexceed five hundred thousand dollars for each claimant under one policy and one million dollars for all claimants under one policy in any one cause of action.\u201d St. 1985, c. 223, \u00a7 3. See <em>Jimmy\u2019s Diner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass., </em>410 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>61, 64 (1991). Applicants for LLJUA insurance are required to complete its application form.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">a. <em>Application. </em>Aspects of the LLJUA\u2019s application pertinent to this dispute are as follows. On the second page of the application form, \u00a7 3.B (\u201cPolicy Limits Requested\u201d) expressly provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cYou [i.e., applicant] may not purchase liquor liability insurance from the [LLJUA] with policy limits greater than your general liability limits (including applicable umbrella and excess coverage) for the premises sought to be insured, except that if your general liability policy limits fall below or between the limits offered by the [LLJUA], you may purchase the next highest liquor liability limits (i.e., if you have $200,000 per person/ $400,000 per occurrence general liability limits, you may purchase $250,000/$500,000 liquor liability limits; if you have no general liability coverage or less than $100,000/ $200,000 per occurrence, you may still purchase the $100,000/$200,000 liquor liability limits.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">An applicant may identify the limits of its general liability insurance by answering question 3.B.I., which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">\u201cState the general liability insurance limits of coverage for the premises sought to be insured, including umbrella and excess liability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">\u201c$_per person $_per occurrence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">\u201c$_aggregate $_umbrella or excess\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Here, QMC\u2019s application, as submitted by AIM, did not furnish any response whatsoever to question 3.B.1; it was simply left blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">QMC and AIM furnished a binder<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for a general liability insurance policy that had been issued to QMC. The binder, which consists of a single page, disclosed that the general liability policy had been written by \u201cUnited National Company\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>(United) with a liability limit of $1 million, and that the \u201cinsured\u201d was \u201cQuincy Bay Inn DBA, Quincy House Corp., Quincy Motel Corp., Aquarius Lounge, Emerald City Realty Trust, 29 Hancock Street, Quincy, MA 02171.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In a section titled \u201cSpecial Conditions/Restrictions/Other Coverages,\u201d the binder provides (in block type) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cLIMIT OF LIABILITY \u2014 $1,000,000. CSL \u2014 OWNERS, LANDLORDS AND TENANTS 1973 OCCURRENCE FORM \u2014 DEDUCTIBLE $5,000. <em>EXCLUDE </em>\u2014 ASBESTOS, POLLUTION, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ANIMALS, WATER DAMAGE, LEAD PAINT POISON, ASSAULT AND BATTERY, SEXUAL ASSAULT, <em>LOUNGE &amp; NIGHTCLUB.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cWARRANT CERTIFICATES OF INSURANCE FOR RESTAURANT $500,000. PREMIUM \u2014 $32,500.00 \u2014 TERM \u2014 12/10/88 \u2014 12/10/89.\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">There was affixed to the binder a handwritten notation: \u201cGENERAL LIABILITY BINDER FOR THE CURRENT YEAR.\u201d (It is not disputed that the binder accurately reflected the terms of the general liability insurance policy issued by United to QMC.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The premium calculation performed by AIM was based on a rate applicable only to a policy with $500,000/$ 1 million coverage. The LLJUA was free to change the premium if it determined the applicant did not qualify for the requested coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The AIM employee who assisted in the preparation of QMC\u2019s application was Jacqueline Coumoyer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Significantly, the judge found that neither Coumoyer, nor any other AIM employee, had looked into QMC\u2019s general liability coverage prior to submitting the application to the LLJUA. That application was received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>by the LLJUA in January of 1989. Its servicing carrier, Alexsis, Inc. (Alexsis), was the entity responsible for verifying information contained in the application or documents submitted therewith. Underwriting guidelines or standards, established by the LLJUA, were in place for Alexsis to follow in the process of reviewing applications for insurance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">b. <em>LLJUA\u2019s underwriting guidelines and issuance of policy. </em>As was described by LLJUA\u2019s executive director, Charles Bucke, in his trial testimony, the guidelines direct the servicing carrier to verify the information contained on an application, to confirm that requested limits of liability correspond with the general liability limits that the risk carries. The guidelines also direct the servicing carrier to contact an agent or broker in the event that an application had not been completed correctly or was lacking information; and, if there were \u201cmajor\u201d omissions, the servicing carrier was authorized to decline coverage and return the application to the applicant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Here, it is undisputed that no one, on behalf of Alexsis or the LLJUA, made any inquiry at all of AIM prior to the issuance of the 1989 policy to QMC. The Alexsis employee responsible for reviewing the QMC application for completeness did not notice either the omission of general liability limits, as asked by question 3.B.1, or the exclusion of the lounge and nightclub on the binder for the general liability insurance. That employee made a decision to process QMC\u2019s application with the information that had been provided, without making inquiry, and, as the judge found, \u201cprobably without even reading the binder because of her work load and lack of support.\u201d The judge also found that had the Alexsis employee \u201cread the binder at the time . . . she would not have relied upon it to write the requested limits.\u201d The \u201cmistake\u201d in issuing a $500,000/$! million liquor liability policy was apparently discovered by the LLJUA only after claims had been made against QMC by representatives of two minors who died in an automobile crash after having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>served alcohol at the Aquarius Lounge. The LLJUA settled those claims, one of which had been reduced to a judgment, without prejudice to its right to seek recovery from QMC (or AIM) for the loss it had sustained by having to pay monies above and beyond the minimum $ 100,000/$200,000 policy limit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">2. <em>Misrepresentation. </em>There was ample evidence for the judge to find that the binder accurately described the terms of the underlying general liability insurance policy, and that Alexsis, in processing QMC\u2019s application, had failed to notice the binder\u2019s reference to the exclusion of the nightclub and lounge. This is the crux of the case. Though it might be said, as the LLJUA did allege, that AIM impliedly represented that QMC was qualified for the maximum coverage, such a view of the evidence is contrary to the judge\u2019s express findings, which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201cThere was no testimony or exhibits [sic] offered by the LLJUA to warrant a finding that Jackie Cournoyer, or anyone else at AIM, made that misrepresentation. The only evidence of what Quincy Motel represented the coverage to be in its application is in the binder Quincy Motel provided. That binder makes no such statement. It states that the nightclub and lounge are excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Since the judge reached this conclusion based on trial testimony and the documentary evidence presented, we cannot say, with any firm conviction, she was mistaken.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>That a statement may be confusing does not render it a misrepresentation.. This is not to say that AIM could \u201cpurposefully shut [its] eyes to means of information within [its] own possession and control,\u201d so as to have only that \u201cknowledge \u2018which [it] cares to have.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 322 (1981), quoting from <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Newburyport &amp; Ames-bury Horse R.R., </em>141 Mass. 496, 498-499 (1886).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The present case is unlike <em>St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Feingold &amp; Feingold Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>427 Mass. 372 (1998), where an independent insurance broker, acting on behalf of an insured, was held liable, on theories of misrepresentation and violation of c. 93A, for placing material misinformation on an insurance application. There, a jury had found that the broker knowingly made false representations of a factual nature to the insurer, with the intention or expectation that the insurer would rely on the representations. <em>Id. </em>at 374. Based on the jury\u2019s findings, the court ruled it was appropriate to impose liability on the broker, who \u201cknew, or reasonably should have known, that disclosure of the truth would have led the insurer to reject the application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Our review of the record satisfies us that the trial judge properly ruled the LLJUA\u2019s evidence to be insufficient to show any misrepresentation by AIM. Even if we were to agree that the binder was ambiguous or confusing, the judge was not required to accept that premise. In the end, it was the responsibility of the LLJUA to verify that an applicant\u2019s coverage request was in line with existing general liability insurance coverage for the subject premises.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In short, the LLJUA did not establish a misrepresentation, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Leeds, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 54, 57 (1997)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 186,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> within the text of QMC\u2019s application for insurance. The law in this area is well-settled. See <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Hudson River Fire Ins. Co., </em>12 Cush. 416, 425 (1853) (defining \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d and \u201cconcealment\u201d in the insurance context); <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. </em>v. <em>Vella, </em>366 Mass. 651, 654-655 (1975). It cannot be fairly said that any speech on the part of AIM hobbled the LLJUA\u2019s ability to perform its underwriting functions. Compare <em>Lennon </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>339 Mass. 37, 40-41 (1959) (applicant\u2019s misrepresentation of the absence of cancer, although innocent, was compounded by his failure to report a subsequent operation to the insurer that did increase the risk of loss); <em>banco </em>v. Tawra-ton 5Wv. <em>Bank, </em>385 Mass. 1, 9 (1982) (implied representation by bank to loan applicants that a plot plan disclosed no irregularities). Here, the combined whole of QMC\u2019s application with the copy of the binder did disclose the truth, i.e., that there was in fact no general liability insurance policy in place for the Aquarius Lounge. Since the truth was disclosed, there can be no actionable silence. Contrast, in a different context, <em>Yorke </em>v. <em>Taylor, 332 </em>Mass. 368, 373 (1955); <em>Urman </em>v. <em>South Boston Sav. Bank, </em>424 Mass. 165, 168 (1997). As the judge implicitly found, the record does not warrant a finding that AIM had uttered a half truth or a partial disclosure of the kind for which liability can be imposed. See <em>Kannavos </em>v. <em>Annino, </em>356 Mass. 42, 48-49 (1969); <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Ratcliffe, </em>356 Mass. 560, 562 (1969); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300 (2000); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 551(2)(b) (1977). The LLJUA (and its servicing carrier, Alexsis) had an opportunity, and the responsibility, to inquire of AIM (or QMC) respecting the information in the binder. Choosing not to do so, and, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>parently, failing even to read the binder itself, the LLJUA cannot now complain it was misled by the binder\u2019s terms. Compare <em>Gishen </em>v. <em>Dura Corp., </em>362 Mass. 177, 179 (1972) (\u201crequest for clarification\u201d by plaintiff as to commission computation made it incumbent upon defendant to disclose all material facts), with <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 311 (1983) (buyer did not avail himself of opportunity to inquire, and, thus, seller\u2019s silence was not actionable). At worst, the binder required some care in reading its terms; on no account, however, can it be said that the binder contained a falsehood, or a half truth, which standing uncorrected by a fuller disclosure, warranted the imposition of liability. Accordingly, dismissal of the LLJUA\u2019s misrepresentation claim was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">3. <em>G.L. c. 93A. </em>The judge correctly ruled that the LLJUA had not proved a violation of c. 93A. The reasons supporting the trial judge\u2019s (and our) conclusion that AIM was not liable in tort for misrepresentation apply with equal force to the LLJUA\u2019s claim made under c. 93A.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">4. <em>Requests for costs. </em>AIM\u2019s request for double costs and damages pursuant to Mass.RA.P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 (1979), is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> Among its other allegations, the LLJUA asserted that QMC had knowingly misrepresented its general liability coverage in the application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Those claims, in essence, reduced to whether AIM had represented, expressly or impliedly, to the LLJUA that there was in place, in 1989, general liability insurance coverage (with a $1 million limit) on the Aquarius Lounge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Though they stipulated to many of the underlying material facts, the parties diverged sharply as to the conclusions to be drawn from those facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\">\u201cIt is a specific risk policy, designed by the Legislature to provide such establishments with coverage against liability imposed because alcohol was negligently given to an individual with resulting injury for which damages are sought.\u201d <em>Jimmy\u2019s Diner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Liab.

On QMC\u2019s behalf, Kenan Nacar, a company vice-president, also signed the application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Although it figures prominently in the events at issue, Alexsis was not named as a party to this lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">There was evidence to the effect that it is common for an insurance agent or broker to field inquiries from either the LLJUA or other insurance company underwriters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In defense of those claims, the LLJUA initially took the position that it would only provide coverage of $100,000 per person and $200,000 per occurrence. The LLJUA subsequently changed course, reserving its rights, by paying monies in excess of the $100,000/$200,000 limits, which, in the end, totaled $550,000, the amount (exclusive of attorney\u2019s fees) that the LLJUA claimed as damages in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">The judge found the \u201conly \u2018statement\u2019 concerning general liability coverage was the general liability binder and that \u2018statement\u2019 was made only by Quincy Motel, not by AIM.\u201d The LLJUA says that AIM, not QMC, was the one who spoke. In the end, the proffered distinction is immaterial given the truth of the binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Similarly, the judge determined that the certification provision, immediately prior to the premium calculation, was connected solely to the applicant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>signs the application; her finding on this point, while debatable, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">\u201cStatements made in an application for insurance are in the nature of continuing representations and speak from the time the application is accepted or the policy is issued.\u201d Ayers v. <em>Massachusetts Blue Cross, Inc., </em>4 Mass.
