L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, against the defendant, Goal Systems International, Inc. (Goal), the judge allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Goal\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge also entered a conditional ruling allowing Goal\u2019s alternative motion for a new trial in the event that the judgment notwithstanding the verdict is set aside.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cTo test whether allowance of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was correct (Mass.R. Civ.R 50(b), [as amended, 428 Mass. 1402 (1998),]) we inquire whether, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, the jury could reasonably return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, i.e., whether from the evidence it was possible to draw enough reasonable inferences to make out the elements of the plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Horizon House Microwave, Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 89 (1987). The review of a judge\u2019s ruling on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict involves the same standard as a review of a motion for a directed verdict. See <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Edward O. Tabor, M.D., Inc., </em>387 Mass. 783, 785-786 (1982). Accordingly, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Waite. See <em>Barbosa </em>v. <em>Hopper Feeds, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 610, 613 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\"><em>Factual background. </em>After having been employed in the computer industry for almost thirty years, Waite, in late March of 1989, was hired by Essential Software, Inc. (Essential), to open and operate a sales office based in Boston for a new territory comprising the northeastern part of the United States and the eastern part of the Canada. Essential\u2019s principal sales product was a computer operating system generally appropriate for large businesses. James Garret was directly responsible for hiring Waite and supervising him until Essential was acquired by Goal in early February of 1990. Garret believed that Waite had done a satisfactory job throughout the time that he had supervised him, and, aware that Waite \u201chad to start from scratch,\u201d was \u201cdelighted\u201d with the amount of his sales during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>those ten months. Until its acquisition of Essential, Goal had specialized in selling a computer operating system geared toward smaller companies than those serviced by Essential. At the time it was acquired, Essential employed six salespersons, including Waite, in an \u201ceastern region\u201d that encompassed Waite\u2019s territory. At the same time, Goal had five sales representatives working in Waite\u2019s territory, four of whom had experience in selling the same operating system sold by Essential. Within a day or two of the effective date of acquiring Essential, Goal discharged three of the six Essential employees serving the eastern region, including Waite. Each of those discharged was over fifty years old and had produced lower dollar sales during the period between the time of Waite\u2019s hiring and December 31, 1989, than the three salespersons who were retained. At least one of the retained Essential salespersons and four of the five Goal sales representatives covering Waite\u2019s territory were well under fifty years of age at the time of the acquisition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Goal opened a Boston office in April, 1990, and shortly thereafter hired three persons, ages 30, 34, and 35. At least one of those persons was hired to sell the same type of operating systems as was previously sold by Waite.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><em>The trial framework. </em>This action was submitted to the jury under the three-stage order of proof recognized in <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 134-136, 138-139 (1976), and recently limited to questions of law and summary judgment analysis by <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>434 Mass. 493, 507-508 (2001)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u201cThe burden shifting rules involve questions of law more appropriately left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>to the trial judge to decide\u201d). See <em>Ventresco </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., ante </em>201, 209 (2002). As to the first stage, the parties stipulated to the first two elements of the prima facie case Waite was required to prove by agreeing that he was between the ages of 40 and 70 at the time Goal terminated his employment. In response to special questions, the jury essentially concluded that the last two elements had been established by finding that Waite had performed his job at an acceptable level before his termination and that he was replaced by \u201ca younger individual or individuals with qualifications similar to [his].\u201d With respect to the second and third stages of the formulation, the jury found that Goal had articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory \u201creason(s)\u201d for discharging Waite and that Waite had proved \u201cthat the reason offered by Goal. . . was not the real reason for. . . Waite\u2019s discharge.\u201d Additionally, the jury found that Goal\u2019s conduct had caused Waite to sustain damages, and proceeded to assess those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In a memorandum addressing Goal\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or alternatively for a new trial, the judge concluded that Waite did not meet his burden of proof with respect to pretext (the third stage) and allowed the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. In so doing, the judge indicated there was no need to examine the issues related to the prima facie stage of the case. She also determined that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that the case \u201cshould be presented at a new trial, if the judgment notwithstanding the verdict is set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The issues presented by Waite on appeal are whether he sustained his burdens of proof on pretext and replacement and whether a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">a. <em>Pretext. </em>In <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 139, the court indicated that a plaintiff could meet his burden of proving unlawful discrimination by establishing that \u201cthe [employer\u2019s] facially proper reasons given for its action against him were not the real reasons for that action.\u201d In <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 117 (2000), the court stated that proof of unlawful discrimination \u201cmay be ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>complished by showing that the reasons advanced by the employer for making the adverse decision are not true.\u201d In <em>Lip-chitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 506, the court noted that \u201cthe evidence suggested several reasons for [the employer\u2019s] decision . . . some of which the jury could have found credible, some of which the jury might have found not credible.\u201d The court went on to indicate that to meet her burden of unlawful discrimination, the plaintiff in that case \u201cwas not required to disprove every reason articulated by the defendant or suggested in the evidence. . . . She could meet her burden by persuading the fact finder that it was more likely than not that at least one reason was false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506-507. In concluding that the \u201cevidence does not meet Waite\u2019s burden of proof on pretext,\u201d the judge in this action did not have the benefit of these evolving interpretations of the pretext requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">To the extent that we can determine from the abbreviated record before us,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> evidence of Goal\u2019s reasons for discharging Waite was introduced through the deposition of Steven Murphy, a marketing manager for Goal; the testimony of Robert Williams, Goal\u2019s executive director of human resources and administrative services; a letter submitted by Williams to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination; and answers to interrogatories made by Williams on behalf of Goal. Williams, who did not become employed by Goal until after Waite was discharged, wrote in that letter that \u201cWaite was terminated . . . due to a duplication and redundancy of services being performed.\u201d In his answers to interrogatories, Williams added that a basis for terminating Waite was that he \u201chad a reputation for messy and incomplete paperwork.\u201d Murphy, in his deposition testimony, advanced many additional reasons for Waite\u2019s termination. Because Waite was discharged almost immediately upon Goal\u2019s acquisition of Essential, Murphy\u2019s reasons were drawn entirely from Waite\u2019s performance as an Essential employee, information obtained from Garret, and an assessment of Waite based upon claimed meetings with him prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>acquisition. Among the reasons articulated by Murphy were (1) that Waite \u201chad trouble coming up to speed\u201d; (2) Waite\u2019s use of \u201cright of cancellation\u201d clauses in his sales agreements which he described as \u201ctime bombs,\u201d and which he said were not used by the Essential salespeople who were retained by Goal; and (3) Waite\u2019s failure to communicate to him an understanding of how \u201ca successful salesperson did his job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Contrasting with Goal\u2019s articulated reasons was the testimony of Garret, who had been retained by Murphy for his \u201cgood advice,\u201d to the effect that he was satisfied with Waite\u2019s performance with Essential, that he was delighted with Waite\u2019s sales figures, that Waite\u2019s experience in selling was important to him, and that what he saw of Waite\u2019s paperwork \u201cwas okay.\u201d Garret also testified that the cancellation clause used by Waite in his agreements was quite common, and that he had not authorized Waite to use an agreement that had different terms than were used by the other salespeople. He further stated that when Murphy had consulted with him before the acquisition, Murphy was not particularly interested in finding out about any backgrounds of any salesperson. Also, Waite in his testimony denied ever meeting with Murphy or having any direct conversation with him before he was terminated. This evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, was sufficient to support a finding that at least one of the reasons advanced by Goal was false. Where the evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, that falsity alone would permit a jury to infer that Goal was covering up a discriminatory animus which was the determinative cause of Waite\u2019s discharge. See <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>434 Mass. at 501, 504, 506-507 (\u201cFrom such proof [that at least one reason was false] the fact finder could infer that [the employer\u2019s] discriminatory animus was the determinative cause of the adverse employment decision\u201d); <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">b. <em>Replacement by person with similar qualifications. </em>Although Murphy testified that, as of the date of Goal\u2019s acquisition of Essential, Goal had only three open sales positions in the eastern region that were filled by Essential\u2019s three highest performers who, along with Goal\u2019s sales people, assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Waite\u2019s responsibilities, the evidence in the case did not compel a jury determination that Waite had not been replaced. There was evidence that Goal had been contemplating other acquisitions at that time; that Goal had opened a Boston office only two months following the acquisition of Essential; and that shortly thereafter, Goal had hired a district manager and two sales persons to cover essentially the same territory for which Waite had been responsible, with one of the new hires working from Boston, Waite\u2019s former base. That evidence reasonably would support an inference that Waite had been replaced. Moreover, a jury could infer from the evidence of Waite\u2019s extensive experience and sales success, from Garret\u2019s choice of him to head the northeast district, and from the fact that Goal anticipated selling from the Boston office the same product as Waite had sold, that Waite was at least \u201csimilarly qualified\u201d with respect to one or more of the new hires who were between the ages of 30 and 35. See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 446 (1995) (plaintiff established fourth element of first stage with showing that after his termination, employer delegated his duties to employees who were under forty years of age).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that it was error to allow the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to enter the ensuing judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">c. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The judge\u2019s alternative and conditional order for a new trial was based upon her conclusion that \u201c[tjhere is no affirmative evidence ... to support the contention that Waite\u2019s discharge was the result of age discrimination.\u201d She opined that the verdict therefore was against the weight of the evidence. The standard for determining whether a new trial should be ordered is different from that applicable to a motion for a directed verdict or to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 59.3 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2002). When ruling on a motion for a new trial a judge is obliged to determine credibility and weigh conflicting evidence, <em>ibid., </em>and must consider the probative force of all the evidence. See <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>323 Mass. 56, 59-61 (1948). Our duty is to determine whether the judge abused her discretion in granting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>new trial. See <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, </em>404 Mass. 515, 520-521, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 894 (1989). The absence of a complete transcript (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>prevents us from considering all the evidence. Consequently, on the limited record, we discern no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s order for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">\n<em>Order allowing defendant\u2019s mo-for judgment notwithstanding the verdict vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\n<em>Conditional order for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The jury awarded the plaintiff $75,000 in lost earnings and $26,701 in punitive damages, plus attorney\u2019s fees.

L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, where there is no direct evidence of discrimination. In summary and in context, that formulation, in the first stage, imposes upon the employee a burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that (1) he is within a protected class of persons (over forty years of age) (G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 1[8] and 4[1B]); (2) he performed his job at an acceptable level; (3) he was terminated; and (4) his employer attempted to fill <em>his </em>position by hiring another individual with qualifications similar to his. In the second stage, the employer can rebut the presumption established in the first stage by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatoiy reason or reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>its employment decision. At the third stage, the employee must show that one or more of the reasons so advanced by the employer was false.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The parties did not provide us with a full transcript of the three-day trial.
