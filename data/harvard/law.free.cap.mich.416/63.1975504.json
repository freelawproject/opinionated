The prosecuting attorney petitioned the probate court for a waiver of jurisdiction to the circuit court in order to have the defendant prosecuted as an adult. In November of 1979 and January of 1980, the two-phase waiver hearing, as required by JCR 1969, 11.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was conducted and on February 15, 1980, the probate court entered its order waiving jurisdiction of the defendant to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court (Kalamazoo County).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On May 2, 1980, the defendant, who had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>represented by the same appointed counsel from the outset of the juvenile proceedings, moved for an order remanding the case to the district court for the purpose of holding a preliminary examination on the offenses charged. The circuit court denied the motion. The defendant then proceeded to trial and was found guilty of the offenses charged and was sentenced to life imprisonment on each charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">On September 12, 1980, the defendant moved for a new trial on the ground <em>inter alia </em>that he had been denied the right to a preliminary examination. It was not until May 11, 1981, that a hearing was held on this motion, at which time the circuit judge granted the motion, declaring that he based his decision upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Dunigan, </em>409 Mich 765; 298 NW2d 430 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In <em>Dunigan, </em>we held that when jurisdiction of a juvenile offender is waived to the circuit court, the defendant is entitled to a preliminary examination before he may be charged in a criminal information unless examination is waived by the defendant or he is a fugitive from justice. We recounted in <em>Dunigan </em>the statutory basis for entitlement to a preliminary examination in this state and observed that both the statute, MCL 767.42; MSA 28.982, and our opinion in <em>People v Duncan, </em>388 Mich 489; 201 NW2d 629 (1972), provide that no information charging a felony may be filed against <em>any </em>person unless he is first afforded the opportunity for a preliminary examination, and that such examination must be held unless the \"examination is waived by the defendant or unless defendant is a fugitive from justice\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>While acknowledging our decision in <em>Dunigan, supra, </em>the prosecuting attorney argues that <em>Duni-gan </em>announced a new rule of law and, since it was promulgated after the denial of the defendant\u2019s request for a preliminary examination in this case, it is not controlling of this case unless it is to be given retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Proceeding on that assumption, the prosecuting attorney\u2019s brief and oral argument were directed principally to an analysis of the familiar test for retroactivity of a new rule of law as first announced in <em>Linkletter v Walker, </em>381 US 618; 85 S Ct 1731; 14 L Ed 2d 601 (1965), and applied in Michigan in <em>People v Hampton, </em>384 Mich 669; 187 NW2d 404 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We think the prosecuting attorney\u2019s assumption that <em>Dunigan </em>announced a \"new rule of law\u201d has led him to misapprehend the real issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\"><em>Dunigan </em>neither announced a departure from clear precedent nor decided an issue of first im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. Thus, it is not a \"new rule of law\u201d and, as a result, no question of retroactive application arises. We find, therefore, that the circuit court correctly ordered a new trial because this juvenile defendant was not given the examination he timely demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Before any question of the retroactive application of an appellate decision arises, it must be clear that the decision announces a new principle of law. A rule of law is <em>new </em>for purposes of resolving the question of its retroactive application in the sense addressed in <em>Linkletter </em>and <em>Hampton </em>and asserted by the plaintiff, either when an established precedent is overruled or when an issue of first impression is decided which was not adumbrated by any earlier appellate decision. In <em>Chevron Oil Co v Huson, </em>404 US 97, 106; 92 S Ct 349; 30 L Ed 2d 296 (1971), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\"[T]he decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, * * * or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">There are two apparent bases for the prosecuting attorney\u2019s claim that <em>Dunigan </em>announced a new rule of law: 1) that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dunigan </em>effectively \"overruled\u201d the alleged widespread practice of not holding preliminary examinations in juvenile waiver cases, and 2) that our decision in <em>Dunigan </em>reversing the Court of Appeals determination that \"it was not mandatory that defendant be provided a preliminary examination in district court prior to arraignment\u201d amounted to an overruling of the \"old rule\u201d upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>which the trial court relied in denying the defendant\u2019s request for a preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The prosecutor argues, both expressly and by implication, that until our <em>Dunigan </em>decision there existed a widespread practice of denying a preliminary examination to juveniles whose cases were waived to the circuit court. That claim appears in the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\"This issue involves legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of this state because the practice of not holding a preliminary examination after a juvenile waiver hearing was widely followed prior to the decision of <em>Dunigan </em>in December of 1980. This issue should immediately be decided to avoid widespread confusion in the Michigan circuit courts and in the Michigan Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">And, in the prosecutor\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">\"If the <em>new </em>rule requiring a preliminary examination after a juvenile waiver hearing is given retroactive application, this will mean that many convicted juveniles will have to be retried or released. As in <em>[People v </em>Auer, 393 Mich 667; 227 NW2d 528 (1975)] this will require many new trials. Prosecutors will have the burden of putting together old evidence. Needless expenditures of labor, time and money will be used to retry already convicted felons. This will have an adverse impact on the criminal justice.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">We had not thought that any such widespread practice existed. Because the record before us contains no statistics on the matter, we are unable to verify the plaintiffs claim that denial of preliminary examination to juveniles, jurisdiction of whom has been waived to the circuit court, was a practice \"widely followed\u201d prior to <em>Dunigan. </em>In point of fact, the \"practice\u201d may have been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>fined to Kalamazoo County. Both <em>Dunigan </em>and this case are appeals from the refusal of the Kalamazoo Circuit Court to grant requested preliminary examinations in juvenile waiver cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Upon close questioning of the assistant prosecuting attorney by this Court during oral argument, it was made to appear that the prosecutor\u2019s claim of an established \"widespread\u201d practice of denying preliminary examinations in cases such as this is unsupportable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>Okay. Now had it been the practice before <em>Dunigan </em>to hold preliminary examination in waiver cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\"><em>\"Mr. Christopherson [Assistant Prosecuting Attorney]: </em>I believe <em>Dunigan </em>was the first case which really dealt with this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>I know, but had it been the practice in Kalamazoo County to hold preliminary examinations in waiver cases; did you stop doing it when you heard that <em>Dunigan </em>came down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">\"Mr. <em>Christopherson: </em>Well first of all, there are very few waiver cases that come through, and I don\u2019t believe it was a practice, no, preliminary examinations were given. <em>Dunigan </em>was perhaps a <em>test case. </em>And between\u2014 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>There were preliminary examinations in waiver cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">\"Mr. <em>Christopherson: </em>I can\u2019t cite you to specific cases and say there were or weren\u2019t, were or were not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>You don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">\"Mr. <em>Christopherson: </em>No. And as far as I know, between the time that <em>Dunigan </em>came down, between the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court decisions, Vincent Phillips is the only waiver case we had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-14\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>So there wasn\u2019t \u2014 before <em>Dunigan </em>was decided by the Court of Appeals, the practice in Kalamazoo County was that the circuit judge had ruled that it wasn\u2019t necessary to hold preliminary examinations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>\"Mr. Christopherson: </em>That\u2019s right, in <em>Phillips </em>we were going to follow that circuit judge\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\"><em>\"Mr. Christopherson: </em>In <em>Phillips </em>we were going to follow that circuit judge\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>And <em>Dunigan </em>was also a Kalamazoo case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\"><em>\"Mr. Christopherson: </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>Another circuit judge in Kalamazoo County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\"><em>\"Mr. Christopherson: </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>And you don\u2019t know what the practice is in other counties as far as preliminary examinations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">\"Mr. <em>Chiistopherson: </em>I can\u2019t testify to that, no, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\"><em>\"Justice Levin: </em>You just don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-14\">\"Mr. <em>Christopherson: </em>I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s correct.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">While there are no properly cognizable facts before us indicating whether a preliminary examination is generally accorded juvenile defendants after waiver in this state, it is clear that there is no evidence to the contrary and that the assistant prosecuting attorney in this case apparently knows of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">Even if it were the practice to deny the opportunity for a preliminary examination in cases such as this, the practice would be wholly without legal justification and directly contrary to the command of the Legislature and the 1972 pronouncement of this Court in <em>Duncan, </em>supra._</p>\n<p id=\"b122-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>MCL 767.42; MSA 28.982, as amended by 1974 PA 63, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\">\"(1) An information shall not be filed against <em>any </em>person for a felony until such person has had a preliminary examination therefor, as provided by law, before an examining magistrate, unless that person waives his statutory right to an examination. If any person waives his statutory right to a preliminary examination without having had the benefit of counsel at the time and place of the waiver, upon proper and timely application by the person or his counsel, before trial or plea of guilty, the court having jurisdiction of the cause, in its discretion, may remand the case to a magistrate for a preliminary examination.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">This broad statutory mandate has existed since 1859,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to our knowledge, before the <em>Dunigan </em>\"test case\u201d, no expression from any member of this Court has ever suggested that there existed an exception for juvenile waiver cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In <em>People v Duncan, </em>388 Mich 489, 502; 201 NW2d 629 (1972), a case involving a question whether a defendant charged under a grand jury indictment was entitled to a preliminary examination, this Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">\"We hold that in each case, and in all pending cases in which the right to a preliminary examination was asserted prior to trial and is presently being asserted, such right shall be accorded to the defendant. In all future cases wherein a defendant is accused of a felony, the right to a preliminary examination shall exist.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">While <em>Duncan </em>was not concerned with providing a preliminary examination to a juvenile, it emphasized the historic statutory entitlement of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>person to a preliminary examination prior to the filing of a felony information and, in recognition of the importance of such a hearing, extended it to persons charged by a grand jury indictment, a class never before thought to be entitled to such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Given the history since 1859 of statutory entitlement to a preliminary examination for \"any person\u201d with respect to whom an information is to be filed, followed by this Court\u2019s extension of the right in <em>Duncan, </em>no matter how widespread the practice of denying an examination to juvenile defendants may have been, it is an illegal practice and is not the sort of \"clear precedent\u201d which should trigger a \"new rule\u201d retrospectivity analysis. Nor can the alleged practice be termed contrary to the resolution of \"an issue of first impression * * * not clearly foreshadowed\u201d. <em>Chevron, supra. </em>In light of the longstanding statutory right to a preliminary examination for all felony defendants prior to the filing of an information, and in light of the plain language of <em>Duncan, supra, </em>our holding in <em>Dunigan </em>can hardly be considered the resolution of an issue of first impression. Rather, in <em>Dunigan, </em>this Court simply applied the statute to the facts. But, even assuming <em>Dunigan </em>did decide an issue of first impression, when we said in <em>Dunigan, </em>at p 771, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\"[t]here is no express statutory exception to the requirement that an examination be held in cases where a defendant is subject to trial following a juvenile court waiver order. We discern no compelling reason to create such an exception by judicial fiat\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">we clearly did not decide a matter \"not clearly foreshadowed\u201d by <em>Duncan </em>and longstanding legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The second basis upon which the prosecutor rests his claim that we announced a \"new rule\u201d in <em>Dunigan </em>is the assertion that our decision in that case reversed the Court of Appeals \"precedent\u201d that there was no requirement for a preliminary examination in the case of a juvenile waived to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The \"old rule\u201d, the prosecutor argues, was the \"no examination\u201d pronouncement of the Court of Appeals in <em>Dunigan </em>on April 2, 1980. This Court\u2019s reversal of that decision on November 24, 1980, is said to announce a \"new rule\u201d. During that seven-month interval, according to the prosecutor, the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Dunigan </em>was binding precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Once again it appears that the prosecutor is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The prosecutor apparently misconceives the pre-cedential status of a Court of Appeals decision in which leave to appeal has been granted by this Court. A timely application for leave to appeal to this Court from a decision of the Court of Appeals effectively stays the Court of Appeals decision as a final adjudication, see <em>People v George, </em>399 Mich 638; 250 NW2d 491 (1977), and denies it preceden-tial force until denial of the application for leave to appeal in this Court or some other disposition of the case is announced. An <em>opinion </em>of the Court of Appeals is not its judgment. Its decision and judgment are made when the clerk of the Court of Appeals issues the Court\u2019s judgment order <em>and </em>sends notice thereof to counsel for each party under GCR 1963, 821.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">It is only after application for leave to appeal to this Court is denied, or dispositive action is taken effectively approving the Court of Appeals deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>sion, that it becomes a \"final adjudication\u201d of that Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In <em>Dunigan, </em>our order granting the defendant\u2019s timely application for leave to appeal, followed by our judgment reversing the Court of Appeals decision, precluded the Court of Appeals opinion from ever having precedential effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Our holding in <em>Dunigan </em>did not adopt a \"new\u201d rule in the <em>Chevron, supra, </em>sense. The right enforced in <em>Dunigan </em>has existed since 1859 and was reaffirmed and broadened by our announcement in <em>Duncan, supra, </em>in 1972, that <em>all </em>defendants accused of felonies are entitled to a preliminary examination. In <em>Dunigan </em>we simply refused to carve out an exception to the broad class of criminal defendants afforded a right to a preliminary examination under MCL 767.42; MSA 28.982. Just as juvenile defendant Dunigan was entitled, upon demand, to such an examination, so too is juvenile defendant Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The circuit court is affirmed in its judgment that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-8\">Fitzgerald, C.J., and Kavanagh, Williams, Levin, and Coleman, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b125-9\">Riley, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"> Juvenile Court Rule 1969,11.1(a) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">\".1 Hearing; Quantum of Proof; Criteria for Waiver.

We observed further, however, that the preliminary examination served other purposes as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">It is interesting to note that when, upon remand, defendant Duni-gan was finally afforded a preliminary examination, he was bound over for trial to the circuit court to stand trial for second-degree murder rather than first-degree murder, the offense with which he was originally charged and \"waived\u201d to circuit court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-17\"> Earlier, during oral argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-18\">\"And I have found from talking to other individuals, especially in Wayne County, that they have been giving preliminary examinations for a long time, and that when <em>Dunigan, </em>the Court of Appeals decision, came down, it rattled the chains all around Wayne County.
