The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction in an unpublished per curiam opinion, Judge Kaufman dissenting. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Defendant owned and operated a store in the City of Detroit. Defendant contacted an alleged arsonist and arranged to burn down a competitor\u2019s market which was located across the street from defendant\u2019s place of business. Unknown to defendant, the alleged arsonist was a police informant. Several telephone conversations between defendant and the informant were taped by police officers. Transcripts of these conversations were introduced at trial and admitted into evidence. This evidence showed that the defendant agreed to pay $1,000 for destruction of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The day before the fire was to occur, defendant directed his brother to telephone the informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and tell him to \"forget everything about the store\u201d. Defendant\u2019s brother contacted the informant as instructed. The informant agreed not to burn the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">At trial, defendant\u2019s counsel requested an instruction that withdrawal constituted a defense to the crime charged. The court denied this request and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is important that you keep in mind that the crime of inciting to burn real property is complete at the time the inciting, inducing or exhorting takes place. In other words, it is <em>unnecessary that any overt act be done </em>in furtherance of that which is incited, induced or exhorted. For example, in this case it is unnecessary to find that the market was actually ever burned or that any person or persons did any act as a result of the defendant\u2019s incitement, if any incitement actually occurred. * * * If <em>you \u00f1nd that such an incitement, inducement or exhortation to burn had been made, [that] there had been a withdrawal is of no consequence, it\u2019s net a defense of the act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The jury convicted defendant of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The Court of Appeals held that no overt act by the informant need be proved for conviction of inciting, inducing, or exhorting the burning of real property. However, the Court reversed defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that withdrawal was a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">We granted leave to appeal and cross-appeal to resolve three questions: Does MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) require proof of an overt act and that the third party was incited? Was it reversible error for the trial court to refuse to charge on attempt? Is withdrawal or abandonment a defense to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>charge of inducing, inciting, or exhorting another to unlawfully burn property under MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2)? 406 Mich 1012 (1979). We answer these questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Defendant argues that proof of an overt act by the person sought to be incited is a necessary element of the crime of inciting, inducing, or exhorting the burning of real property. It is our determination that no overt act by anyone other than the defendant is necessary to convict under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\"Any person who incites, induces or exhorts any other person to unlawfully burn any property, to murder, to kill, to wound or to commit an aggravated or felonious assault on any person or to do any act which would constitute a felony or circuit court misdemeanor, that may endanger or be likely to endanger the life of any person, or who aids and abets in any such inciting, inducing or exhorting shall be punished in the same manner as if he had committed the offense incited, induced or exhorted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The Court of Appeals, in upholding the constitutionality of MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2), wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">\"The three terms used in the statute to describe the prohibited conduct are given similar definitions by <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(2d ed) (Collins &amp; World Publishing Co, Inc, 1974).1 A fair reading of the definitions is that the terms 'incite, induce or exhort\u2019 are essentially synonymous, and refer to conduct intended to bring about action on the part of another person. <em>Cf. People v </em>O\u2019Neal, 22 Mich App 432; 177 NW2d 636 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\"We think that the statute as written sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>informs a potential defendant that he is to refrain from conduct calculated to cause another person to commit an offense described in the statute. MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) is not unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>People v Chapman, </em>80 Mich App 583, 586; 264 NW2d 69 (1978).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">\"1 Incite: 'to urge to action; stir up; rouse\u2019 (p 710). Induce: 'to lead on to some action * * *; prevail on; persuade\u2019 (p 718). Exhort: 'to urge earnestly by advice, warning, etc.\u2019 (p 491).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">This language speaks only to the conduct of the defendant. We agree with this focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">It is the defendant\u2019s inciting, inducing, or exhorting which constitutes the culpable conduct. We do not think the Legislature intended that conviction of a crime under this statute would depend on the incidental result of a third party\u2019s conduct, that is, an overt act or proof of actual incitement.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">This accords with the interpretation articulated in <em>People v Plyler, </em>104 Mich App 437; 304 NW2d 859 (1981), a factually dissimilar case in which the \"overt act\u201d argument was also raised. In holding that no overt act need be established for conviction under this same statute, the Court noted that the purpose of the statute is to punish persons who incite, induce, or exhort dangerous conduct. The Court affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction of inciting second-degree murder without proof of an overt act by a third party or proof of actual incitement.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">A criminal incitement under the statute is conduct by which a person urges another to commit a specified crime with the intent that such a crime result. It is the use of words in this particular manner which constitutes the criminal offense. Defendant, here, sought to have his competitor\u2019s store burned. At the point where the defendant successfully contacted the alleged arsonist for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>purpose of inducing his participation, the statutory crime was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Defendant argues that it was reversible error for the trial court to refuse to instruct on attempted inciting, inducing, or exhorting to burn real property. We conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The statute, as drawn, meets constitutional requirements; an attempt to commit the statutory crime would not. We feel it was the Legislature\u2019s goal to punish inciting, inducing, or exhorting dangerous conduct and not the attempt to commit this statutory crime. This legislative approach is consistent with constitutional considerations of overbreadth. To punish someone for attempting to incite, induce, or exhort a statutorily specified offense would be, perhaps, to punish unexpressed thoughts or otherwise non-culpable conduct. We do not believe that this is what the Legislature intended. Such a crime lacks the required element of imminence to be constitutionally permissible. <em>People v Chapman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The people contend that the trial court correctly ruled that withdrawal is not a defense to the charge of inciting, inducing, or exhorting to burn real property and that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing defendant\u2019s conviction on this ground. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Enactment of MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) bespeaks the Legislature\u2019s appreciation of the danger to society posed by inciting, inducing, or exhorting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>life-threatening crimes. In addition, completion of the statutory crime signifies the point at which control over the criminal act urged and intended effectively passes to a third party. The fortuitous circumstance of a third party\u2019s inaction, as here, does not render the inciting, inducing, or exhorting less dangerous. Thus, a defense of withdrawal would be inconsistent with the legislative determination of the conduct to be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the defendant\u2019s conviction is reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-5\">Williams and Coleman, JJ., concurred with Fitzgerald, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b174-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiA\">Shafou solicited a police informant to burn a competitor\u2019s store. On the day before the fire was to occur, Shafou\u2019s brother telephoned the police informant and told him not to burn the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Shafou was charged with and convicted of inciting, inducing, or exhorting the police informant to unlawfully burn in violation of \u00a7 157b of the Penal Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> added in 1968 after the civil disturbances in Detroit in 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>We were prompted to grant leave to appeal by the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing Shafou\u2019s conviction on the ground that withdrawal was a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The lead opinion would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the withdrawal issue and reinstate Shafou\u2019s conviction. That opinion agrees with the Court of Appeals in rejecting Shafou\u2019s argument that \"proof of an overt act by the person sought to be incited is a necessary element\u201d. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It would further hold that \"actual incitement\u201d need not be shown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\"A criminal incitement under the statute is conduct by which a person urges another to commit a specified crime with the intent that such a crime result. It is the use of words in this particular manner which constitutes the criminal offense. Defendant, here, sought to have his competitor\u2019s store burned. At the point where the defendant successfully contacted the alleged arsonist for the purpose of inducing his participation, the statutory crime was complete.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Justice Kavanagh would hold that \"actual incitement\u201d. is required; while the person solicited need not commit the solicited offense, there must be \"some overt act resulting in actual incitement of the other person\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since, in the instant case, the police informant was not actually incited, Shafou is guilty of attempted inciting, inducing, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>exhorting, and the judge erred in refusing to charge on attempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We would hold that \u00a7 157b does not subject a person to criminal responsibility for utterances which do not cause an offense to be committed. A person who does no more than utter words urging commission of an offense is subject to liability, as before, only for solicitation except where the urgings are with the intent of instituting or maintaining a riot in which case a companion statute, also enacted in 1968, is applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The lead opinion quotes from the per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals in the instant case which sets forth definitions of the words \"incite\u201d, \"induce\u201d, and \"exhort\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">It appears that while \"incite\u201d is sometimes used in the same sense as \"exhort\u201d, i.e., to urge, it is also used in the same sense as \"induce\u201d, an utterance which actually moves the listener to act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>To read the three words \"incite\u201d, \"induce\u201d, and \"exhort\u201d, as meaning \"to urge\u201d would be to deny a separate meaning to the word \"induce\u201d and to make \"incite\u201d superfluous, while to read the three words as meaning \"to move to action\u201d would be to deny a separate meaning to the word \"exhort\u201d* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, again, to make the word \"incite\u201d superfluous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Confronted with three words: \"incite\u201d, which means both to urge on and to move to action \u2014 the lead opinion speaks of \"actual incitement\u201d \u2014 and \"induce\u201d, which requires a cause and effect relationship (to move to action), and \"exhort\u201d (to urge or admonish, without any cause and effect relationship), an appellate court asks what the Legislature intended. Did it intend that persons be subject to liability for simply uttering words or that the listener be persuaded? And, if persuasion is required, is it further necessary that the listener in fact act in the manner requested?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We acknowledge that to require a cause and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>effect relationship is arguably to read \"exhort\u201d out of the statute. It will not do, however, to say that each word must be given meaning and that the three words are stated in the disjunctive. That argument cuts both ways. The construction of \u00a7 157b set forth in the lead opinion, that it is enough that the defendant urged without regard to whether the listener was persuaded or, following persuasion, acted, denies a separate meaning to \"induce\u201d and, again, also makes superfluous the separate meanings of \"incite\u201d, to \"stir up; rouse\u201d, \"to move to action\u201d, to \"stimulate or prompt to action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Confronted with a statute in which such an ambiguity inheres, courts generally look for the legislative intent or purpose, and ask which construction appears most reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The primary rule of construction is to give effect to the legislative intent. To do so, courts will construe \"or\u201d as meaning \"and\u201d and \"and\u201d as meaning \"or\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, \"penal statutes are to be strictly construed and any ambiguity is to be resolved in favor of lenity\u201d. <em>People v Gilbert, </em>414 Mich 191, 211; 324 NW2d 834 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The prosecutor has claimed that \u00a7 157b is a solicitation statute. The lead opinion by its construction agrees, although it draws back from so characterizing it in those words, possibly because the penalties provided are greater than for solicitation in any other state of the union. The enormous potential disparity between the penalties provided by \u00a7 157b and those in Michigan before the enactment of this statute and in other states strongly suggests that the rule of lenity should be invoked and that \u00a7 157b should not be construed to be a solicitation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The 1967 civil disturbance in Detroit prompted a review of the adequacy of the Penal Code provisions concerning riots and unlawful assemblies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Existing legislation did little more than impose obligations on officials to disperse unlawful assemblies and on the citizenry to disperse. Although part of the Penal Code, the legislation did not establish separate criminal penalties for unlawful assembly or rioting as such.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In 1968, existing legislation was repealed, and rioting and incitement to riot were made punishable by not more than ten years in prison. Unlawful assembly was made punishable by not more than five years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>It was in this context that the Legislature added \u00a7 157b:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">\"Any person who <em>incites, induces </em>or <em>exhorts </em>any other person to unlawfully burn any property, to murder, to kill, to wound or to commit an aggravated or felonious assault on any person or to do any act which would constitute a felony or circuit court misdemeanor, that may endanger or be likely to endanger the life of any person, or who aids and abets in any such inciting, inducing or exhorting shall be punished in the same manner as if he had committed the offense, incited, induced or exhorted\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">If not a solicitation statute, what then is it? It is, we believe, a special kind of accomplice statute. Under prior Michigan law, accomplices are and continue to be punishable in the same way as those who commit the offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Why then did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Legislature need to amend the statute? The answer to that question may explain why the Legislature did not stop at \"incite\u201d and \"induce\u201d and added \"exhort\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">After the civil disturbance, the Wayne County Prosecutor had the task of prosecuting persons who had been active in fomenting the civil disturbance. He may have concluded or found that he would not be able to successfully prosecute as accomplices persons who shouted \"burn, baby, burn\u201d or \"kill whitey\u201d or \"kill the blacks\u201d because of the generality of the speech. Arguably the message was too general to impose accomplice responsibility for the actions of those who listened. For accomplice liability more than speech was required. It was necessary to show a closer nexus between the speaker and a listener who burned or killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Section 157b was added so that in circumstances such as prevailed in Detroit in the 1967 civil disturbance (riot or unlawful assembly) a person who \"incited, induced or exhorted\u201d other persons to actually commit a life-endangering offense would be subject to criminal responsibility as an accomplice and, therefore, subject to the same penalty as the person who committed the offense without regard to whether there was any further nexus or concert of action between the speaker and the person who committed the offense. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>believe that the word \"exhort\u201d was added to make clear that the kind of cause and effect relationship generally required for accomplice liability was not required in the civil disturbance or riot situation. A general incitement, inducement, or exhortation which, in fact, resulted in the commission of life-endangering offenses would subject the offender to the severe penalties prescribed by \u00a7 157b.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Any other construction not only places Michigan beyond the pale in terms of the severity of penalty that can be imposed for solicitation, but is not consonant with the other legislation adopted at the time. The penalty for urging the commission of acts of unlawful force or violence in a riot is no more than ten years while under the construction in the lead opinion of \u00a7 157b the penalty for urging someone to commit a life-endangering felony <em>without the added danger of a riot </em>may be up to life imprisonment and even, it has been claimed, mandatory, non-parolable life imprisonment (where the offense solicited is murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We would not construe \u00a7 157b to be a solicitation statute but a special kind of accomplice statute designed to fill in the gap perceived following the 1967 riots in the reach of accomplice liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Complicity and solicitation are different. While the conduct in both cases can be similar \u2014 the encouragement of crime \u2014 the basis of responsibility and the appropriate punishment have traditionally been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">One who assists in the commission of a crime is an accomplice, and encouragement, at least in the context of an adequate nexus between the request and the act, has been considered sufficient assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tance to make one an accomplice.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accomplices generally are punished as severely as the principal, on the premise that when a crime has been committed, those who aid in its commission should be punished like the principal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the principal does not succeed in committing the crime, the accomplice, although he rendered the same aid, is an accomplice only to the attempt,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which carries a lighter penalty.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Encouragement, where it amounts to no more than asking or urging another to commit a crime, constitutes the common-law offense of solicitation, a misdemeanor at common law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Solicitation focuses solely on the conduct of the solicitor. Criminal responsibility does not depend upon subsequent events; it is unimportant whether the person solicited actually commits the crime, is incited to commit the crime but does not complete it, or is not influenced at all. Solicitation remains a common-law offense in this state, and the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 157b shows that it was not intended to cover solicitation. A simultaneously passed riot statute that in terms covers simple urgings to commit crime provides lower penalties for speeches intended to incite a riot.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Further, the history of \u00a7 157b indicates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Senate intended the act to apply when the solicited crime was committed, and the House appears to have acquiesced in the Senate bill on the understanding that the statute punished those encouraging commission of a crime when the crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The same day that \u00a7 157b was enacted, the Legislature enacted a revision of the riot statute making it unlawful for a person intending to cause or to aid or abet the institution or maintenance of a riot to do an act or engage in conduct that <em>\"urges </em>other persons to commit acts of unlawful force or violence, or the unlawful burning or destroying of property, or the unlawful interference with a police officer\u201d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The penalty under the riot act, for advocating the same crimes described in \u00a7 157b, is set at a maximum of ten years.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Section 157b allows a higher penalty, equal to the penalty for the violent crime \"incited, induced or exhorted\u201d. The lead opinion\u2019s construction of \u00a7 157b, in combination with the language of the riot act, would mean that the Legislature, in passing these two acts on the same day, decided that advocacy of violent crime requires a penalty equivalent to the penalty for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the crime called for, <em>unless </em>the advocacy was with intent to incite a riot, in which case a <em>lesser </em>penalty of only ten years is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Senate bill that became \u00a7 157b was, throughout the enactment process, addressed to accomplices \u2014 those successfully encouraging another to commit violent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Three bills that dealt with encouragement of crime were introduced in the Senate within 11 days of each other in 1968. Essentially the same group of senators sponsored each of the three bills.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Senate Bill No. 846, which became the riot act already discussed, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">\"Sec. 2. It is unlawful and constitutes incitement to riot for a person or persons, intending to cause a riot or unlawful mob violence, to do an act or engage in conduct that urges other persons to commit acts of unlawful force or violence, or the unlawful burning or destroying of property, or the unlawful interference with a police officer, peace officer or fireman in the lawful performance of his duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>* * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\"Sec. 4.

Following this amendment, the bill\u2019s penalty provision read \"imprisonment in the state prison for life or any term of years\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">The Senate adopted two floor amendments, both proposed by Senator Fleming, who was a sponsor of the bill. First, the clause \"to do any act which would constitute a felony or circuit court misdemeanor that may endanger or be likely to endanger the life <em>or property </em>of any person\u201d (emphasis supplied) was amended to delete \"or property\u201d. The second amendment was to make the penalty equal to that for the crime incited, induced, or exhorted.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The penalty in Senate Bill No. 928 was similarly amended four days later.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">When the bills reached the House, a substitute bill was passed. The House substitute was addressed to solicitations \u2014 encouragements to commit a crime regardless of whether the crime was in fact committed. The penalties were considerably lower than those in the Senate. One who urged another to commit first-degree murder could be imprisoned for as long as 20 years; one who urged another to commit a crime punishable by 5 years to life in prison could be imprisoned for as long as 5 years; and one who urged commission of a lesser crime was guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable for as long as 2 years in prison.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The Senate did not agree to the House bill.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The conference committee recommended passage of the Senate version,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and both houses agreed.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Senate\u2019s objection to the House bill appears to have been that it was a solicitation statute and did not provide adequately for what the Senate bill covered, successful encouragements to commit crime. The apparent agreement of the conference committee was to adopt a bill imposing accomplice responsibility for successful encouragements to commit crime.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Section 157b appears to have been intended to resolve a problem of establishing accomplice liability that arose following the 1967 civil disturbances in Detroit. Some persons had contributed to the disturbances by making speeches urging violence and disorder, including arson and other dangerous crimes. Although these speakers may have been responsible for crimes inspired by their speeches, a prosecutor would have difficulty in specifying the crime the speaker had committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Successful prosecution of such a speaker as an accomplice to the crimes he encouraged may have been doubtful. An accomplice must have the <em>mens rea </em>requisite to the commission of the crime itself. One who had merely encouraged arson in general, to no specific person and with no specific property in mind, might not be considered by a judge or a jury to have the <em>mens rea </em>necessary to be found an accomplice to a particular act of arson. The prosecutor may have been reluctant to charge speakers as accomplices. He could prosecute them for the common-law offenses of solicitation and incitement to riot, which carry a maximum penalty of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Senate Bill No. 846, which became the riot act, codified the common-law crimes of riot and incitement to riot, and increased the maximum penalties to ten years. Senate.Bills Nos. 927 and 928 were also addressed to the speechmakers. In pass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ing \u00a7 157b, the Legislature did not intend to punish speakers for urging criminal conduct \u2014 the riot act dealt with that problem \u2014 but instead provided a means to hold speakers in a riot responsible for the crimes which their oratory brought about.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"azn-dedup-0\">One could nevertheless argue that the statutory language seems to cover both complicity and solicitation. This construction of the statute would make principals, accomplices, and those who unsuccessfully urge the commission of a crime subject to the same penalties. Such a treatment of solicitation, however, would be sharply at variance with the common law and the treatment of solicitation in every other jurisdiction. In short, the proposed construction of \u00a7 157b would work a drastic and heavy-handed change in the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Common-law solicitation includes the invitation to commit any felony, and at least some misdemeanors.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 157b, only encouragements to felonies or misdemeanors that are \"dangerous to life\u201d would subject the offender to liability. The proposed construction of \u00a7 157b would leave importuning the commission of crimes that are not \"dangerous to life\u201d subject to the penalty for common-law solicitation, a maximum of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">This narrowing of the range of crimes urged, together with the higher penalty, might be construed as an intentional, coherent deviation from the common law: urgings to commit crimes dangerous to life should be punished more severely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>than urgings to commit other crimes. However, the Senate\u2019s parallel amendment of the penalty provision of Senate Bill No. 928, which concerned larceny and burglary,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> does not support such a reading.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The proposed construction of \u00a7 157b might make one who advocated or urged murder automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole. It is difficult to believe that the Legislature intended that mere words that persuaded no one, much less caused them to act, should call for the severest punishment.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">If Shafou\u2019s arsonist had gone ahead with the scheme to burn down the store after Shafou had tried to call the whole thing off, but the arsonist had been caught by the police before he could set the fire, Shafou would be punishable as one guilty of arson while the arsonist would be guilty only of attempted arson, which carries a lesser penalty.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">If a person urged to commit a murder was persuaded to do so and fired a shot gravely wounding the victim who nevertheless survived, he could only be convicted of assault with intent to commit murder, but the speaker could be sentenced for murder (possibly for first-degree murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">No other state treats simple urgings to commit crime as harshly as the proposed construction of \u00a7 157b. Sixteen states<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> have adopted solicitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>statutes based on the Model Penal Code.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Under the Model Penal Code, the crime solicited need not be committed. The penalty for solicitation is the same as that for the crime invited except that a solicitation to commit a felony of the first degree is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>a felony of the second degree.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> There is, however, a defense of withdrawal. This is a coherent treatment of solicitation, punishing solicitors as harshly as those solicited when there is no withdrawal and the offense solicited is or would have been committed. The punishment does not depend on the fortuity of subsequent events, such as whether the solicitee was actually persuaded, or committed the crime, but because the Model Penal Code concentrates on the criminal disposition of the solicitor, one who subsequently repents and disavows the request escapes liability altogether. Moreover, the Model Penal Code provides that the penalty for solicitations of first-degree felonies, which are the most serious crimes, shall be reduced to the penalty for second-degree felonies so that the maximum sentence for solicitation under the Model Penal Code would be ten years and the minimum sentence cannot exceed three years.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The treatment of solicitation in other states is also far less harsh than the proposed construction of \u00a7 157b. Common-law solicitation, which seems to be the rule in 23 states,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> is a misdemeanor. Ten states have solicitation statutes not based on the Model Penal Code, and none of these states imposes a penalty greater than ten years.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Montana has a statute resembling the proposed construction of \u00a7 157b.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Montana\u2019s statute says that the punishment for one convicted of solicitation <em>may never exceed </em>the penalty for the crime solicited; it does not make life imprisonment without parole mandatory for one who encourages murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The maximum penalty for burning a building other than a dwelling house is ten years. Shafou was sentenced to five years probation, the first six months to be served in the Detroit House of Correction, and fined $1,000. If Shafou had been charged with the common-law offense of solicitation, he could have been punished as severely but no more so.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The issues here presented are of considerable importance in a number of cases, held in abeyance pending the disposition of this case, where the defendants were charged with and convicted under \u00a7 157b of soliciting the commission of life-sentence offenses. It would be preferable if the constructional issue were reviewed in such a context because then the potential enormity of the penal provisions of \u00a7 157b, construed as a solicitation statute, would be more readily apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">We would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-9\">Ryan, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-e\">The defendant was convicted by a jury of inciting, inducing, or exhorting another person to unlawfully burn property in violation of MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2). The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">\"Any person who incites, induces or exhorts any other person to unlawfully burn any property, to murder, to kill, to wound or to commit an aggravated or felonious assault on any person or to do any act which would constitute a felony or circuit court misdemeanor, that may endanger or be likely to endanger the life of any person, or who aids and abets in any such inciting, inducing or exhorting shall be punished in the same manner as if he had committed the offense, incited, induced or exhorted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction in an unpublished per curiam opinion on February 22, 1979. That Court held (1) an overt act on the part of the person sought to be incited, induced, or exhorted is not required for the defendant to be in violation of the statute, and (2) that it was reversible error to deny the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury regarding the evidence of withdrawal or abandonment of the inciting, inducing, or exhorting.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On appeal to our Court three issues are raised: (1) is withdrawal or abandonment a defense to the crime of inciting, inducing, or exhorting another to unlawfully burn property under MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2); (2) was it reversible error for the trial court to refuse to give an instruction on attempt; and (3) does MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) require proof of an overt act or that the other person was incited, induced, or exhorted? I would answer the last two questions in the affirmative and not reach the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>There is little dispute about the facts in this case. Mr. Hazim Saeegh testified that, while he was working with the police as an informant in exchange for immunity from prosecution and dismissal of one of several indictments, the defendant approached him about burning a competitor\u2019s store. Mr. Saeegh told the defendant it would cost $1,000, then reported the conversation to the police. The informant was told to stall the defendant so no one else would be hired. The informant subsequently telephoned the defendant on several occasions. These calls were taped by the police and transcripts of the conversations were admitted as evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The defendant testified that the informant approached him about burning the store. The defendant first declined and then agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The defendant, his brother, and the informant testified that the day before the fire was to occur, the defendant\u2019s brother called the informant and told him to \"forget everything about the store\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The defendant argues that under the facts of this case he did not violate MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) because Mr. Saeegh was cooperating with the police as an informant and was not in any way incited, urged, stirred up, or prevailed upon to commit the arson. The prosecution argues that the person who was solicited need not have been incited, for the crime was complete when the defendant asked the informant to burn the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The opinion for reversal treats the statute as a codification of the common-law crime of solicitation and holds that proof of an overt act and that the other person was incited is not required to find one guilty of violating the statute. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">I am satisfied for two reasons that the Legislature intended that there be some evidence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>person sought to be incited was actually incited before the defendant could be convicted under MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2). This statute was enacted as 1968 PA 308 in July, 1968, apparently in response to the 1967 Detroit riots. It was placed in the conspiracy chapter of the penal code. This indicates to me that interaction among persons was contemplated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On the same day that 1968 PA 308 was enacted another statute entitled \"Inciting to riot\u201d was enacted as 1968 PA 302; MCL 752.542; MSA 28.790(2). This statute was placed in a supplemental chapter of the code on riots and related crimes and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\"It is unlawful and constitutes incitement to riot for a person or persons, <em>intending to cause or to aid or abet the institution or maintenance of a riot, to do an act or engage in conduct that urges other persons </em>to commit acts of unlawful force or violence, or the unlawful burning or destroying of property, or the unlawful interference with a police officer, peace officer, fireman or a member of the Michigan national guard or any unit of the armed services officially assigned to riot duty in the lawful performance of his duty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">This statute does not require that a person actually be incited before a crime is committed. It is clear from the emphasized language above that all that is required to violate this statute is an intent to cause or to aid or abet the institution or maintenance of a riot and an act that urges other persons to commit the unlawful acts specified. Thus, the gravamen of this crime is the effort to incite a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In contrast, MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) provides that \"[a]ny person who incites, induces or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>exhorts any other person to unlawfully burn any property, * * * or who aids and abets in any such inciting, inducing or exhorting shall be punished in the same manner as if he had committed the offense, incited, induced or exhorted\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Both acts deal with incitement of crimes and both were passed on the same day, apparently in response to the same social problem. Because the Legislature used different language to define the prohibited conduct, I am convinced that the Legislature intended to prohibit different activity under the different acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">I would hold that it is the incitement to burn illegally rather than the effort to incite which is the gravamen of the crime prohibited by the statute under which the defendant was convicted. Accordingly, some overt act resulting in actual incitement of the other person must be proved by direct evidence or reasonable inference from circumstantial evidence to establish this crime. The overt act which must be proved to establish this crime need not be the commission of the crime sought to be incited. But until it is proved that the other person <em>was </em>incited this statutory crime has not been committed, however vigorous the attempt to incite may have been. Once the incitement has been demonstrated the crime is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Having determined that MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) requires an actual incitement, I would find that to be an impossibility in this case. The person whom the defendant sought to incite, induce, or exhort was a police informant. The prosecution admits that the informant never intended to burn the market. Therefore, there is no proof of actual incitement and, at most, the defendant is guilty of attempted \"inciting, inducing or exhorting\u201d another person to unlawfully burn property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The trial court erred by refusing to charge the jury on attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Chief Justice Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion would hold that there was no request or evidentiary support for an instruction on attempt and finds no error in the trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on attempt. I am convinced that a fair reading of the following excerpt from the record discloses that a request for an instruction on attempt was made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Mr. Steele, do you have any objections or additions to the jury charge that you would like the court to give?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\"><em>\"Mr. Steele [Assistant Prosecuting Attorney]: </em>I have no objections, I would just suggest the possibility of an instruction on withdraw[al], since that was brought both in argument before the jury and testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Well, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any particular instruction, I can indicate so if you want me to, that Mr. Shafou had indicated and the testimony would support that he had withdrawn his request to Mr. Saeegh to have this place burned down, I certainly have no objection to it. I didn\u2019t give an instruction on attempt, because I didn\u2019t think it was applicable to this case whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\"><em>\"Mr. Steele: </em>No, I don\u2019t either. My point is that if the jury in fact, finds that there was withdrawal, that\u2019s not a defense. If the jury finds that defendant did in fact, incite, induce or solicit, so under our conspiracy <em>[sic] </em>defense of withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Well, that\u2019s correct, there\u2019s no questions about that, Mr. Steele.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">\"Mr. Parzen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\"><em>\"Mr. Parzen [defense counsel]: </em>Well, I think your Honor has covered everything pretty care \u2014 quite thoroughly, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\"><em>\"The Court: </em>All right. We\u2019ll call the jury back in, I will add the statement that if they find that Mr. Saeegh had withdrawn \u2014 or, Mr. Shafou had withdrawn his request, that that doesn\u2019t constitute a defense inasmuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>as the elements only require that an inducement or incitement be made originally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">\"Mr. <em>Parzen: </em>Did I understand your Honor to say he was not going to give any intent\u2014 <em>[sic]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\"><em>\"The Court: </em>That is correct because I don\u2019t think it pertains to this whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\"Mr. <em>Parzen: </em>I make an \u2014 I\u2019ll take an exception to that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\"The <em>Court: </em>Okay. Based upon the testimony, Mr. Parzen, I wouldn\u2019t see anything of an attempt at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The applicable Michigan law regarding requests for instructions on lesser included offenses is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In <em>People v Ora Jones, </em>395 Mich 379, 390; 236 NW2d 461 (1975), this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">\"The duty of the trial judge to instruct on lesser included offenses is determined by the evidence. <em>People v Phillips, </em>385 Mich 30; 187 NW2d 211 (1971). If evidence has been presented which would support a conviction of a lesser included offense, refusal to give a requested instruction is reversible error. <em>Id., </em>36. <em>People v Hamilton, </em>76 Mich 212; 42 NW 1131 (1889).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">\"If the lesser offense is one that is necessarily included within the greater, the evidence will always support the lesser if it supports the greater.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">In <em>People v Chamblis, </em>395 Mich 408, 423; 236 NW2d 473 (1975), we set forth the standard for determining whether a lesser included offense instruction should be given upon request.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">\"In determining whether the instruction should be given, the trial court should consider whether, if the defendant had been originally charged only on the lesser offense, the evidence adduced at trial would have supported a guilty verdict on that charge. If it would have, the requested instruction must be given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">In <em>People v Lovett, </em>396 Mich 101; 238 NW2d 44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(1976), we held in a per curiam opinion that it was reversible error for the trial judge to refuse to instruct on the lesser included offense of attempt, when the evidence showed the completed offense. See also <em>People v Bradovich, </em>305 Mich 329; 9 NW2d 560 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Chief Justice Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion would hold that a violation of MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2) is complete without proof of an overt act or that the other person was incited. It also would hold that there is no evidentiary support for an instruction on attempt, and the trial court did not err by refusing to give the instruction. Such view ignores the rule of Lovett, <em>supra. </em>I would hold that even accepting that interpretation of the statute, the defendant was entitled to an instruction on attempt as a cognate included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The remaining issue in this case is whether withdrawal or abandonment is a defense to the crime of inducing, inciting, or exhorting another to unlawfully burn property under MCL 750.157b; MSA 28.354(2). The withdrawal defense is of no avail to the defendant because it is not a defense to a charge of a completed crime. Once the defendant attempted to solicit the police informant, the crime of attempt was complete. There is no need, therefore, to reach the broad issue of whether withdrawal can ever be a defense to an alleged violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">This record establishes only an attempt to incite. The defendant should stand convicted of that crime, and the matter be remanded to the trial court for resentencing therefor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-7\">Riley, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> See text accompanying fn 15 for text of \u00a7 157b.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Shafou could not be charged with conspiracy to burn a building (MCL 750.73; MSA 28.268) because one cannot enter into an unlawful agreement with a police informant who does not intend to commit an offense. <em>People v Smyers, </em>398 Mich 635, 640, 651; 248 NW2d 156 (1976).

See fn 27 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> Solicitation is a crime at common law for two reasons. First, the solicitor has displayed a criminal disposition, and his culpability should not depend upon the fortuity of whether or not the solicited crime ultimately was committed. Second, the populace should not be exposed to entreaties to commit crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Neither of those rationales for the crime of solicitation support a construction of \u00a7 157b that would treat urgings to commit crimes dangerous to life differently from urgings to commit other crimes. Some nonviolent felonies are punished as severely as the \"dangerous\u201d felonies described in \u00a7 157b. For example, the maximum penalty for embezzlement of over $100 is ten years, MCL 750.174; MSA 28.371, as is the maximum penalty for arson of a commercial building, MCL 750.73; MSA 28.268. One would not expect the Legislature to equate the penalties for these two crimes, one dangerous to life and the other not, but then to set different penalties for solicitations of the two crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">One might argue that urgings to commit dangerous felonies are more culpable because they have a greater probability of success. Crimes of violence need only arouse emotion to put them in motion, while nonviolent crimes require calm preparation and calculation. Thus, one might argue, urgings to commit crimes of violence should be punished more severely than urgings to commit other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">There are two responses to this argument. First, that is not what the Legislature has done in \u00a7 157b. That section does not cover urgings to commit crimes of aroused emotion, but urgings to commit crimes that are dangerous to life. There are many crimes dangerous to life, such as the arson requested by Shafou, that require planning and preparation. There are also crimes of aroused emotion that are not dangerous to life, such as the malicious destruction of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">More importantly, the probability of success of the urging is irrelevant to solicitation. If the solicitation is in fact successful, the solicitor will ordinarily have become an accomplice and may accordingly be punished as if he had committed the crime. Thus one would not expect that the Legislature would see a need to distinguish among forms of solicitation on the basis of the likelihood of their success.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\"> MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548.
