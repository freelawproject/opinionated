Held, that, as it was not found that the defendant had reasonable cause to believe that it was necessary to kill the dog in order to prevent him from killing the hens, the defendant had no ground of exception to a ruling that the killing of the dog was not justifiable.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-10\">Tort for killing the plaintiff\u2019s dog. Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Brigham, C. J., who found the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The plaintiff, on February 20, 1884, was the owner of a dog, which was duly licensed' by the town of Reading, and wore a collar, duly marked as required by the Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>102, \u00a7 80.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">On said February 20, the plaintiff\u2019s dog, with another dog, came upon the defendant\u2019s premises and there killed and maimed hens of the defendant, which were in his hen-house or shed. The dogs were driven away, and, in about fifteen minutes afterwards, came again upon the defendant\u2019s premises, and were running toward the same shed and hen-house of the defendant, when the defendant, having reasonable cause to believe that the dogs were proceeding to maim and kill others of his hens in said shed and hen-house, shot and killed the plaintiff\u2019s dog.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">Upon these facts, the judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s killing of the plaintiff\u2019s dog under the circumstances stated, was not in law justifiable; and thereupon found and ordered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-6\"><em>I.

It was found that the defendant had reasonable cause to believe that the dog was proceeding to maim and kill his hens, but not that he had reasonable cause to believe that it was necessary to kill the dog in order to prevent him from killing the hens. The justification, therefore, was not made out. <em>Wright </em>v. Ramscot, 1 Saund. 84. <em>Janson </em>v. Brown, 1 Camp. 41. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>102 Mass. 155, 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">It is unnecessary to consider whether the common law remedy is taken away by the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>102, \u00a7\u00a7 80-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
