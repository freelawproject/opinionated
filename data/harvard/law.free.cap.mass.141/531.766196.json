The report further stated that the auditor found, that, on these facts, the defendant was not an innholder, and was not guilty of gross negligence; and that the plaintiff could not maintain his action. <em>Held, </em>that no error of law appeared.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\">Tort for the alleged negligence of the defendant in the keeping of goods delivered to him for safe keeping. The record showed that the case was referred to an auditor, who found the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">The defendant was the owner and proprietor of Hotel Hun- - tington, in Boston. Said structure is divided into twenty-one suites, or flats, rented to families for housekeeping purposes. Heat, hot and cold water, and janitor\u2019s services are furnished to each suite by the proprietor. Ho board, lodging, or accommodation for transient patrons is furnished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">In July, 1880, the defendant leased a suite to one Blackmar, who, on July 28, 1881, assigned the lease to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff entered upon the occupancy of the same. After the plaintiff entered, he complained to the defendant of lack of closet or storage room, and desired to hire an extra room in one of the suites, but the application was rejected, as the defendant was unwilling to break up a suite, but stated to him that there was a storeroom in the basement in which he might store boxes and trunks, and that it was a general storeroom, in which boxes and trunks were stored; that the servants put their trunks there, and he kept his tools there; that Frank, the assistant janitor, slept there; that Frank and the janitor each had a key; that he thought they would be perfectly safe; that he had employed a competent man, and he would guard the goods; and that this room was assigned for keeping the surplus goods of tenants. The plaintiff placed four cases and one trunk there in the last of September. Soon after, he closed up his suite and went away, and, returning in about six weeks, found that his property had been stolen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\">While the property was there, and before going away, the plaintiff\u2019s wife went to the boxes and trunks to get articles, and opened them in presence of Frank, the assistant janitor, who thus learned that the contents were valuable. Said Frank, one Saturday, while the plaintiff was absent, disappeared, and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>never returned. Some time after Ms disappearance it was found that the goods had been stolen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-4\">The plaintiff told the defendant that the goods he desired to have stored were valuable; but the defendant did not know they were so stored until after it was reported that they had been lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-5\">There was no agreement between the parties as to any compensation for the storage, none was demanded, and none paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\">The auditor further found, that this was a mere license on the part of the defendant to store the trunks in the basement, without compensation or payment to the defendant; that the plaintiff was advised and informed of all the conditions surrounding the safety of the deposit; that the defendant was not guilty of gross carelessness or negligence; that the plaintiff knew all the circumstances surrounding the place of deposit, and, placing the goods there himself, he did so at his own risk; that the defendant was not an innholder in the accepted sense of that term; and that the action could not be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-7\">Annexed to the auditor\u2019s report was a statement of the testimony before him, in full. The only matter upon which there appeared to be any conflict was in regard to what was said when the arrangement was made for storing the goods. The plaintiff testified that the defendant told him that he \u201ccould put the trunks into the trunk-room, and they would be perfectly safe; \u201d that the defendant said that he \u201chad employed an assistant janitor, who would sleep there and watch the goods.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s wife testified, that the defendant said he \u201c had an assistant janitor who would sleep in the trunk-room, and the things would be perfectly safe.\u201d The defendant testified on this point as follows: \u201c The plaintiff wanted to hire a room in the upper story to put his trunks in. I told him I had none to let. He said he had not room enough for his goods. I told him the only room was the storeroom in the basement. He asked if it was safe. I said that, so far as I knew, they would be safe; that a young man slept there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-8\">The record further showed, that the Superior Court ordered judgment for the defendant; and that the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-9\"><em>O. H. Drew, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-10\"><em>J. B. Gtoodrich, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>W. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKBm\">This case comes before us on appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court. The record shows no error in the judgment, and it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In fact, though the record does not show it, the case was heard by the court below upon the report of an auditor, including evidence reported by him, and both parties have proceeded as if that fact and the auditor\u2019s report were in the record. This is wrong, because an auditor\u2019s report is only evidence, and is no part of the record, unless made so as agreed facts, or by being made part of a report, or of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">But, as both parties have presented the ease as if the report of the auditor were before us as the only evidence on which the court below rendered judgment for the defendant, we have considered the questions which have been argued, and which the parties intended to present by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The auditor found, in effect, that the defendant was not an innholder; that he was not guilty of gross negligence ; and that he was not a bailee for hire, or such a bailee that he would be liable without gross negligence. The only questions of law presented upon the record seem to be as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain these findings, and the correctness of the conclusion from them that the defendant is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The argument for the plaintiff is, that the defendant was a bailee for hire; or, if not, that he made a special undertaking to keep the goods safely. But these are precisely the points that the auditor decided, upon conflicting evidence, adversely to the plaintiff. There was sufficient evidence to sustain the findings of fact, and we find no error of law in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
