The rules and orders of the city council provided that, when either board should not concur in the action of the other, written notice of such non-concurrence should be given to the other board. On January 9, at a regular meeting of the common council of said city, A. was declared elected city solicitor on the part of that board, and notice of his election was sent on that day to the board of aldermen. At a regular meeting of the board of aldermen on the same day, the notice of A.\u2019s election on the part of the common council was received, and the board of aldermen refused to concur in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>said election. The board of aldermen, after several ballots for city solicitor, whicli resulted in no choice, adjourned to January 11, when A. was declared elected to that office on the part of that board. The next meeting of the common council was held on January 16, when notice was received that the board of aldermen, at a meeting held on January 9, had voted to non-concur in A.\u2019s election ; and, at the same meeting, notice was also received that, at a meeting of the board of aldermen held on January 11, A. was elected city solicitor on the part of that board. The common council then non-concurred with the board of aldermen in A.\u2019s election, and sent notice of such non-concurrence to that board; and B. was elected city solicitor on the part of the common council. Notices of the non-concurrence in A.\u2019s election, and of the election of B., on the part of the common council, were received by the board of aldermen, which subsequently elected B. city solicitor in concurrence with the common council. <em>Held, </em>that A. was not elected city solicitor by concurrent vote of both branches of the city government.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-4\">If the record of the clerk of the board of aldermen of a city states that a certain vote was in concurrence with the vote of the common council, when the whole record shows that the vote was an independent one, the erroneous statement need not be regarded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-5\">Contract to recover $800, alleged to be due the plaintiff for salary as city solicitor of Lawrence for the year 1884.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A75\">The vote of the board of aldermen of January 11, 1884, was not a vote in concurrence with the common council. The board could act in the election of a city solicitor in two ways, \u2014 by concurring in an election made by the common council, or by making an election to be concurred in by the council. The two proceedings differ in form and in substance. One is by a yea and nay ballot upon the question of concurring in the election of a particular person; the' other is by a ballot for persons, in order to elect one from all who are eligible. After the vote in the negative on the question of concurrence on January 9, the board of aldermen might, under a proper motion, have taken further action upon that question, but it did not. It chose to regard that matter as finally disposed of, and proceeded to the new and different matter of making a first election, to be sent to the common council for its concurrence. Its further action was not upon the notice of election from the common council, but upon proceedings for a new election, and the vote of the adjourned meeting of January 11 was not upon that notice, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>was a new election. Neither the intention nor the power of the aldermen to make it so is doubtful. If the record shows that the plaintiff was declared to have been, by that vote, elected in concurrence, it also shows that the declaration was not true. The records of both branches show that the plaintiff was not elected by concurrent vote of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">We need not consider whether the subsequent concurrent action of both branches in electing another to the office would have worked the removal of the plaintiff if he had been duly elected, nor whether, if elected, and not removed, he could have recovered the salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
