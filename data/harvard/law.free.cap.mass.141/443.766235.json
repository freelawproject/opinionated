A deed of said Minot to one Balch, dated August 11, 1794, of a parcel of land next westerly of that afterwards conveyed to Ridgway, containing the following description: \u201c westerly by land of the Old South Church fifty-three feet; northerly by said lane nine feet five inches; then making a jog and running southerly seven feet two inches; then northerly by the street again nine feet two inches; easterly by the partition wall and fence, which divides the said granted premises from another tenement and land under the same roof, belonging to said Minot, as the said wall and fence now stand, forty-four feet five inches; and southerly by the land of the said church eighteen feet one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>inch more or less, with a privilege in the pump and well of water standing in said lane, paying one quarter part the repairs thereof, and all other privileges and appurtenances to the premises belonging.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">2. A mortgage, dated December 15,1766, from Stephen Minot to the ministers and deacons of the Old South Church, of a lot of land being part of that subsequently conveyed by George R. Minot to Campbell. This mortgage described the lot as follows : \u201c bounded northerly by said Spring Lane, there measuring twenty-one feet six inches; easterly by the tenement and land now in the occupation of said Stephen Minot, there measuring fifty-six feet ten inches ; southerly on land of James Boutineau, Esq., there measuring twenty feet two inches; and westerly on Spring Lane, and the house and land now improved by said Wliittemore, there measuring fifty-six feet.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">George R.

It has for much of the time remained open as it now is, apparently a part of the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">On the construction of said three deeds and mortgage, the court ruled, as matter of law, that George R. Minot conveyed the title in the land in controversy to said Ridgway, by deed of June 30, 1795 ; and, on said ruling, found for the plaintiff on the second count, and assessed damages in the sum of SI. If said ruling was correct, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff on the second count; otherwise, a new trial to be had on that count.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-8\"><em>J.

Minot, by his deed to George Ridgway dated June 30, 1795, intended to convey any land not a part of Spring Lane lying north of the northerly boundary, which is described as \u201c northerly on the lane aforesaid in front, there measuring on said lane sixteen feet.\u201d The width of the lot is sixteen feet, with an extension \u201c over said alley way at the height of eight feet, and across the same, three feet and eight inches,until it comes against another house of said Minot,\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>privilege of using the alley way in common with said Minot, his heirs and assigns, to the necessary or vault at the head of the alley. It is unnecessary to determine whether this deed conveyed the fee to the centre line of the alley way, or to the easterly or westerly side of it, because there is no right granted to make the extension over the alley way continue northerly beyond the northerly boundary of the dwelling-house and land as conveyed. The grant of \u201c a privilege in the pump in the street,\u201d which was situated either northerly of the north boundary of the dwelling-house and land, or of this line extended across the alley way, implies that the land in which the pump and well were situated was not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The argument is, that, as the lot is bounded \u201c easterly on an alley way and other land owned by said Minot,\u201d the lot must have extended on the easterly side north of the alley way, as the alley way ceased when the northerly boundary of the house was reached, and therefore that the lot conveyed must have included a parcel of land, at least as wide as the alley way, bounded easterly on Minot\u2019s other land, and extending northerly as far as his other land extended. If these words could otherwise have no intelligible meaning, still it would be difficult to define all the boundaries of the land included in this description. But these words as applied to the land may have an intelligible meaning without extending any part of the lot conveyed to Ridgway northerly beyond the northerly line of sixteen feet on the lane continued across the alley way. There was a vault or necessary on Minot\u2019s land at the head of the alley and across it, and, whether Ridgway\u2019s easterly line ran through the centre of the vault or on the easterly or westerly side of it, the lot conveyed, so far as the vault extended, would be bounded easterly on other land owned by said Minot. Again, the lot was conveyed with a right of extension over' the alley way at the height of eight feet, \u201cuntil it comes against another house of said Minot,\u201d and by the deed it may have been intended that the lot on the easterly side should be bounded by the alley way for eight feet from the surface, and that above this it should be bounded by the other land owned by said Minot, which was the house and land for whose use a right in the alley way and vault was reserved in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The deed of Minot to Campbell of the lot on the east, dated July 30, 1800, cannot be used to detract anything from Minot\u2019s previous deed to Ridgway, but it may perhaps be used to show the buildings on the land at the time of the latter conveyance, and the condition of it. This deed describes the lot conveyed as bounded \u201c westerly by land lately sold by said Minot to George Ridgway deceased, and now owned by John Driscoll, there measuring to the front of skid Driscoll\u2019s home [house] forty-three feet more or less, then making a jog and measuring on a northerly boundary the width of an alley way, as the same now runs, about three feet, then running to the first-mentioned bound on said street, and measuring from said jog thirteen feet and three inches, more or less.\u201d If land north of the alley way had been previously conveyed to Ridgway, these last two lines would naturally have been described as bounded on land conveyed to Ridgway. The description of the lot in the mortgage given by Stephen Minot, dated December 15, 1766, which is in part the same land conveyed to Campbell by George R. Minot, bounds it \u201c westerly, on Spring Lane, and the house and land now improved by said Whittemore,\u201d which indicates, as all the deeds, including that of Minot to Balch, indicate, that the lot of land described in the second count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was considered to be a part of Spring Lane, where were a pump and well from which the abutters had the right to draw water. If the fee in Spring Lane to the centre line is in the abutters respectively, still the plaintiff would have no right to maintain the fence which the defendants took down, because Spring Lane is a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In accordance with the terms of the report, the finding on-the second count must be set aside, and a new trial ordered on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"AIi0\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
