On the last day of the term, the general order was passed that judgment he entered in all cases ripe for judgment. The clerk made an entry in the case on the day the action was dismissed, stating that fact, but made no entry in it under the general order. <em>Meld, </em>that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction, upon a petition filed more than a year after the last day of the said term, to order the case to he brought forward upon the docket.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">Contract, against the executor of Otis H. Pierce, in two counts. The first count was on a promissory note for |631.75, dated March 24, 1870, signed by said Pierce, and payable to the order of the plaintiff one day after date. The second count was for 113,000 and interest, for money lent by the plaintiff to said Pierce on December 2, 1875. Writ dated July 19, 1880, and returnable to the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">At December term, 1882, of that court, the action was dismissed, upon the calling of the docket, under the fifty-fourth rule.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On the last day of said December term a general order for judgment was passed as follows : \u201c That judgment be entered in all cases ripe for judgment, and that all matters pending and not passed upon be continued to the next term of this court.\u201d The only record made by the clerk of the Superior Court in this action was by the following entry on the docket: \u201c December 12, 1882. Dismissed on call.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">On January 14,1885, the plaintiff filed a motion to restore the case to the docket, and to bring it forward for further proceedings. This motion was supported by an affidavit of the then counsel for the plaintiff, stating that the case was continued from term to term on the assurance of the defendant that he could pay the debt if delay were given, because there was a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>amount of real estate \"belonging to the testator\u2019s estate which could not then be sold to advantage on account of the depressed condition of the market; and that, at the time the action was dismissed, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was prevented by illness from being present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">At the time of the hearing upon this motion the defendant was dead, having died in December, 1883, and Joseph H. Cotton had been, on March 31, 1884, appointed, and then was, administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>with the will annexed, of the estate of Otis H. Pierce. Before any action on the motion, the attorney of record for the defendant appeared, but disclaimed any relation to the action, or any desire to be heard in the matter of the motion. <em>Brigham, </em>C. J., allowed the motion; and, immediately afterward, the death of the defendant was suggested, and an order was made to summon in the said Cotton as administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">Cotton appeared specially, and on January 26, 1885, filed a motion that the action be dismissed, on the ground that, by reason of the dismissal and judgment of December term, 1882, the court had no further jurisdiction of the action. This motion was overruled on February 17, 1885; and Cotton alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">By order of court, an answer was filed, and the case was put on the trial list. Cotton represented the estate of Otis H. Pierce insolvent, and the Probate Court appointed commissioners to receive and pass upon the claims against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">The case came on for trial, before <em>Knowlton, </em>J., without a jury, for the purpose of determining the amount due. The judge found that Otis H. Pierce in,his lifetime was indebted to the plaintiff in the amount claimed in her writ. It appeared that, if the plaintiff\u2019s claim should be defeated by the statute of limitations, or otherwise, there would be assets which would pass to legatees under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-8\">The administrator <em>de bonis non </em>asked the judge to rule as follows : \u201c 1. The dismissal of this action at December term, 1882, and the general order for judgment passed on the last day of said term, constituted a rendition by the court of a judgment in this case. 2. Said dismissal and said general order for judgment constitute a defence and are a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>against the administrator <em>de bonis non. </em>3. Upon said dismissal and said order for judgment, the legatees under the will of Otis H. Pierce became entitled in law to the funds in the hands of the administrator. 4. The interests of third persons having intervened, judgment cannot be rendered against the administrator, as the funds in his hands belonging to said estate cannot lawfully be applied to the payment thereof. 5. The bringing fprward of this cause upon the docket is a revival of said action. 6. The statute bar has closed upon all personal claims against the estate of said Otis H. Pierce. 7. The administrator <em>de bonis non </em>cannot be held liable in this action. 8. The dismissal of said action was a final disposition thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\">The judge was of opinion that all the matters to which these requests related had been considered and passed upon by the justice who made the order restoring the case to the docket, and who overruled the subsequent motion to dismiss it, and that the defendant\u2019s rights relating thereto were protected by his bill of exceptions, and ruled that the trial must proceed under said order as if the action had never been dismissed, but had been pending all the time since it was originally entered; and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $14,830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">At the request of the defendant, the judge reported the case to this court for decision of the questions of law involved. If said ruling was wrong in law, or the finding under it was erroneous, the finding was to be set aside and a new trial ordered; otherwise, judgment to be entered thereon, as a determination of the amount to be allowed by the commissioners.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-6\"><em>H.
