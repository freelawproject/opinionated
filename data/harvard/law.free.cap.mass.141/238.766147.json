The evidence tended to show that the land was a brush pasture unenclosed by a fence; that the plaintiff, having a license to cut a footpath on the land of a third person, by mistake cut it on the defendant\u2019s land; that, at the most, only ten trees were cut; that the damage done did not exceed twenty-five cents; and that, before the complaint was made, the plaintiff, being informed by the defendant that the cutting was on his land, offered to pay the damages. <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence for the jury that the complaint was prosecuted without probable cause, and with malice.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-9\">Tort for malicious prosecution. Writ dated March 1, 1884. Trial in the Superior Court, before Bacon, J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, in substance as follows;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-10\">Drake, on August 25, 1883, made a complaint before a trial justice, charging Moyle with wilfully committing a trespass, on August 13, 1883, and unlawfully and wilfully cutting down, carrying away, and destroying three hundred trees, of the value of $30, of the property of Drake. Upon the warrant issued upon this complaint Moyle was arrested, and taken before J. C. Lane, trial justice, for examination. The record of the trial justice was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-11\">\u201c Norfolk, ss. By virtue of the within warrant, the respondent is brought into court this first day of September, A. D. 1883, and the within complaint is read to him, and he being asked whether he is guilty or not guilty of the offence within charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>upon him, says that he is not guilty, and after due and full examination it is considered by me that he is not guilty of the offence charged against him. It is therefore ordered by said court that he be discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">Frederic Endicott testified that he was a surveyor and civil engineer; that he surveyed the premises where the alleged trespass had been committed, and produced a plan by which it appeared that the path which Moyle cut on the land of Drake was about five hundred feet in length. The damage caused by cutting the path was in the witness\u2019s opinion, ten or fifteen cents. The witness testified that he had examined the stumps from which the wood was cut; that there were three chestnut trees, the largest an inch and a quarter in diameter, six birches, the largest an inch and a quarter in diameter, one small branch of an oak tree, less than an inch in diameter, and a few small huckleberry and other bushes, and small limbs. On cross-examination the witness said he did not include in his estimate the value of any trees cut on Drake\u2019s land not on the line of the path. The attention of the witness was first called to the premises in September, 1884; at that time he examined the stumps.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">It appeared from the deeds introduced at the trial, or was admitted by the parties, that Drake\u2019s land had been owned by one Barnabas D. Capen, who gave a bond for a deed to one Friend Drake, the defendant\u2019s father, who had formerly owned said premises, and had lived on them for many years. The interest in said estate which Friend Drake had was sold by his administrator by public auction, a few months before the trespass complained of, and the defendant obtained title by deeds from both said administrator and said Capen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">Moyle testified that he had lived several years, and now lived, a short distance southerly of the defendant\u2019s house in Sharon; that he was present at the auction sale, upon the premises of Drake, by the administrator, of the defendant\u2019s land, and was the second highest bidder therefor at said sale; that he was also the lessee of a lot called the Carpenter lot, lying northwesterly of Drake\u2019s lot; that he had used another path on Drake\u2019s land, somewhat nearer Drake\u2019s house, to get to and from the Carpenter lot, but had been forbidden by the defendant to use that path; that he then obtained a license from one A. Gf. Hixon to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>cut a path through land of one Fanny Dixon, which lay between Drake\u2019s lot and the Carpenter lot, to go to and from the Carpenter lot; that in consequence of said license he cut the path, but in mistaking the defendant\u2019s boundary, he had cut the path, as he subsequently found, on the defendant\u2019s land, although he had supposed at the time that he was on Hixon\u2019s land, and that the defendant\u2019s line was several feet southerly of where he cut the path; that he had known the defendant\u2019s premises for some years, and thought the defendant\u2019s line commenced on the highway at a point southerly of the point where he began to cut on the plan, and ran back westerly about parallel with the path cut; that in pursuance of said license he went, on the afternoon of August 13, 1883, with a hired man, and cut the path, which was a footpath; that upon completing the cutting of the path, and on the same day the path was cut, Drake told him that he had cut the path on Drake\u2019s land; that he replied, \u201c I think not, I had authority from Hixon to cut the path on his land, and I think I cut it on his land;\u201d that Drake answered, \u201c Well, you have cut it on my land; \u201d and that the witness replied, \u201c If I have, it is a mistake, and I suppose I must stand the racket,\u201d meaning to pay the damages, \u201c but I don\u2019t think I have.\u201d Moyle also testified that, the next morning, August 14, he called on Capen; that, in consequence of what Capen told him, he saw the defendant, and said to him, \u201c I have seen Capen, and I find that a portion of the path is on your land, and I will pay you whatever the damages are, if you don\u2019t set them too high, and, if we cannot agree, I will pay whatever any two or three men say they are.\u201d To this Drake made no reply; that the witness asked Drake to show him where his line was, which Drake refused to do; that he had no further or other conversation with the defendant until his arrest and trial; that the damage in cutting the path was small, that it would\" not exceed twenty-five cents; that no trees were cut, only huckleberry brush and some sprouts; that there were no walls or fences designating the boundary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">On cross-examination Moyle said that he testified at the hearing before the trial justice that he cut only a part of the path on the defendant\u2019s land, and that he did not know that he had cut the whole path on the defendant\u2019s land until about a week before the trial in this court, when he went with the surveyor to run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>out the line; that after the hearing before the trial justice, and after his discharge, he tendered Drake two dollars in payment of the civil damages caused by the trespass, which Drake accepted. There was a notice posted near Drake\u2019s house on said premises, near where the path was cut, forbidding trespassing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">Albert G. Hixon, a witness called by Moyle, testified that he was the agent for Fanny Dixon ; that her lot was under his control ; and that he gave Moyle permission to cut a path through his land. Upon cross-examination, the witness testified, \u201c I gave Moyle permission to cut or trim a path, but no permission to cut trees; that Drake came to see him, and inquired if Moyle had permission from the witness to cut a path through his, the witness\u2019s land; that the witness told Drake he did give that permission to the plaintiff, and that this inquiry, the witness believed, was made before the hearing before the trial justice, \u2014 he could not tell whether it was before or after the criminal trial; that he was not there at that trial; that it might have been after,\u2014 might have been after September 6, but did not think it was, \u2014 could not swear it was not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">Barnabas D. Capen testified that he had formerly owned Drake\u2019s land; that he examined the path the plaintiff cut, and thought a part of it was on Drake\u2019s land; that the path was a footpath; that no trees were cut, and only a few sprouts; that the damage would not exceed twenty-five cents; that the path was cut through a brush pasture; that he thought he could carry off all the plaintiff cut down in his arms at one time; and that the plaintiff the day after the cutting called upon the witness to find out where the defendant\u2019s line was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">Upon these facts, the judge ruled that the action could not be maintained, and ordered the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. If the ruling was right, judgment was to be entered on the verdict; otherwise, a new trial to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\"><em>T. E. Grrover, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-8\"><em>J. </em>Everett, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-9\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR4\">The defendant made a complaint before a trial justice against the plaintiff, under the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>203, \u00a7 94, on which the plaintiff was arrested, and, after an examination by the trial justice, was discharged. This section of the Public Statutes is a reenactment of the Gen. Sts. c. 161, \u00a7 81, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>amended by the St. of 1868, <em>c. </em>321, \u00a7 1. By \u00a7 2 of the latter statute, jurisdiction to punish this offence was given to trial justices concurrently with the Superior Court, \u201c when the value of the property cut, .... or the injury occasioned by the trespass, is not alleged to exceed the sum of one hundred dollars.\u201d It seems that, by the Pub. Sts. <em>a. </em>155, \u00a7 51, this grant of jurisdiction to trial justices over offences under this section of the statutes was omitted, and that, since the Public Statutes took effect, they have jurisdiction only to commit or bind over for trial in the Superior Court those who, on complaint, appear to be guilty of offences under this section. But this change in the law is immaterial. A discharge by the trial justice is an end of the prosecution, and the prosecution was before a court having some jurisdiction over the offence. <em>Sayles </em>v. Briggs, 4 Met. 421, 426. <em>Cardival </em>v. Smith, 109 Mass. 158. <em>Driggs </em>v. Burton, 44 Vt. 124. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>36 N. Y. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">There was evidence for the jury that the complaint was prosecuted without probable cause, and with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\n<em>New trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
