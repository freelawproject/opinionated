It is not alleged in said count, that said defendant suffered said vehicle or cab to stand or stop in one particular place or locality in said street, at any one time, - for a longer space of time than twenty minutes. 4.

The regulation of the board of aldermen, under which the complaint is brought, provides that no person \u201c having the care or ordering of a vehicle shall suffer the same to stop in a street for more than twenty minutes.\u201d The obvious meaning of the regulation is that no vehicle shall be allowed to make a continuous stop of more than twenty minutes. The complaint substantially follows the regulation, and, by its natural and obvious construction, charges a continuous stopping for a longer time than twenty minutes, and is sufficient. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>108 Mass. 302. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
