Trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">One Hanley, a police officer, testified as follows: \u201c About 11.35 P. M., on July 31, 1885, in passing the premises alleged, I saw the curtains drawn up so as to prevent a view of the interior. I went in and saw a young man, the defendant\u2019s son, who, at my request, called the defendant down stairs. She came into the dining-room, and I asked her if she was the licensed owner of this place. She said she was; she said she was licensed, and I called her attention to the screens, and she made some reply which I cannot exactly remember.\u201d On cross-examination, he testified that he was in the place once before, but did not know how business was conducted there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">One Frohock, a police officer, testified that, at the time mentioned, he was with Hanley, and that the curtains were drawn on two windows so as to prevent a view of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">The defendant offered no evidence, but asked the judge to rule that the allegation in the complaint, that the defendant was duly licensed to sell intoxicating liquors, was not properly or-sufficiently proved; that it should be proved by the record prescribed by the statute; and that there was no proper evidence upon this point on which to submit the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The judge declined so to rule; but ruled that, if the jury believed the testimony of the officer, and from that were satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, from the circumstances of the case, that, when the defendant said she was licensed, she referred to a license to sell intoxicating liquors on the premises in question, such an admission would render it unnecessary to procure record evidence of such license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-4\"><em>P. A. Collins J. 3. </em>Burke, <em>(Gr. A. Grriffin </em>with them,) for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL1\">contended that no evidence was offered to show whether the license referred to by the defendant was a junk-dealer\u2019s license, a pawnbroker\u2019s, a common victualler\u2019s, or one under the internal revenue laws of the United States.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-5\"><em>E.

Taken in connection with the fact that the conversation with the officer was in relation to her use of screens or curtains, the inference is strong that what she meant was that she was licensed to sell intoxicating liquors. It was a question for the jury, and the case was submitted to them with proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"A9a\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
