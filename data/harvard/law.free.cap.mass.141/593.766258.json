Subsequently B. wrote to A., acknowledging the receipt of these goods, and ordering more goods, saying: \u201cAs regards the shipping of the goods just received, you have done everything satisfactory. Ship this order in like manner.\u201d The goods were sent, according to B.\u2019s instructions, to M., who, upon receiving them, wrote to A. as follows: \u201c Are we to keep them for our steamer sailing 14th inst., or ship by the G., which is a very slow steamer sailing 7th inst., and will not, we think, arrive out before our steamer ? \u201d The G. was a steamer belonging to a line for which M. was not the agent, and of which steamer he was not the owner. A. replied to M.\u2019s letter as follows: \u201c Send the goods by the steamer which will arrive first.\u201d Thereupon, without further instructions of any kind, M. caused the goods to be shipped by the G., which foundered in mid-ocean, and the goods were lost. <em>Held, </em>that A. could not maintain an action against B. for the price of the goods.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">Contract, upon an account annexed, for goods sold and delivered. The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the plaintiff, to this court, on appeal, upon agreed facts, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The plaintiff is a tanner, currier, and leather, merchant, having his place of business at Brighouse, England. The defendant is a manufacturer of leather belting in Lowell, in this Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\">On November 3, 1882, the defendant sent to the plaintiff, by mail, an order for leather goods, with instructions to \u201c ship to care of D. &amp; C. Mclver, shipping merchants, Liverpool, as soon as possible, for their next steamer to Boston direct.\u201d This order was filled by the plaintiff, and the goods were shipped by the Cunard line by D. &amp; C. Mclver, and were duly received by the defendant. On December 16, 1882, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, acknowledging the receipt of said goods, enclosing sight draft in payment for the same, and ordering the goods described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, saying: \u201c As regards the shipping of this leather just received, you have done everything satisfactory. Ship this order in like manner.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">D. &amp; C. Mclver, referred to in the shipping instructions, were at that time shipping merchants and part or sole owners and agents of the Cunard line of steamers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">The goods were properly prepared for shipment, and sent to . D. &amp; C. Mclver in accordance with the defendant\u2019s instructions. D. &amp; C. Mclver received them at Liverpool on or about February 1, 1883, and on that day wrote the plaintiff as follows: \u201c The five bales of leather have arrived. Are we to keep them for our steamer sailing 14th inst., or ship by the Glamorgan, which is a very slow steamer sailing 7th inst., and will not, we think, arrive out before our steamer ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">The Glamorgan was a steamer belonging to the Warren line, for which D. &amp; C. Mclver were not the agents, and of which steamer they were not the owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-8\">The plaintiff replied to said letter as follows: \u201c Send the bales by the steamer which will arrive first.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-9\">Thereupon, without further instructions of any kind, D. &amp; C. Mclver caused the goods to be shipped by the Glamorgan, which foundered in mid-ocean, and the goods were lost. There was no insurance on them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">If, upon these facts, the plaintiff could recover, judgment was to be entered for the amount claimed; otherwise, for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>W.

Mclver, shipping merchants, Liverpool, as soon as possible, for their next steamer to Boston direct.\u201d This shipment was made as ordered; and, on December 16, 1884, the defendant sent a further order, saying: \u201c As regards the shipping of the leather just received, you have done everything satisfactory. Ship this order in like manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The directions by which the plaintiff was to be controlled \u25a0 must be interpreted as requiring him to forward the goods to D. &amp; C. Mclver, to be transported by them by the Cunard line, of which they were managers and agents. The words \u201c their next steamer \u201d could not have meant any steamer which would accept freight from D. <em>&amp; </em>C. Mclver. Cases may be readily imagined where these words would be of the highest importance, as if the defendant had an open policy of insurance protecting his goods which might be sent by the Cunard line. It might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>also be true that the defendant would not deem a policy of in* surance necessary when goods were sent' by a well-established passenger line, where greater precautions might probably be taken for safety, which he would deem necessary when they were sent by a purely freighting steamer. The goods were actually forwarded to D. &amp; 0. Mclver, with instructions in conformity with the directions of the defendant; and, had the matter ended there, so far as any directions to D. &amp; C. Mclver is concerned, the plaintiff would be entitled to treat them as delivered to the defendant, and to require him to pay the purchase money. If, on the other hand, while the goods were yet in the hands of the carrier, and before transportation of them had commenced, the plaintiff changed the directions given to him by the defendant, or authorized the carrier to transport them in a different mode from that directed by the defendant, and loss has thereby occurred, he cannot contend that they were delivered to the defendant by him. By continuing to exercise dominion over them, and by giving a new direction impliedly withdrawing the directions previously given, he cannot be allowed to assert that he had made a complete delivery by his original act, if a loss has occurred by reason of that which he has subsequently done or directed. The change in the directions given relates back to and qualifies the original delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The plaintiff, in answer to a letter from D. &amp; C. Mclver, after the goods had reached them, inquiring whether they were to keep the goods \u201cfor our steamer 14th inst., or ship by tlie Glamorgan,\u201d ordered them to be shipped by the steamer arriving out first, presumably the steamer which D. &amp; C.- Mclver believed would be the first to arrive. The Glamorgan was not a steamer of any line of which D. &amp; 0. Mclver were owners or agents, and in no way answers the description of \u201c their steamer \u201d as applied to D. &amp; C. Mclver. By neglecting to limit the authority of D. <em>&amp; </em>C. Mclver to send by a steamer which could be thus described, and by directing them to send by the steamer which would first arrive, the plaintiff had failed to comply with the orders of the defendant as to the shipment of goods, and, if correct directions had originally been given, had withdrawn them and substituted others. When, therefore, exercising the authority thus given by the plaintiff, D. &amp; C. Mclver send by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the Glamorgan, as being in their judgment the steamer likely to arrive first, and a loss occurs, it should not be borne by the defendant, whose directions have not been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
