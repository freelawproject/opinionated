A member of the society became ill, and was unable to work. He gave due notice in writing of his illness to the society, and a committee of the society visited him and reported his condition to the society; and, on a day named, he was entitled to receive from the society a certain sum for two weeks\u2019 illness, which was afterwards tendered to him. On that day, he resumed work at his regular employment, and worked for two consecutive days, receiving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>wages therefor; but during the two days he was not physically in a fit condition to work, and could only perform light work, and not even that without unreasonable, excessive, and harmful exertion. During the time he was so employed, a committee of the society visited his house, and afterwards reported to the society that he had returned to work, and the committee was discharged by the society. At the expiration of the two days, he suffered a relapse, and was unable to work for a period sufficient to make four weeks from the date of his first illness by including said two days in the computation ; but no notice of his illness was given to the society after the day when he so resumed work, and the society took no action thereon. He then brought an action against the society, to recover the amount of the benefit for four weeks. The judge, who tried the case without a jury, found for the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that it could not be said, as matter of law, that the plaintiff might not be deemed \u201cincapable of working\u201d during the time in question, within the meaning of the by-law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-4\">Contract by a member of the defendant society, to recover $20, alleged to be due the plaintiff according to the by-laws of the society.

On or about November 20, 1884, the plaintiff became ill and unable to work, and, by reason of such illness and inability, ceased to work. He gave due notice in writing of said illness to the president of said society, as required by article 18 of the by-laws. A committee of said society visited the plaintiff, and reported his condition to the society, as required by article 13 of the by-laws; and on December 10, 1884, the plaintiff was entitled to receive from said society for said illness the sum of ten dollars, which sum was duly tendered \u2022 by the defendant to the plaintiff prior to the date of the plaintiff\u2019s \u2019 writ in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-4\">On said December 10, the plaintiff resumed work at his regular employment as carpenter, and worked two full days in succession, and received his wages therefor; but during said two days the plaintiff was not in fit physical condition to work, and could not work without unreasonable, excessive, and harmful effort and exertion, and did not and could not perform the heavier kind of carpenter work, though he did the work required by the condition of the building in the erection of which he was employed. During the time when he was so employed, a committee of the society visited his house, and afterwards reported to the society that he had returned to work, and the committee was discharged by the society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">On December 12, 1884, the plaintiff found himself unable to return to his work, by reason of the same kind of illness complained of on November 20, and remained at his home unable to work on that day, and for a period of time thereafter sufficient to make four weeks from said November 20, by including the tenth and eleventh days of December in the computation; but no notice of his illness was given to the society subsequently to December 10, 1884, and the society took no action thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">Upon these facts, the judge refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, that the action could not be maintained; and found for the plaintiff.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aca-\">The only question is whether the plaintiff had become capable of working on December 10, 1884, so that he was no longer entitled to the benefit of the Union, under his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>notice. This was a question of fact, and must be deemed to have been conclusively decided in favor of the plaintiff, unless the detailed facts are inconsistent with such a finding. On examining the detailed facts reported by the judge,, we cannot say that the plaintiff might not be deemed \u201c incapable of working,\u201d within the just meaning of the by-law. The fact of his having done some work is not the final test. The by-law must have a reasonable construction. A man recovering from an illness of about three weeks\u2019 duration may justly .be deemed to be \u201c incapable of working,\u201d although by unreasonable, excessive, and harmful effort and exertion he succeeds in doing light work for two consecutive days, and then by reason thereof suffers a relapse. That the recurrence of the plaintiff\u2019s illness was a relapse, caused by his excessive and harmful exertion, might fairly be inferred. The fact that he received wages for those two days is immaterial. But one report from the committee for a continuous illness is contemplated in the by-laws. Such report, having been made, the plaintiff was not affected by what they did afterwards, or by their discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
