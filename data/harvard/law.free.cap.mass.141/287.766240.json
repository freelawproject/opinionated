It is very plain that George was not intended to have any part of the income of this \u201c other portion,\u201d as he would have if there were held to be any intestacy as to the deceased daughter\u2019s share. The provision that \u201cthe issue of any deceased daughter shall take the mother\u2019s share,\u201d whatever its scope, raises no difficulty, but simply makes a sub-class of such issue, and puts them in place of their mother. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>140 Mass. 267. If it has any effect, it is to show that it is assumed that the share would go over but for such provision. The words \u201c in equal shares \u201d do not affect the question.' They simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>determine the proportions in which the income is to be divided. See <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Coolidge, </em>99 Mass. <em>191; Jackson </em>v. Roberts, 14 Gray, 546, 551; <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>103 Mass. 489. It is true that the event which has happened is not specifically provided for, but, upon our interpretation, it was not necessary to provide for it specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"A9W\">It is objected that, if the deceased daughter\u2019s share of the income goes to the other daughters, the equality which the testator seems to have desired is not preserved. Especially it is said that, so far as the testator expressed himself, he showed a disposition to give George at least as large a share as his sisters ; that his share of the income will be less than theirs; and that, if this is not a sufficient reason for declaring a partial intestacy as to the deceased daughter\u2019s share, so as to let in George, it is one for holding her representatives entitled, and thus preserving the equality. But, as we have intimated already, we cannot carry the testator\u2019s disposition further by conjecture than it is expressed, and then, in order to satisfy the wish which we have 1 imagined, give words a different meaning from that which they would have had otherwise. A slight temporary inequality caused by the secondary division of one share must be regarded as an accident which the testator did not provide against, perhaps because he did not think it worth while.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">It follows, of course, from what we have said, that we find no reason, in the disposition made of the income, for disappointing the testator\u2019s expressed wishes, and ordering any part of the principal to be distributed now.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
