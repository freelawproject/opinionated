The defendants had possession, claiming under a judicial sale in proceedings to foreclose a mortgage. It was admitted that the plaintiffs below' had \u25a0the legal title to the land in controversy, unless it had been divested by those proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">On the trial the defendant, having introduced a transcript of the record of the proceedings under which they claimed title from the Court of Common Pleas of Vanderburgh County, \u201cthe plaintiffs then offered in evidence the original order of sale issued to the sheriff on the decree of foreclosure, and upon w\u2019hich order of sale the sheriff sold to the defendant in the case the premises in controversy, which order of sale appeared, on inspection thereof, not to have been issued under the seal of said Court of Common Pleas of Vanderburgh County, and not to have had the seal of said court impressed thereon, or in any manner annexed thereto. . . . And the court, <em>because the said order of sale was not issued under the seal of the said Court of Common Picas of Vanderburgh </em>County, did find for plaintiffs, to which finding of the court the defendants at the time excepted.\u201d Judgment having been given accordingly, the question now before this court w\u2019as the correctness of the decision so made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-8\">\n<em>Mr. R. M. Corwine,for the plaintiff in error :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-9\">Did the omission to use the seal of the court make the older void, or was it avoidable merely? The general rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>in judicial sales is, that the purchaser is not bound to look beyond the \u201cjudgment, levy, and sale.\u201d All other steps (such as the issuing of an execution after a year and a day without a revivor) are merely directory to the officer.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As between the parties to the process, or their privies, the return is usually conclusive, and not liable to be collaterally impeached. In <em>Sowle </em>v. Champion, in the Supreme Court of Indiana,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it was held that an order of sale, issued on a decree of foreclosure, which did not set out a copy of the decree, was informal, under the statute, but was <em>not void, </em>and if not set aside on the defendants\u2019 motion, that all acts done under it were valid. Yet the direction of the code, \u201c that <em>a copy of the order of sale </em>and judgment <em>shall </em>be issued,\u201d is as stringent and mandatory as that other direction, that it \u201c shall be issued and certified by the clerk <em>under the seal of the court,\u201d </em>&amp;c. If the one is merely directory, the other is so also.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-5\">\n<em>-Messrs.

Counsel for plaintiffs in error have not cited a single ease to the contrary, nor have our own researches discovered one.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">We have decided in this court that a writ of error is void for want of a seal, though the clerk had returned the transcript in obedience to the writ.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>We have held that a bill of exceptions must be under the seal of the judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">It is true that the paper now under consideration is not an ordinary <em>fieri facias, </em>nor is it any other common-law writ. It may be well, therefore, to consider what is its relation to the writ of <em>fieri </em>facias, and especially whether it was essential to the authority of the sheriff to make the sale. That the ordinary writ <em>offieri facias </em>is the authority of the sheriff to levy on property and sell it is undoubted, and needs no reference to authorities to support it; and if the supposed writ is void, then the levy and sale are also void, and not merely voidable, because they are made without any authority on the part of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The decisions cited by counsel are all cases where process was issued irregularly, in point of time, or where the officer has not proceeded according to some statutory requirement which was directory to him, but did not affect his power to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">But if his power to sell depends upon a process, and that process shows on its face that it is void, it can confer no authority, and all his proceedings uuder it are simply void.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The question then recurs, did the authority of the sheriff to make the sale on which plaintiffs in error rely, depend upon the order of sale issued by the'Court of Common Pleas ?</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">In courts which pursue the chancery practice in foreclosing mortgages, unaffected by statutory provisions, the sale is made by a commissioner appointed by the court. This is usually one of the standing master commissioners of the court, or, for reasons shown, some special commissioner for that purpose. In neither ease does any process or order under seal of the court issue to the commissioner. He may, if he thinks proper, procure a copy of the decree and order appointing him commissioner, or if the party who -wishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the decree executed thinks proper in this mode to demand of him to proceed, he may furnish him such copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">But it is believed that the decree itself is the authority on which the commissioner acts, and if he proceeds in conformity to the decree, the sale will be valid although no copy has been placed in the hands of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In the courts of Indiaua the distinction between common law and chancery proceedings is abolished, and under their code of civil procedure but one form of action, called a civil action, is known. This code provides, \u00a7 407, that \u201c when a judgment requires the payment of money, or the delivery of real or personal property, the same may be enforced by execution.\u201d Section 409 says, \u201cThe execution must issue in the name of the State, and be directed to the sheriff of the county, sealed with the seal, and attested by the clerk of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Section 635, which relates to the proceedings to foreclose a mortgage, we give verbatim :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201cA copy of the order of sale, and judgment, shall be issued and certified by the clerk, <em>under the seal of the court, </em>to the sheriff, who shall thereupon proceed to sell the mortgaged premises, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment, interest, and costs, <em>as upon execution; </em>and if any part of the judgment, interest, and costs remain unsatisfied, the sheriff shall forwith proceed to levy the residue of the other .property of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Though the order of sale here described may not come under the name of any of the recognized common law writs of execution, as <em>capias, fieri facias, </em>or others, yet it comes cleariy within the function and supplies the purpose of an execution \u2014 that is, a process issuing from a court to enforce its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">The statute recognizes it as such, and requires that it shall issue under the seal of the court. The sheriff to whom it is directed is required to proceed \u201cas upon execution.\u201d If the debt is not satisfied by the sale of the property specifically mentioned in the order, it then operates as a <em>fieri facias, </em>under which the sheriff is directed to levy the residue of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>other property of the defendant. It is therefore to all intents and purposes an execution, and the statute expressly requires that it must issue under the seal of the court. Without the seal it is void. We cannot distinguish it from any other writ or process in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">It is equally clear that under the Indiana statute the sherifl could not sell without this order, certified under the seal of the court, and placed in his hands. This is his authority, and if it is for any reason void, his acts purporting to be done under it are also void.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"A7Kb\"> Overton <em>v. </em>Check, 22 Howard, 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\"> Pomeroy\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Bank of Indiana, 1 Wallace, 592 ; and see Boal\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>King, 6 Ohio, 11; Bybee <em>v. </em>Ashby, 2 Gilman, 157; Tibbetts <em>v. </em>Shaw, 19 Maine, 204; Witherill <em>v. </em>Randall, 30 Id. 170; State <em>v. </em>Curtis, 1 Hayward, 471 ; Hall <em>v. </em>Jones, 9 Pickering, 446.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
