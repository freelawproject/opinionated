Where,pending a writ of error to this court, subsequently dismissed, the defendant in error dies and the other side wishes to take a new writ, application should be made to the court below for the purpose of reviving the suit in the name of the representatives of the deceased. A writ of error can then regularly issue. A motion in' this court to revive the writ by suggesting the death and substituting the representatives as parties to the record is not regular.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"AHo\">2. If the court below should refuse an application such as that above contemplated, in the circumstances mentioned, then the writ may, from necessity, issue in the name of the representatives, in the usual way, serving on them the citation to appear at the next term.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-14\">Error to the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-15\">On motion. Boon filed a bill in a State court of Or\u00e9gon against McClane, to enjoin him from prosecuting an action at law to recover the possession of a lot of land, for which a patent had been issued to McClane by the United States, and praying that the same might be held by McClane as trustee for the benefit of him, Boon. The court dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the bill. On an appeal to the Supreme Court, that court reversed the decree, and rendered one for the plaintiff. Mc-Clane, the defendant, sued out a writ of error from this court to the Supreme Court of Oregon, returnable December Term, 1863, which was dismissed at the December Term, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">A second writ of error was issued July 29th, 1867, returnable at the next term of the Supreme Court of the United States.
