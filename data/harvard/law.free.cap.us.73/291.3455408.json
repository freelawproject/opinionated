Upon the counting of the votes cast for the different candidates, the city councils (who had a power to elect where the candidates had an equal number of votes) declared that ene A., a rival candidate, was elected ; and A. was accordingly installed into office. In a proceeding by <em>quo </em>warranto, taken by the United States on the relation of C., judgment of ouster was rendered against A.

His opposing candidate was one Addison. The electors having voted on the election day, the judges of election returned Crawford as the person elected. He accordingly presented himself to the city councils, and offered to take the usual oath. They, however, on a count made by themselves of the vote, declared that Addison was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>really elected. He and not Crawford was accordingly sworn into office and entered upon the duties of mayor. Crawford then proceeded by <em>quo warranto </em>in the Federal court of the District, to test Addison\u2019s right to the place; the proceeding being in the usual form of one by the United States at the relation of the party aggrieved; in this instance Crawford. On this proceeding the jury brought in a verdict that \u201c the votes received by each candidate make the vote a tie.\u201d The court, with the assent of Addison\u2019s attorney, refused to receive the verdict, and having directed the jury to return to their room and again consider of their verdict, they brought in a new verdict, on which a judgment of ouster was given. To review this judgment Addison took a writ of error from this court, giving a bond in $3000. The bond, which was to \u201c the United States of America,\u201d recited that the Circuit Court for the District in a suit of the United States <em>at the relation of </em>Crawford, had lately adjudged that Addison should not intermeddle with the office, privileges, franchises, &amp;c., of mayor, and that he \u201c be taken to satisfy the United States for his usurpation thereof, and that the said Crawford, relator, recover against Addison the sum of $-for his costs.\u201d And it bound Addison and his sureties, to \u201c prosecute the said writ of error with effect, and to answer <em>all damages and costs if he shall fail to make his plea good.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">The writ of error having been held by the Court of the District to be a <em>supersedeas </em>of the judgment of ouster, Crawford applied to this court in 1859 for a mandamus on the Circuit Court to enforce it, notwithstanding the writ of error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The arguments of his counsel in this court were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHP\">1st. That the matter in dispute being an office of personal confidence and trust, and not a thing capable of being bought, sold, or assigned, \u2014 it was not a thing which had a \u201c value \u201d within the act, which gave this court jurisdiction only when the matter in dispute was of the value of $1000 or more, and hence that the writ ought to be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">2d. That the two years \u2014 or term of office \u2014 for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Crawford was elected, would run out before tbe case brought up by the writ of error could be passed ou.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">The court, however, considered that the office having a salary, the case did present a.subject of \u201cvalue,\u201d and that salary being $1000, of the requisite value. As to the other matter they said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The bond and security given on the writ of error cannot be regarded as an idle ceremony. It was designed as an <em>indemnity to the defendant in </em>error, <em>should the plaintiff fail to prosecute with effect his writ.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">The mandamus was accordingly refused, and the writ of error suffered to stand, Addison in the meantime enjoying the mayoralty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-9\">In January, 1861, however, tbe writ of error was dismissed, and on the 21st of that <em>month </em>\u2014 a <em>large part of the term of office haring at this time of course passed </em>\u2014 Crawford got that possession of the mayoralty from which the writ of error had till now deprived him. He now brought suit on the writ of error bond in the name of the United States against Addison, the purpose being to recover the amount ($1104) received by Addison as salary from the date of the bond to the time when Crawford got the benefit of the judgment of ouster, a term as it appeared of one year one month and seven days, which he claimed as damages chargeable to the bond. The costs Addison had himself paid. The <em>narr. </em>alleged that Addison had <em>not </em>prosecuted his writ of error with effect, and that he did <em>not </em>answer ail damages and costs, in that he had not paid Crawford, at whose relation the suit recited in the bond was brought, $1000 a year, for the year and more in which he Addison was enjoying the office, and which sum he, Crawford, would have had for his own use but for the suing, out of the writ of error aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-10\">On the trial the plaintiff requested the court to instruct the jury as a second instruction, that if they should find that during the time in which Addison acted as mayor he received the salary, and that he did not prosecute his-writ of error with effect, then that- the plaintiff was entitled to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>cover the amount so received, and interest on it \u2014 provided they should also find that Crawford was duly elected and qualified as mayor, and that he continued and was ready and willing to discharge his duties, and was only prevented from so doing by the interference of Addison, and by his assuming to exercise the functions of the office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">The court refused to give such instruction; assigning as a reason among others for the refusal, that there was no evidence in the case that the defendant by his interference had prevented the plaintiff from the exercise of the office.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-6\"><em>Messrs. Carlisle and </em>Brent, <em>for </em>Crawford, <em>plaintiff in error :</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">Crawford\u2019s right to sue upon the bond in the way we now sue is settled by what was said by this court on the application for a mandamus. The court then settled also that the value of the mayoralty was its annual salary. All matter and question on it, then, are out of the way. As to the reason specified by the court below for refusing the second instruction asked, it is in the teeth of the evidence showing that the defendant, Addison, had interfered by exercising the duties of the relator\u2019s office, and by superseding the judgment of <em>ouster </em>by his writ of error bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>Messrs. Bradley and Wills, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-9\">1. The <em>quo warranto </em>was to try whether Addison had or had not usurped the office \u2014 noi <em>whether Crawford was entitled. </em>The judgment was a judgment of ouster of Addison, not restoration of Crawford. Addison had therefore a right to his writ of error; and, if he.failed on that writ, he was liable only for the costs. Those he has paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-10\">2. The councils had a right to look to the first finding of the jury, which indeed the court refused to receive <em>as a verdict </em>of a fact, but which, nevertheless, was a fact ascertained by the jury in a cause in which these two men were parties. This was one of the instruments of evidence upon which the duty of the councils to elect immediately arose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-11\">3. From the day after the date of the bond, Addison held the office of mayor, not by the old, but by a <em>new title, </em>de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>rived under the charter of the corporation \u2014 that is, by virtue of a new election by the city councils, authorized by the charter in case of a failure to elect by the popular vote in consequence of a tie vote. On this new element of the case, the court in the <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding pronounced no judgment, and in regard to <em>it </em>the judgment of ouster is irrelevant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">4. The instructions asked were erroneous :</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-7\">i. Because they assumed that the salary of the office had a pecuniary value <em>other </em>than as \u201c a compensation <em>for labor and services </em>performed\u201d in the discharge of the duties of that office, contrary to the law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-8\">ii. Because they assumed that the whole salary received by Addison after the date of the bond, was the measure of such damages; and not the actual damages to Crawford; that is, the profit of the office, if any; or the amount of the salary received by Addison, less the amount which Crawford did receive, or reasonably might have received for his services in some other branch of business during the same period of time. On this point the analogies of the law are decisive. In cases of breach of contract for wages, if the servant is illegally discharged, he is bound to seek other employment, so as to lessen the damages, and his right to recover the stipulated wages is subject to the right to deduct the wages which he could reasonably have earned during time asked by the remainder of the contract. In eases of breaches of contract for freight or lodgings, the claim is subject to be diminished by the amount of freight or rent received, or which might have been received by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"> See United States ex relatione Crawford v.

And so the court held, and refused the mandamus.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">When in January, 1861, the writ of error was dismissed, and the judgment of ouster against the defendant, Addison, was enforced, the relator was installed into office. He then brought the present suit on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">By the judgment of ouster against Addison, his right to the office of mayor was determined. The relator thereupon became entitled to the office, either by virtue of the declaration of the judges who had returned him' elected, or by virtue of that provision of the charter which enacts that the mayor shall hold over until his successor is elected. By the writ of error and the suspension bond the enforcement of the judgment was prevented, and until the writ was dismissed the relator was excluded from the office and deprived of the salary annexed to it. The amount of the salary received by the defendant, Addison, during the period of such deprivation, constitutes, under the decision in the mandamus case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the measure of the damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon the suspension bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The second instruction to the jury which the plaintiff requested correctly presents the law of the case, and should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The rule which measures the damages upon a breach of contract for wages or for freight, or for the lease of buildings, has no application. In these cases the party aggrieved must seek other employment, or other articles for carriage, or other tenants, and the damages recovered will be the difference between the amount stipulated and the amount actually received or paid. But no such rule can be applied to public offices of personal trust and confidence, the duties of which are not purely ministerial or clerical.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">An attempt is made to avoid the liability of the defendant, Addison, by showing that on the trial of the <em>quo warranto </em>the jury in the first instance returned a special verdict to the effect that there'was a tie in the votes cast for him and the relator respectively. This verdict is not evidence of the fact, for it was not received by the court, or in any way made matter of record. With the assent of the attorney of the defendant the court directed-the jury to retire to their room and consider of their verdict. They did retire, as directed, and returned the verdict upon which the judgment of ouster was entered. The original verdict was, therefore, of no weight as evidence for any purpose, and constituted no basis for the action of the councils of the city in the proceeding to elect the defendant, Addison, as upon a tie in the votes cast by the electors. That the members of the councils did not themselves place any reliance upon the validity of their action in this respect is evident from the subsequent installation of the plaintiff after the enforcement of the judgment of ouster.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">We are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">So ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> The United States ex relatione Crawford <em>v. </em>Addison, 22 Howard, 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\"> See Costigan <em>v. </em>The Mohawk and Hudson River Railroad Co., 2 Denio, 609.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
