By the term <em>title, </em>as used in this section, is meant a regular chain of transfer from or under the sovereignty of the soil; and <em>color of title </em>is constituted by a <em>consecutive chain </em>of such transfer down to him, her or them in possession, <em>without being regular; </em>as if one or more of the. memorials or muniments be not registered, or not duly registered, or be only in writing, or such like defect as may not extend to or include the want of intrinsic fairness and honesty; or when the party in possession shall hold the same by a certificate of head-right, warrant, or land-scrip, with a chain of transfer down to him, her or them in possession; and provided this section shall not bar the right of the government.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-9\">With this act in force Atchison brought suit against League to recover a lot of ground in Galveston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-10\">On the trial, it appeared that both parties claimed title under the Directors of the Galveston City Company, from whom the title was deraigned, to one Hasbrook. The plaintiff asserted himself to be the owner of Hasbrook\u2019s title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>through a deed from him to one Curtis. The defendant denied the validity of this deed to Curtis, alleging it to be a forgery, and claimed under a levy and sale of the property under a judgment against Hasbrook <em>posterior </em>to the alleged sale of Hasbrook to Curtis. The validity of this deed was one of the issues to be tried, one however uot involved iu the case as here presented. The defendants pleaded the statute whose fifteenth section as to limitation of three years is above quoted. On this point the plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">\u201c That, if the jury, under the instructions of the court, find a conveyance from Hasbrook and wife to Curtis to be valid, then the sheriff had no authority to make the levy, under the execution against Hasbrook, on the lot in question, or to make the deed to Atchison, and there is no such transfer of title from Has-brook to Atchison as will sustain the plea of limitation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">' The court refused the instruction, and whether it had done so rightly or not was the point for review here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-8\">The case was fully argued <em>in behalf of the plaintiff in error by Messrs. C. Robinson and W. G. </em>Hale,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI\">who relied on the fifteenth section above quoted, as clear of itself; citing in addition, however, by way of illustration, the statutes of\u2019Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and other States, and decisions upoD them, to show what possession ivas adverse.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-9\">\n<em>Messrs.

It is somewhat peculiar in its terms, and is well suited to the policy of a new State desirous to encourage emigration, and the settlement of its vacant lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">For this purpose the usual limitation of tweuty years, which alone would protect one -who had entered without title, was held insufficient. Hence the legislation of Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>reduced the term to ten years. This term was also reduced to five years when the disseizor entered with a claim of title under a recorded deed, and had paid the taxes and cultivated the land for that length of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The limitation of three years now under consideration was intended to protect settlers under junior grants emanating from the State of Texas against older titles under the former Mexican sovereignty, as well as a fraudulent issue of head-right certificates or land scrip under the Republic. This policy is clearly exhibited in this peculiar term and the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">As respects the instruction requested by the plaintiffs counsel, we are of the opinion that the court erred in refusing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">There was no dispute that the defendant purchased with full notice of the previous deed to Curtis. The only question was, whether this deed from the sheriff gave him such a title or color of title as is required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Unnecessary labor and learning has been expended by counsel, as to the construction of similar statutes in other States, and as to whether the possession of defendent was adverse or not. This section of the statute is its own interpreter. It was not made to protect mere adverse possession; it carefully defines th'e construction of the words used. By the term title, as used in this section, is meant \u201c <em>a regular chain of transfer </em>from, <em>or under the sovereignty of the soil; </em>and color of title is constituted by a consecutive chain of such transfer down to him or her or them in possession, without being regular, as if one or more of the memorials or instruments be not registered, or not duly registered, or be ouly in writing; <em>or such, like </em>defect,\u201d &lt;^e., $-c.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Now, this ease shows no such \u201c chain of title or transfer from the sovereignty,\u201d as to constitute either title or color of title. As defined by the act, a link in the chain is absent, which is necessary to make the whole one chain. It is not merely a defect or flaw in some link in the chaiu which may make it weak at that point, but there is no chain at all. A sale of *he sheriff on a judgment against \u201c A,\u201d confers nei <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ther title nor color of title to the property of \u201cB.\u201d In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Cragg,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court say: \u201cNor can there be color of title where there is a complete hiatus in the chain. Color of titles differs from titles only in externals. The substance of both is the same, were this not so. If color of title were something intrinsically and substantially less or weaker than title, then the wisdom of the legislature could not be vindicated,\u201d &amp;e. This construction of the statute as thus settled by the courts of Texas is conclusive, even if we doubted its correctness, which we do <em>not.</em></p>\n<headnotes id=\"AUg\">[See <em>infra, </em>next case, <em>Osterman </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>in regard to this same section 15 of the Texas statute of limitations. \u2014 Rep.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Judgment reversed, and a venire db novo awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A68\"> 24 Texas, 596.
