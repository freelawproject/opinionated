But at the time of the capture she was out of the ordinary and most direct line of a voyage from Yera Cruz to New Orleans, and somewhat along the coast and in a position to go to Galveston, Texas, then blockaded. She had encountered heavy weather before the capture and was somewhat damaged; and it was alleged by the master that he had abandoned the voyage to New Orleans, and was about returning to Yera Cruz. Having been brought into New Orleans and libelled as prize in the District Court, restitution was decreed and a certificate of reasonable cause given the captors. The United States appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>Mr. Ashton, special counsel of the United, States,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACs\">contended that the case exhibited but the ordinary sinuous devices of blockade-runners; simulating onevoyage, purposing another. The vessel was just where she wmuld have beeu had she been going to Galveston, and where she would not have been if going to New Orleans.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">Moreover at this time, as is matter of public history, New Orleans had been but recently opened to trade, and of course was glutted with the articles which this vessel carried. Coffee was higher in Yera Cruz than in New Orleans; and as for drugs, it was shipping \u201c coals to New Castle,\u201d to take them to the last-named port. Galveston, on the other hand, closely blockaded, was in extreme necessity of both.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-9\">\n<em>Mr. Marvin, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-10\">The CHIEF JUSTICE</author>\n<p id=\"AnV\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">The only ground of suspicion that a violation of the block<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ade was intended is the fact that the vessel, when captured, was out of the most direct regular course to New Orleans, and in a part of the gulf where she would very probably have been had her real destination been Galveston. But we think this is sufficiently accounted for by the weather, and by the probability that such a vessel, really bound for New Orleans, would prefer to keep at no greater distance from the shore than the blockade would require, rather than take the more direct course across the gulf.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">It was stated in the argument that the cargo of the vessel umuld not command at New Orleans so good a price as at Vera Cruz; and this circumstance, if proved, would be entitled to great weight. But there is no evidence of that sort in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On the whole, therefore, we think that the decree of the District Court was correct, and shall order that it be</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
