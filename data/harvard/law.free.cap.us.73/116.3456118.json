As the company was not at the moment ready to execute deeds, he received certificates of the purchase. These described-the purchased lots, acknowledged the receipt of the purchase-money, and added that Baldwin was entitled to receive a conveyance, so soon as the company was prepared to execute deeds in proper form. These certificates were made out in Baldwin\u2019s own name. The constitution of Texas, however, prohibiting aliens from holding lands there, he transferred them to James S. Holman, a Texan; the purpose having been'\u201c to place the lots in the hands of a citizen to watch over and protect them, for the payment of taxes and otherwise.\u201d No consideration moved from Holman, and the transfer was on an express agreement (made only by parol, however), that Holman was to hold the lots, and take a conveyance of them from the company, as Baldwin\u2019s trustee. The certificates were placed in an envelope, on which was indorsed a memorandum, thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">\u201cNo. 113.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-7\">\u201cJames S. Holman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-8\">\u201cLots No. 5 and 11, in block 617, &amp;e. &amp;c.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\">\u201cIn trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-10\">This envelope, with the certificates inclosed, was subsequently found in the.office of the company, having, as was said by the one side, been left there for safe keeping at the time, and by the other, having been brought there in order that a deed might issue to Holman, and surrendered and filed on the issue of a deed accordingly. The letters aud figures, \u201cNo. 113,\u201d indicated the number of the deed to be issued for these lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-11\">In September, 1846, the lots were levied on by the sheriff of Galveston Couuty, upon a judgment obtained by one McKinney against Holman. Notice was given to McKinney of Baldwin\u2019s ownership of the lots, aud that Holman had never had any iuterest in them, except as trustee for Baldwin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>At the sale, October 6th, 1846, full notice was read aloud by Baldwin\u2019s agent, to the persons assembled, of Baldwin\u2019s claim to the lots, and of the exact state of his title. The sale was then proceeded with, and one lot was struck of\u00ed to Osterman, others to other persons. The purchasers took possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">In May, 1850, <em>that is to say, more than three years after the sale, </em>Baldwin filed a bill in the District Court for the District of Texas, making the Galveston City Company, Holman, Osterman, McKinney, and others, defendants; and praying that the Galveston City Company might be directed to execute a conveyance in fee simple to him, that the sale and proceedings under the judgment and'execution against Holman might be declared void, and the defendants enjoined from setting up title under the same, and be ordered to deliver up possession of the lots held by them respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">The defences set up were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">1. Baldwin\u2019s alienage and consequent incapacity to hold; that even if the lands were meant to be held by Holman in trust for him, the trust was void; that on this part of the defence it mattered not whether there was a deed or certificate, Holman\u2019s estate, if but equitable, being liable to levy and sale; that however a deed was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\">2. That if these defences failed, the suit was barred by the statute of limitations of Texas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">As to the fact whether any deed had been made to Holman, the testimony was not quite consistent. On the one hand, the secretary of the company, the complainant\u2019s witness, testified thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-11\">\u201cWhenever the holder of a certificate wished a deed, he produced his certificate to the company and delivered up the same, and the company issued a deed to him. The certificate was then filed away in the records of the company. Books were kept showing the issue of deeds upon the certificates, by memorandum entered against the number of the lot. All the certificates in this case were filed away in the records of the company, in the same place and manner, with the certificates upon which d.eeds had been issued. The books and records of the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>bear the same evidence of a deed to Holman on these certificates, that they do of the issue of any deed whatever. If the records of the company are true, a deed issued to Holman. The memorandum No. 118, in the envelope, indicates that that was the number of the deed issued on the certificates.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">On the other hand, Holman himself remembered no deed: and one Edmunds, the ageut of McKinney, who seemed to manage the whole matter of the execution under a bargain for a large contingent share of its proceeds, twice examined the books of the City Company, once by himself and once (\u201c thinking it an important matter\u201d) with another person, an attorney-at-law, \u2014 and found that the books \u201c showed that no deed had then been issued,\u201d and that \u201cthe title still appeared to be by certificates in the name of Holman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">As respected a bar by the statute of limitations, the second defence set up, it appeared that the Texas act in its fifteenth section ran thus:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">\u201c Every suit to be instituted to recover real estate as against him, her or them in possession under title or color of title, shall be instituted within three years next after the cause of action shall have accrued, and not afterwards. By the term <em>title </em>as used in this section, is meant a regular chain of transfer from or under the sovereignty of the soil; aDd color of title is constituted by a consecutive chain of such transfer down to him, her or them in possession, without being regular; as if one or more of the memorials or muniments be not registered or not duly registered, or be only in writing, or such like defect as may not extend to or include the want of intrinsic fairness and honesty; or when the party in possession shall hold the same by a certificate of head-right, land warrant or land scrip, with a chain of transfer down to him, her or them in possession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-9\">The District Court decreed in favor of the complainant. The purchasers appealed; Holman and the company not denying Baldwin\u2019s equities, and acquiescing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\n<em>Messrs. Adams, Coombs, and Ballinger, for the appellants:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-6\">1. The evidence of the deed\u2019s having issued, greatly preponderates over that of its having not issued. The possession by the company among <em>its </em>papers, of the certificates, the only evidence of individual ownership, and the testimony of the secretary of the company, offered a strong presumption that there was a deed. The purpose of conveying to Holman was that a deed should issue to him. It matters not, however, as respects this branch of the defence, whether Holman\u2019s title were legal or equitable, if /\u00a1ehad the real title \u2014 of any kind. Equities can be levied on in Texas as well as legal estates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-7\">2. He had such title. It having been illegal for the complainant to hold lands in Texas at the date of these assignments, the law did not imply, create ornllow any trust whatever in his favor, nor create one in favor of the government of Texas; but Holman took and held the property free and clear of any trust or right whatever for or on the part of Baldwin or the government.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-8\">Nor did the admission of Texas into the Union help the matter. The law not having previously raised or recognized any trust in behalf of Baldwin, nor of the government as the sovereign, by escheat or other paramount right, no trust or right of any kind in his favor was created by that political act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-9\">At best, the only evidence of any trust in favor of Baldwin was parol; a dangerous sort of proof on which to rest the title to real estate; and a sort which the British statute of frauds would not allow to be given in such a case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-10\">3. If Holman was thus the sole owner \u2014 either legal or equitable \u2014 Baldwin had no title, and the various notices were of no value. They were notices of nullities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-11\">\"Waiving all these points, however, we have above and independent of the other defence\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>4. <em>The Statute of Limitations. </em>If the Galveston City Company made a deed to Holman, then the appellants had a \u201c regular chain of transfer\u201d with the single exception from its regularity that the deed to Holman was not recorded, a circumstance which confessedly would not affect it. We have referred to the evidence of the existence of the deed. \u201cA regular chain of transfer\u201d relates to the deeds, the muniments, the paper evidences of right. If on their face, they constitute a title, the%ctual nature of that title, arising from extrinsic facts, from the existence of a superior or better title, either in the first link by a previous grant from the government, or in any subsequent link by a previous better conveyance, is unimportant. If possession be held three years under a chain of deeds from the sovereignty of the soil, by the 15th section the character of the actual title at any point of the chain is unimportant.' \u201cIntrinsic fairness and honesty \u201d is not a question where a regular chain of transfer is shown. They apply to <em>color of title </em>where the transfers are not regular. But the meaning is, not that the consecutive chain of transfer, or any link of it, must be fair and honest in relation to the adverse, better title, but simply that if one or more of the links, instead of being a regular deed \u2014 for instance, from A. or B. \u2014 is such a transfer of the right of A. or B., whatever that right is, as amounts fairly and honestly to a conveyance of it, then it constitutes color of title. In short, \u201c title \u201d is <em>legal; </em>\u201c color of title \u201d is <em>equitable.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Messrs.

But the defendants cannot object on that ground. Until office found, Baldwin was competent to hold land against third persons. No one has any right to complain in a col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>lateral proceeding, if the sovereign does not enforce his prerogative. This court, in <em>Cross </em>v. <em>De Valle,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>say: \u201c That an alien may take by deed, or devise, and hold against any one but the sovereign, until office found, is a familiar principle of law, which it requires no citation of authorities to establish.\u201d Even if the defendants could have made this objection, while the Republic of Texas existed, they cannot make it now, because, when Texas was admitted into the Union, the alienage of Baldwin was deterfnioed. His present status is that of a person naturalized, and that naturalization has a retroactive effect, so as to be deemed a waiver of all liability to forfeiture, and a confirmation of his former title.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">It is insisted the legal title to the lots in controversy, is in Holman, by deed from the Galveston City Company, and if so, that the execution against Holman was properly levied on them, and they were rightfully sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">There is evidence tending to show a deed to Holman, but it falls short of proving it. It is almost certain a deed was never made, and quite certain, if made, it was never delivered. Holmau, who ought to know, has no recollection about it, and he is fortified by Edmunds (the active agent in hunting up property to levy on), who swears, the books of the company were examined, and did not show the making of the deed \u2014 a matter deemed of importance by him and his attorney. The deed is not produced; is not recorded; the directors who must have executed it, are not called; and its existence is but a matter of conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Even if made and delivered, it cannot help the title of the defendants, for the sheriff sold with express notice of Baldwin\u2019s rights, and his intention to enforce them, and no one who bought can be considered an innocent purchaser for value. If Holman had the bare, naked, legal title, without any beneficial interest in the property sold, and no possession, nothing passed by the sale. <em>A </em>purchaser, at a sheriff\u2019s sale, buys precisely the interest which the debtor has in the property sold, and takes subject to all outstanding equities.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>But no deed was, in fact, made, and the legal title is still in the Galveston City Company. If, in equity Baldwin is entitled to have that title conveyed to him, the defence in this case must fail, unless the plea of the statute of limita-, tions can be successfully maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">It is proven, beyond dispute, that Baldwin purchased the lots and paid the money for them, and that Holman had no interest in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">It is in equal proof, that Holman agreed to hold them in trust for Baldwin \u2014 the object being to place them in the hands of a citizen of Texas, who could pay taxes and protect them. The trust, thus created, is an express trust \u2014 hot one resulting by implication of law \u2014 proved, it is true, by parol, but equally efficacious for the purposes of this suit, as if in writing. The declaration of an express trust, under the statute of frauds of 29 Charles II, was required to be in writing, and could not be proved by oral testimony. But the courts in Texas hold, that trusts are not embraced in their statute of frauds,'and that a trust may be proven as at common law, by parol evidence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The equitable title is, therefore, in Baldwin, and there is no reason why he should not have the legal title also, unless his rights are cut off by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The defendants claim that they have possessed the land peaceably for more than three years, under title, or color of title, derived from the sovereign authority, thus claiming the benefit of the fifteenth section of the act of limitations of Texas.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> But this claim is unavailing, because one link in \u201c the chain of transfer,\u201d from the government down to the defendants, is broken. There is no conveyance from the Galveston City Company to Holman. A \u201c consecutive chain of transfer\u201d is required by the statute, and the writing possessed by Holmau is not, in any legal sense, a link in that chain. It does not purport to convey title. It is nothing more than a declaration by the company of the purchase of the lots, the payment of the money, and the intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>make deeds, when prepared to do so. If this writing, upon its face, professed to pass title, but failed to do it, either because the city company had no title, or for want of proper execution, it could be used as color of title. But an agreement to convey title at some future period, is not color of title, within the meaning of the law.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AVI\">[See <em>supra, </em>preceding ease, <em>League </em>v. <em>Atchison, </em>in regard to this same statute of limitations in Texas. \u2014 Rep.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Supreme Court of Texas has decided the precise question here presented. That learned court, in discussing this subject, in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Cragg,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>say : \u201c Nor can there be color of title, as defined by the statute, where there is a complete hiatus in the chain. Color of title differs from title only in externals. The substance of both is the same. Were this not so, if color of title were something intrinsically and substantially less, or weaker than title, then the wisdom of the legislature could not be vindicated in applying the same period of limitation to a possession supported by the one as is applied to a possession supported by the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> 1 Wallace, 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\"> Jackson <em>v. </em>Beach, 1 Johnson\u2019s Cases, 401.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\"> Miller <em>v. </em>Thatcher, 9 Texas, 484.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\"> Hartley\u2019s Digest, Art. 2391.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-14\"> 24 Texas, 596.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
