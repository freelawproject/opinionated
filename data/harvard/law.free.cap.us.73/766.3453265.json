A full pardon and amnesty by the President for all offences committed by the owner of property seized under the act of Congress of August 6th, 1861, \u201c to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\u201d and which makes property used in aid of the rebellion, with the consent of the owner, subject to seizure, confiscation, and condemnation, relieves such owner from the forfeiture of the <em>property </em>seized so far as the right accrues to the United States.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b782-10\">2. The proceedings under the act relating to a seizure of land, present a case of common -law jurisdiction, the proceedings in which are to be conformed, in respect to trial by jury and exceptions to evidence, to the course of the common law, and a final decision in which can be reviewed here only on writ of error.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b782-11\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for the Eastern District .of Louisiana, the proceeding below being one for condemnation of pi\u2019operty as used in aid of the rebellion, and resembling in its' general featux*es the case just disposed of. It was thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b782-12\">An act of Congress passed August 6th, 1861, \u201c to confis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>cate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> enacted that property used in aid of the rebellion with consent of the owner, should be the lawful subject of <em>prize </em>and <em>capture </em>wherever found, and made it the duty of the President to cause it <em>\u201c </em>to be seized, confiscated, and condemned.\u201d It enacted further that \u201c such <em>prizes </em>and <em>captures </em>shall be condemned in the District or Circuit Court of the United States having jurisdiction of the amount, or in <em>admiralty </em>in any district in which they may be seized, or into which they may be taken,\u201d &amp;e. And the attorney-general or any district attorney was to institute proceedings of condemnation himself, or by aid of an informer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-6\">Under this act a libel of information was filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana, in which it was charged, that certain property in New Orleans, known as Armstrong\u2019s Foundry, had been seized as forfeited to the United States by reason of having been used, with the consent of the owner, in aid of the rebellion. This libel closed with the usual prayer for condemnation. A claim was interposed by John Armstrong as owner, and another claim was interposed by the Citizens\u2019 Bank as mortgagee. Armstrong also pfieaded the amnesty offered by President Lincoln, and his acceptance of it and compliance with the terms. On the hearing the plea of pardou was rejected, and a decree of condemnation was rendered. Armstrong alone appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-7\">Subsequently, and while the cause was pending in this court, the President of the United States granted to \u201c the said <em>John Armstrong </em>a full pardon and <em>amnesty </em>for all offences by him committed, arising from participation, direct or implied, in the said rebellion, conditioned as follows.\u201d Certain conditions were annexed. At this term Armstrong was allowed, in conformity with the usual course in admiralty cases, to plead the new' matter, and to file with his plea a statement of facts agreed between his counsel and the Attorney-General, showing, among other things, that he had complied wfith all the conditions of the pardon granted to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b784-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The question now on the appeal was, whether this pardon relieved from forfeiture <em>the property </em>seized.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b784-6\">\n<em>Mr. Stanbery, Attorney-General, and Mr. Ashton, special counsel for the United Slates:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b784-7\">1. \u201cA pardon,\u201d this court declared in <em>Ex parte Garland,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c reaches both the <em>punishment </em>prescribed for the <em>offence </em>and the guilt of the <em>offender ; </em>and when the pardon is full, it releases the <em>punishment, </em>and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the <em>offender </em>is as innocent as if he had never committed the <em>offence. </em>The effect of this pardon, then, is to relieve the petitioner from all penalties and disabilities attached to the <em>offence </em>of treason committed by his participation in the rebellion.\u201d But this is the extent of a pardon. It cannot reach a forfeiture of <em>property </em>imposed, in virtue of the unlawful predicament in which the property may be found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b784-8\">Now, the act of August 6th, 1861, does not affect property with liability to condemnation as a punishment for any offence of the owners, but as a means of suppressing the insurrection, then flagrant, by depriving those engaged thereiu of property subject to their control, and dedicated to their uses. The property is made the \u201c lawful subject of prize and capture wherever found.\u201d These words draw the property in question within the category of enemy property, and establish a rule of <em>capture.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b784-9\">2. But however affecting the interest of the United States, it cannot operate to remit the moiety which accrues to the informer.

Under a statute of municipal forfeiture, such as this, proceedings for the condemnation of property seized on land, without the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, are, <em>ex necessitate rei, </em>according to the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>of the common law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> If reversed, the proceedings should follow that course.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b785-6\"><em>Mr. Humphrey </em>Marshall, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 319.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\"> 4 Wallace, 380.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b784-12\"> 4 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, 309; 2 Hawkins, 6, 392; Comyn\u2019s Digest, Pardon, F.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-14\"> 1 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 376; La Vengeance, 3 Dallas, 297; United States <em>v </em>Sally, 2 Crarch, 406; United States <em>v. </em>Betsy, 4 Id. 443; The Samuel, 2 Wheaton 9; The Octavia, Id. 20; The Sarah, 8 Id. 391.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b785-7\">The CHIEF JUSTICE</author>\n<p id=\"AsR\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Upon the case presented, it is necessary to\u2018consider a single question only.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">It was insisted, in argument, that the pardon pleaded by the appellant cannot avail to relieve him from the forfeiture of the property seized, because the liability to seizure arose, under the statute, from the mode in which the property was employed, and was not to be regarded as a penal consequence of the act of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">\u00a5e are unable to concur in this view. \"We think it clear that the statute regarded the consent of the owner to the employment of his property in aid of the rebellion as an offence, and inflicted forfeiture as a penalty. The general pardon of Armstrong, therefore, relieved him of so much of the penalty as \"accrued to the United States. We think it unnecessary to express any opinion at present in relation to the rights of the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">The proceedings below related to a seizure of land, and though conducted under the statute in the forms of admiralty, must be regarded as a case of common law jurisdiction, a final decision in which can be reviewed here only on writ of error</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">The decree of the Circuit Court, therefore, must be reversed as irregular, and the cause remanded, with directions to allow a new trial, the proceedings in which shall be conformed, in respect to trial by jury and exceptions to evidence, to the course of the common law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b785-13\">Mr. Justice MILLER, dissented.</judges>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">At the same time with the two preceding cases was decided, on appeal from the same circuit <em>(Mr. Durant, for the appellant), </em>the ease of St. Louis Street Foundry; not distinguishable, \u2014 as the Chief Justice stated was the opinion of the court, \u2014 in principle from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">It appeared in it that Cronan, in the Circuit Court, pleaded the amnesty proclaimed by President Lincoln on the 8th of December, 1863, and the oath taken by himself in pursuance of the proclamation; but there was no averment in this plea that Cronan was not within any of certain exceptions made by that proclamation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b786-8\">The CHIEF JUSTICE</author>\n<p id=\"Aiy\">delivered the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">The plea was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">Upon proper pleading and proof, however, the claimant of property seized under the act of August 6th, 1861, is entitled to the benefit of amnesty to the same extent as, under like pleading and proof, he would be entitled to the benefit of pardon.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">The decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed as irregular, and the cause remanded, with directions to allow a new trial, the proceedings in which shall be conformed, in respect to trial by jury and exceptions to evidence, to the course of the common law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-15\"> See the Gray Jacket, 5 Wallace, 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
