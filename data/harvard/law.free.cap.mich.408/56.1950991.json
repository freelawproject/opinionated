The issue is whether it was error to permit, over objection, cross-examination of Henderson concerning his financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We hold that it was not, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate Henderson\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Henderson was convicted of arson of real property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and embezzlement over $100.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charges arose out of a fire and theft at the service station which Henderson managed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The station was found in flames. When they were extinguished the combination safe was found open and empty of money. Over $1,400 was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">There was no evidence of forced entry into the building or safe. The main power panel controlling the gasoline pumps had been unlocked. The padlocks on the individual pumps were found open and undamaged. The hoses from the pumps were stretched out and the nozzles locked open to continually dispense gasoline toward the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The door to the interior storeroom was unlocked and standing open. The contents of the storeroom had been drenched in gasoline. From the length of the pump hoses and the slope of the driveway, it appeared that this gasoline had been carried in and poured from a container.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The fire was started by igniting the flowing gasoline. It was extinguished before reaching the storeroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The employees assigned to the station were Henderson and Samuel Chapman, an attendant. Both had keys to the front door, the main power panel and the pumps. Only Henderson had a key to the storeroom, but a duplicate set was kept in the safe. Only Henderson and his district manager were given the combination to the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">There was eyewitness testimony tending to identify Henderson as the person who set the fire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He presented an alibi defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>A split panel of the Court of Appeals reversed Henderson\u2019s conviction<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the basis of the following colloquy during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\"><em>\"Q. </em>How was your financial situation back in August of 1975?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\"><em>\"A. </em>Not bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>How about not good?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\"><em>\"A. </em>Not bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\"><em>\"Q. </em>Didn\u2019t Consumers Power on July 28th, \u201975 turn off your power?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">\"A.

In closing argument, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\"Think about it. There\u2019s a man with two cents in his pocket and he hasn\u2019t worked for a long time, there\u2019s three guns, three fully loaded weapons in the vehicle. That is something you can consider when you decide whether or not this defendant committed this particular violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">We reversed Johnson\u2019s conviction, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\"Obviously neither poverty nor unemployment is an element of the crime of carrying a concealed weapon. Either a poor man or a rich man may be either guilty or innocent of carrying a concealed weapon. Likewise whether a man is employed or unemployed is no proof or partial proof of carrying a concealed weapon. * * * In short, these things neither in law nor in logic are evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">We found an abuse of discretion in allowing \"inquiries designed to demonstrate a causal connection between extraneous matters and guilt on the charge.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The Court of Appeals has subsequently ruled on the admissibility of evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition in diverse factual and procedural settings. The Court has not seen <em>Johnson </em>as announcing a per se rule that evidence of financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>condition is never admissible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It has, however, been sensitive to the need to scrutinize the admission of such evidence because of its potential prejudicial impact, and has indicated awareness that decisions admitting such evidence might provide a precedent which would, in practice, weigh more heavily on the poor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals, in holding the evidence inadmissible, said that it could not \"permit routine proof of impecuniousness to establish the motive for a theft offense\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It concluded that the evidence was legally irrelevant because its probative value, which it found to be \"very low\u201d,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was outweighed by its prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>effect on poor persons as a class. The Court found that this would be so even if it applied a rule that, on its face, did not discriminate against the poor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\"It may be argued that we should permit proof of the origins of each person\u2019s desire for money, whether it be want, or well-fed cupidity. However, greed would not readily be proved. Poverty would. Hence we cannot, consistent with equal treatment to the poor and the well-to-do, indulge ourselves in the fiction that the motive of each may be shown at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In his brief in this Court, Henderson echoes the Court of Appeals concern for avoiding class-based discrimination. Citing a New Jersey case, <em>State v </em>Mathis,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for the proposition that \"there must be something more than poverty to tie a defendant into a criminal milieu\u201d, and a Federal case, <em>Davis v United States,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that \"[w]here the evidence elicited only demonstrates that the defendant is 'poor,\u2019 the inquiry is improper\u201d, and arguing that admission of such evidence necessarily rests on the premise that \"poor people have greater motive to commit theft crimes\u201d, Henderson warns that \"[b]y allowing evidence of financial condition to be used to show motive in a theft offense, this Court would be permitting economic and social status to be routinely used against a defendant\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>We agree with the propositions quoted above from <em>Mathis </em>and <em>Davis. </em>There is a need to avoid undue prejudice in individual cases and to prevent establishment of a \"two-tiered standard of justice\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> weighing more heavily on the poor. And we recognize that evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition, because it ordinarily has limited probative value and usually goes to a collateral issue, will often distract rather than aid the jury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Our decision reversing the Court of Appeals does not, however, allow \"routine use\u201d of evidence of financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>and most of the post <em>-Johnson </em>Court of Appeals cases involving similar issues, concerned evidence that the defendant was unemployed and poor.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s proofs in the instant case, rather than showing unemployment, established that Henderson was not only employed, but held a managerial position. The evidence that his electricity was shut off for non-payment, viewed in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>of this evidence of employment, carried with it no suggestion that Henderson was \"poor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">There is a difference between evidence of poverty and unemployment \u2014 evidence that a person is chronically short of funds \u2014 and evidence of the sort involved in this appeal, showing that a person is experiencing a shortage of funds that appears to be novel or contrary to what one would expect is typically felt by such a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Evidence of poverty, dependence on public welfare, unemployment, underemployment, low paying or marginal employment, is not admissible to show motive.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The probative value of such evidence is diminished because it applies to too large a segment of the total population.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Its prejudicial impact, though, is high. There is a risk that it will cause jurors to view a defendant as a \"bad man\u201d\u2014 a poor provider, a worthless individual.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Other evidence of financial condition may, however, be admissible in the circumstance of a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Henderson was not charged with an ordinary theft offense such as larceny, robbery or breaking and entering. He was charged with embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">As the Court of Appeals observed in the instant case, \"[t]he motive for a theft offense seldom requires explanation\u201d.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Motive in the typical case is a collateral issue of minimal importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Embezzlement, however, is not a typical theft offense. The embezzler, by definition, begins from a position of trust, and is usually gainfully em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ployed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In the instant case, the evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief unavoidably showed that Henderson was employed in a managerial position, that only Henderson and his district supervisor knew the combination to the service station safe, and that Henderson was the only person to have a key to the storeroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In these circumstances, the question of motive took on a significance not present in the typical theft case. Jurors may have wondered why Henderson, enjoying both gainful employment and his employer\u2019s trust, would breach that trust and risk losing his employment. In short, the motive for <em>this </em>theft offense \"require[d] explanation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Federal courts have referred to evidence of poverty to show motive as a \"forbidden theme\u201d,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but have recognized that \"the special nature of the crime charged may justify the use of evidence of financial embarrassment in order to show the accused\u2019s knowledge and motive, as where one is charged with embezzlement or similar financial misconduct\u201d.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">What marks embezzlement and similar offenses<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> is that the factual setting in which those crimes occur \u2014 a position of trust, gainful employment\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>generally causes one to wonder about the defendant\u2019s motive.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">This is not to say that evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition is admissible whenever embezzlement or a similar crime is charged, regardless of the nature of the evidence or the circumstances in which it is introduced. In this regard, we note that the testimony showing that Henderson\u2019s electricity had been shut off was not necessarily probative of an acute and seemingly atypical need for money at the time of the offense; mere financial embarrassment is not such a need. A judge may, in the exercise of discretion, bar evidence of financial embarrassment when persuaded that it is insufficiently probative of need. Henderson did not seek to invoke the judge\u2019s discretion in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate Henderson\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-7\">Coleman, C.J., and Williams, Levin, Fitzgerald, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-11\"> MCL 750.73; MSA <em>28.268.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-12\">MCL 750.174; MSA 28.371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> On Sunday, August 24, Chapman worked at the station alone, and closed up as usual at 8 p.m. Loretta McGuire testified that she drove past the station twice that evening. Shortly after 8 p.m. she observed a black man pumping gasoline into a \"beige-looking\u201d car which she was \"quite sure\u201d was a hard top. Shortly before 11 p.m., she observed the same man pumping gas into the same car parked in the same position. At both times the station\u2019s interior lights were on.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Mrs. McGuire\u2019s testimony was substantially corroborated by her 12-year-old son, Jeffrey, who was in the car with her both times. Jeffrey said the car into which the gasoline was being pumped was a two-door model, \"something like a Pontiac\u201d. At trial, neither Mrs. McGuire nor Jeffrey could identify Henderson as the man they had seen. They had identified him in a post-arrest line-up, but a lawyer associated with the Grand Rapids Defenders Office testified that Mrs. McGuire told him that, although she thought she recognized Henderson at the lineup, she did not feel confident saying so until she leaned over and looked at a slip of paper on which another witness had written Henderson\u2019s line-up number.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Martha Mekkes testified that as she was driving past the station between 1 and 1:30 a.m. on August 25, she saw flames shoot up from the back of the building. A gold-colored Pontiac driven by a black man then darted out from between the pumps and the building, nearly sideswiping her in the process. Ms. Mekkes identified Henderson\u2019s gold-colored Pontiac convertible as the car she had seen that night from a group of seven photographs shown her by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The police officer assigned to patrol the area in which the station was located observed a man walking away from the pumps at about 10:30 p.m. on August 24, carrying something which required the use of both hands. He drove past again, about 15 minutes later, and observed no one there. At approximately 1 a.m. he observed what appeared to be the same man on the station premises. At trial he identified Henderson as the man he had seen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\"> Henderson testified that on Sunday the 24th he, Dorothy Starrs (with whom he was living), Dorothy\u2019s mother, and Leslie Sherman went to visit Dorothy\u2019s brother. They arrived back in Grand Rapids at about 8:30 p.m. and stopped first at Dorothy\u2019s mother\u2019s house. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>about 8:45, he, Dorothy and Leslie stopped at the home of Dorothy\u2019s father, Roy Sherman. At about 9:15, en route home, he stopped to check the station since he had not personally closed up that night, and then returned home. He fell asleep watching television, was briefly awakened by Warnell Martin, who visited shortly after 11, and then went to bed and slept until about 1:30 when he was awakened by a call from Roy informing him that the station was on fire. Henderson\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Dorothy, Roy and Warnell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-22\"> <em>People v Henderson, </em>80 Mich App 447; 264 NW2d 22 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b225-17\"> <em>People v Henderson, </em>403 Mich 825; 267 NW2d 698 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b226-12\"> <em>People v Johnson, </em>393 Mich 488; 227 NW2d 523 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b226-13\"> <em>Id., </em>p 496.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b226-14\"> <em>Id., </em>p 499.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> See, <em>e.g., People v Jackson, </em>77 Mich App 392, 400; 258 NW2d 89 (1977); <em>People v Baldwin, </em>74 Mich App 700, 708; 254 NW2d 619 (1977); <em>People v Thomas Jones, </em>73 Mich App 107, 109; 251 NW2d 264 (1976).
