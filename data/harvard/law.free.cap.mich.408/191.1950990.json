From that premise it is further concluded that lunchtime activities are also a \"circumstance\u201d of one\u2019s employment and \"incidental to the employment\u201d, and that <em>a fortiori </em>injuries suffered during those activities are compensable as arising out of and in the course of that employment, regardless of whether the injury occurs on or off the premises where the work is to be done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">We cannot subscribe to that combination of appellate fact-finding and reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Our brothers, writing for reversal of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board decision and reaffirmance of <em>McClure </em>I, would add this case to a line of recent decisions in which this Court has expanded and broadened the sweep of workers\u2019 compensation coverage by judicial decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>To follow that course here would see this Court effect more worker compensation law \"reform\u201d of its own, unchecked by burdensome legislative committee hearings, union and management testimonial expertise, cost analyses, consideration of the effect upon related social legislation and the risk of rejection following bicameral debate or of executive veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We decline to continue the ongoing dilution of the legislative requirement that, as a condition of compensability, an employee\u2019s injury must be suffered \"out of and in the course of his employment\u201d by first equating \"circumstance of employment\u201d with \"out of and in the course of employment\u201d, and finally substituting the newly created judicial standard for the longstanding legislative norm. We cannot agree with our colleagues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\"The significant inquiry in the instant cases is not whether the employees were injured while carrying out duties absolutely required by their employment contracts, but whether the injuries occurred as a circumstance of the employment relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We are of the view, of course, that neither of the stated alternatives is the \"significant inquiry\u201d; that the significant inquiry is whether the injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>arose \"out of and in the course of his employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">By this case, the Court is asked to extend the scope of workers\u2019 compensation coverage in three inter-related ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">1. To that <em>time segment </em>of the worker\u2019s day historically and intentionally allocated to the employee for an interruption of and withdrawal from the service of the employer, traditionally understood to be mealtime,</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">2. To <em>any activity </em>whether performed \"out of and in the course of his employment\u201d, or not, in which the employee may be engaged during that period, and</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">3. To <em>any place </em>in which the employee may be during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Apparently unwilling to declare this requested extension ofi workers\u2019 compensation coverage to be the new law it is, three of our brothers claim merely to be following the lead of <em>Howard v Detroit, supra, </em>stating that they \"are still convinced of the soundness of [its] rationale\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">In <em>Howard, </em>a municipal bus driver was required on the day in question to work a split shift. He drove his bus from 7:05 a.m. until 8:45 a.m., and was scheduled to drive again from 1:25 p.m. to 7:54 p.m. During the five-hour interval for which he was paid his hourly wages, and as a consequence of which he was paid an overtime rate at the end of his day, the driver left the terminal, conducted some personal business, went home for lunch and, while returning to the terminal in his car, was injured in an auto accident. With heavy reliance upon the earlier case of <em>Bisdom v Kerbrat, </em>251 Mich 316; 232 NW 408 (1930), a divided Court reversed an appeal board denial of benefits, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\"In <em>[Bisdom v Kerbrat], </em>plaintiff was en route to his dinner, rather than returning thereafter, but the special circumstance was created by a <em>specif\u00edc requirement of his employment on that day. </em>It resulted from a direct order from his employer and had no application to any other day. <em>The essential point abides. The circumstance was a deviation from his regular normal working schedule. </em>It was for his employer\u2019s benefit and was an incident of his contract of employment. Thus it was that a circumstance of his employment placed him where he was at the time of his accidental injury. So too, it was a circumstance of his employment that placed plaintiff in this case where he was when he was accidentally injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\"In this case, also, plaintiff had not finished his day\u2019s work. We agree with the dissenting opinion [of the WCAB] that <em>the facts presented in </em>Bisdom <em>are sufficiently analogous to warrant its application here.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\"><em>Bisdom </em>and <em>Howard, </em>properly read, are cases standing for the proposition that when on a given day an employee, in obedience to the employer\u2019s direction to deviate from \"the regular normal working schedule\u201d and to enter upon an interrupted and irregular schedule, including a mandatory period of \"swing run\u201d inactivity, is injured, his injuries are suffered \"out of and in the course of his employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The significance of the <em>Howard </em>Court\u2019s statement that \"it was a circumstance of his employment that placed plaintiff in this case where he was when accidentally injured\u201d is in the context of employer-ordered departure from a normal work schedule of uninterrupted service.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The facts in <em>Bisdom </em>and <em>Howard, </em>which the <em>Howard </em>Court said were \"sufficiently analogous to warrant\u201d the same result, are totally distinguishable from those in <em>McClure </em>and <em>Krolczyk. </em>In neither of the cases before us did the lunchtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>activities involve an employer-directed deviation from the worker\u2019s regular normal working schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Ignoring the difference, our colleagues lift the \"circumstance of his employment\u201d language from the \"deviation from his regular normal working schedule\u201d context of <em>Howard </em>and <em>Bisdom </em>and apply it to the off-premises injuries suffered by Mr. McClure and Ms. Krolczyk during their regularly scheduled normal workday lunch hour break to create a \"circumstance\u201d by which there is entitlement to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We reject that approach because it ignores the legislative requirement that, to be compensable, the injury must occur \"out of and in the course of\u2019 the worker\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">It may indeed have been a \"circumstance\u201d of Mr. McClure\u2019s employment that he was in the middle of Fort Street, and of Ms. Krolczyk\u2019s that she was driving a car a half-mile away from work during the lunch period, but the Legislature has not yet seen fit to provide compensation for injuries suffered by workers during off-premises lunch-hour activity of a purely personal character. Perhaps it ought to have done so long ago \u2014 but it has not, and we are not constitutionally free to do so in its place. Like it or not, the test for entitlement to compensation benefits remains \"out of and in the course of\u2019 employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The rationale employed by the New Jersey court in <em>Wyatt v Metropolitan Maintenance Co, </em>74 NJ 167; 376 A2d 1222 (1977), and <em>Hornyak v The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>63 NJ 99; 305 A2d 65 (1973), upon which our colleagues rely, is even less persuasive than what we perceive to be the misapplication of the \"circumstance of employment\u201d language of <em>Howard. </em>We share the concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>expressed by Professor Larson<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in his critique of the <em>Hornyak </em>case and adopt his argument as having signal applicability to today\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\"Let us assume the case of an ordinary office worker in a downtown Newark office building, with an hour off for lunch, during normal daytime work. The worker sets out on foot, and a half-hour later is found somewhere in Newark, beaten and robbed in an amusement arcade, a pool room, a porno movie, or a massage parlor. Has the New Jersey court prepared itself <em>now </em>for the prospect of explaining how this was 'reasonably incidental\u2019 to the employment? If not, what stands between it and the necessity of calling these cases compensable? Will it resort to a case-by-case attempt to label some such excursions deviations? On what principle? In its opinion it quotes a Hawaii case, <em>Dependents of Pacheo v Orchids of Hawaii </em>[54 Hawaii 66; 502 P2d 1399 (1972)]. 'An employer may derive substantial benefits from an employee who is allowed time away from the job to accomplish pressing personal business.\u2019 Thus, if an employee on the way to lunch deviated a block to buy a record, the New Jersey court would no doubt find this deviation insubstantial. Where is the line between this and the poolroom? Both relate to recreational activities of the employee. Moreover, all this presupposes that one knows (as in <em>Hornyak) </em>where the employee was going at the time of injury. In downtown Newark there are restaurants in all directions. If the employee is mugged, run over, or hit by a falling brick anywhere in town during lunch hour, is it to be presumed that he was on his way to lunch, or on a permissible deviation, provided only the incident occurred during that hour?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\"Now suppose the case of a young female automobile assembly-line worker who never eats lunch. She uses the lunch hour to run personal errands, visit friends, and window-shop. She is injured when a bookcase falls on her while she is browsing in a bookstore. Is this to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>be considered reasonably incidental to automobile manufacture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\"Millions of workers go home for lunch. Presumably this trip will also be covered, along with an incalculable variety of deviations along the way. Where will coverage stop? At the employee\u2019s premises? At his front steps? Inside his door? Or perhaps he will be covered inside his own house for the entire period, while eating, and perhaps while doing little incidental things around the house. After all, how can one distinguish downtown deviations and home deviations? Perhaps he tries to fix a light switch, or chops some wood, or cleans his shotgun, or merely falls down the basement stairs with an armload of canning jars. Or perhaps he gets food poisoning from his wife\u2019s cooking. If this is not to be called 'reasonably incidental\u2019 to his employment, someone had better think out in advance where the stopping point is, and what [its] rationale is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">As the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board found with conclusively binding effect, the off-premises lunchtime auto accidents which resulted in Mr. McClure\u2019s death and Ms. Krolczyk\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of their employments and thus, as the Court of Appeals has held, are not in law compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-7\">Coleman, C.J., and Fitzgerald, J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b373-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_F\"><em>(for affirmance). </em>The plaintiffs sought worker\u2019s compensation benefits for injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents. The accidents occurred off the employers\u2019 premises and at lunchtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The issue is whether the injuries arose \"out of and in the course of\u2019 the employment within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>meaning of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">I would hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">(1) Injuries sustained in off-premises motor vehicle accidents during the normal lunch period do not arise \"out of and in the course of\u2019 the employment. An award of compensation, although consistent with the rationales of earlier lunchtime cases, would be an extension of prior case law. Under the case law extant when the no-fault insurance act was enacted, employers were not generally liable for off-premises lunchtime injuries and thus, under that act, the motor vehicle insurer of the worker or a family member would ordinarily bear the entire cost of motor vehicle injuries during the lunch period. An extension today of worker\u2019s compensation coverage to lunchtime automobile injuries would, because of \u00a7 3109 of the no-fault act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allow the motor vehicle carrier a deduction for worker\u2019s compensation benefits payable and thus work a reallocation, probably unforeseen by the Legislature, of the cost of insurance reparations for such accidents from the no-fault system to the worker\u2019s compensation system. This Court should not disturb the cost allocation extant when the no-fault act was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">(2) Krolczyk\u2019s injuries were sustained after the effective date of the no-fault act. Although McClure\u2019s injuries were sustained before that date, a different rule should not be applied in his case. In light of the disposition stated in (1) above, the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>remaining issue of jurisprudential significance is whether an employee is entitled to worker\u2019s compensation for off-premises lunchtime injuries <em>not </em>resulting from a motor vehicle accident. <em>McClure </em>does not present that precise issue because his injuries were sustained in a motor vehicle accident. To grant or deny benefits in a pre-no-fault motor vehicle accident case would be to set precedent, in a context not likely to recur, which might govern disposition in off-premises lunchtime injury cases generally. This being a Court of discretionary jurisdiction, we should not speak decisionally on this question at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Gary McClure was employed at General Motors\u2019 Fleetwood Plant on Fort Street. Although a cafeteria serving hot food was maintained on the premises, employees were permitted to leave during their 30-minute unpaid meal period. There was testimony that employees who chose to stay often had to rush their eating because of long cafeteria lines. Located across Fort Street from the plant was the Fleetwood Inn, which enjoyed the lunchtime patronage of approximately 50 to 100 Fleet-wood Plant employees each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On April 14, 1973, while crossing Fort Street on his way to the Fleetwood Inn with three co-workers, McClure was hit by an automobile and sustained injuries which resulted in his death on November 8, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Carol McClure, his widow, was awarded compensation by the administrative law judge. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board reversed. The Court of Appeals denied l\u00e9ave to appeal. On application for leave to appeal, this Court reversed the WCAB, holding that the injuries arose out of and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>in the course of the employment because it was a \"circumstance\u201d or \"incident\u201d of McClure\u2019s employment that placed him where he was when injured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Kimberly Ann Krolczyk was a salaried employee of Wolverine Moving and Storage Company. A refrigerator and vending machines containing candy and soft drinks were located on the premises. There was no cafeteria. The WCAB found that employees were encouraged to leave their desks during the one-hour lunch period. Employees testified that they were told that one hour was allotted for lunch so that they could leave the premises and return refreshed for the afternoon\u2019s work. Krolczyk and all but a handful of her coworkers customarily left the premises for lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">On February 1, 1974, during her lunch hour, Krolczyk was injured on the way to a restaurant when the car in which she and a co-worker were driving struck a rut and went out of control approximately one-half mile from her work place.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The WCAB affirmed the referee\u2019s denial of benefits and the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. We granted leave to appeal, ordering the case argued and submitted with <em>McClure </em>on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">This Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>McClure\u2022, </em>simultaneously granting leave to appeal and reversing the WCAB without further briefing or argument, implied that the question presented could be readily answered. On the application for rehearing, it appeared that the issues were more complex than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>we had at first believed. At this time, it is appropriate to identify the complexities that initially escaped our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">I agree with Justice Ryan that our reliance on <em>Howard v Detroit</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in our prior decision in <em>McClure </em>was mistaken. <em>Howard </em>was not really a lunchtime case. Tommie Howard was injured during a paid five-hour lull in the work, traceable to an irregular work schedule designed to suit his employer\u2019s needs. The <em>Howard </em>Court seems to have assumed that because Howard was injured en route to the work place (after eating lunch), the \"going-and-coming\u201d rule, which denies compensation for injuries sustained in off-premises travel to and from the work place, would have been applicable but for the irregularity of his schedule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">McClure and Krolczyk were injured during their normal unpaid lunch periods, and therefore the exception to the going-and-coming rule recognized in <em>Howard </em>for an irregular work schedule has no application in the circumstances of their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"><em>Howard </em>did not, however, define the outer limits of compensability, and the result reached by Justices Kavanagh and Moody might be justified on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>other grounds. Based on doctrines developed in other cases, lunchtime injuries might be held to be compensable generally or on the facts of these cases, or a separate exception to the going-and-coming rule might be recognized for lunchtime travel generally or on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Justice Ryan\u2019s statements that it is an extension of prior law to award benefits for injuries incurred during the lunch period and while no services required by the contract of employment are being performed is not supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Lunchtime coverage is neither novel nor remarkable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The principle that lunchtime is part of the workday was recognized by this Court in <em>Haller v Lansing, </em>decided in 1917,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and is the law today.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The <em>Haller </em>Court explicitly recognized that there may be coverage although the employee is performing no services for the employer at the time of the injury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To limit worker\u2019s compensation coverage to injuries incurred during performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of work required by the contract of employment or of apparent benefit to the employer would ignore numerous holdings of this Court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and confuses the statutory term \"course of employment\u201d with the concept of \"scope of employment\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">For the reasons stated by Justice Moody, it can be said that lunchtime injuries \u2014 at least when they occur on the premises \u2014 are compensable so long as the employer-employee \"nexus\u201d is not broken.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the light of <em>Haller, </em>it cannot be said that the nexus is broken by the lunchtime suspension of work. Rather, it remains intact so long as the employee\u2019s conduct is, in Justice Moody\u2019s words \u2014 which parallel the <em>Haller </em>rationale\u2014 \"within the normal sphere of permitted and contemplated employee activity\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>McClure and Krolczyk voluntarily left their employers\u2019 premises. Still, neither can, in principle, be charged with departing from the normal sphere of permitted and contemplated employee activity and therefore the employment nexus, so defined, was not broken. Both did what persons in their work situations, in the language of <em>Haller, </em>\"may reasonably do\u201d \u2014 \"a reasonable and natural thing under existing conditions\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, in leaving the premises for lunch, they were doing something that significant numbers of their co-workers did on a regular basis and with their employer\u2019s consent (and, in <em>Krolczyk, </em>apparent encouragement).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In sum, it would be no extension of prior law to award compensation for injuries sustained during lunchtime although the lunchtime activity has a \"personal character\u201d, provided that the employment nexus is not broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">However, in all the cases where compensation was awarded for lunchtime injuries, the injuries occurred on the employer\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The only ground for distinguishing these cases from prior cases is that these injuries occurred when McClure and Krolczyk were not on their employers\u2019 premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The issue then is whether coverage that would otherwise extend during the lunch period is lost when an employee leaves the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">To be sure, it is difficult to articulate a principled basis for a premises cut-off. Arguably, if lunch on the premises is in the \"course of employment\u201d, so too is lunch off the premises.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Justice Moody understandably concludes that \"[allowing compensation to be paid only where lunchtime injuries occur on the employer\u2019s premises creates a distinction without meaningful difference. An employee who crosses the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>threshold and who is injured on his way to lunch is in no real sense less in the course of his employment than his fellow worker who is injured en route to the company cafeteria\u201d. I would add that the employee who leaves the premises is in no meaningful way less in the course of his employment than his fellow worker who, about to leave the premises, trips and falls while still on the premises, as in <em>Dyer v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where compensation was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">A premises limitation is not inherent in the concept of \"nexus\u201d, nor need <em>Haller </em>be read as limited to on-premises lunchtime injuries. Justice Black, dissenting in <em>Mack v Reo </em>Motors, <em>Inc, </em>where recovery for a lunchtime injury was denied, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\"I now move * * * that so-called intermission cases, and this one equally with <em>Salmon, </em>be guided again by the precepts of <em>Haller v City of Lansing, supra. </em>Such precepts, <em>and I do not wish to be understood as limiting their scope to the employer\u2019s premises </em>if 'nexus between workman and employer\u2019 remains unbroken, are introduced on page 758 of the <em>Haller Case </em>in language I have previously quoted, and they continue to the end thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\"><em>Mack </em>was overruled and <em>Haller </em>restored in <em>Dyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">This Court has not, however, applied the \"nexus\u201d test to off-premises lunchtime injuries, nor has it held the going-and-coming rule inapplicable to lunchtime travel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The extension of <em>Haller </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>off-premises injuries, although it has logical appeal, is not necessarily compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In four Michigan cases decided between 1914 and 1940, compensation for lunchtime travel inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ries was denied, the Court, explicitly or implicitly, applying the going-and-coming rule.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> One or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>of these cases might be distinguished from the instant cases; it is uncertain, though, whether the factual differences suggest any reason why the going-and-coming rule, if applicable to those lunchtime injuries, should not be applicable to lunchtime injuries of the kind that occurred in the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">All four cases eventually turned on whether the employee was actively serving his employer at the time he was injured. I agree with Justices Kavanagh and Moody that this is too narrow an inquiry. Strict reliance on whether the employee was performing services for his employer is inconsistent with the \"nexus\u201d principle, with this Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Crilly v Ballou,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which unequivocally held that \"[c]ourse of employment is not scope of employment\u201d and which specifically recognized that an employee\u2019s \"human deviations\u201d are within the course of employment, with <em>Howard\u2019s </em>award of compensation in spite of the observation that the decision to leave the premises was voluntary,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and with later cases awarding compensation during non-working time.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, it could be argued that the four cases, because they relied on an outdated principle, have been superseded by subsequent decisions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The cases might, however, be read as imposing higher standards for qualifying for compensation where the injury occurs off the premises.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If so, it could then be argued that there are two distinct lines of cases which taken together mean: \"Lunchtime injuries on the premises are covered so long as the nexus is unbroken, but lunchtime injuries off the premises are covered only if service for the employer is being performed or some other exception to the going-and-coming rule applies.\u201d This, we note, would only lead us back to the starting point: Can this Court, consistent with logic or reason, justify the continued existence of a distinction between on-premises and off-premises injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Legislature has provided special treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>for some injuries on the employer\u2019s premises by enacting the \"on-premises\u201d amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\"Every employee going to and from his work while on the premises where his work is to be performed, and within a reasonable time before and after his working hours, shall be presumed to be in the course of his employment.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">This amendment does not, however, purport to limit coverage to only \"on-premises\u201d injuries; the statutory presumption that on-premises injuries are compensable carries no negative implication that oif-premises injuries are not.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>Haller </em>awarded compensation applying the nexus test and did not rely on the concept, later embodied in the amendment, that particular injuries might be compensable simply because they occurred on the premises. Justice Talbot Smith elaborated the nexus principle in his influential dissent in <em>Salmon v Bagley Laundry Co, </em>344 Mich 471, 490; 74 NW2d 1 (1955), again without reference to or reliance on the concept embodied in the on-premises amendment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Although <em>Dyer, </em>the case in which <em>Haller </em>was reinstated,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and <em>Lasiewicki v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Tusco Products Co,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the only post-Dyer lunchtime injury case decided by this Court, were based on the \"on-premises\u201d presumption, the Court did not thereby reject the independently developing principle enunciated in <em>Haller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">It would not be inappropriate, therefore, to extend principles developed, independently of the amendment, in the construction of \"out of and in the course of\u2019, when or if it is concluded that those principles cannot be logically or reasonably limited to on-premises injuries. The amendment does not limit the Court\u2019s power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Another argument in support of a premises cutoff is based on the nature of worker\u2019s compensation decision making. One commentator has noted that any given worker\u2019s compensation decision represents a balancing of many factors, one implication being that principles developed in one context in which certain factors are present \u2014 here, presence on the premises \u2014 should not be automatically extended to a separate context, off-premises injury.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>It might be that the meaning of the cases is that compensation is allowed whenever there is <em>some </em>factor on which liability can justifiably be appended: the employee was either performing services, being paid <em>or </em>on the premises. Or, it may be that courts have been willing to allow compensation for virtually any on-premises injury because a worker\u2019s compensation award relieves the employer of the duty of defending himself in a tort suit, based on ownership or control, which the employee might otherwise bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">These theories might well <em>explain </em>a premises cut-off although they do not adequately justify it. The \"tort trade-off\u201d is something the Legislature might appropriately take into consideration when drafting legislation; it is difficult to see how such concerns have any proper place in adjudicating whether a particular employee was or was not \"in the course of\u2019 his employment, especially now that it is well established that worker\u2019s compensation coverage is available although the employer was not at fault for causing the injury,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or in control of the employee when injured,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the employment neither increased the risk of injury<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> nor was the proximate cause thereof.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Although the theoretical justifications for distinguishing on- and off-premises injuries are weak, a clear majority of jurisdictions that have addressed the question deny coverage for off-premises injuries.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Larson, an avid exponent of the premises limitation, acknowledges that \"[a]s to the conceptual category of reasons, no one has ever denied that there is no theoretical, ethical or intellectual reason why coverage of the going-and-coming trip should be limited to the premises\u201d,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> but explains \"[t]he real reason for the premises rule is, and always has been, the impracticality of drawing another line at such a point that the administrative and judicial burden of interpreting and applying the rule would not be unmanageable\u201d.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">A line must be drawn at some point. The premises line might be the appropriate cut-off. The work connection is at least apparent on the premises; administratively, it is relatively easy to determine whether an injury occurred on or off the premises;<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the premises line is one which one can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>be certain has legislative approval; and, its rejection could extend liability disproportionately.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">This, then, is the tension: a premises cut-off is inconsistent with the principles announced in <em>Haller </em>and its progeny; practical considerations may, however, warrant the retention of this seemingly arbitrary limitation. A decision either for or against coverage can be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">There is, however, another dimension: McClure and Krolczyk sustained their off-premises lunchtime injuries in motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In 1973, the no-fault act<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> went into effect providing benefits for injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents. An injury compensable under that act might also be compensable under the worker\u2019s compensation act because it arose \"out of and in the course of\u2019 the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Section 3109(1)<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> of the no-fault act allocates the cost of reparations for such injuries between the no-fault and worker\u2019s compensation systems: the liability of the no-fault insurer is reduced by the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits payable.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">At the time such set-off was enacted and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>legislative allocation made, it was not the law of Michigan that off-premises lunchtime injuries were compensable under the worker\u2019s compensation act; coverage for injury sustained in lunchtime motor vehicle accidents had been denied by this Court on three separate occasions.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Thus, the legislative allocation was made in the context that the motor vehicle insurance system bore the entire cost of insurance reparations for off-premises lunchtime motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">As previously set forth, the extension of coverage sought here can be justified. One might find that the lunchtime motor vehicle cases where coverage was denied are distinguishable, have been superseded, or ought to be overruled; the extension of the <em>Haller </em>rationale to off-premises injuries may seem logically compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Nevertheless, an award of benefits today would be an extension of prior law, one not fairly foreseeable by the Legislature. When lunchtime coverage has been granted in recent years, it has been on the basis of the on-premises amendment.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Benefits have never been awarded for off-premises travel injuries sustained during a normal lunch period; and when benefits have been awarded for an off-premises (non-lunch) travel injury, it has been under one of the traditional exceptions to the going-and-coming rule<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> or in circumstances the Court stressed were special.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This Court has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>indicated that the creation of a lunchtime exception to the going-and-coming rule was imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">A decision in favor of coverage for such injuries, then, would cause \u00a7 3109(1) of the no-fault act to work a reallocation of the cost of insurance reparations for lunchtime motor vehicle accidents, one probably not anticipated by the Legislature when \u00a7 3109 was enacted. This Court should not disturb the allocation of the burden of providing such reparations struck by the Legislature when it enacted the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">It is no answer to say that because the purpose of \u00a7 3109 was to reduce the cost of no-fault insurance, a reallocation of the cost of lunchtime motor vehicle accidents away from the no-fault system furthers the Legislature\u2019s purpose. The legislative decision embodied in \u00a7 3109 may have been based on assumptions regarding the existing costs to the worker\u2019s compensation system that did not include payment for lunchtime automobile injuries generally. An extension of worker\u2019s compensation liability to lunchtime automobile injuries not previously covered would impose on that system the greater part of the burden of providing insurance reparations for injuries heretofore compensated through the motor vehicle insurance system.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">I would, therefore, hold that injuries resulting from off-premises motor vehicle accidents occurring during the normal lunch period in circumstances in which no previously recognized excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tion<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> to the going-and-coming rule is applicable, do not arise \"out of and in the course of\u2019 the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-1\">McClure\u2019s injury was sustained before the effective date of no-fault. The disposition set forth in Part II might be limited to injuries arising after the effective date of the act (such as Krolczyk\u2019s), and McClure\u2019s case decided without regard to the impact of no-fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-2\">Although McClure\u2019s injury was sustained before no-fault, subsequent cases arising in the same factual context \u2014 motor vehicle accidents \u2014 will not be governed by anything we might separately say in respect to <em>McClure, </em>but rather by the disposition set forth in Part II, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\">The only issue of jurisprudential significance left unresolved by the disposition in Part II is whether the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act covers off-premises lunchtime injuries not sustained in motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">That question, as I have indicated, is a difficult and troublesome one. There is no satisfactory basis in theory for denying coverage merely because the premises threshold has been crossed; practical considerations may, however, militate against extension of coverage beyond the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">That difficult issue should be resolved only in a case presenting that precise question. A separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>decision in <em>McClure </em>would color the disposition of the issue left unresolved today.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The Legislature may speak before the issue is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Although case-by-case construction of the phrase \"out of and in the course of\u2019 may be preferable to a legislative attempt to develop a scheme of detailed rules purporting to cover every possible situation in which a claim for compensation might arise, there are times when legislative guidance in the form of a specific rule applicable to a recurring class of cases is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">This is such a case. The Legislature can tell us, simply and unequivocally, whether coverage that would ordinarily exist during the lunch period is lost if the injury is sustained off the employer\u2019s premises. The Legislature has provided this sort of specific guidance once before, when the \"on-premises\u201d amendment was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">I join in affirming the WCAB in both <em>McClure </em>and <em>Krolczyk.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b395-8\">Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYNa\">We granted rehearing in <em>McClure </em>and leave to appeal in <em>Krolczyk </em>for the purpose of considering whether the workers\u2019 lunchtime injuries arose out of and in the course of their employment. MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Gary McClure, deceased husband of plaintiff Carol McClure, was employed at the General Motors Fleetwood Plant in Detroit. The Fleetwood Plant occupies a corner bounded by West Fort St., running east and west, and by West End Ave., which runs north and south. The plant is located south of Fort St. and west of West End Ave.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The Fleetwood Inn, a bar, is located across Fort St. from the Fleetwood Plant and approximately 200 feet west of the intersection of West End Ave. and Fort St.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Gary McClure was working his usual shift on April 14, 1973, the day he sustained the injuries which resulted in his death on November 8, 1973. The shift began at 6 a.m. and was to end at 2:30 p.m., with a 30-minute unpaid lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">A cafeteria and lunch wagon were provided on the premises of the plant for the convenience of the employees. There was no requirement that the employees utilize these facilities and they were permitted to go off the plant premises for lunch. Approximately 50 to 100 employees, including Gary McClure, habitually chose to lunch at the Fleetwood Inn, which on a direct line was located about 75 yards away from the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">On the day of the injury, he and some others were going to the Fleetwood Inn for lunch. Instead of crossing at the intersection where there were traffic signals, McClure attempted to cross Fort Street in mid-block and was struck by an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The administrative law judge awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits on September 19, 1974. The appeal board reversed on October 13, 1976, holding that the injuries and consequent death did not arise out of and in the course of employment. The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal on March 25, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">On March 13, 1978, this Court reversed in a per curiam opinion. We held that the injuries did arise out of and in the course of employment because it was as \" 'a circumstance of his employment\u2019 \u201d and \"as an incident of the employment relationship\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that McClure found himself where he was at the time he was injured. 402 Mich 392, 395; 262 NW2d 829 (1978). A motion for rehearing was filed by defendant and granted by this Court on June 5, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Kimberly Ann Krolczyk seeks compensation for lunchtime injuries she suffered on February 1, 1974. She was a salaried employee at defendant Wolverine Moving and Storage Company in Livonia. She worked daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and was entitled to a one-hour lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Vending machines containing candy and soft drinks were located on the premises. A refrigerator was furnished in the ladies\u2019 restroom, but no facilities for hot meals were provided. In its opinion, the appeal board stated that the employees were encouraged to leave their desks during the lunch period. There was testimony that the reason the employees were given an hour for lunch was to provide them an opportunity to leave the premises, and thus segment the workday, so that the employees could return refreshed for the afternoon\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Plaintiff customarily went to lunch off the premises. On the day she was injured, plaintiff and a coworker were driving to a restaurant where, approximately one-half mile from defendant\u2019s place of business, their car struck a rut and went out of control. As a result plaintiff sustained severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The appeal board affirmed the referee\u2019s denial of benefits on August 12, 1977. After the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal, this Court granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal on June 5, 1978, ordering the case argued and submitted together with <em>McClure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The defendants in each of these cases contend that the contracts of employment did not require, directly or indirectly, that the employees be where they were at the time of the injuries. Therefore, defendants argue, the injuries did not arise out of and in the course of employment. We reject this argument and hold that the injuries are compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In the initial <em>McClure </em>opinion, we cited <em>Howard v Detroit, </em>377 Mich 102, 109; 139 NW2d 677 (1966), wherein compensation was granted the employee bus driver even though \"no incident of plaintiffs employment <em>required </em>him in an absolute sense to leave the terminal during the 5-hour interval\u201d between his morning and afternoon shifts. (Emphasis in original.) Despite the lack of compulsion, this Court held in <em>Howard </em>that because \"it was a circumstance of his employment that placed plaintiff in this case where he was when he was accidentally injured\u201d, he was entitled to compensation benefits. 377 Mich 110. We are still convinced of the soundness of that rationale. The significant inquiry in the instant cases is not whether the employees were injured while carrying out duties absolutely required by their employment contracts, but whether the injuries occurred as a circumstance of the employment relationship. We are satisfied they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In both <em>McClure </em>and <em>Krolczyk, </em>the workers were permitted to go off premises for their lunch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>deed, Kimberly Ann Krolczyk was encouraged to do so because of the benefits accruing to the defendant in having a refreshed employee. Their freedom to do as they wished during lunchtime was limited by the requirements of their employment. In <em>Wyatt v Metropolitan Maintenance Co, </em>74 NJ 167; 376 A2d 1222 (1977), the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld an award of benefits to an employee injured during lunchtime and while off the premises of his employer. The court stated, 74 NJ 171:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">\"[A]n employee who interrupts his work and leaves his place of employment for lunch knows that he has not completed his workday and that he will be returning as soon as his lunch is over. His time is not really his own. <em>[Hornyak v The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>63 NJ 99, 107-108; 305 A2d 65 (1973)]. Midday meal periods have long been recognized as an integral part of the work routine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">It was a circumstance of their employment that McClure and Krolczyk were where they were when the injuries befell them. During the workday when an employee is injured in the course of an activity which is incidental to the employment the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>injuries are said to have arisen out of and in the course of that employment. This is true whether the injury arises on the premises<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or off the premises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The lunch breaks in both <em>McClure </em>and <em>Krolczyk </em>were incidental to their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We do not by this holding impose upon the employer the burden of guaranteeing the general health and well-being of the employee.

Rejecting the suggestion that an employee who leaves the premises at lunchtime \"abandons\u201d his employment \u2014 a concept apparently equivalent to breaking the nexus \u2014 it held the \"going-and-coming\u201d rule inapplicable to lunchtime travel. <em>Hornyak v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>63 NJ 99; 305 A2d 65 (1973); <em>Wyatt v Metropolitan Maintenance Co, </em>74 NJ 167; 376 A2d 1222 (1977). The North Dakota Supreme Court awarded compensation for an off-premises lunchtime travel injury, but its basis of decision is unclear; it did not, however, expressly create a lunchtime exception to the \"going-and-coming\u201d rule. <em>Desautel v North Dakota Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau, </em>72 ND 35; 4 NW2d 581 (1942), <em>(After Remand) </em>75 ND 405; 28 NW2d 378 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Other courts have allowed recovery for off-premises lunchtime injuries in particular circumstances. <em>Denver School District #1 v Industrial Comm, </em>196 Colo 131; 581 P2d 1162 (1978) (teachers injured going to restaurant on day on which cafeteria was closed, entitled to compensation); <em>Mission Ins Co v Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board, </em>84 Cal App 3d 50; 148 Cal Rptr 292 (1978) (coverage only if employee is paid during lunchtime); <em>Hansen v Superior Products Co, </em>65 Idaho 457; 146 P2d 335 (1944) (employee was paid during lunch and no hot meals were available on the premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">This Court, conceivably, could also establish only a limited lunchtime rule, perhaps with the result that only one of the instant claimants would recover: coverage might turn on whether hot food was available, whether the food service was \"adequate\u201d, whether going out to lunch generally or going to a particular restaurant had been so standard a part of the employee\u2019s work pattern that it can be said that the trip on which the injury occurred must have been within the employer\u2019s contemplation.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Coffee-break injuries seem to have received special consideration in other jurisdictions and have been more frequently compensated than lunchtime injuries. See, 1 Larson \u00a7 15.54, pp 4-107 <em>et seq. </em>The fact that the injury in <em>Salmon v Bagley Laundry Co, supra, </em>took place during a coffee break rather than at lunchtime appears, however, to have been assigned no particular importance in our jurisprudence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> Such an employee, of course, is within the \"on-premises\u201d amendment, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\"> <em>Mack v Reo Motors, Inc, supra, </em>p 278 (Black, J. dissenting).

Work requirements set the starting and ending times of the lunchtime trip; the work limits the employee\u2019s choices and conditions his tastes.</p>\n<p id=\"ABy\">Larson\u2019s argument to the contrary, \u00a7 15.12, p 4-12, is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"Apq\">He argues that the employee is no less free at lunchtime than he is at any other time, since the legal obligation to return to work after lunch is no greater than the obligation to report to work at any other time. I do not think that the question whether the employee is more or less free at lunchtime depends on his legal \"obligation\u201d to work. Assuming he intends to stay in good standing with his employer, he is less free at lunchtime: he can start his travel to work at whatever time he chooses and there is no employment-related time at which he must arrive at home at the end of the day. The lunchtime trip, however, has its starting <em>and </em>ending time (and place) designated by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"AtA\">Larson also argues that the element of \u201churry\u201d only confuses the issue. \"Suppose the employee is an executive taking two hours out for lunch.\u201d 1 Larson, p 4-12. It is elementary, however, that workmen\u2019s compensation cases turn on the facts of each case. If time permits the employee to wander errantly, if the work does not in fact limit the employee\u2019s range of activity, or color his tastes, then it would not be difficult to deny recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"AyI\">One must keep in mind that the going-and-coming rule is not a \"rule\u201d as much as a restatement of the conclusion reached in past cases that travel injuries under consideration did not arise in the course of employment; a finding that a particular injury did so arise should automatically render the going-and-coming rule inapplicable. Specifically, an exception to the rule is properly recognized when application of the rule that \u201clunchtime is covered time so long as the employment <em>nexus </em>is unbroken\u201d leads to the conclusion that a particular off-premises injury should be compensated; as in (but not because of) <em>Howard, </em>it can then be said that the employee was not \"merely\u201d on his way to or from work.</p>\n<p id=\"AIr\">Failure to relax the going-and-coming \u201crule\u201d in the face of the principle that \"lunchtime injuries wherever they occur are compensable so long as the employee is doing that which he might reasonably do\u201d could create the anomalous situation of allowing recovery for injuries <em>at </em>a restaurant \u2014 because eating at a restaurant is a reasonable thing for an employee to do \u2014 but denying recovery for injuries during travel <em>to </em>the restaurant because travel injuries fall within the going-and-coming rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b384-4\"> <em>Furino v Lansing, </em>293 Mich 211; 291 NW 637 (1940), and <em>Cherewick v Morris G Laramie &amp; Son, Inc, </em>295 Mich 570; 295 NW 268 (1940), both concerned employees with no permanently fixed job sites. Michael Furino was assigned to street crews, and was injured in an automobile accident during the lunch period when traveling to the city shed where he had left his lunch. Stephen Cherewick was a power shovel operator who, on the day of his injury, completed work at one location before lunch and was to appear after lunch at a different location; he was injured in an automobile accident when traveling from his home, where he had eaten lunch, to the second job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The <em>Cherewick </em>Court stated that it could not disturb the board\u2019s finding of fact that Cherewick was not in the course of his employment, but was merely on his way to resume his employment, and observed that his lunchtime travel was indistinguishable from the journey before and after the workday. Although one might argue that this was so because his workday, divided between separate job sites, was as if two separate workdays, the board\u2019s decision appears to have been based on a finding that Cherewick was performing no service for his employer during the lunch period. The denial in <em>Cherewick </em>was with citation to <em>Furino </em>in which benefits were denied because no service was being performed for the employer at the time of injury and the travel was not in an employer-owned vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Hills v Blair, </em>182 Mich 20, 27; 148 NW 243 (1914), concerned an employee who, along with his co-workers, customarily ate lunch on the premises, but who, on the day in question, left for work before his wife had packed his lunch. He was killed on his way home for lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The Court applied the going-and-coming rule and denied compensation. The exception for an employee \"engaged in his employer\u2019s business, discharging any duty or on any errand connected with his employment\u201d was not supported by the facts and the employee was not aided by the rule that \"the employment is not limited by the exact time when the workman reaches the scene of his labor and begins it, nor when he ceases, but includes a reasonable time, space, and opportunity, before and after, while he is at or near his place of employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In <em>Lipinski v Sutton Sales Co, </em>220 Mich 647; 190 NW 705 (1922), the employee, a salesman who usually spent his workday making calls on customers, stayed at the central salesroom because of a special sale. He was injured in an automobile accident when returning to the salesroom from his home where he had eaten lunch. The Court, citing <em>Hills, </em>denied compensation because no exception to the going-and-coming rule applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">For various reasons one might say that these decisions do not or ought not control today\u2019s cases. <em>Hills </em>and <em>Lipinski </em>involved departures from the employee\u2019s typical daily patterns; they can be distinguished from today\u2019s cases in that one cannot say of them that the activity was, by informal custom, something a worker similarly situated might reasonably and naturally do as part of a normal workday and therefore within the employer\u2019s contemplation. <em>Furino </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>and <em>Cherewick </em>were decided at the time of Michigan\u2019s parsimony in worker\u2019s compensation law, see <em>Mack v Reo Motors, Inc, supra, </em>p 281; one might dismiss them as tainted by this parsimony and as superseded by the resurgence in the 1950\u2019s of <em>Haller\u2019s </em>\"naturally and reasonably\u201d test of whether the nexus has been broken and <em>Crilly\u2019s </em>expanded concept of \"course of employment\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b385-6\"> <em>Crilly v Ballou, supra, </em>p 326 (quoting from the dissent in <em>Salmon v Bagley Laundry Co, supra): </em>\" 'These human deviations * * * do not suspend the employer-employee relationship.

It is significant that <em>Lipinski\u2019s </em>closing paragraph began with the observation that \"[a]n examination of the cases <em>where the accident was upon the street </em>and liability was sustained will disclose that in each case the employee was at the time of the accident in the discharge of his duties to the employer * * (Emphasis changed.) <em>Lipinski v Sutton Sales Co, supra, </em>p 652.

In <em>Haller v Lansing, </em>195 Mich 753; 162 NW 335 (1917), an injury suffered on the employer\u2019s premises during the lunch hour was held to have occurred in the course of employment, based upon the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\"[D]irectly applied to the noon intermission, it is a long and well-settled rule that the service tie, or contractual relations and obligations between master and servant, is not broken by such suspension of all activities directly beneficial to the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\" 'A workman is considered in the employment of his master during the intermission for the noon hour if he remains upon the premises.\u2019 Baldwin on [Personal] Injuries (2d ed), \u00a7 374.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\"[W]hile such relation so continues, an injury to an employee may arise out of and in the course of his employment, although he is not directly engaged in the work of his employment at the time.\u201d <em>Haller, supra, </em>758-759.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The <em>Haller </em>Court opined that the employee in that case was injured in an activity reasonable for a worker to engage in during a lunch period at a place it was reasonable for the employee to be located. The \"employment nexus\u201d remained intact, not having been broken by employee conduct such as wilful misconduct or disregard of employer instructions regarding time, place and nature of permissible employee activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The soundness of the <em>Haller </em>rationale was reaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>firmed in <em>Dyer v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>350 Mich 92; 85 NW2d 152 (1957), where an injury suffered on the employer\u2019s premises during the lunch period was held to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The reasoning employed by the <em>Haller </em>Court was also adopted and expanded upon by Justice Talbot Smith dissenting in <em>Salmon v Bagley Laundry Co, </em>344 Mich 471; 74 NW2d 1 (1955).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Salmon </em>the employee sustained an injury upon the steps of the employer\u2019s premises during a coffee break while returning from a restaurant located across the street from the premises. Justice Smith concluded the injury occurred in the course of employment, proffering the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\"The words 'course of employment\u2019 in our act include the coffee break simply because the product, which must shoulder the burdens of injuries in its manufacture, is made by a human being. He brings to his work all of his human characteristics, his frailties as well as his virtues. * * * 'Course of employment\u2019 is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sterile form of words. It is descriptive of life in the industrial age. These human deviations from the course of the automaton do not suspend the employer-employee relationship. They are not departures from employment, but the very substance of it. They are the inevitable concomitants of the working relationship and conditions which produce the product. Its cost must reflect the fatigue, the irritations, and sometimes the blood that went into it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\"[T]he course of employment of a human being * * * includes not only his repetitive acts at the machine to which he is assigned, but includes, as well, his ministrations to his human needs. Some courts have explained these cases on the theory of 'indirect benefit\u2019 to the employer, since an uncomfortable employee does not efficiently serve his employer, some on the theory of mutual benefit, since the gratification of the need is also a solace to the worker. Recovery in this case, the record makes clear, could be rested on either of these grounds as appears from the background of the contractual provisions concerning the coffee break\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\"Our decision, however, should not be grounded upon the benefit theory since there is a more fundamental principle involved. It is well described in one of our early decisions. In the case of <em>Haller v </em>Lansing; 195 Mich 753, 758-760 (LRA1917E, 324), a claim arose out of an employee\u2019s accidental death from injuries suffered on his employer\u2019s premises during his lunch hour. * * * In approving the compensation awarded we said, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\" 'He was doing a natural and apparently innocent thing, which a workman while employed may reasonably do, especially at a time of intermission from active work.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\"Here, then, is the reason for the compensation award: His injury was suffered during his working day while he was doing a natural thing, a thing which an employee, while working, might reasonably do. The fundamental inquiry is whether or not the act in question, either because of its nature, or local custom, or contractual provision, is reasonably to be regarded as part of the on-the-job activities of the human being involved, a part of his normal and reasonable sphere of activities. If so, it takes place 'in the course of his employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Salmon, supra, </em>486-488, 490.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The activities of the employees in the instant cases, at the time of injury, fell within the course of their employments. Lunch periods are now customarily considered an integral part of the work routine. The employment agreements of both employees provided that the employees be permitted, during the course of their working day, a certain period of time for lunch.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The duration of each lunch period was definite and reasonably brief. Both injuries were suffered during the time period designated for lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The injuries in both cases occurred off the employer\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both employees were injured at places it was reasonable for them to be located during the lunch period. Both employers either acquiesced in or actually encouraged the employee practice of departing from the premises to obtain refreshment elsewhere.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In leaving their place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>work, neither employee was disobeying any reasonable employer rule or instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Allowing compensation to be paid only where lunchtime injuries occur on the employer\u2019s premises creates a distinction without meaningful difference. An employee who crosses the premises threshold and who is injured on his way to lunch is in no real sense less in the course of his employment than his fellow worker who is injured en route to the company cafeteria. Application of this rule is certainly questionable where the facts indicate that no lunch facilities or no adequate facilities have been provided on the premises.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Finally, at the time of injury both employees were traveling to a place for the purpose of obtaining lunch, an activity reasonably related to the purpose for which the lunch period was created. Their conduct was reasonable and within the normal sphere of permitted and contemplated employee activity. The employment nexus remained intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Accordingly, for these additional reasons it is concluded that the injuries suffered by both employees arose out of and in the course of their respective employments.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-4\">Williams, J., concurred with Blair Moody, Jr., J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\"> It was precisely the erroneous importation of tort concepts such as \"scope of employment\u201d into the analysis of whether an injury was sustained in the course of employment, which led to denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits in prior cases involving lunch break and coffee break injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">See, <em>e.g., Hills v Blair, </em>182 Mich 20, 29; 148 NW 243 (1914) (lunch hour injury did not occur in course of employment since employee was not \"within the scope of his employment, [and] was not under the direction or control of his employer\u201d); <em>Daniel v Murray Corp of America, </em>326 Mich 1; 39 NW2d 229 (1949) (employee injured in parking lot supplied by employer, after completion of work shift, was not in course of employment); <em>Salmon v Bagley Laundry Co, </em>344 Mich 471, 474; 74 NW2d 1 (1955) (coffee-break injury suffered on employer\u2019s premises was not in course of employment since the employee was not performing a duty she was hired to perform); <em>Mack v Reo Motors, Inc, </em>345 Mich 268, 290-291; 76 NW2d 35 (1956) (injury suffered on employer\u2019s premises during lunch hour while employee was en route to company cafeteria did not occur in the course of employment, since, under <em>Salmon, </em>employee was not within the scope of employment or under the control of employer at the time of injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The majority opinions of <em>Salmon, Daniel </em>and <em>Mack </em>were expressly overruled in <em>Dyer v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>350 Mich 92, 96; 85 NW2d 152 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\"> Writing for the majority in <em>Dyer, </em>Justice Black found the injury suffered to have occurred in the course of employment according to the prior case of <em>Haller, supra. </em>The fact that the majority opinion in <em>Dyer </em>rested upon principles set forth in <em>Haller </em>was reiterated by Justice Black in his opinion issued in <em>Simerka v Pridemore, </em>380 Mich 250, 266; 156 NW2d 509 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Justice Dethmers, concurring with the majority in <em>Dyer, </em>considered that the injury suffered was compensable.
