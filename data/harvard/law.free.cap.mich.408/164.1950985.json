MCL 500.3114, subds (3) and (4); MSA 24.13114, subds (3) and (4), precludes recovery from the no-fault insurer of the employee\u2019s private vehicle under the facts of these cases. Where the employer is self-insured under the no-fault act, the employee may collect no-fault benefits from the employer in his role as insurer in addition to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>We also hold that the no-fault insurance carrier, or the employer, if self-insured under the no-fault act, may set off the workers\u2019 compensation benefits against the no-fault benefits pursuant to \u00a7 3109(1) of the no-fault act. Section 3109(1) as applied to workers\u2019 compensation benefits is constitutional under the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The facts of the consolidated cases are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">A. <em>Mathis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">On September 30, 1974, plaintiff Mathis was injured while loading and unloading a semi-trailer in the course of his employment with defendant Interstate. As a result of this injury, he applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">In addition to receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Mathis applied to Interstate for no-fault personal protection insurance benefits. Interstate was a self-insurer under the no-fault act. The claim was denied by Interstate on the ground that Mathis\u2019 exclusive remedy against his self-insured employer was workers\u2019 compensation benefits under MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The trial court granted Interstate\u2019s motion for accelerated and/or summary judgment on the basis of \u00a7 131 of the WDCA. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 73 Mich App 602; 252 NW2d 842 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">B. <em>Hawkins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">On June 7, 1976, plaintiff Hawkins was injured while driving one of his employer\u2019s trucks in the course of his employment with Acme Disposal, Inc. As a result of this injury, Hawkins applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>were paid by Acme\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In addition to receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Hawkins filed suit against his employer\u2019s no-fault insurer, defendant Auto-Owners Insurance Company, seeking payment of all personal protection benefits due to him under the Michigan no-fault act. The trial court granted Auto-Owners\u2019 motion for an accelerated judgment. On May 9, 1978, the Court of Appeals set aside the accelerated judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Court of Appeals held that the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act does not operate as a bar to the employee\u2019s action. 83 Mich App 225; 268 NW2d 534 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">C. <em>Ottenwess</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Plaintiff-appellee\u2019s decedent, Michael Ottenwess, was an employee of Wickes Lumber Company. On September 16, 1975, Ottenwess attempted to examine or repair an apparent malfunction of the mechanism which raised and lowered the dump box on the dump truck he was operating in the course of his employment. Ottenwess was crushed to death when the dump box suddenly came down on him, trapping him between the box and the frame of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">At the time of the accident, Ottenwess\u2019 employer\u2019s no-fault insurer was Travelers Insurance Company. Ottenwess was the owner of a private automobile covered by no-fault insurance issued by the Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">On September 16, 1976, plaintiff-appellee Deborah Ottenwess (Schroeder) filed suit in Kent Circuit Court against Travelers Insurance Company and Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ing no-fault benefits for the death of Michael H. Ottenwess. Both insurance companies filed motions for summary judgment which were granted by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The Court of Appeals held that the summary judgment in favor of Travelers Insurance Company, insurer of the employer, was proper, but that the summary judgment in favor of HawkeyeSecurity Insurance Company, insurer of decedent\u2019s private car, was improper, and remanded the case to the trial court for a trial upon the merits. 84 Mich App 292; 269 NW2d 570 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">D. <em>In re Certi\u00f1ed Questions (Joseph)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On October 26, 1974, plaintiff Joseph was injured in the course of his employment while driving a truck owned by his employer, IML Freight Company. Joseph has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of this injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Defendant Transport Indemnity Company paid Joseph no-fault work loss benefits from the date of the accident through August 21, 1976, but deducted the sum of $117 per week. The amount deducted was the amount plaintiff received as workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">No-fault benefits paid through January 8, 1977 were in the amount of $16,941.90. No no-fault benefits have been paid since that date. Defendant relied on the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals in <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight </em>System, 73 Mich App 602; 252 NW2d 842 (1977), for stopping payment of no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Plaintiff brought suit in Wayne Circuit Court on July 12, 1977. The action was subsequently removed by the defendant to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Southern Division. The parties entered into a stipulation of facts and agreed that the issues to be determined were issues of law. Plaintiff and defendant filed a motion for summary judgment and a counter-motion for summary judgment, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">On February 13, 1979, Judge Kennedy entered an order of certification of questions to this Court, which we accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA) and the no-fault insurance act are complete and self-contained legislative schemes addressing discrete problems. Neither act refers expressly to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The WDCA provides a substitute for common-law tort liability founded upon an employer\u2019s negligence in failing to maintain a safe working environment. Compensation under this act is for industrial injuries arising out of and in the course of the injured person\u2019s employment. Compensation is paid by the employer or the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer under an indemnity contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The no-fault act provides a substitute for common-law tort liability based upon the ownership or operation of a motor vehicle. Under this act, victims of motor accidents receive insurance benefits from a no-fault insurance carrier as compensation for their injuries. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The cases under consideration herein raise the question of recovery under both legislative schemes. The employees injured in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>their employment were victims of motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">It is argued in these cases that \u00a7 131<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the WDCA bars an employee injured in the course of his employment while occupying a motor vehicle from collecting no-fault benefits from the carrier insuring the employer\u2019s vehicle. Section 131 provides that \"[t]he right to the recovery of benefits as provided in this act shall be the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy against the employer(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that \u00a7 3114(3) of the no-fault act authorizes recovery of personal protection insurance benefits from the insurer of the employer\u2019s vehicle. Section 3114(3) provides that \"[a]n employee * * * who suffers accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle owned or registered by the employer shall receive personal protection insurance benefits to which the employee is entitled from the insurer of the furnished vehicle\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Section 3105(1) of the no-fault act provides that \"[u]nder personal protection insurance an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, subject to the provisions of this chapter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Read together, \u00a7\u00a7 3105(1) and 3114(3) create a new cause of action directly against the employer\u2019s no-fault insurance carrier. The only express limitation on this cause of action is the phrase \"to which the employee is entitled\u201d in \u00a7 3114(3). The argument has been made that this phrase was inserted in the no-fault act to restrict recovery to the situation where the employee was not within the scope of his employment at the time he was injured while occupying the employer\u2019s vehicle. The exclusive remedy provision of the WDCA (MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>418.131; MSA 17.237[131]) is claimed to be the basis for this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">We are not persuaded by this analysis for two reasons. First, the exclusive remedy provision applies to actions against the employer. Here the cause of action is directly against the no-fault insurance carrier. Because the cause of action is not against the <em>employer, </em>the exclusive remedy provision of the WDCA is not applicable and is not a bar to the employee\u2019s cause of action. Second, we agree with Judge Allen\u2019s dissent in <em>Ottenwess v Hawkeye-Security Ins Co, </em>84 Mich App 292, 302-306; 269 NW2d 570 (1978), that the legislative history of the no-fault act discloses an intent to override any prohibitions which the exclusivity clause might make on no-fault recovery from the employer\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As originally introduced, the no-fault bill provided that a personal protection insurer had the primary obligation to indemnify for accidental bodily injuries arising out of the ownership, operation, or use of a motor vehicle. Payment of personal protection benefits with respect to such injury discharged, to the extent of the payment, the obligation of an employer or his workers\u2019 compensation insurer to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits on account of an employee\u2019s injury. If the personal protection insurer failed to pay any benefits due under the act, the payer of compensation benefits had a lien against the personal protection insurer for any payment the compensation payer was required to make.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We read the original bill to provide that an employee injured in the course of his employment while occupying his employer\u2019s automobile would recover no-fault benefits for such injuries to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>extent that such benefits equalled or exceeded any benefits he might claim under the workers\u2019 compensation law. The discharge provision prevented duplication of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">As amended and passed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> however, the act provides that benefits payable under any other law, state or Federal, would be deducted from personal protection insurance benefits payable. The amendment rearranged the priorities of obligations for payment among the responsible parties. The responsibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits rests first on the employer or workers\u2019 compensation insurer, and the amount of that payment is to be deducted from the liability of the personal protection insurance carrier. We are convinced that this rearrangement of responsibilities was neither intended to have nor has the effect of changing the original intention of the Legislature to provide that an employee injured in the course of his employment while occupying his employer\u2019s motor vehicle would be entitled to no-fault benefits despite the fact that he is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We hold, therefore, that an employee who suffers accidental bodily injury in the course of his employment while occupying a motor vehicle owned by the employer is entitled to collect no-fault benefits from the no-fault insurer of the employer\u2019s vehicle, and is not limited to workers\u2019 compensation as his sole remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In <em>Mathis, </em>the employer was self-insured under the Michigan no-fault insurance act. The argument is made that because the no-fault carrier in this situation is the employer, the exclusive rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>edy provision of the WDCA should bar the employee\u2019s cause of action for no-fault benefits. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">An employee may have ties with an employer other than the employer-employee relationship. They may be landlord and tenant; trustee and beneficiary; vendor and vendee and so on. We look to the laws governing the particular relationship involved to determine rights and obligations of the parties. The fact that the parties are also employer-employee does not automatically trigger the operation of the exclusive remedy provision of the WDCA. The exclusive' remedy provision applies only to employers where conditions of liability under the WDCA pertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The injured person in <em>Mathis </em>is seeking no-fault benefits from an insurer who happens to be his employer. Any liability to pay no-fault benefits is based on the status of being an insurer under the no-fault act. The employer-employee relationship does not determine the status of insurer, but simply fixes priority among those who do have that status. No conditions of liability under the WDCA exist affecting the employer as a self-insurer under the no-fault act. Accordingly we find no reason to apply the exclusive remedy provisions of the WDCA to bar the employee\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In <em>Ottenwess, </em>the plaintiff is seeking to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits, no-fault insurance benefits from the employer\u2019s no-fault insurer, and no-fault insurance benefits from the insurer of the employee\u2019s private automobile. As stated above, the plaintiff may recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits and, in addition, no-fault insurance benefits from the employer\u2019s no-fault carrier. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>3114 of the no-fault insurance act, however, precludes the action against the insurer of the employee\u2019s private automobile under the facts of the <em>Ottenwess </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Section 3114(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\"(4) <em>Except as provided in subsections (1) to (3), </em>a person suffering accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\"(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\"(b) The insurer of the operator of the vehicle occupied.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Section 3114(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">\"(3) An employee, his spouse, or a relative of either domiciled in the same household, who suffers accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle owned or registered by the employer shall receive personal protection insurance benefits to which <em>the employee </em>is entitled from the insurer of the furnished vehicle.\u201d (Prior to 1977 amendment this section read \"to which he is entitled\u201d.) 1976 PA 356, amended by 1977 PA 53.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The italicized portion of \u00a7 3114(4) indicates that subsection (3) is intended to be an exception to subsection (4). If subsection (3) is applicable, subsection (4) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">In <em>Ottenwess, </em>subsection (3) is applicable because Ottenwess was an employee who suffered accidental bodily injury from the use of a motor vehicle owned by his employer. Under subsection (3), his widow and children are to receive personal protection insurance benefits to which they are entitled from the insurer of the furnished vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Because <em>Ottenwess </em>is within subsection (3), subsection (4), which allows recovery from the insurer of the operator of the vehicle occupied, does not apply. Therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled to bring an action against the no-fault insurer of the employee\u2019s private vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Section 3109(1) of the no-fault insurance act requires the subtraction of benefits required to be provided under the laws of any state from no-fault benefits otherwise due:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\"Benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government shall be subtracted from personal protection insurance benefits otherwise payable for the injury.\u201d MCL 500.3109(1); MSA 24.13109(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">This Court upheld the constitutionality of this provision in <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We held that the Legislature\u2019s judgment that the recipients of private benefits should be treated differently from the recipients of government benefits has a rational basis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">\"This distinction rationally promotes the legitimate legislative objectives of enabling persons with economic needs and/or wages exceeding the maximum benefits permitted under the No-Fault Act to obtain the supplemental coverage they need and of placing the burden of such extra coverage directly on the shoulders of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>persons, instead of spreading it throughout the ranks of no-fault insureds.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><em>O'Donnell </em>involved a setoff by Federal Social Security survivor\u2019s benefits of no-fault benefits otherwise due. This Court concluded that \u00a7 3109 does require a setoff of these government benefits, and the setoff is not arbitrary because the benefits are paid as a result of the same accident and duplicate in varying degrees the no-fault benefits otherwise due.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The instant cases involve a setoff by workers\u2019 compensation benefits with no-fault benefits otherwise due. Plaintiffs argue that workers\u2019 compensation benefits should be distinguished from the Social Security benefits in <em>ODonnell </em>and that to set off the workers\u2019 compensation benefits would result in a denial of equal protection of the laws. We disagree. The workers\u2019 compensation benefits are paid as a result of the same accident and duplicate in varying degrees the no-fault benefits otherwise due. According to our findings in <em>ODonnell, </em>this brings the workers\u2019 compensation benefits within the scope of \u00a7 3109(1). Therefore, the workers\u2019 compensation benefits must be set off against the no-fault benefits otherwise due. Applying <em>ODonnell, </em>such a setoff is constitutional. Consequently, insurance policy provisions based on \u00a7 3109(1) are also constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Mathis </em>the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In <em>Hawkins </em>the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In <em>Ottenwess </em>the Court of Appeals is reversed, the summary judgment in favor of Hawkeye-Secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>rity Insurance Company is affirmed, and the cause remanded for trial as to defendant Travelers Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In <em>In re Certi\u00f1ed Questions </em>the certified questions are answered in the negative, in that an employee is not limited to WDCA benefits, but may claim no-fault benefits from the carrier of the insurance on the employer\u2019s vehicle, and that \u00a7 3109(1) of Michigan no-fault insurance act is constitutional and valid under the Michigan Constitution as applied to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The prevailing parties in <em>Mathis, Hawkins </em>and <em>Ottenwess </em>may tax costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Costs in <em>In re Certi\u00f1ed Questions </em>are covered by GCR 1963, 797.2(e).</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-7\">Coleman, C.J., and Levin, Fitzgerald, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\"> MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\"The right to the recovery of benefits as provided in this act shall be the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy against the employer.

However, since he relies heavily on <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979), to which I vigorously dissented, and which I still feel was wrongly decided, I feel obliged to explain myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">In my <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>dissent, I wrote</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">\"Our opinion, in its simplest form, concludes that it is neither logical nor constitutionally permissible to either eliminate benefit duplication or accomplish premium reduction by subtracting personally paid-for Social Security survivors\u2019 benefits from personally paid-for no-fault benefits while not likewise requiring a subtraction of analogous, personally paid-for private insurance benefits.\u201d 404 Mich 524, 557.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In contrast, in the instant case the classification is not between a personally paid-for government benefit plan and a personally paid-for private benefit plan, but between a non-personally paid-for government plan and a personally paid-for private plan. I believe the legislative differentiation between a non-personally paid-for benefit system and a personally paid-for benefit system is a reasonable and constitutional classification. See <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>p 585. Therefore I can assent to the classification in the instant case but could not and cannot in <em>O\u2019Donnell.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b353-4\">Fitzgerald, J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b353-5\">Blair Moody, Jr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av5\"><em>(concurring in the results). </em>In <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979), it was my judgment that \u00a7 3109(1) of the Michigan no-fault insurance act was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In my view, \u00a7 3109(1) creates an elitist, unreasonable and arbitrary classification permitting those who can afford private insurance to supplement no-fault benefits the luxury of duplicative recovery while denying parallel benefits to the many similarly situated insureds whose economic circumstances require sole reliance on governmental sources to which they may have contributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">However, it must be acknowledged that the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>majority concluded that \u00a7 3109(1) is free from constitutional infirmity. Further, <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>is held to control the constitutional question presented in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Aside from the constitutional issue, significant questions were left unanswered in <em>O\u2019Donnell. </em>These questions, which were unnecessary to the decision in <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>concerned the scope and type of benefits which may be subtracted from no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>fault personal protection insurance benefits. Indeed, issues regarding which governmental benefits may be deducted from no-fault benefits still remain largely unaddressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In these cases we deal with workers\u2019 compensation benefits which are provided without direct cost to the employee. The legislative history, as studiously outlined by Justice Kavanagh, indicates an intent that workers\u2019 compensation benefits be deducted from personal protection insurance benefits when both benefits are payable for an injury. Therefore, allowing set-off of <em>these </em>government benefits comports with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Additionally, under the facts of the instant cases, the workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the personal protection insurance benefits are clearly \"payable for the injury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3109(1). The right to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits arises out of the same circumstances which make the recipient eligible to receive personal protection insurance benefits. Further, both benefits are payable to compensate the recipient for the same economic injuries suffered as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">As to the resolution of other issues raised in these cases, I agree with the analysis employed by Justice Kavanagh. For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the results reached.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
