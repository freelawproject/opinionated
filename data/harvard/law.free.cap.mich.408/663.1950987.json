However, we find it necessary to focus greater attention upon the administrative decisions and orders which compose the record in this case. The question that we are asked in this case must, of course, be decided within the boundaries of, and with reference to, the concrete record from which the issue arises.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Justice Williams perceives the issue to be: \"[T]he question remains whether MERC, like the NLRB pursuant to NLRA, \u00a7 10, may exercise discretionary deferral authority pursuant to the <em>procedural </em>outline of PERA, \u00a7 16 subject to <em>proper </em>post-award review. We answer this inquiry in the affirmative.\u201d Williams, J., p 716 (emphasis on \"proper\u201d added).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">A review of the decisions and orders below discloses that MERC has very plainly declared that it will apply <em>Spielberg </em>post-award review in this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in accordance with its established policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>of applying a combined <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>doctrine in all such deferral cases. <em>Collyer Insulated Wire, </em>192 NLRB 837; 77 LRRM 1931 (1971); <em>Spielberg Mfg Co, </em>112 NLRB 1080; 36 LRRM 1152 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">We must decide then, on the record presented, whether MERC\u2019s order implementing its established policy of <em>Collyer </em>deferral subject to <em>Spielberg </em>post-award review comports with the specific and clearly expressed procedural requirements of PERA as discussed hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-1\">While in several respects PERA is \"patterned after\u201d the National Labor Relations Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (NLRA), it nevertheless contains some important provisions which are without parallel in the Federal act. Among the significant differences are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b842-2\">(1) PERA\u2019s prohibition of strikes by public employees, MCL 423.202; MSA 17.455(2);</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\">(2) PERA\u2019s directive that \"[a]ny proceeding\u201d relating to statutory unfair labor practice charges \"shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 4 of [the Michigan Administrative Procedures Act]\u201d, MCL 423.216(a); MSA 17.455(16)(a); and</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>(3) PERA\u2019s requirement that MERC make findings of fact in resolving unfair practices complaints, and that MERC\u2019s decisions be reviewable as a matter of right in the Court of Appeals under the competent, material, and substantial evidence standard,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. MCL 423.216(d), 423.216(e); MSA 17.455(16)(d), 17.455(16)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Against the background of these specific and deliberate provisions, we are asked to find a legislative intent to permit virtually <em>complete delegation </em>of statutory unfair labor practice issues to a private arbitrator acting in an informal and recordless setting. The foregoing emphasis on \"complete delegation\u201d derives indisputably from a review of the instant record which establishes that MERC would, absent our disapproval, employ its version of <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>deferral in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Under MERC\u2019s version of <em>Collyer-Spielberg, </em>as long as the arbitrator\u2019s contract-law decision indicates resolution of the statutory unfair labor practice charge in a manner \"not repugnant\u201d to PERA, MERC would do no more than adopt the arbitrator\u2019s conjectured resolution of the statutory charges as its \"decision\u201d. There would be no compliance, by the arbitrator or MERC, with the Administrative Procedures Act, no record for appellate purposes would be available, and MERC\u2019s \"decision\u201d would seemingly never be based on competent, substantial, and material evidence, all contrary to PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Further, if this case is any indication, the supposed celerity of <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>deferral is sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>ject to doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> MERC\u2019s decision and order for <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>deferral in this case was entered on April 4, 1977. The decision to defer requires analysis and determination of the applicability of the <em>Collyer </em>criteria. Such a decision is itself appealable and, in this instance, is here under review over three years after entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Moreover, in this case, Justice Williams finds that even under the <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>doctrine, MERC has improperly attempted to defer to private arbitration of the association\u2019s refusal to furnish relevant information charge. The commission\u2019s error in this regard requires, under Justice Williams\u2019 analysis, a bifurcation of the association\u2019s unfair labor practice complaint, with part being remanded to MERC for resolution according to PERA, and part to private arbitration under the <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Thus, in the present case, we are asked to attribute to the Legislature an intent, in enacting PERA, not only to authorize MERC to discretion-ally defer to private arbitration of public sector statutory unfair labor practice charges under a <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>doctrine, but also an intent to approve bifurcated proceedings attended with obvious delay and inconvenience. We are unable, in light of the specific and deliberate provisions of PERA discussed above, to declare the existence of such a legislative intent. Moreover, for reasons to be developed hereinafter, we find that the concerns which prompted the NLRB to narrowly adopt the <em>Collyer </em>doctrine in the Federal sphere are conspic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>uously absent in our state\u2019s public employee labor relations sphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">HH 1 \u2014 1</p>\n<p id=\"b845-2\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\">The <em>Collyer </em>deferral doctrine, which is thoroughly discussed in our brother\u2019s opinion, had its origin in the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s (NLRB) resolution of a dilemma presented by two expressed, and potentially conflicting, congressional policies. The first of these statutory policies is that of the NLRA\u2019s, that the NLRB should have exclusive jurisdiction to prevent unfair labor practices (in the <em>private </em>sector). The second statutory policy is that of the Labor Management Relations Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (LMRA), which favors the fullest use of collective bargaining and the arbitral process (to promote voluntary resolution of <em>private </em>sector labor disputes). The deferral policy adopted in <em>Collyer </em>is the result, then, of the NLRB\u2019s effort to resolve the dilemma presented by opposing expressions of congressional intent. Certainly, the NLRB\u2019s <em>Collyer </em>decision was not an attempt by the NLRB to substitute its judgment respecting how labor disputes should be resolved in place of Congress\u2019 judgment, as the latter is stated in the NLRA and LMRA. See <em>Collyer Insulated Wire, supra. </em>An analysis of PERA and related Michigan labor relations statutes reveals to us that no comparable dilemma has been imposed upon MERC or this Court by our Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">We agree with Justice Williams that o\u00far Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>lature \"has manifested [a] preference in the <em>private sector\u201d </em>for the voluntary resolution of contractual labor disputes through private arbitration. (Emphasis supplied.) Indeed, the title to the labor mediation act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> includes in its enumeration of purposes the following: \"to provide for the mediation <em>and arbitration </em>of labor disputes\u201d. 1939 PA 176 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In contrast, the title to PERA contains no reference to a purpose of providing for arbitration under that act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\"An act to prohibit strikes by certain public employees; to provide review from disciplinary action with respect thereto; to provide for the mediation of grievances and the holding of elections; to declare and protect the rights and privileges of public employees; and to prescribe means of enforcement and penalties for the violation of the provisions of this act.\u201d 1947 PA 336, as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">When the Legislature has intended to provide for arbitration of public employee collective bargaining disputes, as in the case of the compulsory arbitration of labor disputes in police and fire departments act<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (PA 312), it has spoken plainly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-9\">\"An act to provide for compulsory arbitration of labor disputes in municipal police and fire departments; to define such public departments; to provide for the selection of members of arbitration panels; to prescribe the procedures and authority thereof; and to provide for the enforcement and review of awards thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Moreover, as is evidenced by PA 312, when the Legislature has intended the use of arbitration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the public sector, it has provided for a quite different framework for such arbitration than would be in effect under a MERC <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>deferral doctrine under PERA. For example, under PA 312, arbitrators are chosen from a panel of qualified individuals maintained by MERC, under a procedure enabling some limited input from the parties. MCL 423.235; MSA 17.455(35). While the act authorizes informal proceedings, the making of a verbatim record is mandated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> MCL 423.236; MSA 17.455(36). In addition, the majority decision of the arbitration panel is subject to review under the competent, material, and substantial evidence standard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> MCL 423.240, 423.242; MSA 17.455(40), 17.455(42).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">When it is remembered that PA 312 concerns itself with \"interest\u201d arbitration <em>(i.e., </em>contract formation) involving primarily <em>economic </em>issues, as opposed to the <em>statutory rights </em>involved under PERA, the above-discussed provisions of PA 312 take on added significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The foregoing analysis of PA 312 establishes, to our satisfaction, that the Legislature could not have intended that <em>greater </em>deference to private arbitration methods be permitted with respect to PERA statutory unfair labor practice charges than is permitted under PA 312, where compulsory arbitration of primarily economic interests in contract formation is expressly provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Collective bargaining in the public sector is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>obviously greatly affected by political pressures and concerns, as well as economic factors. The services performed by public employees, such as the fire fighters in this case, tend to be essential to the public health, safety, and welfare. Certainly, the Legislature was cognizant of these considerations when it enacted PERA, as is evidenced by that act\u2019s prohibition of public employee strikes. At the same time, however, it is clear that the Legislature intended to provide public employees with nearly the same collective bargaining rights as are possessed by private sector employees, to the extent that public policy can allow. Toward that end, the Legislature has, through PERA, assured public employees of protection against unfair labor practices, and of remedial access to a state-level administrative agency with special expertise in statutory unfair labor practice matters. The additional safeguards that MERC must comply with the APA, and make findings in support of its decisions which are reviewable under the competent, material, and substantial evidence standard have been provided. These processes seem well designed to promote and maintain the confidence and high morale of public employees, who, being prohibited from striking, must rely heavily on the statutory protections afforded under PERA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The alternative of <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ral to private arbitration of public employee unfair labor practice charges is, under any circumstances, antithetical to these legislatively provided means for resolution of such charges under PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Finally, in our analysis, it is emphasized that we find no legislative intent forbidding or discouraging voluntary private arbitration of public employee grievance disputes. Rather, we read PERA and related state statutes as manifesting a clear legislative intent that, once a party to a public sector employment collective bargaining relationship invokes MERC\u2019s jurisdiction under PERA, that party\u2019s complaint should be resolved by MERC in accordance with the statutory processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In conclusion, we cannot agree that our Legislature intended the degree of delegation to private arbitration of public employment unfair labor practice matters that would be effected under the <em>Collyer-Spielberg </em>deferral doctrine. It appears instead that the Legislature deliberately provided for thorough MERC processes, and scrupulous review of MERC decisions, under PERA. We are not faced with the kind of conflicting expressions of legislative intent which led to the NLRB\u2019s adoption of the <em>Collyer </em>deferral doctrine. On the contrary, our Legislature has determined that our state\u2019s public policy is best served when public employment disputes, implicating statutory rights, are resolved under a system which provides significant procedural, and appellate review, protections. We do not substitute the public policy evaluations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of this Court for the considered, and clearly expressed, policy judgments of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Accordingly, we reverse MERC\u2019s order in this case and remand this matter to MERC for plenary consideration of the plaintiff association\u2019s complaint pursuant to the statutorily provided processes.</p>\n<judges id=\"b850-5\">Coleman, C.J., and Fitzgerald and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b850-6\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXQ\"><em>(for affirmance in part and reversal in part). </em>The important question in this case is designated by this Court\u2019s grant of leave to appeal, limited to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">\"Whether the Michigan Employment Relations Commission may, when presented with allegations of unfair labor practices, defer hearing of those charges until after an arbitration award has been made pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, where the subject matter of the alleged unfair labor practices is arguably covered by the collective bargaining agreement in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">In essence, this issue requires us to determine whether the doctrine of \"pre-arbitral\u201d deferral is statutorily permissible under Michigan law and, if so, under what conditions. As indicated in footnote 15, <em>infra, </em>we express no opinion concerning either the statutory or constitutional efficacy of post-arbitration award, or Spielberg-type, deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">This is a question of first impression in this state. However, the underlying Michigan labor legislation in question, the public employment relations act (hereinafter PERA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is \"modeled on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and is derived from that Federal act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the language of the pivotal PERA section, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is nearly identical in language with the pertinent Federal statutory section of the NLRA, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In those instances where we have earlier been confronted with an issue relevant to PERA, this Court has indicated that it \"may appropriately look to the Federal precedents for guidance\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>so in this case and find that there exists a large body of Federal administrative and judicial authority addressing the issue before us. Furthermore, the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (hereinafter MERC) has largely followed that Federal precedent in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">We find those Federal precedents considering and upholding pre-arbitral deferral to be both applicable and persuasive. We have reviewed the fundamental legislative and policy considerations which influenced those Federal rulings and find that such considerations apply with even more vitality to the pertinent Michigan statutes and support our ruling here. We therefore hold that pursuant to \u00a7 16 of PERA, MERC <em>may, </em>when presented with allegations of unfair labor practices, defer hearing of those charges until after an arbitration award has been rendered pursuant to the parties\u2019 binding collective bargaining agreement, <em>where </em>(1) a stable bargaining relationship and the absence of enmity is found to exist between the parties; (2) there is found to exist an intent on the respondent\u2019s part to exhaust the parties\u2019 contract grievance procedures culminating in final and binding arbitration; and (3) the subject matter of the alleged unfair labor practice is determined to be arguably covered by the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, centering on the interpretation or application of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Affirmed as to the determination set forth above, but reversed and remanded as to the deferral of the Detroit Fire Fighters Association\u2019s charge that the city refused to furnish relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">\n<em>A. Factual and Procedural Background: The Objected-to City Plan of Reorganization</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">On March, 24, 1976, Fire Commissioner Jeffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>son issued a press release indicating that the city intended to close one fire station, eliminate four tactical mobile squads as well as three engine and two ladder companies, demote an unspecified number of officers (ostensibly to increase the fire fighter/fire chief ratio), and transfer certain personnel in an apparent attempt to strengthen certain overburdened fire companies. This plan was to be implemented on March 29, 1976, without prior discussion, allegedly in furtherance of a city-wide April 4 projected layoff scheme.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">On March 25, 1976, one day after the issuance of Commissioner Jefferson\u2019s press release, the association filed a written protest with the city objecting to the press release proposals. The association maintained that the proposed plan violated both PERA and various provisions of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, demanded good faith bargaining, and insisted that the city refrain from implementing the reorganization pending such negotiations. The letter also requested certain information more precisely describing the reorganization\u2019s effects on personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The following day, the Fire Commissioner issued a separate bulletin proposing the demotion of approximately 150 officers. Further, a meeting was held between city and association representatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>to consider the association\u2019s objections. Concurrent with this meeting, the association petitioned Judge O\u2019Hair for a temporary restraining order relative to the city\u2019s intended reorganization. That petition was granted and an order issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Subsequent to Judge O\u2019Hair\u2019s restraining order, on March 27 and 29, 1976, the Fire Commissioner issued two further bulletins which substantially sought to fulfill the terms of the March 24 reorganization press release.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">On March 29, 1976, the city sought to implement the bulletins without the benefit of prior bargaining with association representatives. Insofar as such attempted implementation was determined by Judge O\u2019Hair to be contrary to his March 26 temporary restraining order, the Fire Department\u2019s Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, and Acting Chief were held in civil contempt. The city subsequently abandoned its disputed activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\n<em>B. The Current Unfair Labor Practice Charges and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\n<em>1. Decision and Recommended Order of</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">\n<em>Administrative Law Judge Kurtz: Pre-Arbitral Deferral Granted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Concurrent with the association\u2019s petition for a temporary restraining order and its extra-judicial meeting with city representatives, on March 26, 1976, the association formally charged the city with statutory unfair labor practice violations before MERC. The association charged the city with having violated \u00a7 10(1), subds (a) and (e)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of PERA, in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>. \"On or about March 26, 1976, the above-named employer refused to bargain with the charging party by unilaterally altering working conditions, including manpower and safety, of employees represented by the charging party by ordering the discontinuance of four battalions and four tactical mobile squads, demoting at least 150 officers, and transferring affected personnel; and refusing to bargain with regard to same, to desist from same pending negotiations, and to furnish requested information with respect thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">On June 7, 1976, counsel for both parties appeared before MERC Administrative Law Judge (hereinafter ALJ) Kurtz, <em>Detroit Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 267, 280. At the outset of that hearing, counsel for the city admitted all factual allegations, except the refusal to furnish information allegation, of the association\u2019s charge. The city then moved for pre-arbitral deferral of MERC\u2019s \"jurisdiction in this matter to the contractual grievance procedure which includes binding arbitration\u201d inasmuch as \"a clearly contractual dispute\u201d was at issue. After argument between counsel on the record, albeit without the benefit of testimony, ALJ Kurtz granted the city\u2019s motion to defer the matter to the contractual grievance-arbitration procedure contained in the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">At the hearing, counsel for the city characterized the disputed actions as personnel shifts, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>tended to be undertaken concurrently with the anticipated April 4, 1976, layoff of 251 Fire Department employees; these layoffs were explained as occasioned by a general city-wide fiscal crisis necessitating reductions in many city departments due to departmental budget reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Specifically addressing the contractual nature of the charge, the city maintained that both the proposed demotions and transfers were personnel shifts authorized under Article 10 of the parties\u2019 contract dealing with seniority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, the battalion and squad reductions were posited as arguably authorized by Article 12.E6<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ties\u2019 contract and necessary products of the April 4 layoff scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">The city asserted that it had provided all requested information pertinent to the proposed actions outlined in the March 26 press release. No contract clause was offered as embracing information request disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Responding to the city\u2019s motion for pre-arbitral deferral, the association did not contest counsel\u2019s admission that the city had indeed violated certain contractual mandates of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. The association nonetheless objected to deferral under the instant circumstances, alleging that, as a prevailing complement to these contractual transgressions, \"such actions were plainly violative of the city\u2019s statutory obligations under PERA [\u00a7 10(1), subds (a) and (e)] to refrain from unilateral changes and <em>[sic] </em>material conditions of employment, particularly insofar as the impact upon manpower and * * * the impact upon safety\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Citing earlier promotional-standard disputes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the unilateral nature of the Fire Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>missioner\u2019s press release, as well as the department\u2019s violations of Judge O\u2019Hair\u2019s temporary restraining order, the association urged that pre-arbitral deferral was inappropriate in view of the city\u2019s disregard of the parties\u2019 collective grievance-bargaining mechanism. The association additionally asserted that the city\u2019s refusal to supply requested information precluded pre-arbitral deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">On August 9, 1976, ALJ Kurtz granted the city\u2019s pre-arbitral deferral motion, declining to entertain the matter any further and deferring the association\u2019s disputes to the parties\u2019 contractual grievance-dispute arbitration machinery \"with the usual proviso that the Commission retain jurisdiction for the purpose of determining whether any eventual arbitration decision, and the handling of any grievance, is in accord with the PERA and Commission policy\u201d, <em>Detroit Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 267, 280, 285. Pivotal to this decision were the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\"the previous failures of the employer in its bargaining with the union do not evidence an 'anti-union history\u2019 which would sustain a finding that the city has a background of such hostility and animosity towards collective bargaining and contractual grievance settlement processes so as to justify a refusal to defer to arbitration. * * * Nor is reorganization plan in this case a clear refusal to obey a prior arbitration award, as was involved in the previous fire department case before ALJ Bixler * * *.

MERC and Court of Appeals Affirmance of ALJ Kurtz\u2019s Pre-Arbitral Deferral Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">On April 4, 1977, MERC Commissioners Rehmus and Milmet affirmed the decision and recommended order of ALJ Kurtz; Commissioner Ellmann dissented. <em>Detroit Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 267.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The MERC majority: (1) rejected the association\u2019s allegations of sufficient anti-union history and animosity toward the collective bargaining process to preclude deferral; (2) determined that deferral in this instance was consistent with prior MERC decisions and policy; (3) eschewed the notion that the association\u2019s disputes primarily involved statutory obligations; and (4) concluded that insufficient evidence had been presented to establish a clear refusal by the city to comply with the association\u2019s information request and that this charge could be properly resolved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the arbitral forum. <em>Id., </em>277-278.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> MERC retained jurisdiction to review both the arbitral proceedings and award.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">On September 13, 1977, the Court of Appeals affirmed by order the MERC decision to defer exercise of its jurisdiction to the arbitral process.

The Court of Appeals did not address the association\u2019s charge relative to the city\u2019s alleged refusal to furnish requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">II. Issue and Arguments of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">On April 17, 1978, this Court granted the association\u2019s application for leave to appeal, limited to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">\"Whether the Michigan Employment Relations Commission may, when presented with allegations of unfair labor practices, defer hearing of those charges until after an arbitration award has been made pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, where the subject matter of the alleged unfair labor practices is arguably covered by the collective bargaining agreement in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Along with other arguments raised by the asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ciation which we do not address,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the association contends that this question should be answered in the negative inasmuch as: (1) pre-arbitral deferral violates MERC\u2019s statutory obligation to remedy unfair labor practice charges as provided in \u00a7 16 of PERA; (2) PERA, as interpreted in <em>Rockwell v Crestwood School Dist, </em>393 Mich 616, 642-643; 227 NW2d 736 (1975), <em>app dis </em>427 US 901; 96 S Ct 3184; 49 L Ed 2d 1195 (1976), prohibits MERC from refusing to decide statutory unfair labor practice charges properly within its jurisdiction; and (3) unlike the Federal congressional policy favoring arbitral resolution of grievance disputes, no such countervailing policy is expressed in the Michigan statutory scheme to support arbitral deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The city responds to these arguments as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">(1) \u00a7 16 of PERA grants MERC discretionary authority to defer disputes arguably within the parties\u2019 contractual, collective bargaining agreement;</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">(2) <em>Rockwell v Crestwood School Dist, </em>is distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>guishable from the deferral question and its general mandate has nonetheless been fulfilled; and (3) like the Federal policy, the Michigan labor regulatory scheme favors the concept of pre-arbitral deferral insofar as that concept furthers the policy preference for the voluntary resolution of grievance disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The matter of pre-arbitral deferral under \u00a7 16 of PERA is one of first impression in this state. There are, however, abundant decisions of the NLRB, the United States Supreme Court and the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal considering comparable doctrine and provisions emanating from the NLRA, upon which the parties have relied in addressing the pre-arbitral deferral issue on leave. The Michigan labor relations acts are modeled on the NLRA, <em>Rockwell v Crestwood School Dist, </em>fn 2 <em>supra, </em>635-636. PERA is derived from that act, <em>Lamphere Schools v Lamphere Federation of Teachers, </em>400 Mich 104, 120; 252 NW2d 818 (1977). Section 16 of PERA is virtually identical in language to \u00a7 10, subds (b), (c), and (e) of the NLRA, from which the doctrine of pre-arbitral deferral arises. Therefore, this Court \"may appropriately look to the Federal precedents for guidance\u201d in considering the propriety of pre-arbitral deferral. <em>MERC v Reeths-Puffer School Dist, </em>391 Mich 253, 260; 215 NW2d 672 (1974). See <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>391 Mich 44, 53; 214 NW2d 803 (1974). We will likewise review MERC\u2019s treatment of the deferral doctrine as it has been shaped by the Federal sphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">IV. The NLRB\u2019s and the Federal Judiciary\u2019s Position on the Discretionary Exercise of Deferral Authority Under the NLRA</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>\n<em>A. NLRB Power to Prevent Unfair Labor Practice: Statutory and Policy Tensions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Section 7 of the NLRA, 29 USC 157, guarantees workers the right to organize and engage in collective bargaining without interference. Those specific practices proscribed as interfering with a worker\u2019s \u00a77 rights have been deemed \"unfair labor practice^]\u201d and are codified in \u00a7 8 of the NLRA, 29 USC 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Through \u00a7 10 of the act, 29 USC 160, Congress has engineered a mechanism for NLRB review and enforcement of \u00a7 8 charges, and authorizes the NLRB</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">\"(a) to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in \u00a7 8 of this title) affecting commerce. <em>This power shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention </em>that has been or may be <em>established by agreement, </em>law or otherwise * * *.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">In determining the propriety of discretionary NLRB deference to the litigants\u2019 contractually-forged binding arbitral process, both the Federal judiciary and the NLRB have been confronted with the apparent tension between two competing congressional policies: one policy discourages while the other supports the exercise of deferral authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The first policy favors NLRB remedial independence and casts the board as the sole arbiter of statutory unfair labor practices.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This congressional policy, reflecting the literal mandate of NLRA, \u00a7 10(a) quoted above, necessarily operates to the exclusion of arbitral deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">The second policy encourages affording \"full play\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the voluntary, contractual resolution of grievance disputes<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and elevates the arbitral mechanism for grievance adjustment to a preferred position in Federal labor law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This policy preference embraces the concept of discretionary deferral authority despite the literal mandate of NLRA, \u00a7 10(a)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and finds support in \u00a7 203(d) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the Labor Management Relations Act (hereinafter LMRA), 29 USC 173(d), which provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\">\"Final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing collective bargaining agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">As will be revealed below, this conflict has largely been resolved in favor of discretionary deferral authority in both post-award, or <em>Spielberg Mfg Co, </em>112 NLRB 1080; 36 LRRM 1152 (1955), and pre-arbitral, or <em>Collyer Insulated Wire, </em>192 NLRB 837; 77 LRRM 1931 (1971), deferral situations. Rather than taking either of these two policy extremes, however, Federal authorities have embraced the <em>tertium quid </em>and upheld the arbitral deferral doctrine provided the NLRB retains statutory jurisdiction to review the ultimate arbitral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>award. No lesser authority than the United States Supreme Court has indicated in dictum its approval of the deferral doctrine when Mr. Justice Brennan remarked for a unanimous Court in <em>William E Arnold Co v Carpenters Dist Council of Jacksonville, </em>417 US 12, 16-17; 94 S Ct 2069; 40 L Ed 2d 620 (1974), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\">\"Indeed, Board policy is to refrain from exercising jurisdiction in respect of disputed conduct arguably both an unfair labor practice and a contract violation when, as in this case, the parties have voluntarily established by contract a binding settlement procedure. * * * The Board said in <em>Collyer, </em>'an industrial relations dispute may involve conduct which, at least arguably, may contravene both the collective agreement and our statute. * * * We believe it to be consistent with the. fundamental objectives of Federal law to require the parties * * * to honor their contractual obligations rather than, by casting [their] dispute in statutory terms, to ignore their agreed-upon procedures.\u2019 * * * The Board\u2019s position harmonizes with Congress\u2019 articulated concern that, '[f]inal adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is * * * the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing collective-bargaining agreement * * *.\u2019 29 USC 173(d).\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">\n<em>B. The Post-Arbitration Award Spielberg Deferral Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Federal response to the question of NLRB deferral first arose in a post-arbitral award deferral context. Inasmuch as the doctrine of discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>pre-arbitral deferral, under consideration here, emanated from that decisional authority and rationale supporting post-award deferral, we will first briefly address the post-award, or <em>Spielberg, </em>deferral doctrine. As indicated in footnote 15, <em>supra, </em>our discussion of the NLRB\u2019s <em>Spielberg </em>doctrine is not intended to sanction that rule but is, rather, offered only to elucidate the concept of <em>Collyer </em>prearbitral deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">In <em>Spielberg Mfg Co, </em>112 NLRB 1080; 36 LRRM 1152 (1955), the parties agreed to submit their employee reinstatement dispute to contractual binding arbitration. The arbitration panel concluded that reinstatement was not required under the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. Upholding that award, the NLRB emphasized that it was not legally bound by the private tribunal\u2019s resolution pursuant to \u00a7 10(a) of the act, but concluded that it would not upset it where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">\"* * * <em>the proceedings appear to have been fair and regular, all parties had agreed to be bound, and the decision of the arbitration panel is not clearly repugnant to the purposes and policies of the Act. </em>In these circumstances we believe that the desirable objective of encouraging the voluntary settlement of labor disputes will best be served by our recognition of the arbitrators\u2019 award.\u201d <em>Id., </em>1082. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The <em>Spielberg </em>doctrine was elaborated upon and clearly reaffirmed in <em>International Harvester Co, </em>138 NLRB 923, 925-926; 51 LRRM 1155, 1157 (1962). The Supreme Court added its imprimatur to the post-award deferral doctrine in <em>Carey v Westinghouse Electric Corp, </em>375 US 261, 271; 84 S Ct 401; 11 L Ed 2d 320 (1964), quoting with approval the following statement from <em>International Harvester Co, supra, </em>925-926:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>\" 'There is no question that the Board is not precluded from adjudicating unfair labor practice charges even though they might have been the subject of an arbitration proceeding and award. Section 10(a) of the Act expressly makes this plain, and the courts have uniformly so held. <em>However, it is equally well established that the Board has considerable discretion to respect an arbitration award and decline to exercise its authority over alleged unfair labor practices if to do so will serve the fundamental aims of the Act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-5\">\" 'The Act, as has repeatedly been stated, is primarily designed to promote industrial peace and stability by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining. Experience has demonstrated that collective-bargaining agreements that provide for final and binding arbitration of grievance and disputes arising thereunder, \"as a substitute for industrial strife,\u201d contribute significantly to the attainment of this statutory objective.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In <em>Raytheon Co, </em>140 NLRB 883, 884-886; 52 LRRM 1129 (1963), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds Raytheon Co v NLRB, </em>326 F2d 471 (CA 1, 1964), the NLRB supplemented <em>Spielberg </em>by requiring that the unfair labor practice charge cognizable under the parties\u2019 agreement have been presented to, as well as considered by, the arbitral tribunal before post-award deferral would be deemed proper. <em>Spielberg </em>otherwise remained undisturbed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Although the <em>Spielberg </em>doctrine has been repeatedly addressed and refined by the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>authorities,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it has survived both judicial and administrative scrutiny for the past approximately 30 years.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In short, our research discloses that the NLRB is empowered with discretion to abstain from entertaining an alleged unfair labor practice charge arguably covered by the parties\u2019 binding collective bargaining agreement and defer to the arbitral tribunal\u2019s award where the charge has been properly decided through private arbitration. The <em>Spielberg </em>doctrine has been fashioned as furthering the purposes of the Federal labor relations scheme despite the contradictory sense of NLRA, \u00a7 10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">C. <em>The Pre-Arbitral Collyer Deferral Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-S\">Between the benchmarks of <em>Spielberg </em>in 1955 and <em>Carey </em>in 1964, it is apparent that the Federal authorities had increasingly indicated a disposition to reconcile the competing claims of Federal labor policy in favor of the arbitral process. Especially was this clear in the case of post-award deferral. In the seminal decision of <em>Collyer Insulated Wire, </em>192 NLRB 837; 77 LRRM 1931 (1971), however, the NLRB explicitly extended the ambit of discretionary NLRB deferral authority and ushered in the era of \"pre-arbitral deferral\u201d,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> representing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\"an accommodation between, on the one hand, the statutory policy favoring the fullest use of collective bargaining and the arbitral process and, on the other, the statutory policy reflected by Congress\u2019 grant to the Board of exclusive jurisdiction to prevent unfair labor practices\u201d. <em>Id., </em>841.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In <em>Collyer, </em>the union charged that the employer had violated NLRA, \u00a7 8(a), subds (1) and (5) by allegedly undertaking unilateral changes in certain wages and working conditions. The employer maintained that it was so authorized pursuant to the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement as well as their prior course of contractual dealing. Accordingly, the employer averred that the dispute should be resolved through the parties\u2019 contractually binding grievance arbitration machinery as the appropriate forum for grievance adjustment despite the union\u2019s characterization of the dispute in statutory terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 factual allegations and contractual agreement, the NLRB majority opined that this was \"essentially a dispute over the terms and meaning of the contract\u201d, <em>id., </em>837, which \"in its entirety arises from the contract\u201d, <em>id., </em>839. The breadth of the arbitration provision satisfied the majority that \"the parties intended to make the grievance and arbitration machinery the exclusive forum for resolving contract disputes\u201d. <em>Id., </em>839. Noting that \"the dispute between these parties is the very stuff of labor contract arbitration\u201d, <em>id., </em>842, the board emphasized that \"[t]he competence of a mutually selected arbitrator to decide the issue and fashion an appropriate remedy, if needed, can no longer be gainsaid\u201d. <em>Id., </em>842. Sensitive to the dissent\u2019s objection that deferral to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>private arbitral consideration would strip the parties of statutory rights and henceforward mandate private compulsory arbitration of otherwise statutory disputes, the NLRB majority responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-4\">\"We are not compelling any party to agree to arbitrate disputes arising during a contract term, but are <em>merely giving full effect to their own voluntary agreements </em>to submit all such disputes to arbitration, <em>rather than permitting such agreements to be sidestepped and permitting the substitution of our </em>processes, <em>a forum not contemplated by their own agreement.\u201d Id., </em>842. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The NLRB concluded that the threshold issue of whether to defer arises \"only when a set of facts may present not only an alleged violation of the Act but also an alleged breach of the collective-bargaining agreement subject to arbitration\u201d. <em>Id., </em>841. Elaborating on those factors favoring pre-arbitral deferral,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the majority observed that \"[t]he contract and its meaning * * * lie at the center of [the] dispute\u201d, such that,</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">\"* * * the Act and its policies become involved only if it is determined that the agreement between the parties, examined in the light of its negotiating history and the practices of the parties thereunder, did not sanction Respondent\u2019s right to make the disputed changes * * * under the contractually prescribed procedure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>842.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-7\">\"We conclude that the Board is vested with authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>to withhold its processes in this case, and that the contract here made available a quick and fair means for the resolution of this dispute including, if appropriate, a fully effective remedy for any breach of contract which occurred.\u201d <em>Id., </em>839.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The NLRB announced that, per <em>Spielberg, </em>it would reserve jurisdiction pending arbitration to \"guarantee that there will be no sacrifice of statutory rights if the parties\u2019 own processes fail to function in a manner consistent with the dictates of our law\u201d. <em>Id., </em>843. As justification for their announcement of the discretionary pre-arbitral doctrine subject to <em>Spielberg </em>review, the majority surveyed the Federal statutory labor scheme as well as the Federal sphere\u2019s interpretation thereof<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and, in the words of concurring member Brown, found that \"the <em>raison d\u2019\u00e9tre </em>of the [NLRA] is to encourage collective bargaining\u201d. <em>Id., </em>844. The <em>Collyer </em>doctrine was cast as comporting with the \"[dynamic] policy of this Nation to avoid industrial strife through voluntary resolution of industrial disputes\u201d. <em>Id., </em>843.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Since the <em>Collyer </em>decision, at least three Federal circuits have directly upheld that doctrine<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and at least three others have offered implicit approval in considering whether the NLRB properly exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>its authority <em>not </em>to defer.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> While the NLRB\u2019s decisions in <em>Roy Robinson [Chevrolet], Inc, </em>228 NLRB 828; 94 LRRM 1474 (1977), <em>General American Transportation Corp, </em>228 NLRB 808; 94 LRRM 1483 (1977), and the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Alexander v Gardner-Denver Co, </em>415 US 36; 94 S Ct 1011; 39 L Ed 2d 147 (1974),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> appear to have somewhat restricted the expansion of <em>Col</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Iyer\u2019s </em>scope, the Federal sphere has consistently upheld and applied <em>Collyer\u2019s </em>four-factor test in determining whether pre-arbitral deferral is appropriate. The <em>Collyer </em>doctrine has been discussed favorably in <em>dicta </em>by the United States Supreme Court, <em>William E Arnold Co v Carpenters Dist Council, </em>417 US 12, 16-17; 94 S Ct 2069; 40 L Ed 2d 620 (1974), and has prompted the Second Circuit to state: \"The validity of the <em>Collyer </em>doctrine is no longer seriously in doubt\u201d. <em>Lodges 700, 743, 1746, International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v NLRB, </em>525 F2d 237, 239 (CA 2, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">\n<em>D. Summary of NLRB Deferral Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In summary, the NLRB has exercised discretionary deferral both prior to and following the decision of the parties\u2019 arbitral tribunal. <em>Spielberg </em>and its progeny generally indicate that the board will defer to a <em>prior arbitral award, </em>provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">(1) the unfair labor practice dispute cognizable under the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement was presented to and considered by the arbitral tribunal;</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">(2) the arbitral proceedings were fair and regular;</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">(3) all parties to the arbitral proceedings agreed to be bound thereby; and</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">(4) the decision of the arbitral tribunal was not clearly repugnant to the purposes and the policies of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\"><em>Collyer </em>and its progeny generally indicate that the board will defer an alleged unfair labor practice charge to the parties\u2019 binding grievance-arbitration procedures memorialized in their collective bargaining agreement subject to <em>Spielberg </em>post-award review, provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">(1) a stable collective bargaining relationship exists between the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>(2) the respondent is willing to resort to arbitration under a binding arbitration clause broad enough to embrace the dispute; and</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">(3) the contract and its meaning are at the center of the dispute.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">V.

The Pre-Arbitral Deferral City of Flint Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">In <em>City of Flint, </em>1970 MERC Lab Op 367, a unanimous MERC predated the NLRB\u2019s <em>Collyer </em>decision by deferring resolution of an arguably contractual, training-schedule negotiation dispute to the parties\u2019 contractually established arbitral mechanism insofar as \"[t]he record discloses that the issue dividing the [parties] is basically one of contract interpretation\u201d. <em>Id., </em>369. In adopting this pre-arbitral deferral posture whereby \"[t]he contract procedure should be exhausted before the parties seek to have their contract disagreement settled by government\u201d, <em>id., </em>369, MERC approved the following general guidelines and policy rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-8\">\" 'If there is any situation in which the Board should defer to the parties\u2019 own agreed-upon methods for resolving contract disputes, this is the case. Thus, the parties have an <em>established </em>bargaining history; they have a <em>dispute involving substantive contract interpretation, </em>each party <em>asserting a reasonable claim in good faith </em>* * *; and they have <em>contractual grievance-arbitration procedures which Respondent has urged the Union to use for resolving their dispute. </em>In this context, the <em>[sic] </em>mindful of our competency in the area, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>believe that the policy of promoting industrial peace and stability through collective bargaining impels us to defer to the grievance-arbitration procedures the parties themselves have voluntarily established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>370, quoting <em>Unit Drop Forge Division, Eaton, Yale &amp; Towne, Inc, </em>171 NLRB 600, 604; 68 LRRM 1129, 1133 (1968) (dissent). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Concluding, MERC stated its acceptance of the post-award deferral <em>Spielberg </em>doctrine and remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">\"There will be situations in which we should, and will take jurisdiction of the controversies which may involved <em>[sic] </em>contract construction as well as an alleged unfair labor practice. <em>But employers and unions should make every effort to resolve issues primarily contractual under the contract dispute-settling procedure.\u201d </em>1970 MERC Lab Op 371. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In <em>University of Michigan, </em>1971 MERC Lab Op 994, MERC considered deferring to arbitration a charge of unilateral alteration of the lunch hour. MERC approved the pre-arbitral deferral doctrine and elaborated on the propriety of exercising such authority, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">\"We note that the collective bargaining agreement contained an arbitration provision. The presence of this arbitration clause does not divest this Commission of jurisdiction from passing on the unfair labor practice. However, left to this Commission is considerable discretion as to whether we should decline to exercise our unfair labor practice jurisdiction in the face of an invoked grievance arbitration procedure.

MERC opined that pre-arbitral deferral is appropriate where the \"dispute arises under the contract\u201d, <em>id., </em>1040, since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-4\">\" 'disputes such as these can better be resolved by arbitrators with special skill and experience in deciding matters arising under established bargaining relationships than by the application * * * of a particular provision of our statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>1041, quoting <em>Collyer, supra, </em>839.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Pre-arbitral deferral was described as advancing the \"declared * * * public policy of this state\u201d evidenced in \u00a7 1 of the labor mediation act (LMA), MCL 423.1; MSA 17.454(1), \"to promote the prevention or prompt settlement of labor disputes and other forms of industrial strife\u201d, <em>Wayne County, </em>1041-1042.

Summary of MERC Pre-Arbitral Deferral Policy </em>Mirroring the <em>Collyer </em>doctrine, MERC has outlined its pre-arbitral deferral policy in the following succinct statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-8\">\"Under <em>Collyer, </em>deferral of a charge presumes satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>faction of <em>three requirements: </em>1) <em>a stable bargaining relationship between the </em>parties;[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>] 2) <em>intent on Respondent\u2019s part to </em>exhaust[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>] <em>the contract grievance procedure culminating in \u00f1nal and binding arbitration; </em>[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>] <em>and </em>3) <em>the underlying dispute centers on the interpretation or application of the </em>contract.[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>] The touchstone of deferral is that the dispute does not require a determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>nation or clarification of statutory obligations and is susceptible of resolution under the provisions and language of the contract. Pre-award deferral thus involves a preliminary review of the history and quality of the bargaining relationship, the amenability of Respondent to arbitrate,[<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>] the absence of anti-union animus, and the scope of the arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Detroit Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 267, 276.

A solution which leaves all of these questions to MERC seems highly undesirable, since in many situations it would subject the parties to unnecessary costs and delay. In contrast, a solution which makes a private adjudicator the final and .binding interpreter of the external law is improper and unattainable, even if it were desirable. <em>The third alternative, which would say that questions under the agreement are to be resolved by arbitrators, but that the results of arbitration, insofar as they involve the interpretation and application of the agreement itself, are to be taken as binding in subsequent litigation under the external law if they were satisfactorily considered there </em>[per <em>Spielberg], is conceptually proper and meets the best interests of the parties in the vast majority of disputes.\u201d Id., </em>274.

Has MERC Properly Found Discretionary Deferral Authority in PERA, \u00a7 16?</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The foregoing analysis demonstrates the significant comparability in doctrinal development of the NLRB\u2019s and MERC\u2019s pre-arbitral deferral postures. While it is patent that MERC\u2019s <em>City of Flint </em>doctrine has closely paralleled the federally-sanctioned <em>Collyer </em>doctrine in <em>substantive </em>respects, the question remains whether MERC, like the NLRB pursuant to NLRA, \u00a7 10, may exercise discretionary deferral authority pursuant to the <em>procedural </em>outline of PERA, \u00a7 16 subject to proper post-award review. We resolve this inquiry in the affirmative. Indeed, we find the propriety of PERA, \u00a7 16 discretionary deferral authority to be more ineluctable than the federally approved exercise of NLRA, \u00a7 10 deferral authority to which we look for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\n<em>A. The Virtual Identity in Language of PERA, \u00a7 16 and NLRA, \u00a710</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Using language much like that of NLRA, \u00a7 8, through PERA, \u00a7 10, the Michigan Legislature has enumerated and declared \"unlawful\u201d certain actions deemed in PERA, \u00a7 16 to be \"unfair labor practices <em>remediable </em>by [MERC]\u201d (emphasis supplied). PERA, \u00a7 16 is the nearly precise statutory analogue of NLRA, \u00a7 10. Our discussion earlier in this opinion has established that the NLRB has been judicially accorded discretionary deferral authority over NLRA, \u00a7 8 claims pursuant to the statutory framework of NLRA, \u00a7 10. With marked similarity to the language of NLRA, \u00a7 10, \u00a7 16 of PERA provides a procedural framework for MERC review and enforcement of unfair labor charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">\"Violations of * * * [\u00a7 10] shall be * * * <em>remediable </em>by the commission in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>\"(a) Whenever * * * [a \u00a7 10 unfair labor practice] is charged * * * the commission * * * <em>may issue and cause to be served upon the person a complaint </em>stating the charges in that respect, and containing a notice of hearing * * *.

One salient aspect of the statutory parallelism between PERA and the NLRA was recognized in <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n, </em>fn 6 <em>supra, </em>53, where we found that \u00a7 15 of PERA \"undoubtedly was patterned after \u00a7 8(d) of the * * * (NLRA) [inasmuch as] [b]oth statutes use almost identical language\u201d. The significance of this virtual identity in language was emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-11\">\"The decision by the Michigan Legislature to adopt the language of \u00a7 8(d) of the NLRA is significant. Section 8(d) has been a part of the NLRA since the TaftHartley amendments of 1947. The terms of \u00a7 8(d) have been litigated in numerous cases before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Federal courts. Although we cannot state with certainty, it is probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>safe to assume that the Michigan Legislature intentionally adopted \u00a7 15 PERA in the form that it did with the. expectation that MERC and the Michigan courts would rely on the legal precedents developed under NLRA, \u00a7 8(d) to the extent that they apply to public sector bargaining.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id., </em>53.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Given the virtual identity in language of PERA, \u00a7 16 and NLRA, \u00a7 10, we likewise find it \"safe to assume\u201d that \u00a7 16 was intentionally adopted in anticipation of this Court\u2019s as well as MERC\u2019s reliance on Federal precedent in construing the discretionary nature of MERC\u2019s \u00a7 16 deferral authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Inasmuch as our research of Federal precedential guidance discloses that deferral authority has been deemed proper under \u00a7 10 of the NLRA, we likewise find that MERC may exercise discretionary pre-arbitral deferral authority (subject to proper post-award review) under the virtually identical language of PERA, \u00a7 16:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">\"While Federal-state conflicts are concededly not at issue in this state case, precedents under the * * * (NLRA), from which the PERA is derived, are to be persuasively considered.\u201d <em>Lamphere Schools, </em>fn 3 <em>supra, </em>120.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">See <em>Rockwell, </em>fn 2 <em>supra, </em>635-636; <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n, </em>fn 6 <em>supra, </em>53; <em>Reeths-Puffer School Dist, </em>fn 6 <em>supra, </em>260.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">While it is clear that the procedural outline of PERA, \u00a7 16, much like NLRA, \u00a7 10, neither expressly authorizes nor prohibits discretionary deferral, it is equally clear that MERC\u2019s powers in this regard are framed in discretionary rather than mandatory terms. Substantially imitating the congressional statement, the Michigan Legislature penned this section to provide that: unfair labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>practices are \"remediable\u201d by the commission, not \"shall be remedied\u201d; MERC \"may\u201d issue a complaint, rather than \"mandatorily shall\u201d issue a complaint; finally, even if a violation is discerned, MERC \"may\u201d, not \"shall\u201d, petition the Court of Appeals for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Our reading of PERA, \u00a7 16, much like the Federal sphere\u2019s treatment of NLRA, \u00a7 10, indicates that MERC \"shall\u201d have the authority to remedy primarily \"statutory\u201d unfair labor practices. MERC is not, however, mandatorily \"required\u201d to exercise that authority and \"may\u201d, in its discretion, defer the exercise of its jurisdiction to arbitration in those instances where the commission is \"of the opinion\u201d that, among other factors discussed in Part V, B, <em>supra, </em>the respondent is not engaged in a primarily statutory unfair labor practice but, rather, is engaged in a practice arguably covered by the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">\n<em>B. Unfair Labor Practice Charges Are \"Remediable\u201d by MERC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Again looking to the guidance of Federal precedent, we find further support for our acceptance of PERA, \u00a7 16 discretionary deferral authority in comparing the language and Federal treatment of NLRA, \u00a7 10(a) with the introductory paragraph of PERA, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Section 10(a) of the NLRA empowers the NLRB to prevent statutory unfair labor practices and further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">\"This power <em>shall not be affected, </em>by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been * * * established by agreement * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Despite this seemingly mandatory language, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Federal sphere has consistently held NLRB deferral to constitute a permissible exercise of NLRA, \u00a7 10 discretionary remedial authority. Significantly, such deferral authority has been federally sanctioned even though, as indicated in footnote 19, <em>supra, </em>express language authorizing deferral was deleted from NLRA, \u00a7 10 as finally enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Unlike \u00a7 10(a) of the Federal statutory framework, \u00a7 16 of PERA is introduced by the following discretionary language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-5\">\"Violations of the provisions of section 10 shall be deemed unfair labor practices <em>remediable </em>by the commission * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Juxtaposed with the directory language of NLRA, \u00a7 10(a), it is inescapable that the Michigan Legislature sought to couch \u00a7 16 in discretionary terms and thereby avoid the obstacle to deferral originally posed by NLRA, \u00a7 10(a). The internal, statutory tension which the Federal sphere had to resolve in sanctioning deferral authority is significantly absent from our consideration here and compels our approval of PERA, \u00a7 16 discretionary deferral authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">\n<em>C. PERA, \u00a716 Pre-Arbitral Deferral Authority Accords With This State\u2019s Policy Favoring the Voluntary Resolution of Disputed Labor Practices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Much like the Federal sphere\u2019s determination that pre-arbitral deferral is merely an exercise in abstention rather than abdication, thereby furthering the Federal preference for arbitral resolution of labor disputes, we similarly find that MERC\u2019s deferral policy comports with this state\u2019s preference for the voluntary resolution of contractual labor disputes through mutually binding collective bargaining agreement procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The Legislature has manifested this preference in the private sector through its enactment of the labor mediation act (LMA), \"[a]n act * * * to provide for the mediation and arbitration of labor disputes\u201d, which has as its declared policy, \"that the voluntary mediation of such disputes under the guidance and supervision of a governmental agency will tend to promote permanent industrial peace * * *\u201d, MCL 423.1; MSA 17.454(1). Section 10(1) of that act specifically maintains that the commission \"shall take such steps as it may deem expedient to effect a voluntary, amicable, and expeditious adjustment and settlement [of the parties\u2019 labor dispute]\u201d. MCL 423.10(1); MSA 17.454(H)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Through its enactment of PERA, the Legislature has likewise placed a premium on the voluntary resolution of public-sector labor disputes. Justice Moody\u2019s legislative history of PERA chronicled in his <em>Lamphere Schools </em>opinion, fn 3 <em>supra, </em>116, buttresses this policy preference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">\"The PERA drastically altered public employee labor relations in Michigan by amending the Hutchinson Act, 1947 PA 336. The Hutchinson Act had prohibited public employees from engaging in \u2022 collective bargaining. The PERA not only permitted collective bargaining by employees, see \u00a7 9, but it required public employers to negotiate with public employees\u2019 bargaining units, see \u00a710.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Indeed, in PERA, \u00a7 13, the Legislature commanded MERC \"to insure public employees the full benefit of their right * * * to collective bargaining\u201d with specific reference to fire fighting personnel. MCL 423.213; MSA 17.455(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Specific concern for arbitral resolution of fire fighter labor disputes was manifestly signaled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>when the Legislature enacted the compulsory arbitration of labor disputes in police and fire departments act, MCL 423.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.455(31) <em>et seq., </em>which has as its stated policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">\"It is the public policy of this state that in * * * fire departments, where the right of employees to strike is by law prohibited, <em>it is requisite </em>to the high morale of such employees and the. efficient operation of such departments <em>to afford an alternate, expeditious, effective and binding procedure for the resolution of disputes, and to that end the provisions of this act, providing for compulsory arbitration, shall be liberally construed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) MCL 423.231; MSA 17.455(31).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We garner from the literal language of this state\u2019s labor regulatory scheme a legislative preference for the voluntary resolution of labor disputes. We find this preference especially compelling in the case of public employees and fire fighters who are denied the right to strike and statutorily limited to other avenues of dispute resolution including collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The Legislature\u2019s preference for the voluntary resolution of disputes through the parties\u2019 collective bargaining process was specifically discerned and sanctioned by this Court in <em>Kaleva-Norman-Dickson School Dist No 6 v Kaleva-Norman-Dickson School Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>393 Mich 583, 591; 227 NW2d 500 (1975), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\">\"The <em>policy favoring arbitration of disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements, </em>as enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in the Steelworkers\u2019 Trilogy, <em>is appropriate for contracts entered into under the PERA.\u201d </em>(Footnote omitted, emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>VII. MERC\u2019s Discretionary Exercise of Pre-Arbitral Deferral Does Not Violate the Rule in <em>Rockwell v Crestwood School Dist</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Association counsel implicitly argues that even if MERC\u2019s authority under \u00a7 16 of PERA is determined to be discretionary and therefore amenable to pre-arbitral deferral, such discretionary refusal to remedy an alleged unfair labor practice violates the rule in <em>Rockwell v Crestwood School Dist, </em>393 Mich 616; 227 NW2d 736 (1975), <em>app dis </em>427 US 901; 96 S Ct 3184; 49 L Ed 2d 1195 (1976). The association cites <em>Rockwell </em>for the proposition that \"MERC may not refuse to exercise even its discretionary powers without regard to the merits of a given case\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In <em>Rockwell, </em>this Court was confronted with a claim that MERC had consistently refused to petition the circuit court for temporary relief or a restraining order pursuant to PERA, \u00a7 16(h) which provides that MERC <em>\"shall have power </em>* * * to petition any circuit court * * * for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order\u201d (emphasis supplied). We held such refusal impermissible, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">\"When the union filed with MERC the amended unfair labor practice charge against the school board on January 6, 1975, it requested the Commission to seek immediate relief in the circuit court pursuant to \u00a7 16(h). The director of the MERC responded the same day: 'It has been the consistent policy of this Commission to refrain from petitioning for temporary relief or a restraining order under the provisions of Section 16(h) of the act. Therefore, your request is denied and the charges filed in the matter will be processed in accordance with established statutory procedures.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\"><em>\"Whatever the reasons for this policy </em>\u2014 \u00f1nancial <em>or personnel limitations or other </em>\u2014 the <em>Commission may </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>not properly adopt an arbitrary policy of refusing to consider exercising, without regard to the circumstances, power conferred upon it by the PERA.\u201d Id., </em>642.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">\"We simply hold that an administrative agency empowered to exercise discretion abuses its discretion and errs as a matter of law when it absolutely refuses in every and any instance to exercise its discretion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>643, fn 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We find that MERC\u2019s exercise of discretionary authority to defer an arguably contractual dispute properly within the parties\u2019 contractual collective bargaining mechanisms does not violate the holding of <em>Rockwell. </em>Our discussion in Part VI, <em>supra, </em>indicates that MERC has adopted and elaborated on federally-approved guidelines in its deferral determinations. MERC certainly has not evidenced an \"arbitrary policy of refusing to consider exercising, <em>without regard to the circumstances, </em>power conferred upon it by the PERA\u201d present in <em>Rockwell, supra, </em>642. Nor has MERC erred as a matter of law by \"refusing] in every and any instance to exercise its discretion\u201d as found in MERC\u2019s behavior with regard to \u00a7 16(h) in <em>Rockwell, supra, </em>643, fn 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">In this instance, MERC has not only inquired into the <em>Collyer/City of Flint </em>merits of the contractual nature of the association\u2019s grievance, the bargaining history of the parties, and the city\u2019s willingness to arbitrate, but MERC has additionally retained jurisdiction to determine whether the arbitrator\u2019s ultimate award comports with the type of requirements enunciated by the NLRB in <em>Spielberg </em>and it progeny and adopted by MERC in <em>City of Flint, </em>1970 MERC Lab Op 367, 369-370. (We reiterate that we express no opinion regarding the propriety of <em>Spielberg-type </em>post-award defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ral.) In view of these guidelines and MERC\u2019s inquiry in this instance, we can find no violation of the principle established in <em>Rockwell. </em>MERC has not abdicated its \u00a7 16 discretionary authority but has merely abstained from deciding a dispute not primarily statutory in nature and arguably covered by the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, until the parties have exhausted their contractual remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">VIII. Pre-Arbitral Deferral and the Pending Unfair Labor Practice Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Having determined that pre-arbitral deferral is a permissible method for the resolution of arguably contractual grievances in this jurisdiction, we must now determine whether pre-arbitral deferral is warranted in this instance. Under the guidelines of the NLRB\u2019s <em>Collyer </em>doctrine as well as MERC\u2019s decision in the present matter, pre-arbitral deferral is appropriate when three conditions are fulfilled: (1) a stable bargaining relationship and the absence of enmity is found to exist between the parties; (2) there is found to exist an intent on the respondent\u2019s part to exhaust the parties\u2019 contractual grievance procedure culminating in final and binding arbitration; and (3) the subject matter of the alleged unfair labor practice is determined to be arguably covered by the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, centering on the interpretation or application of the contract. See <em>City of Flint, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\n<em>A. Prior Stable Bargaining Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Insofar as the first factor is concerned, the association claims that there exists sufficient anti-union animosity toward the collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>process and the parties\u2019 contractual grievance resolution procedure to render pre-arbitral deferral inappropriate. In support of this contention, the association cites three previous proceedings before MERC in which both the association and the city had been involved.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The city did not respond to this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">After considering the contentions of both parties, the ALJ concluded that \"the previous failures of the employer in its bargaining with the union do not evidence an 'anti-union history\u2019 which would sustain a finding that the city has a background of such hostility and animosity towards collective bargaining and contractual grievance settlement processes so as to justify a refusal to defer to arbitration. See <em>Machinists v NLRB, </em>525 F2d 237 (CA 2, 1975), <em>aff'g United Aircraft Corp </em>[204 NLRB 879; 83 LRRM 1411 (1973)].\u201d <em>Detroit Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 267, 284. MERC affirmed this specific ruling, noting that \"[a] litigious history between the parties does not necessarily render deferral inappropriate\u201d. <em>Detroit Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 267, 277. The association has not supplemented its arguments in this regard on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Having reviewed the record as a whole, we find that MERC\u2019s factual determination in this regard is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence as required by MCL 423.23(e); MSA 17.454(25)(e).

Arguably Contractual Nature of the Alleged Unfair Labor Practices Charge Centering on the Interpretation or Application of the Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In its charge before MERC, the association specifically alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-8\">\"On or about March 26, 1976, the above-named employer refused to bargain with the charging party by unilaterally altering working conditions, including manpower and safety, of employees represented by the charging party by ordering the discontinuance of four battalions and four tactical mobile squads, demoting at least 150 officers, and transferring affected personnel; and refusing to bargain with regard to same, to desist from same pending negotiations, and to furnish requested information with respect thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The issues of demotion and transfer are arguably covered by Articles 10.E4 and 10.K of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement (set out in fn 9, <em>supra). </em>The issues of tactical mobile squad and battalion reductions are arguably covered by Article 12.E6 of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement (set out in fn 10, <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The scope of the parties\u2019 Article 7 arbitration clause is broad enough to embrace arbitral consideration of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>arguably contractual issues.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the \"arguably contractual\u201d element of pre-arbitral deferral has been fulfilled in these particulars, we conclude, as did MERC, that these matters are appropriate for pre-arbitral deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">We do not agree, however, that MERC should have deferred the association\u2019s claim of refusal to furnish relevant information to the arbitral process. In its opinion, MERC recognized that \"[generally, where the contract is silent on the parties\u2019 duty to supply information demanded during the course of grievance proceedings, the NLRB has refused to defer * * MERC nonetheless granted deferral concluding that \"in the instant matter there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish a clear refusal on respondent\u2019s part to comply with charging party\u2019s request for data\u201d. <em>Detroit Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>1977 MERC Lab Op 267, 277-278.

In <em>American Standard, Inc, </em>203 NLRB 1132; 83 LRRM 1245 (1973), the NLRB specifically ruled that deferral is inappropriate where the parties\u2019 contract is silent on the duty to provide such information. Therefore, consistent with our opinion that pre-arbitral deferral is appropriate only where the alleged charge is arguably covered by the parties\u2019 agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ment, we reverse the MERC ruling in this respect and remand for a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 16 of PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">IX. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We hold that MERC may, when presented with allegations of unfair labor practices, defer hearing of those charges until after an arbitration award has been rendered pursuant to the parties\u2019 binding collective bargaining agreement, where the subject matter of the alleged unfair labor practices is arguably covered by the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. In particular, we rule that under the guidelines of the NLRB\u2019s <em>Collyer </em>doctrine adopted by MERC in its <em>City of Flint </em>decision, prearbitral deferral is appropriate when three conditions are fulfilled: (1) a stable bargaining relationship and the absence of enmity is found to exist between the parties; (2) there is found to exist an intent on the respondent\u2019s part to exhaust the parties\u2019 contractual grievance procedure culminating in final and binding arbitration; and (3) the subject matter of the alleged unfair labor practice is determined to be arguably covered by the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, centering on the interpretation or application of the contract. As provided by the MERC order in this matter, the parties may request post-award review of the arbitrator\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">This Court is persuaded that pre-arbitral deferral is a permissible exercise of discretionary authority pursuant to \u00a7 16 of PERA and is not violative of the rule announced in <em>Rockwell v Crest-wood School Dist. </em>We are likewise persuaded of the correctness of this holding in view of the sanction of this abstention doctrine, by the Federal sphere, to which we look for guidance, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>this state\u2019s policy preference for the voluntary resolution of grievance disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">Having upheld the general pre-arbitral deferral doctrine in this jurisdiction, we affirm MERC\u2019s deferral determination in this case, except to the extent that that determination ordered deferral of the association\u2019s charge of refusal to furnish relevant information. In this latter respect, we reverse and remand this charge to MERC for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part.

In its place, \u00a7 10(b), as well as \u00a7 10(a), was enacted to provide that \"[w]henever it is charged that any person has engaged in * * * any such unfair labor practice, the Board, * * * <em>shall have power </em>to issue and cause to be served * * * a complaint * * 29 USC 160(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">It is apparent from this juxtaposition of \u00a7 10, subds (a) and (b), as proposed and as enacted, that while the NLRB has not been expressly granted discretionary deferral authority, neither has the board been expressly mandated to hear, resolve, or enforce <em>all statutory </em>unfair labor practices. Rather, the board has merely been provided the \"power\u201d to exercise authority over \u00a7 8 claims; the door has arguably been left somewhat ajar for the entrance of the deferral doctrine.

The board stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">\" '[T]he Board has not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of the Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it may wholly ignore other and equally important Congressional objectives.

Beyond the requirements that the dispute be capable of resolution under the parties\u2019 agreement and that the respondent be willing, in good faith, to arbitrate, the NLRB additionally noted that the parties must exhibit a stable bargaining relation and the absence of anti-union animus. <em>Collyer, supra, </em>841-842.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\"> See footnotes 16-20 and accompanying text, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\"> The Second, Ninth and District of Columbia Circuits have directly upheld the <em>Collyer </em>doctrine although the Ninth Circuit has done so only in a per curiam opinion: <em>Nabisco, Inc v NLRB, </em>479 F2d 770 (CA 2, 1973); <em>Local 2188, IBEW v NLRB [Western Electric], 161 </em>US App DC 168; 494 F2d 1087 (1974); <em>Associated Press v NLRB, </em>160 US App DC 396; 492 F2d 662 (1974); <em>Provision House Workers Union, Local 274, AFL-CIO v NLRB, </em>493 F2d 1249 (CA 9, 1974), <em>cert den </em>419 US 828 (1974).

Although these cases did not overrule <em>Collyer, </em>they did overrule much of its progeny to the extent that a 29 USC 158(a)(3) claim (\"It shall be an unfair labor practice * * * (3) [to discriminate] in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment * * *\u201d) is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In <em>General American Transportation Corp, </em>fn 22 <em>supra, </em>involving the discharge of an employee allegedly because of union activities, the NLRB held that the board would no longer defer in cases of alleged employer discrimination or interference with protected rights. The majority expressly overruled <em>National Radio Co, </em>198 NLRB 527; 80 LRRM 1718 (1972), in which <em>Collyer </em>was extended to \u00a7 8(a)(3) discharges. See, generally, Casenote, fn 22 <em>supra, </em>1978 So Ill UU 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">In <em>Roy Robinson Chevrolet, </em>involving a plant shutdown in alleged violation of the employer\u2019s \u00a7 8(a)(5) bargaining obligation, the NLRB held that it would continue to defer under <em>Collyer </em>in cases involving \u00a7 8(a)(5) violations where the dispute is subject to, and resolvable by, contractual grievance arbitration procedures. This decision, \u2022 at least implicitly, indicates that the board will likely defer to the arbitral process in \u00a7 8(a)(5) situations alone. See, generally, Novack, <em>Cutting Back on Collyer: The First Step in the Right Direction, </em>28 Labor L J 785 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">In <em>Gardner-Denver, </em>the Supreme Court held that an employee who alleged racially motivated discharge was entitled to pursue a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e <em>et seq., </em>even though that claim had already been rejected in a grievance proceeding. While <em>Gardner-Denver </em>dealt with Title VII rather than either the NLRA or the board\u2019s general pre-arbitral deferral authority, that case indicates that the NLRB may not defer in those instances where a Title VII claim arises .under a non-discrimination clause of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement.
