There is no need to repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We agreed to review this case to answer two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">\"(1) Whether the letters of the director of the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, establishing new rate schedules, constitute 'rules\u2019 within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, as amended? (2) Whether, assuming <em>pro arguendo </em>that said letters do constitute 'rules\u2019 within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the Administrative Procedures Act, circuit court review of the validity of same pursuant to APA \u00a764; MCLA 24.264; MSA 3.560(164) is appropriate?\u201d 402 Mich 920-921 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Because we answer the first question in the negative, we do not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Michigan Administrative Procedures Act, MCL 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>et seq., </em>contains a comprehensive provision defining the term \"rule\u201d which expressly excludes certain material. The basic definition and the pertinent exclusion are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\" 'Rule\u2019 means an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling or instruction of general applicability, which implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or which prescribes the organization, procedure or practice of the agency, including the amendment, suspension or rescission thereof, but <em>does not </em>include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\"(h) A form with instructions, an <em>interpretive statement, </em>a guideline, an informational pamphlet or other material which in itself does not have the force and effect of law but is merely explanatory.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) MCL 24.207; MSA 3.560(107).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">By way of comparison, the Federal administrative procedures act contains the following definition of the term \"rule\u201d as it is there used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\"(4) 'rule\u2019 means the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, <em>interpret, </em>or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, ser-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>vices or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 5 USC 551(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Although not required to do so by the Federal act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Federal agencies, as a practical matter, often follow the statutorily prescribed rule-making procedures for interpretative as well as legislative rules. This practice has been the source of litigation in Federal courts going to the issue of whether, in particular cases, agency rules were \"legislative\u201d or \"interpretative\u201d. See generally, 1 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 5.03; Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies, Supplementing Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 5.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Hence, while under the Federal act a rule can be legislative or interpretative, under the Michigan act an \"interpretive statement\u201d is <em>not, </em>by definition, a rule at all.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">It would seem, then, that rules which are \"legislative\u201d under the Federal act would be analogous to \"rules\u201d under our act.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Professor Davis describes a Federal legislative rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\"><em>\"A legislative rule is the product of an exercise of legislative power by an administrative agency, pursuant to a grant of legislative power by the legislative body. </em>In the clearest case of a legislative rule, a statute has conferred power upon the agency to issue the rule and the statute provides that the rule, if within the granted power, shall have the force of law. But a legislative rule may rest upon an implied or an unclear grant of power as well as upon an express and clear grant of power. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>When a rule is legislative, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute judgment as to the content of the rule, for the legislative body has placed the power in the agency and not in the court. <em>A legislative rule is valid and is as binding upon a court as a statute if it is (a) within the granted power, (b) issued pursuant to proper procedure, and (c) reasonable. </em>The requirement of reasonableness stems both from the idea of constitutional due process and from the idea of statutory interpretation that legislative bodies are assumed to intend to avoid the delegation of power to act unreasonably.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 1 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 5.03, p 299. See, also, 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (2d ed, 1978), \u00a7 7:8, p 36.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In addition, Professor Davis offers an analysis of the difference between \"legislative\u201d and \"interpretative\u201d rules under the Federal act which is relevant to our analysis of the difference between \"rules\u201d and \"interpretive statements\u201d under our state act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\"A helpful proposition not stated in the Treatise is this: Any officer who has discretionary power necessarily also has the power to state publicly the manner in which he will exercise it, and any such public statement can be adopted through a rulemaking procedure, whether or not the legislative body has separately conferred a rulemaking power on the officer. But what such an officer says in explaining what he does is necessarily the law only to the extent that he is exercising power delegated to him by the legislative body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\"When an agency has no delegated power to make law through rulemaking, the rules it issues are necessarily interpretative. When it has the delegated power, its rules may be either legislative or interpretative, depending on which kind of rules the agency intends to make. An agency with power to make both kinds of rules necessarily has authority to determine which kind it is making, and the best evidence of its intent is what it says when it issues the rules. If it says it is not following notice and comment procedure because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>intends the rules to be interpretative, then the rules are clearly interpretative no matter what their impact. If the agency says it is using notice and comment procedure because it intends the rules to be legislative, then that makes them so; if they are valid, the courts are bound by them as if they were statutes. The crucial question is whether the agency intends to exercise delegated power to make rules having force of law, and the intent usually can best be found in what the agency says at the time of issuing the rules.\u201d Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies, Supplementing Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 5.03, pp 147-148.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">These authorities suggest that what is essential to a valid Federal \"legislative rule\u201d or Michigan \"rule\u201d is: a reasonable exercise of legislatively delegated power, pursuant to proper procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In the present case, it is acknowledged that the director never took the procedural steps<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> necessary to the formulation of a rule under our act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>over, as Justice Levin recognizes, the letters in this case were \"the director\u2019s announcement of his interpretation of <em>Jolliff\u201d. </em>Consequently, the letters were \"interpretive statements\u201d within the above discussed exclusion to the definition of \"rule\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-5\">Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b315-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_6\">In <em>Jolliff v American Advertising Distributors, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals held that the minimum, as well as the maximum, workers\u2019 compensation benefit payable to an injured worker was subject to adjustment to reflect the increase in the average weekly wage in covered employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Shortly after <em>Jolliff </em>was decided, the Director of the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Compensation sent letters to workers\u2019 compensation insurance companies and self-insured employers which included new compensation rate schedules reflecting adjustments in death benefits as well as disability benefits and which applied <em>Jolliff </em>retroactively to the date of the amendment to the act which provided for adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The question presented is whether those letters set forth rules within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that they did. We agree with the majority that they did not, and that the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act was amended (effective September 1, 1965), to provide that \"[t]he maximum weekly rate in each dependency classification shall be adjusted once each year in accordance with the increase or decrease in the average weekly wage in covered employment, as determined by the Michigan employment security commission\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Court of Appeals held in <em>Jolliff </em>that by reason of other language in the statute the minimum as well as the maximum benefit rates were \"adjustable according to\u201d that provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court denied leave to appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The director advised all insurance companies and self-insured employers, in April, 1974, that <em>Jolliff </em>had held that minimum compensation rates are adjustable, that leave to appeal had been denied, and that \"the attached table indicates the new minimum rates, effective as indicated\u201d, and stated \"[y]ou should make immediate arrangements to correct any file that may be effected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>[sic].\u201d </em>A second letter, in July, 1974, called attention to the April letter, stated that an attempt had been made by \"a number of self-insured employers and insurance companies to again ask\u201d this Court to hear <em>Jolliff, </em>that in June, 1974 this Court declined to do so, that \"[therefore, there is no question at this time but that the order of the Court of Appeals is final and the new minimum compensation rates as attached are now payable\u201d and requested that insurers \"[p]lease take immediate steps to be governed accordingly\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The rate schedule attached to the letters stated minimum and maximum \"weekly compensation rates\u201d and \"weekly death compensation rates\u201d for the period September 1, 1965 to December 31, 1968, the years 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973, and from January 1, 1974 on.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Jolliff had been injured in 1970. The questions whether <em>Jolliff </em>was to be retroactive to the amendment of the act or applied in death cases had not been presented or decided. The director\u2019s letters therefore extended <em>Jolliff </em>beyond what it decided.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Plaintiffs, Michigan Farm Bureau, Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company of Michigan, and Underwriters Adjusting Company, sought a declaratory ruling, in October, 1974, pursuant to the APA that, among other things, <em>Jolliff </em>does not apply retroactively \"to injuries occurring prior to the date on which the <em>Jolliff </em>decision became or will become final\u201d, and \"that the cost-of-living adjustments [required by the act] should not be applied to death benefits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The director responded in December, 1974 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>steps were being taken to promulgate a rule pursuant to the APA, that \"[b]ecause of the decision to proceed through rule making, it is our belief that we should not issue a declaratory ruling which would only be binding on one specific case\u201d, and stated that it is \"our belief that a declaratory ruling is not appropriate\u201d \"for the reason that the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation is exempted from\u201d the contested case and judicial review chapters of the APA:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \"Jurisdiction to determine the application of <em>Jolliff </em>to these cases is a controversy concerning which <em>[sic] </em>shall be determined by the Bureau pursuant to section 841 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No formal rule was ever promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">A few days later the director advised insurers and self-insured employers of a new weekly compensation and death compensation rate schedule reflecting changes required by <em>Alexander v Director, Bureau of Workmen\u2019s </em>Compensation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for the period commencing September 1, 1965, each year 1969 through 1974 and, additionally, the rates for the period commencing January 1, 1975. It stated that the maximum and minimum rates were based on <em>Jolliff </em>\"which holds that the minimum as well as maximum rates are adjustable\u201d according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the provisions of the act \"as advised by the Attorney General\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Plaintiffs commenced an action against the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation and its director in circuit court, pursuant to the APA, seeking a declaratory judgment that, among other things, the letters and attached schedule addressed to insurers and self-insured employers were rules within the meaning of the APA, that they were not adopted in accordance with its requirements and that the holding in <em>Jolliff </em>may not be applied retroactively or extended to death benefits. The circuit judge entered an accelerated judgment on the grounds that i) the court was without jurisdiction under \u00a7 64 of the APA<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (concerning declaratory judgments regarding the validity or applicability of a rule), because the APA provides that \"[a] rule or order establishing or fixing rates or tariffs\u201d is not a rule within the meaning of the act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the letters were orders establishing rates; ii) by reason of \u00a7 841 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, jurisdiction in compensation cases is in the bureau, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board and the appellate courts, and a circuit court is without jurisdiction to decide compensation rates in specific cases, and iii) no rules had been promulgated which would give rise to review under \u00a7 64 of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The Court of Appeals, responding to the director\u2019s argument that even if the letters were rules the circuit court was without jurisdiction, held that \u00a7 841 does not vest exclusive jurisdiction in the bureau to determine the validity of rules promulgated by the director \"making a challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>under the APA unavailable\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It further held that \"the 'rates and tariffs\u2019 exception was intended to exempt only the rate fixing operations of the Public Service Commission\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It concluded that the letters set forth rules and that the circuit court had jurisdiction to determine their validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We join in reversing the Court of Appeals because the letters did not reflect an exercise of discretion by the director regarding the meaning of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. The letters did not set forth rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that a rule promulgated by the director is subject to the provisions of chapter 3 of the APA concerning notice and comment, declaratory rulings and judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act provides that the director \"may make rules not inconsistent with this act for carrying out the provisions of the act in accordance with\u201d the APA.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The APA provides that only chapters 4 (procedure in contested cases) and 6 (judicial review) of that act \"shall not apply to the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation or the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Section 841 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (see fn 9), providing that all questions concerning compensation and questions arising under <em>that act </em>shall be determined \"by the bureau\u201d, does not provide a procedure (within the meaning of \u00a7 64 of the APA<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>) for challenging or determining the validity or applicability of a rule promulgated by the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We conclude that \u00a7 841 does not relieve the bureau of complying with chapter 3 of the APA when issuing policy declarations and statements within the APA\u2019s definition of a rule, and that the review provisions of that chapter also apply to a rule promulgated by the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The APA states that a rule is \"an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling or instruction of general applicability, which implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency\u201d. Excluded are \"[a] rule or order establishing or fixing rates or tariffs,\u201d \"an interpretive statement, a guideline, an informational pamphlet or other material which in itself does not have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>force and effect of law but is merely explanatory\u201d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We need not consider whether the letters are, as the director asserts, within the \"interpretive statement\u201d exception to the general definition of a rule,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> since we hold that implicit in the definition of \"rule\u201d is the concept of agency exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Jolliff </em>had determined that certain increases in benefits were payable. It was the director\u2019s apparent understanding of <em>Jolliff, </em>possibly on the advice of the Attorney General, that it applied in death cases and retroactively. By the letters the director made the following statements: i) the rates were required by the act as construed by the Court; ii) carriers and employers should make payment in accordance with the schedules; and, iii) implicitly, that he would seek to enforce that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>When an appellate court construes a statute and the agency is bound by that construction, it is the court, not the agency, which has exercised choice and discretion although the agency seeks to enforce that construction. The agency has hot expressed a policy of general applicability in the exercise of discretion in the application or implementation of law enforced or administered by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The asserted rule in the instant case is the director\u2019s apparent understanding, expressed by the letters and schedules, that <em>Jolliff </em>required an increase in the minimum death benefits and was retroactive. There can be but one correct interpretation of <em>Jolliff. </em>The letters sought to inform insurers and employers of what the director thought the decision required. He did not purport to be conveying his own construction of the act but, rather, to be implementing the Court\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The letters did not purport to announce an <em>agency </em>implementation or application of the act. The director merely announced what he understood to be the <em>judicial </em>construction of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">To be sure, the letters extended the <em>Jolliff </em>holding to facts not there presented. This was done, however, in the apparent belief that <em>Jolliff </em>required that extension and was not done in the exercise of the policy-making authority of the agency. Because the letters were not a product of agency exercise of discretion and policy-making authority, they did not set forth rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">It is one thing for an agency to invoke one or more judicial decisions in <em>its own </em>construction of a statute and quite another for it merely to state its understanding of <em>the court\u2019s </em>construction of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">There is no reason to suppose that the director\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>letters, following closely upon the <em>Jolliff </em>decision, represented an attempt to promulgate an agency policy to expand that decision in the guise of a statement of the director\u2019s understanding of it. The director\u2019s approach may have been simplistic but there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of his expressed view that the Court\u2019s decision mandated his action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">If there was reason to believe that the director\u2019s action was other than it purported to be and in actuality represented a conscious choice (an exercise of discretion) by the agency to extend the decision, a different question would be presented, as then it would be necessary to decide whether the letters were something other than they appeared to be. Similarly, the judicial role might be different if the letters had a substantial and immediate impact on insurance companies.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The insurers and employers in this case were not, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tially and immediately affected by the director\u2019s statements. If they chose not to comply, their businesses would not be embarrassed or impeded but could continue as before while a determination was made whether they need comply. No immediate change in internal operating procedures was required, no relationship with any customer was affected, no advantage was bestowed on one insurer or employer as compared to another that could only be overcome, if at all, by recourse to the courts or other strenuous measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">An injured worker or dependent might commence proceedings seeking compliance with the <em>Jolliff </em>decision as interpreted by the director. The director on his own might initiate such proceedings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A hearing referee and the WCAB would, following adversary presentation, determine whether the director\u2019s interpretation was correct. The WCAB decision would be appealable to the Court of Appeals and this Court. The only consequence of a failure to comply with the rate schedules attached to the director\u2019s letters would be that the insurer or employer might be subjected to such adversary proceedings. The act provides no sanctions or penalties for non-compliance with the director\u2019s rate schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Even if the director had never publicly announced a view concerning minimum compensation rates required to comply with <em>Jolliff, </em>he would still have possessed authority to institute compliance proceedings if he believed that the requirements of the act, as construed in <em>Jolliff, </em>had not been observed. The director\u2019s announcement of his interpretation of <em>Jolliff </em>in no way expanded his authority to institute compliance proceedings. His announcement, indeed, may have limited his abil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ity to institute compliance proceedings because he is arguably limited by his own declarations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The majority reaches the same result as we on the ground that the letters were \"interpretive statements\u201d. We have indicated (see Part III A, <em>supra) </em>that there is no need to consider whether the letters are within that exception to the general definition of a rule. Also, this exception appears to have been advanced by the director for the first time on appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In reaching its conclusion, the majority cites authorities which it states \"suggest\u201d that in Michigan a \"rule\u201d is \"a reasonable exercise of <em>legislatively delegated </em>power, <em>pursuant to proper proce</em>dure(Emphasis supplied.) The majority opinion points out that \"the director never took the <em>procedural steps </em>necessary to the formulation of a rule under our act\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) The implication is that what might otherwise be a rule within the definition of the APA is not a rule if the agency exceeds its legislatively delegated power or fails to comply with the notice and comment provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The Legislature did not intend that the policy, scope and requirements of the act be so easily circumvented. Agency pronouncements within the definition of a rule may have the practical force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and effect of a rule although the agency has not observed the notice and comment requirements of the APA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b327-4\">Williams, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\"> 5 USC 553(b)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-11\"> The Michigan Administrative Procedures Act has been amended to define another kind of agency action, a \"guideline\u201d. 1977 PA 108; MCL 24.203(6); MSA 3.560(103)(6).

See generally Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies, Supplementing Administrative Law Treatise (1977 Supp), \u00a7 5.03-5; 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (2d ed, 1978), \u00a7 7:21.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">In comparison, our state act offers more guidance in this area. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>act\u2019s definition of \"rule\u201d <em>includes </em>\"an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy * * * which prescribes the organization, procedure or practice of the agency\u201d. MCL 24.207; MSA 3.560(107). Expressly <em>excluded </em>from the definition of \"rule\u201d is an agency\u2019s \"memorandum, directive or communication which <em>does not affect </em>the rights of, or procedures and practices available to, the public\u201d. MCL 24.207(g); MSA 3.560(107)(g) (emphasis added). The Michigan act mandates the promulgation of <em>rules </em>by an agency \"prescribing its procedures available to the public and the methods by which the public may obtain information and submit requests\u201d. MCL 24.233(2); MSA 3.560(133)(2). It appears then that our act may actually require state agencies to promulgate, as <em>rules, </em>their regulations, statements, standards, policies, etc., which affect the rights of, or procedures available to, the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> <em>Jolliff v American Advertising Distributors, Inc, </em>49 Mich App 1; 211 NW2d 260 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\"> MCL 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-9\"> 1965 PA 44, amending 1948 CL 412.9; MSA 17.159, now MCL 418.355; MSA 17.237(355).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\"> <em>Jolliff, supra, </em>p 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\"> <em>Jolliff v American Advertising Distributors, Inc, </em>391 Mich 780 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> Unpublished order, June 27, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> The question of the correctness of the director\u2019s interpretation of <em>Jolliff </em>is not before us, and we intimate no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">On November 20, 1979 this Court granted leave to appeal in <em>Gusler v Fairview Tubular Products </em>(Docket No. 63538) to consider the issue decided in <em>Jolliff. </em>407 Mich 926 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b318-5\"> The letter identified chapters 4 and 6 of the APA.
