We have reviewed the briefs and joint appendix and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Leagon v. Eaton Corp., </em>No. CA-02-898-20 (D.S.C. filed July 18, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>entered July 21, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">In addition, we note that Leagon relies on statements in his affidavit attacking the Labor Market Survey submitted by Eaton. However, the affidavit was not presented to Eaton, and we can only consider evidence that was before the Plan Administrator when the claim was denied. <em>See Elliott v. Sara Lee Corp., </em>190 F.3d 601, 608-09 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Krizek v. Cigna Group Ins., </em>345 F.3d 91, 97 (2d Cir.2003) (new evidence may be considered in district court only where \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown). Further, Leagon contends that Dr. DuPuy\u2019s report was given too much weight, considering it relied on a functional assessment which was never completed. However, the record reflects that DuPuy properly relied on another physician\u2019s estimated assessment, as well as a physical exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
