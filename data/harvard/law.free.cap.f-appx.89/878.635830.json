Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Appellant Ruben Luna (\u201cLuna\u201d) was employed with the United States Air Force from 1980 until 1992 as an Air Conditioning Equipment Mechanic on the Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. His employment was terminated on October 23, 1992 after he took an excessive amount of unscheduled leave. While on leave, Luna was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. He appealed his discharge to the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Luna subsequently entered into a negotiated settlement agreement with the Air Force.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement provided that Luna would withdraw his appeal to the MSPB, and, in exchange, the Ah* Force would classify his termination as related to disability rather than excessive absenteeism. The Air Force also agreed to help Luna obtain disability retirement benefits through the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">The OPM granted Luna\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits on December 15, 1992. On January 28, 1999, the OPM terminated Luna\u2019s benefits after he failed to produce evidence that his mental disorder was still disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">On May 5, 1999, Luna filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) complaint against James D. Roche (\u201cRoche\u201d), Secretary of the Air Force. The complaint alleged that the Air Force breached the 1992 settlement agreement by unlawfully terminating his disability benefits. An EEO counselor advised Luna, by letter dated June 23, 1999, that the EEO lacked jurisdiction over his complaint. As a result, Luna petitioned the MSPB to enforce the 1992 settlement agreement. An MSPB administrative judge dismissed Luna\u2019s petition as untimely, and the MSPB denied Luna\u2019s request for review. Luna then filed a second EEO complaint against Roche on August 10, 1999, alleging that the Air Force had failed to accommodate his mental disability back in 1992. This second complaint was dismissed as untimely on November 15,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">Luna then sued Roche in federal district court on the grounds that the Air Force had engaged in discriminatory employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ment practices, and had fraudulently induced him to enter a settlement agreement. Roche moved to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The district court dismissed the complaint upon the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. Luna timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <em>de novo. Bauer v. Texas, </em>341 F.3d 352, 357 (5th Cir.2003). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we accept all factual allegations made by the plaintiff as true and resolve any doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence in his favor. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Sales, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 1045, 1050 (5th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Luna contends that the Air Force discriminated against him by terminating his employment in 1992, and by terminating his disability benefits in 1999. Luna\u2019s discrimination claims are brought pursuant to: (1) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e; (2) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621; (3) the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101; (4) the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d); (5) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\u201cRehabilitation Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); and (6) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983. Luna further asserts that the Air Force fraudulently induced him to enter into the 1992 settlement agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">A. Discrimination Claims Involving Luna\u2019s Terminated Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Luna first argues that the Air Force discriminated against him when it terminated his employment in 1992. As a prerequisite to filing an employment discrimination suit in district court, a plaintiff is required to timely exhaust his administrative remedies with the federal agency that he believes has discriminated against him. <em>See Fitzgerald v. Sec., U.S. Dept. Veterans Affairs, </em>121 F.3d 203, 206 (5th Cir.1997). Title 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.05(a) requires that a federal employee who believes he has been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap contact an EEO counsel- or within 45 days of the discriminatory act or the effective date of the personnel action. If the employee fails to do so, his claim is barred. <em>See Teemac v. Henderson, </em>298 F.3d 452, 454 (5th Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 must be filed within two years of the alleged unlawful event. <em>See Meadowbriar Home for Children, Inc. v. G.B. Gunn, </em>81 F.3d 521, 533 n. 10 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Luna\u2019s employment was terminated in 1992. Because he did not complain to an EEO counselor, or pursue a claim under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 or 1983, until 1999, his discrimination claims involving his terminated employment are untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">B. Discrimination Claims Involving Luna\u2019s Terminated Disability Retirement Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">Luna next argues that the Air Force discriminated against him when it termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>nated his disability retirement benefits in 1999. The employment discrimination claims raised by Luna require the existence of an employer-employee relationship. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16 (Title VII); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a) (ADEA); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (Rehabilitation Act); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (Equal Pay Act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Luna was neither an employee of the Air Force, nor an applicant for employment with the Air Force, when his disability retirement benefits were terminated in 1999. Luna lacked standing to pursue his discrimination claims involving his terminated benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">C. Fraudulent Inducement Claim Involving the 1992 Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"AAj\">Luna next argues that the Air Force fraudulently induced him into signing a settlement agreement in 1992 in order to avoid its responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). The Rehabilitation Act prohibits federal employers from terminating disabled persons who are \u201cotherwise qualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A person is \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d if he can perform the essential functions of his job with no more than a reasonable accommodation. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">It is highly doubtful that Luna could have continued to perform his functions as a mechanic with a mere \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d by the Air Force. For instance, during Luna\u2019s period of leave, he was diagnosed by his physician as \u201ctotally and permanently disabled.\u201d Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Ah' Force was motivated to negotiate with Luna due to its potential liability under the Rehabilitation Act, Luna nonetheless fails to present any evidence that the Air Force made a single fraudulent representation during the negotiations. Luna\u2019s claim that the Air Force fraudulently induced him to enter a settlement agreement is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">TV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-17\">, It is unclear whether Luna was represented by counsel. He characterizes his representative, David Howard, as a \"chartered peacemaker.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-8\">. Luna also seems to claim that a district court erred by denying his motion to appoint counsel during a proceeding in 1994. Luna's appeal of that decision is untimely. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (requiring that notices of appeal be filed within 60 days after a district court's final judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b910-15\">. The ADEA, however, permits an employee to bypass this administrative requirement if he provides notice to an EEO counselor of his intent to sue within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory incident. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b911-8\">. The ADA does not apply to the federal government. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(5)(B). Moreover, Luna failed to contest the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that he lacks standing to pursue his \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 claims involving his terminated benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
