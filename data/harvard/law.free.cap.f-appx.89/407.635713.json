He was sentenced to thirty-six months of imprisonment. On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether the district court erred because it sentenced him outside the guideline range as calculated under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-24\">As counsel concedes, this claim fails because sentencing ranges as set out in USSG \u00a7 7B1.4 are advisory and not binding. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 640-41 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-25\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
