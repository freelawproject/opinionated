We hold that the BIA\u2019s determination that Leonov had not demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, that he is ineligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Because Leonov has failed to satisfy the requirements for asylum, he has also failed to satisfy the requirements for withholding of deportation under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 667 (5th Cir.2002). Leonov has failed to brief the issue whether he is eligible for withholding under the Convention Against Torture, and it is therefore waived. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-19\">Insofar as Leonov contends that the Lautenberg Amendment should be afforded evidentiary weight regarding the persecution of Jews in Russia, we find that the BIA did acknowledge that legislation when evaluating the evidence in his case. Finally, Leonov argues that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13 should be construed to afford him the same procedural benefits afforded Russian Jews under the Lautenberg Amendment to avoid an equal protection problem. However, even if that lowered standard were applied to his case, he has not shown \u201ca credible basis for concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>about the possibility of [] persecution.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157 note.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
