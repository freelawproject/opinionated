Rogers was convicted by a jury of filing a false claim in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 (2000) and sentenced to a sixty-month term of probation. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s motion to revoke his probation. On appeal, Rogers\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding there are no meritorious issues for appeal but asserting the district court\u2019s decision to continue Rogers\u2019s supervised probation was unreasonable because the court failed to consider alternative placements that would accommodate Rogers\u2019s mental instability. Though notified of his opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, Rogers has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">After examination of the record, which documents the court\u2019s extensive dealings with Rogers\u2019s repeated violations of the terms and conditions of his probation, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to continue Rogers\u2019s supervised probation or in denying the motion to revoke his probation. We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
