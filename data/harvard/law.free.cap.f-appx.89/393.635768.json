Defendants moved for summary judgment. The magistrate judge recommended granting Defendants\u2019 motion with regard to the sex discrimination and retaliation claims and recommended dismissing without prejudice Stroman\u2019s state law claim. Both parties filed objections to the recommendations. The district court adopted the recommendations of the magistrate judge, granting summary judgment to the Defendants on Stroman\u2019s sex discrimination and retaliation claims and dismissing without prejudice Stroman\u2019s state law claim. Final judgment was entered January 16, 2003. Stroman filed his notice of appeal October 9, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-23\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 conditions federal appellate jurisdiction on the filing of a timely notice of appeal. Rule 4(a)(1)(A) states that a defendant in a civil case must file an appeal within thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s order. This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 267, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>4(a)(5) allows a party to move for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal where the party so moves no later than thirty days after the time prescribed by Rule 4(a) expires and where the party shows excusable neglect or good cause. Moreover, Rule 4(a)(6) allows the district court to reopen the time to file an appeal under certain circumstances upon a party\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Stroman filed his notice of appeal almost seven months late.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Additionally, he did not move the district court to reopen the time for appeal. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-16\"> Although Stroman filed a motion for new trial, the motion was untimely and thus did not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). In addition, the motion was promptly denied by the district court, approximately seven months prior to the filing of Stroman\u2019s notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
