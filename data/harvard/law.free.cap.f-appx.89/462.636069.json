Patterson contends that the Government failed to prove that he knew that the microprocessors were stolen. Contrary to Patterson\u2019s assertion, the evidence does not give \u201cequal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Jaramillo, </em>42 F.3d 920, 923 (5th Cir.1995). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to enable a reasonable juror to find that the Government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Patterson participated in the conspiracy to sell stolen microprocessors and had possessed those microprocessors knowing that the microprocessors were stolen. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (en banc), <em>ajfd on other grounds, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983); <em>see also Jackson v.
