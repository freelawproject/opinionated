Because our review of the record discloses that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, we reverse the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-21\">Theodore Latusek, Jr., worked in the coal mines of West Virginia for approximately twenty-four years, all of them with Consolidation Coal. During his tenure, Latusek worked as a general laborer, shuttle car operator, loading machine operator, miner operator, mechanic, section boss, and long wall operations coordinator. He was exposed to dust throughout his career, particularly while he served as a long wall operations coordinator.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-22\">The history of Latusek\u2019s diagnosis and treatment is summarized in our earlier opinion in this case. <em>See Consolidation Coal Co. v. Latusek, </em>187 F.3d 628, 1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>WL 592051 (4th Cir.1999) (unpublished) <em>(Latusek </em>I). Latusek has at least a mild case of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties agree that Latusek has a totally disabling pulmonary condition. As the ALJ found, \u201c[a]ll of the experts agree that claimant\u2019s total disability is due to IPF; however, the experts provide conflicting testimony as to the cause of the disability. Drs. Jennings and Rose concluded that IPF is related to exposure to coal mine dust, while Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino concluded that IPF is not related to coal dust exposure.\u201d (J.A. at 540.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In his first decision, the ALJ concluded that \u201cclaimant\u2019s IPF arose out of his coal mine employment and ... he is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.\u201d (J.A. at 507.) The BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. On Consolidation Coal\u2019s petition for review, we vacated the award of benefits and remanded for further consideration because \u201cthe ALJ did not fulfill his duty to fully consider the entire record and provide adequate reasons for discounting significant expert medical testimony.\u201d <em>Latusek I, </em>1999 WL 592051 at *5. We were particularly concerned with the ALJ\u2019s crediting of the testimony of Drs. Jennings and Rose based primarily on three medical articles discussing IPF, which offered \u201c[a]t best ... tepid support\u201d for their conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at *4. Moreover, we found it \u201cmost troubling\u201d that the ALJ\u2019s \u201csole reason ... for discrediting the opinions of Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino was that \u2018they were unable to cite any medical articles finding that there was no causal connection between IPF and coal dust exposure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In his second decision, the ALJ again awarded benefits. The ALJ found that the opinions of Drs. Fino, Morgan, Kleinerman, and Renn were irrational because they \u201cagree that they do not know the etiology of claimant\u2019s IPF, although they all opine it cannot be coal dust exposure.\u201d (J.A. at 531.) The ALJ also found that Drs. Rose and Jennings had \u201cmore expertise in regard to IPF,\u201d and that their opinions were well-reasoned. (J.A. at 531.) Accordingly, he gave their opinions \u201cthe most weight.\u201d (J.A. at 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The BRB concluded that \u201c[t]he administrative law judge\u2019s weighing of the ... medical opinions of record ... cannot be affirmed.\u201d (J.A. at 536.) Among other flaws, the BRB concluded that the ALJ did not address Consolidation Coal\u2019s argument that the opinions of Drs. Jennings and Rose were not reliable because they were based on flawed epidemiological studies contained in the three medical articles. (J.A. at 537.) Accordingly, the BRB vacated the ALJ\u2019s findings and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">In his third decision, the ALJ once again awarded benefits. With regard to the credentials of the doctors, the ALJ found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACS1\">While the credentials of Dr. Kleinerman, an expert on the pathology of occupational lung diseases, and Drs. Renn, Morgan, and Fino, pulmonary specialists with expertise on occupational lung diseases, are undoubtly [sic] impressive, Drs. Jennings and Rose\u2019s credentials are superior to these physicians in the area of interstitial lung disease.... Therefore, I find Dr. Jennings and Rose[\u2019s] credentials regarding IPF superior to the credentials of Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino, and accord their opinion great weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>(J.A. at 540-41.) The ALJ again found the opinions of Drs. Kleinerman, Fino, Renn, and Morgan to be \u201cirrational\u201d because \u201cthese physicians are able to draw a conclusion as to what is not the cause of claimant\u2019s IPF when they cannot even give an opinion as to the cause of this disease.\u201d (J.A. at 541.) Therefore, the ALJ accorded these opinions \u201clittle weight.\u201d (J.A. at 541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The ALJ also found that \u201cthe opinions of Drs. Jennings and Rose [were] well documented and better supported by the underlying data of record and therefore accorded] these opinions great weight.\u201d (J.A. at 541.) With regard to the allegedly flawed epidemiological studies underlying the three medical articles that Drs. Jennings and Rose relied on, the ALJ found that \u201c[e]ven if these studies are flawed, I find the opinions of Drs. Jennings and Rose to be reliable. I credit their opinions without regard to these articles because the physicians did not rely on these articles in their opinion that claimant\u2019s IPF is related to his coal mine employment, but merely used them as support for their opinion.\u201d (J.A. at 542.) Over a strong dissent, the BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits. Consolidation Coal petitions for review of the BRB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We review decisions of the BRB to determine whether the BRB properly found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. <em>See Doss v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>53 F.3d 654, 658-59 (4th Cir.1995). In making this determination, we conduct an independent review of the record in deciding whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Dehue Coal Co. v. Ballard, </em>65 F.3d 1189, 1193 (4th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but only such evidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>See Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">In order to establish a right to benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945, \u201ca <em>claimant must prove </em>that (1) he has pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment; (3) he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition; and (4) pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability.\u201d Mi<em>lburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1998) (emphasis added) (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.201-.204 (1997)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the ALJ found, \u201c[a]ll of the experts agree that the claimant\u2019s total disability is due to IPF,\u201d (J.A. at 540), the only remaining question is whether Latusek\u2019s IPF meets the definition of legal pneumoconiosis, which is \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201 (2003). If it does, then pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Drs. Jennings and Rose concluded that Latusek\u2019s IPF is related to exposure to coal mine dust, while Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino concluded that Latusek\u2019s IPF is not related to coal dust exposure. The ALJ credited the opinions of Drs. Jennings and Rose over the opinions of Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino. Our review of the record convinces us that the ALJ erred in his evaluation of the medical opinion evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>First, it was error to discredit the opinions of Drs. Fino, Renn, Morgan, and Kleinerman as irrational solely because they were \u201cable to draw a conclusion as to what is not the cause of claimant\u2019s IPF when they cannot even give an opinion as to the cause of this disease.\u201d (J.A. at 541.) It is clearly not irrational for a physician to eliminate certain causes while not being able to ascertain the definitive cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Second, we have previously held in this case that Dr. Jennings\u2019s credentials, and by analogy Dr. Rose\u2019s, are \u201cnot indisputably superior to those of the other physicians of record.\u201d <em>Latusek I, </em>1999 WL 592051 at *4 n. 4. Drs. Jennings and Rose have experience with IPF, but the relevant question here is whether Latusek\u2019s IPF is a \u201cchronic dust disease of the lung ... arising out of coal mine employment,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201. Thus, the extensive experience of Drs. Renn, Fino, Morgan, and Kleinerman with patients having coal mine experience and coal dust exposure must be factored in along with their experience with IPF.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our dissenting colleague notes that Drs. Jennings and Rose have some experience with patients having coal dust exposure. <em>Post, </em>at 379-80. The ALJ, however, credited Drs. Jennings and Rose\u2019s opinions because he found their <em>\u201ccredentials regarding IPF </em>superior to the credentials of Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino.\u201d (J.A. at 540-41.) We must review the findings that the ALJ actually made. It was error to discredit the opinions of Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino as having inferior eredentials in the area of IPF without considering the vast experience that these doctors have researching, diagnosing and treating diseases that meet the relevant regulatory standard, that is \u201cchronic dust disease[s] of the lung ... arising out of coal mine employment,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Third, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Drs. Jennings and Rose did not rely on the flawed articles in coming to their conclusions is not supported by substantial evidence. Although the doctors noted a few factors that made Latusek\u2019s IPF atypical, the deposition testimony of both doctors shows that they relied on the epidemiological research in the three medical articles in coming to their conclusions that there was a relationship between Latusek\u2019s coal dust exposure and his IPF. <em>{See </em>J.A. at 303-08 (deposition of Dr. Jennings) (\u201cThere is epidemiologic research, which suggests that individuals with exposure to silicates and other dusts have a much higher frequency of developing interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.... \u201d); J.A. at 244-45 (deposition of Dr. Rose) (\u201c[Tjhere is data emerging to suggest that there may be a relationship between exposure to occupational dust with the subsequent development of pneumoconiosis, and with histologic findings of diffuse interstitial fibrosis.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard is tolerant of a wide range of findings on a given record, but the ALJ\u2019s decision here exceeds the limits of that tolerance. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>find that \u201cno \u2018reasonable mind\u2019 could have interpreted and credited the [medical opinions] as the ALJ did.\u201d <em>See Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 764 (4th Cir.1999). Because there remains no evidence upon which to base a finding of entitlement to benefits, Latusek has not carried his burden to prove that his total disability is due to pneumoconiosis. Accordingly, we reverse the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\">. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is also known as usual interstitial fibrosis (UIP). For ease of reference, we will refer to the condition as IPF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"><em>. </em>We note that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718 (1998) applies to all claims filed after April 1, 1980, and thus applies to this case. <em>See Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\">. For example, as we noted in <em>Latusek I, </em>\"Dr. Jerome Kleinerman has served as the Director of the Department of Pathology at the Metro Campus of Case Western Reserve University, has chaired the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health committee responsible for developing the guidelines for diagnosing coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, and has authored over 160 articles appearing in peer review journals, the vast majority of which dealt with lung disease, pneumoconiosis, or emphysema. Dr. Kleinerman is board certified in clinical pathology and pathologic anatomy. In addition, Dr. Kleinerman undertook graduate studies in human pulmonary function at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Medicine following his graduation from medical school.\u201d <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Latusek, </em>187 F.3d 628, 1999 WL 592051 (4th Cir.1999) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b408-5\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A_X\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"Aja\">Consolidation Coal Company (\u201cConsol\u201d) disputes the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) conclusion that Theodore Latusek is entitled to benefits under Title VI of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (\u201cBlack Lung Benefits Act\u201d or \u201cBLBA\u201d); 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-45 (West 1986 &amp; Supp.2003). On July 5, 1994, Latusek, who had never been a smoker, filed a disability claim, after retiring from twenty-four years of coal mine employment. The parties do not dispute that Latusek suffers from a totally disabling pulmonary condition; however, Consol\u2019s experts claim that the etiology of Latusek\u2019s impairment is unknown, while Latusek\u2019s physicians maintain that his condition was caused by occupational coal dust exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In three separate opinions, the ALJ has consistently concluded that Latusek demonstrated that he was entitled to black lung benefits. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion was affirmed on two separate occasions by the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consol, Latusek\u2019s former employer, appeals the BRB\u2019s most recent order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision to award black lung benefits. After reviewing the entire record, I find there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision. Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The majority asserts that it reviewed the ALJ\u2019s order under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, which is far more deferential than de novo review. Under the substantial evidence standard, reviewing courts are prohibited from substituting their judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>See Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201cUltimately, it is the duty of the administrative law judge reviewing a case, and not the responsibility of the court, to make findings of fact and to resolve conflicts in evidence.\u201d). The majority ignores this well established principle of appellate review by concluding that it was irrational for the ALJ to rely on the opinions of Drs. Jennings and Rose more than those of Drs. Renn, Morgan, Fino, and Kleinerman. Because the ALJ is in a better position to make credibility determinations, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s decision to substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ. If substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s credibility decisions, which I submit it does, then the ALJ\u2019s decision must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">The majority asserts that it was error for the ALJ to discredit the expert opinions of Drs. Renn, Morgan, Fino, and Kleinerman \u201csolely because they were \u2018able to draw a conclusion as to what is not the cause of claimant\u2019s IPF when they cannot even give an opinion as to the cause of this disease.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 376. This asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>tion is not entirely accurate. A review of the record reveals that the ALJ did not discredit the opinions of Drs. Renn, Morgan, Fino, and Kleinerman <em>solely </em>because they could not determine the etiology of Latusek\u2019s disability, even though they were certain it was not attributable to coal dust exposure. Rather, in the ALJ\u2019s third decision and order, he finds \u201cDr. Jennings [sic] and Roses\u2019s credentials regarding IPF [to be] superior to the credentials of Drs. Kleinerman, Renn, Morgan, and Fino, and accord their opinion great weight.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (J.A. 541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The law instructs that, particularly in black lung cases, the ALJ \u201cis not bound to accept the opinion or theory of any medical expert.\u201d <em>Underwood v. Elkay Mining, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 946, 949 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, it is the ALJ\u2019s responsibility to \u201cevaluate the evidence, weigh it, and draw his own conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ reviewed and weighed the evidence in this case not once, but three times, and on each occasion, the ALJ concluded that Latusek was entitled to black lung benefits. In reviewing the ALJ\u2019s conclusions, \u201c[w]e must sustain the ALJ\u2019s decision, even if we disagree with it, provided the determination is supported by substantial evidence .... \u201d <em>Smith v. Chater, </em>99 F.3d 635, 637-38 (4th Cir.1996). A review of the physicians\u2019 respective qualifications reveals that the ALJ\u2019s decision to accord greater weight to the opinions of Drs. Jennings and Rose was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Dr. Cecil Rose, one of Latusek\u2019s treating physicians, is \u201cboard certified in internal medicine, pulmonary diseases, and occupational medicine.\u201d (J.A. 527.) Moreover, she is employed at the National Jewish Center (\u201cNJC\u201d), which is a premier institution treating interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, Dr. Rose is a member of the Committee on Pneumoconiosis for the American College of Radiology and the Chair of the Committee for the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics. (J.A. 233.) She was also a certified \u201cB\u201d reader for chest x-rays.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During her deposition, Dr. Rose estimated that throughout her career she has evaluated approximately more than one hundred patients for coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis (\u201cCWP\u201d) and other coal mine dust-related diseases. (J.A. 234-235.) She also evaluated Latusek on several occasions, beginning in 1993, when she documented his occupational history. Undoubtedly, Dr. Rose has considerable experience in diagnosing and treating CWP. Given Dr. Rose\u2019s credentials and experience, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s decision to rely upon her diagnosis of CWP and her conclusion that Latusek\u2019s condition was caused by his occupational exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Likewise, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that the opinion of Dr. Constance Jennings was credible. Dr. Jennings is also a staff member of the NJC, and she is board certified in internal medicine, pulmonary diseases, and critical care medicine. Additionally, Dr. Jennings is the Clinical Director of the Interstitial Lung Disease Laboratory at the NJC, (J.A. 528), and an assistant professor with the University of Colorado Medical School, where her primary teaching responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>is in the area of interstitial lung diseases. (J.A. 285-86.) Before joining the NJC, Dr. Jennings was a staff member at the National Institute of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) for two years, where she worked exclusively in the area of interstitial lung diseases. (J.A. 286.) Since joining the NJC, her primary focus has been on interstitial lung diseases. <em>Id. </em>During her deposition, Dr. Jennings testified that she has evaluated and/or treated approximately 50 to 100 patients at the NJC \u201cwho have worked in and about coal mines who have an interstitial-type lung disease.\u201d (J.A. 289.) Further adding to Dr. Jennings\u2019s credentials is the fact that she has published several articles on IPF.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">On the other hand, the following doctors each testified that the etiology of Latusek\u2019s disability was unknown, despite having positively concluded that it was not related to coal dust exposure. Dr. Kleinerman, the former Director of the Department of Pathology at the Metro Health Campus of Case Western Reserve University, (J.A. 339), never examined Latusek, but he reviewed his medical records and biopsy slides and concluded \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty\u201d that Latusek\u2019s lung disease \u201ccan not be attributed to coaldust [sic] exposure or simple coalworkers [sic] pneumoconiosis.\u201d (J.A. 57.) Additionally, Dr. Kleinerman is not board certified in internal medicine or pulmonary diseases, and he is not a certified \u201cB\u201d reader because he has never taken the necessary examination. (J.A. 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Dr. W.K.C. Morgan is also not board certified in pulmonary diseases or internal medicine. (J.A. 530). He is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, \u201cwhich he testified is somewhat equivalent to U.S. board certification, although he was <em>not </em>required to take any medical boards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added.) Dr. Morgan reviewed Latusek\u2019s medical records and submitted a report, wherein he stated that Latusek had \u201cminimal evidence of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis\u201d and that he did \u201cnot believe that the interstitial fibrosis present in Mr. Latusek is a result of coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis.... \u201d (J.A. 175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Dr. Fino is board certified in pulmonary diseases and internal medicine, and he is also a certified \u201cB\u201d reader. (J.A. 402.) However, unlike Dr. Jennings, he has not published any articles relating to coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Fino examined Latusek on August 24, 1995, and later diagnosed him with \u201csimple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis\u201d and \u201can idiopathic interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.\u201d (J.A. 184.) Dr. Fino concluded that Latusek has a \u201csignificant pulmonary impairment characterized by progressive restrictive lung disease which has worsened significantly since 1990.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite this conclusion, Dr. Fino ultimately opined that Latusek\u2019s \u201cimpairment and disability would be present had he never stepped foot in the coal mines.\u201d (J.A. 186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Dr. Renn is board certified in internal medicine and the subspecialty of pulmonary diseases. He is also a certified \u201cB\u201d reader of x-rays. He treated Latusek over the course of three years, from April 14, 1992 through April 25, 1995. (J.A. 501.) Dr. Renn ordered Latusek\u2019s first lung biopsy, which was performed in June 1992. (J.A. 499.) Dr. Renn diagnosed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (\u201cIPF\u201d). (J.A. 501.) Dr. Renn regularly sees and treats patients with CWP, which is why Latusek was referred to him. However, the ALJ noted that Dr. Renn \u201cexplicitly stated in his deposition that he referred claimant to the National Jewish Center because his treatment plan was not working and <em>because of the Center\u2019s expertise in treating patients unth IPF.\u201d </em>(J.A. 541) (emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Drs. Rose and Jennings relied on the following clinical findings to reach them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>conclusions that Latusek\u2019s condition was related to coal dust exposure: (1) the unusually early onset of the disease in Latusek, who was only 39 years old, (2) his heavy exposure to silicates or coal mine dust, (3) a finding of pneumoconiosis combined with his exposure, (4) the presence of emphysema in a non-smoker, (5) the unusual nature of Latusek\u2019s IPF lesion, and (6) the abnormally elevated cell count in his lungs, which indicated the presence of an irritant in the lung. Clearly, there was more than a mere scintilla of evidence supporting Drs. Rose\u2019s and Jennings\u2019s conclusion that Latusek\u2019s IPF was caused by his coal dust exposure. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s decision to give greater credence to the opinions of Drs. Jennings and Rose was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Next, the majority holds that there was substantial evidence to conclude that Drs. Jennings and Rose relied upon on the \u201cflawed\u201d articles in determining that Latusek\u2019s disability was related to coal dust exposure. <em>Ante, </em>at 377. I respectfully disagree. Dr. Rose testified in her deposition that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s enormous uncertainty about th[e] relationship [between CWP and IPF], but there is data emerging to suggest that there may be a relationship between exposure to occupational dust with the subsequent development of pneumoconiosis .... \u201d (J.A. 244.) Although acknowledging the research, Dr. Rose stated that she did not \u201cwish to ignore the uncertainty associated with [her] opinion,\u201d (J.A. 245), but she ultimately concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEG\">it is my opinion, to a reasonable probability, that in Mr. Latusek\u2019s case, given the atypical nature and presentation of his lesion and given his history of coal mine dust exposure and the associated finding of simple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis with emphysema, that the two [Latusek\u2019s work exposure and his condition] are related, and that his occupational exposure to coal mine dust probably did have an association with his subsequent development of his IPF-type condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">(J.A. 246).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Likewise, Dr. Jennings also testified in her deposition about the increasing amount of research being done regarding the connection between exposure to silicates and IPF. (J.A. 303-308.) However, when asked how she was able to link Latusek\u2019s disease to his coal mine employment, Dr. Jennings replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apr\">there\u2019s probably a number of pieces of evidence that could be used to support the contention that his disease is due to the silicates. First we have discussed, one, his age; secondly, would be his heavy exposure, which just based on history of quite an extensive exposure involving a lot of drilling and long wall exposure. Thirdly, would be the histologic evidence ... [which] demonstrates silicates exposure with findings compatible with simple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and silicate deposition. There is evidence of injury to the small airways. There\u2019s evidence of emphysema in a nonsmoker.... And finally, in the areas of peripheral fibrosis, even in the areas of honeycomb, silicate deposits are seen within the areas of honeycomb, strongly indicating silicates in the pathogenesis of the fibrotic process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">(J.A. 309-310.) Based upon Drs. Jennings\u2019s and Rose\u2019s deposition testimony, it is clear that they did not rely solely on the three related articles to determine that Latusek\u2019s condition was caused by his coal dust exposure. The majority incorrectly determines that substantial evidence supports a conclusion that Latusek\u2019s physicians relied upon the \u201cflawed\u201d articles. In fact, a review of the record reveals the opposite conclusion; the physicians merely acknowledged the research being done to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>support a connection between IPF and CWP. Despite acknowledging this growing area of research, their conclusions were based primarily upon Latusek\u2019s medical, histologic, and employment background, rather than on the articles. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In sum, I believe there was substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s factual findings that Drs. Jennings\u2019s and Rose\u2019s opinions were entitled to more weight than the opinions of Drs. Renn, Morgan, Fino, and Kleinerman. Likewise, the ALJ\u2019s factual finding that Consol\u2019s experts were less experienced in IPF is supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, while the majority may have reached a different conclusion after reviewing the record de novo, we should not disturb the ALJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. Accordingly, I maintain that the ALJ\u2019s decision should be upheld.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">. In the BRB's second opinion, it affirmed in part the ALJ's discrediting of Drs.
