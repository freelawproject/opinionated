He contends that, although he waived his right to appeal his sentence, the district court\u2019s upward departure from the sentencing range is excepted from this waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In his written plea agreement, Jones waived his right to appeal \u201cwhatever sentence is imposed on any ground, including any appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.\u201d However, during the plea hearing pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, the district court mistakenly informed Jones that he had \u201creserve[d] only the right to appeal from an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines established at sentencing.\u201d Jones agreed with this statement. Under these circumstances, we find that Jones\u2019 waiver of his right to appeal is ineffective as to his right to appeal from an upward departure. <em>See United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">However, Jones does not raise any challenge to the upward departure. He cites to no errors in the sentencing proceeding, does not challenge the district court\u2019s methodology or reasons for departing or the extent of the departure, and does not in any way challenge the validity of the 137-month sentence imposed. By failing to raise any issues for review, Jones has waived review of his sentence. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(6); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (noting that issues not briefed or argued on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">Moreover, we find that Jones\u2019 sentence was appropriate. An upward departure is encouraged when the sentencing court concludes that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2002); <em>see United States v. Bellamy, </em>264 F.3d 448, 456 (4th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1143, 122 S.Ct. 1097, 151 L.Ed.2d 994 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">Here, the district court found that the seriousness of Jones\u2019 criminal history and his likelihood of recidivism were underrepresented by criminal history category VI. Noting the \u201cextended nature of [Jones\u2019] criminal history,\u201d the court properly moved \u201cincrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it [found] a guideline range appropriate to the case.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. The sentencing court considered and found that each of the guideline ranges below offense level 25 were not appropriate for Jones\u2019 ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">We find that the district court has complied with the requirement that the sentencing court state the reasons for departure with specificity in the written order of judgment and commitment. We also find that the district court\u2019s departure was based on permissible grounds. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e); USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. Additionally, we find no abuse of discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the district court\u2019s determination of the degree of departure. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Gonzales-Ortega, </em>346 F.3d 800, 804 (8th Cir.2003) (reviewing extent of departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Jones\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
