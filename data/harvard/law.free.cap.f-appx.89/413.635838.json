We have reviewed the record and we affirm in part and reverse in part. We agree with the district court that the majority of Peacock\u2019s claims are frivolous. However, we conclude that his claim that prison officials are forcing him to take psychiatric medication against his will alleges a set of facts that may entitle him to relief. <em>See Washington v. Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 227, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990); <em>De\u2019Lonta v. Angelone, </em>330 F.3d 630, 633 (4th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim, affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Peacock\u2019s remaining claims, and remand for further proceedings. We also deny Peacock\u2019s motion to hold this case in abeyance. We deny his motions for an injunction against the administration of medication, as further factual development is required to address this issue. Peacock may renew this motion in the district court on remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
