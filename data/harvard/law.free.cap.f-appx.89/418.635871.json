With respect to the denial of relief on his \u00a7 2255 motion, the order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 </em>U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931, (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ord and conclude that Ramey has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal as to the denial of relief on Ramey\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We have also reviewed the record with respect to the denial of Ramey\u2019s motion for modification of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and have found no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Ramey, </em>Nos. CR-92-140; CA-02-866-2; CA-02-883 (S.D.W.Va., May 6, 2003). We deny Ramey\u2019s motion to expedite, and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART: AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
