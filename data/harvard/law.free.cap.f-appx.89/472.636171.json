He argues that 1) the evidence supporting his conviction was insufficient; 2) the district court plainly erred in calculating his criminal history score and criminal history category and erred in classifying him as a career offender; and 3) the condition in his written judgment of his supervised release barring his possession of a dangerous weapon should be stricken because it conflicts with the sentence orally pronounced by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-24\">The evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Allison knowingly and intentionally possessed pseudoephedrine with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Farias, </em>294 F.3d 657, 660 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1114, 123 S.Ct. 869, 154 L.Ed.2d 789 (2003); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-25\">As Allison concedes, his argument challenging the condition of his supervised release that he not possess a dangerous weapon is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935-38 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-26\">For the first time on appeal, Allison challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score and the determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>nation of his criminal history category and also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erroneously classified him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. \u201cUnder the plain error standard, forfeited errors are subject to review only where the errors are \u2018obvious,\u2019 \u2018clear,\u2019 or \u2018readily apparent,\u2019 and they affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>172 F.3d 347, 351 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Reyna, </em>358 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.2004) (No. 01-41164) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">As the Government concedes, the district court erred to the extent that Allison\u2019s 20 criminal history points included nine points for three suspended sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). The district court also erred in assigning Allison two criminal history points for an outstanding bench warrant. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) and comment, (n.4). Finally, Allison should not have been classified as a career offender for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Allison\u2019s total offense level of 36 and corrected criminal history category of IV results in a corrected imprisonment range under the Sentencing Guidelines of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. Chapter 5, Part A, Sentencing Table. Because the minimum sentence under the corrected guidelines range is higher than the 240-month statutory maximum sentence, Allison is subject to the same 240-month sentence as he originally received. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2). Thus, we AFFIRM Allison\u2019s 240-month prison sentence AS MODIFIED to reflect that for sentencing purposes, Allison is not a career offender under U.S.S.G. 4Bl.l(a), and his corrected criminal history category is IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
