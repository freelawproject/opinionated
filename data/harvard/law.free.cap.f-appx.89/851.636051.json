Saunders\u2019 counsel has a filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) raising one possible sentencing issue on appeal, but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Saunders was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-28\">Saunders was denied an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guideline Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2002) based on three positive drug tests and his unauthorized departure from the jurisdiction while on pre-sentence release. We conclude the district court did not commit clear error in its denial of the adjustment. <em>See United States v. Underwood, </em>970 F.2d 1336 (4th Cir.1992); USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Saunders\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the chent requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
