Walker pleaded guilty to this and several other related counts; however, he argues on appeal that there was an insufficient factual basis to support his plea on this count. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(b)(3). Because Walker did not object to the sufficiency of the factual basis in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002) (applying plain error review to Rule 11 violation); <em>United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Walker\u2019s conviction is based on a shotgun seized from a vehicle driven by his co-defendant, Brian Peterson. A defendant may be liable for his co-conspirator\u2019s substantive offenses if the acts were reasonably foreseeable and done in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>105 F.3d 219, 221 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 647-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in finding that Peterson\u2019s possession of a firearm was both reasonably foreseeable and in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Schmalzried, </em>152 F.3d 354, 357 (5th Cir.1998) (carrying of firearm must be shown to have had \u201ca \u2018purpose or effect\u2019 with respect to the drug offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 410-11 (5th Cir.) (discussing factors to consider in determining whether possession of firearm was \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a drug-trafficking offense), <em>amended in part, </em>226 F.3d 651 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Dean, </em>59 F.3d 1479, 1490 n. 20 (5th Cir.1995) (possession of firearm was reasonably foreseeable based on circumstances of transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
