The granting of a writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). McCotter\u2019s petition does not set forth exceptional circumstances as would warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus at this time. We note, however, that no significant action has been taken in the district court for over nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">Accordingly, we deny McCotter\u2019s mandamus petition without prejudice to his refiling it should the district court fail to act within a reasonable time. We grant McCotter\u2019s application to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
