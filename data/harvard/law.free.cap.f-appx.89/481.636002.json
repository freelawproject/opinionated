He concedes that the majority of his claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), but he maintains that the district court wrongly dismissed his action with prejudice. The \u201cpreferred order of dismissal\u201d under <em>Heck, </em>which was used by the district court, dismisses barred claims \u201cwith prejudice to their being asserted again until the <em>Heck </em>conditions are met.\u201d <em>Johnson v. McElveen, </em>101 F.3d 423, 424 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-23\">Stanley also asserts that the district court wrongly dismissed pursuant to <em>Heck </em>his challenges to the improper seizure of his personal property. To the extent that Stanley is raising a substantive due process claim, the issue would arise under the Fourth Amendment and Stanley is challenging actions taken at the time of his arrest, which may call into question the validity of his conviction. <em>See Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 375 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent that Stanley is arguing that the defendants denied him procedural due process through the unauthorized seizure of his personal property, the claims are barred by the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine. <em>See Sheppard v. Louisiana Bd. of Parole, </em>873 F.2d 761, 763 (5th Cir.1989). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
