Pena challenges the district court\u2019s upward departure on the basis that his criminal his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>tory score under-represented his criminal history. Because Pena did not object to the district court\u2019s departure at sentencing, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d 865, 869 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Pena argues that his sentence must be vacated because the district court failed to state its reasons on the record for rejecting an intermediate criminal history category before departing upward from category IV to category VI. He also argues that his criminal history category IV did not significantly under-represent his criminal history. The district court held that a departure was warranted because 1) the criminal history score did not reflect Pena\u2019s likelihood for recidivism; 2) Pena had an extensive juvenile record for which he received no criminal history points; and 3) Pena had numerous convictions as an adult but continued to violate the law in a violent manner. We conclude that there is no plain error in the district court\u2019s departure. <em>See United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d <em>658, </em>662-63 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Pena also argues for the first time on appeal that the Government breached the plea agreement because it did not orally recommend that he be sentenced at the low end of the applicable guideline range. The terms of Pena\u2019s plea agreement and the Government\u2019s recommendation are set forth in the presentence report, however, and there is no plain error. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
