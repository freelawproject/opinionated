Rodriguez has filed a motion for leave to file an out-of-time reply brief; that motion is GRANTED. He first argues on appeal that the district court erred in its application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 by counting three prior drug convictions separately, which increased his criminal history score and resulted in a higher guideline range. We conclude that Rodriguez has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding that the prior cases were not consolidated. <em>See Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 64-66, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001); <em>United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, </em>255 F.3d 198, 203 n. 10 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThe applicability <em>vel non </em>of Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 3.03 does not affect our analysis.\u201d <em>United States v. Fitzhugh, </em>984 F.2d 143, 147 n.18 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that the three prior offenses were unrelated. Rodriguez\u2019s three convictions involved three separate transactions over a three-month period involving differing amounts of cocaine. Furthermore, although Rodriguez was charged for all of the offenses on the same day by the same judge and his sentences were concurrent, he was indicted separately for each offense, each indictment was assigned a different docket number, and the sentences were not all the same length. The foregoing suggests that the two offenses should not be considered consolidated for federal sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Huskey, </em>137 <em>F.3d </em>283, 288 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Kates, </em>174 F.3d 580, 584 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Rodriguez also argues that his guilty plea was not voluntary because the district court did not admonish him that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) stated an essential element of the offense to which he was pleading guilty. He acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of the Supreme court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 519, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Rodriguez concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
