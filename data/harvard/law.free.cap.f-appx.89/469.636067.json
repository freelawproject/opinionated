He moves for this court to grant him a restraining order; this motion is DENIED. <em>See Greene v. Fair, </em>314 F.2d 200, 201 (5th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">Lynn asserts that he was denied due process when he was placed in administrative segregation prior to a hearing on a disciplinary charge for possession of a weapon and during the hearing itself. Because Lynn has no interest in his custodial classification, his prehearing detention does not violation due process. <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Whitley v. Hunt, </em>158 F.3d 882, 889 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-21\">Lynn also asserts that he was denied due process at his disciplinary hearing and that there was no evidence to support his disciplinary conviction. He is not entitled to relief on these grounds because he has not established that his disciplinary conviction has been overturned or vacated. <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648-49, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">Lynn\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS Lynn\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal of his appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim constitute two \u201cstrikes\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). If Lynn obtains three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
