Ward challenges the district court\u2019s order denying without prejudice his motion for authorization for funds for psychiatric examination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Appointment of an expert psychiatrist is permitted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e) (2000), in cases where competency or insanity is an issue. A court may refuse to authorize \u00a7 3006A(e) expert services on the ground that they are not necessary, if the court concludes that the defendant does not have a plausible claim or defense. <em>See United States v. Fince, </em>670 F.2d 1356, 1357-58 (4th Cir.1982). The decision to deny or grant a motion for services pursuant to \u00a7 3006A(e) is committed to the sound discretion of the district court and may only be overturned upon a showing of abuse of that discretion. <em>See United States v. Hartsell, </em>127 F.3d 343, 349 (4th Cir.1997). Ward\u2019s motion stated that he was not asserting incompetence to stand trial and he had not filed a notice pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.2 raising mental condition as a defense. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ward\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Ward\u2019s conviction. We grant the motions to seal the Government\u2019s brief and Ward\u2019s reply brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
