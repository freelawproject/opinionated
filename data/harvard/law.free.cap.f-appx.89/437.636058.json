Brown also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his FRCP 59(e) Motion for Reconsideration (\u201cReconsideration Motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Brown filed his lawsuit alleging a claim of employment discrimination under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq </em>on December 14, 2001. In a June 5, 2002 Order, the district court granted MCES\u2019 motion to dismiss for untimely service as to the defendants who had not been served, while quashing the service of process on the remaining defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> all of whom had been ineffectively served because the summons and copies of the complaint had been mailed to Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore rather than hand-delivered as required by Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure (\u201cMRCP\u201d) 4(c)(3)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court also extended the time during which Brown could effectuate proper service on these defendants until July 8, 2002. On October 29, 2002, the district court granted MCES\u2019 renewed dismissal motion because Brown had not effectuated proper service of process by the July 8, 2002 deadline. On February 10, 2003, the district court denied Brown\u2019s reconsideration motion. Brown appeals both of these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">MCES asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear Brown\u2019s appeal because his March 13, 2003, Notice of Appeal failed to mention the October 22, 2002 Order, violating Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (\u201cFRAP\u201d), 3(c)(1)(B). While MCES is correct that Brown only mentioned the February 10, 2003 denial of his reconsideration motion, we exercise our broad discretion to hear Brown\u2019s appeal on the merits as to both orders because we find that he intended to appeal both. <em>See C.A. May Marine Supply Co. v. Brunswick Corp., </em>649 F.2d 1049, 1056 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1125, 102 S.Ct. 974, 71 L.Ed.2d 112 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">\n<em>The October 29, 2002 Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ANTA\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of dismissal for improper service of process pursuant to FRCP 4(m), as well as its finding of a lack of good faith for failing to make timely service, for abuse of discretion. <em>See Marshall v. Warwick, </em>155 F.3d 1027, 1030 (8th Cir.1998) and <em>McGinnis v. Shalala, </em>2 F.3d 548, 550 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">In its June 5, 2002 Order the district court, citing <em>George v. United States Dept. of Labor, Occupational Safety &amp; Health Admin., </em>788 F.2d 1115, 1116 (5th Cir. 1986), exercised its discretion to quash Brown\u2019s original service of process on MCES and gave him until July 8, 2002, to effectuate proper service of process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>When Brown failed to make proper service of process by the July 8, 2002 deadline, the district court granted MCES\u2019 Renewed Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that his proffered excuse for missing the July 8, 2002 deadline. The medical problems of his attorney Becky Allen Farrell (\u201cFarrell\u201d), and her resignation on July 22, 2002, did not constitute good cause. The record clearly shows that Brown failed to meet the July 8, 2002 deadline. Furthermore, Farrell\u2019s resignation occurred two weeks after the deadline, and the firm had approximately one month from June 5, 2002, to make proper and timely service. Additionally, her resignation from the firm did not require Brown to search for a new attorney because another attorney at the firm, Carol Henderson, was named on Brown\u2019s original complaint and had been involved with his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision not to grant Brown a discretionary extension. We agree with the district court\u2019s reasoning that such was not warranted because Brown failed to serve timely the defendants even though they all are citizens of Mississippi and could have been served by simply making hand-delivery to the Attorney General as the June 5, 2002 Order clearly instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\n<em>The February 10, 2003 Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of an FRCP 59(e) motion to reconsider its denial of an extension to make proper service of process for abuse of discretion. <em>Schiller v. Physicians Resource Group, Inc., </em>342 F.3d 563, 566 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">A FRCP 59(e) motion to reconsider should not be granted unless there is: (1) an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence not previously available; and (3) the need to \u00b0correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent a manifest injustice. <em>See e.g., Schiller, </em>342 F.3d at 567; <em>Atkins v. Marathon Le Torneau Co., </em>130 F.R.D. 625, 626 (S.D.Miss.1990); <em>Russ v. International Paper Co., </em>943 F.2d 589, 593 (5th Cir. 1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 987, 112 S.Ct. 1675, 118 L.Ed.2d 393 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The district court, in denying Brown\u2019s reconsideration motion, did not abuse its discretion because there has been no intervening change of law, Brown has not produced any evidence that was not previously available to him but simply restates his \u201cgood cause\u201d argument. He has not shown that the district court made a clear error of law that would result in a manifest injustice because the record shows that he failed to meet the July 8, 2002 deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Because we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting MCES\u2019 motion to dismiss in its October 29, 2002 Order, nor in its denial of Brown\u2019s reconsideration motion in its February 10, 2003 Order, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
