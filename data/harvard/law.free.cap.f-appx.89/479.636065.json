She challenges the district court\u2019s finding that she did not meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>criteria of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5) because she failed truthfully to provide the government with all information and evidence she had concerning her offense. Madrigal has not shown that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 964-65 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Madrigal also challenges the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the statute treats drug type and quantity as sentencing factors. Madrigal raises the issue solely to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. As Madrigal acknowledges, the argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
