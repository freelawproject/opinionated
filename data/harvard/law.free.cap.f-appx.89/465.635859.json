River Construction contracted to do dock repair work; it provided the barge from which its employees did the repair work; Dalleo was injured while climbing down timbers located on the dock in order to get to the barge. Mrs. Dalleo filed suit against River Construction arguing that, as owner of the barge, River Construction was negligent under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b) for not providing a safe ingress/egress between the barge and the dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-26\">Our <em>de novo </em>review of the record reveals that, in its capacity as owner of the barge, River Construction did not breach its (1) turnover duty, (2) its duty to protect against hazards arising in areas or equipment under the barge\u2019s active control, or (3) its duty to intervene based upon knowledge as barge owner of a serious hazard ignored by it acting in its capacity as stevedore. <em>See Fontenot v. United States, </em>89 F.3d 205, 209 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also Scindia Steam Nav. Co. v. De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. 156, 166-70, 101 S.Ct. 1614, 68 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981); <em>Howlett v. Birkdale Shipping Co., S.A., </em>512 U.S. 92, 98, 114 S.Ct. 2057, 129 L.Ed.2d 78 (1994); <em>Castorina v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., Inc., </em>758 F.2d 1025, 1031-33 (5th Cir.1985). The district court was correct to dismiss Mrs. Dalleo\u2019s negligence claim against River Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-27\">The claims subject of this suit fall within the definition of ocean marine insurance as defined in La.Rev.Stat. Ann. 22:1379(9) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>(West 1995), and the district court correctly dismissed River Construction\u2019s third-party claim against the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association. <em>See Blair v. Sealift, Inc., </em>91 F.3d 755, 757 (5th Cir. 1996); <em>H &amp; B Const. Co., Inc. v. LIGA </em>580 So.2d 931, 933-34 (La.App.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
