Freeman filed a notice of appeal on January 23. The district court found no excusable neglect or good cause excusing Freeman\u2019s untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-23\">Criminal defendants have ten days from the entry of the judgment or order at issue to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 <em>(1978). </em>Because Freeman filed his notice of appeal outside the appeal period and failed to show either good cause or excusable neglect, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-24\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
