He argues that this court has jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>to review the denial of his application for cancellation of removal and that \u201cthe BIA failed to properly consider facts bearing on [his] individual circumstances and failed to state its reasons for its conclusory and generic decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">We have previously approved of the BIA\u2019s authority to affirm the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision without giving additional reasons. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003). When, as in this case, the BIA affirms without opinion, this court has jurisdiction to review the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that the petitioner did not amass 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States as required for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 215, 217 (5th Cir.2003). The Immigration Judge determined that Fuentes\u2019 testimony regarding when he arrived in the United States was not credible. We will not disturb this credibility determination. <em>See Garciar-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir.2003). There was substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that Fuentes did not amass the 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We do not have jurisdiction to review the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that Fuentes\u2019 children would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if they were deported to Mexico. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D); 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 592 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Fuentes\u2019 petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
