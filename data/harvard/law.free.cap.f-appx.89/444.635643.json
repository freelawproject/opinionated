Alpha argued that FDIC was obligated to repurchase this loan under the terms of an agreement the two parties entered into in conjunction with FDIC\u2019s sale of a loan portfolio to Alpha. FDIC argued that it was not obligated to repurchase the loan because the conditions precedent to repurchase specified in the agreement had not been satisfied. The magistrate judge granted FDIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Alpha appeals this judgment. This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Threadgill v. Prudential Sec. Group, Inc., </em>145 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-23\">Alpha argues that the magistrate judge erred in determining that the repurchase provision in the agreement was triggered only if two separate individuals were released of their obligations by a judgment and in giving an unreasonably restrictive interpretation to the term \u201cholding.\u201d The magistrate judge\u2019s interpretation of the contract was in accordance with the plain language of that document as it is written. <em>See Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London v. C.A. Turner Constr. Co., </em>112 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the magistrate judge\u2019s interpretation of the contract is not erroneous, and Alpha has not shown otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-24\">Alpha further argues that the judgment of the magistrate judge cannot be affirmed on the alternate theories put forth by FDIC, that the instant suit is blocked by res judicata and that Alpha cannot now complain about its inability to foreclose on the collateral for one loan due to the \u201cas\u00eds\u201d provisions of the contract between the parties. The magistrate judge did not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>cuss these theories, and her judgment is not erroneous. There is thus no need to consider these arguments. The judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
