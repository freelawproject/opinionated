Based on Booze\u2019s cooperation, the Government filed a motion for downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-23\">Booze appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to grant the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure. We lack jurisdiction over the denial of a downward departure unless the district court mistakenly believed it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Yanez-Huerta, </em>207 F.3d 746, 748 (5th Cir.2000). The court in this case properly understood the scope of its authority but declined to exercise its discretion to depart. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review its decision. The Government\u2019s motion seeking leave to forego filing a brief in this case and its motion for dismissal of this appeal are GRANTED. <em>See United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899-900 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
