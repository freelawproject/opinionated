When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability 'will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019\u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In No. 03-7761, we have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Marshall has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In No. 02-7802, we dismiss the appeal as moot because the district court granted reconsideration of its order dismissing Marshall\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for failure to comply with a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The district court previously entered an order dismissing Marshall's petition for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>comply with a court order. In case no. 02-7802, this Court remanded the matter to the district court so that the court could rule on Marshall's motion for reconsideration. After the court granted Marshall's motion for reconsideration, the court dismissed Marshall\u2019s petition as untimely and an appeal followed (case no. 03-7761).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
