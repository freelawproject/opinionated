Dawkins\u2019 plea agreement waives all rights to appeal except the right to appeal from an upward departure or an appeal based upon grounds of ineffective assistance. Dawkins now seeks to appeal his sentence. The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-20\">Dawkins asserts that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, which resulted in an excessive sentence. To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal, a defendant must show conclusively from the face of the record that counsel provided ineffective representation. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment due to ineffective assistance of counsel, Dawkins must demonstrate that (1) counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) there is a reasonable probability that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We conclude that Dawkins has not shown conclusively from the face of the record that counsel provided ineffective representation. <em>Richardson, </em>195 F.3d at 198. Instead, he openly concedes that his trial counsel\u2019s actions did not amount to ineffective assistance. Accordingly, although we deny the motion to dismiss as to this claim, we affirm Dawkins\u2019 conviction and sentence as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">Next, Dawkins contends that the district court erred by denying him a downward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0, 5K2.13 (2002). However, based on the waiver contained in Dawkins\u2019 plea agreement, he is precluded from raising this claim on appeal. Moreover, the district court\u2019s decision not to depart from the sentencing guidelines is not subject to appellate review, as the court clearly understood that it had the authority to depart, but chose not to. <em>See United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
