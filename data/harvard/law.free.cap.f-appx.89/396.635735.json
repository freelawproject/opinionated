Having reviewed Michaux\u2019s claims and finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Michaux pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute quantities of cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 846 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2003). According to the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), Michaux\u2019s total offense level was 37 and his total criminal history score was 23, placing him in criminal history category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"A-v\">Among other things, the PSR assessed three criminal history points against Michaux for a prior state-court conviction for assault with a firearm on a police officer. Michaux objected to the three-point assessment, arguing that the assault conviction was relevant conduct and, therefore, not countable as criminal history points.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As a result, Michaux contended, his criminal history score should be reduced by three points from 21 to 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">A reduction of his criminal history score to 18 would still leave Michaux in a criminal history category VI; however, Michaux also objected to the PSR\u2019s assignment of 11 criminal history points for what Michaux referred to as \u201cminor motor vehicle offenses\u201d such as driving on a revoked license. Supp. J.A. 2. In his objection, Michaux contended that the assessment of 11 points overstated the seriousness of his actual behavior and that he was entitled to a downward departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (explaining that a departure may be appropriate if the \u201ccriminal history category significantly over-represents the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s criminal history\u201d). Michaux argued that only one point should be assessed for lesser traffic offenses and that a four-point cap should be applied. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c)(permit-ting a maximum of 4 points to be assigned for certain prior offenses). Thus, if the district court agreed with both of his objections, Michaux\u2019s criminal history score would be reduced from 21 to 10 points, and his criminal history category would be reduced from category VI to category V.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">At sentencing, the district court rejected both of Michaux\u2019s objections and adopted the findings of the PSR. The court sentenced Michaux to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Michaux then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">On appeal, Michaux presses his argument with regard to whether the prior state-court assault conviction was properly included in the calculation of his criminal history category. This court need not reach the question of whether the district court should have considered Michaux\u2019s prior state-court conviction to be relevant conduct. Even if Michaux\u2019s prior conviction were considered relevant conduct and the three criminal history points associated with the conviction were excluded, Michaux would remain in the same criminal history category and his sentence range would not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Michaux concedes that a criminal history score of 18 would still place him in criminal history category VI. However, he argues that he is nonetheless entitled to relief because the district court did not fully consider his motion for a downward departure based on an overstatement of his criminal history relating to his minor traffic offenses. Michaux maintains that the district court, having already refused to treat Michaux\u2019s state-court conviction as relevant conduct, did not consider the downward departure motion because such a departure, on its own, would not have affected Michaux\u2019s criminal history category. Accordingly, Michaux argues that if we conclude that the state-court assault conviction should be treated as relevant conduct rather than criminal history, we should remand to give the district court another chance to consider his motion for a downward departure based on an overstatement of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Michaux is correct that, in order for his criminal history category to be reduced from VI to V, the court must find that his prior state-court assault conviction was relevant conduct <em>and </em>that his criminal history was overstated. However, contrary to Michaux\u2019s assertion, the district court did not fail to consider the question of whether Michaux\u2019s criminal history was overstated. In addressing Michaux\u2019s departure motion, the district court plainly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">In this case the defendant has 21 criminal history points. So if the matter involved discounting traffic offenses, then they would have to come down considerably ... to get the defendant to [category] V. But even though that may be the case, the court finds the probation officer accurately calculated the raw score of criminal history and <em>the court sees no reason why the scoring overstates his criminal history. </em>Consequently, the motion for departure will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">J.A. 27-28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The district court clearly rejected Michaux\u2019s argument that the inclusion of his traffic offenses overstated his criminal history and denied Michaux\u2019s request for a downward departure. Because the district court understood that it had the discretion to depart downward on the basis suggested by Michaux, the district court\u2019s denial of his departure motion is not appealable. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238 (4th Cir.1999) (noting that a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to depart is not reviewable unless the court\u2019s decision not to depart is based on a mistaken view that it lacks the authority to depart). Thus, even if Michaux\u2019s state-court assault conviction were treated as relevant conduct and his criminal history reduced by three points, Michaux\u2019s criminal history category would not change, and any error in that regard would be harmless. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (noting that a district court\u2019s sentencing error is subject to harmless error analysis and remand is not required if \u201cthe error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed\u201d); <em>see also United States v. McCrary, </em>887 F.2d 485, 489 (4th Cir.1989) (per curiam) (noting that error in calculating criminal history category warrants remand only when possible sentencing ranges are different). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\"> Under Section 4A1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, criminal history points are assigned to a defendant\u2019s \u201cprior sentence[s].\u201d <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), \u00a7 4A1.1 (2001).
