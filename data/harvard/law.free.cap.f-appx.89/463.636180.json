Lawrence was originally sentenced to concurrent terms of 292 and 240 months, respectively. In conjunction with a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion filed by Lawrence, the district court altered Lawrence\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and sentenced Lawrence to consecutive terms of 240 months for the money laundering offense and 52 months for the drug offense. On appeal, this court concluded that <em>Apprendi </em>was not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, vacated Lawrence\u2019s sentence, and ordered that Lawrence be resentenced to his original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-22\">Lawrence, who is proceeding <em>pro se </em>on appeal, raises numerous challenges to his indictment, his guilty plea, and his sentence. \u201cThe only issues on remand properly before the district court are those issues arising out of the correction of the sentence ordered by this court.\u201d <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 531 (5th Cir.1998). Because Lawrence could have raised these issues in his direct appeal in 1997, he may not present them now. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-23\">Lawrence also contends that the district court wrongly resentenced him <em>in absentia. </em>The mandate of this court specifically required the district court to reimpose Lawrence\u2019s original sentence, at which time he was present and had an opportunity for allocution. Therefore, the sentence received by Lawrence was not a \u201cnew\u201d sentence requiring his presence. <em>Cf. United States v. Patterson, </em>42 F.3d 246, 248 (5th Cir.1994). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-24\">The Government\u2019s motion to seal its appellate brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
