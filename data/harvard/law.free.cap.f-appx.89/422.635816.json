Mohamed contends that she provided detailed, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>sistent and plausible testimony sufficient to support her asylum claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). We have reviewed the record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s conclusion, and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s ruling that Mohamed failed to establish refugee status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We conclude as well that Mohamed is not entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000), or under the U.N. Convention Against Torture. The immigration judge did not err in finding that Mohamed failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d). Nor did Mohamed establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would face torture if she returned to Somalia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003) (to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
