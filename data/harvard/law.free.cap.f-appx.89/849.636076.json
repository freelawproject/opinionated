The district court sentenced Stokes to 162 months in prison. Stokes timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">Stokes\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue: whether the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Stokes within the appropriate sentencing guidelines range. Stokes has filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence and that the Government had no jurisdiction over his case. The Government has elected not to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">We have reviewed the arguments presented by <em>Anders </em>counsel and by Stokes and conclude they are without merit. Additionally, we have independently reviewed the entire record in this case in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Stokes\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that <em>Anders </em>counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may then move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
