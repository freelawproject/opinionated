The district court entered judgment of conviction against Bellamy on February 20, 2002. Bellamy filed a pro se notice of appeal on July 15, 2003. Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), conceding the appeal is untimely. Bellamy has filed a supplemental brief, alleging his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal in a criminal case must be filed within ten days after the entry of the judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1). The district court may, upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, extend a defendant\u2019s time period for filing a notice of appeal an additional thirty days beyond the expiration of the ten-day period. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>Panhorst v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 367, 369-70 (4th Cir.2001). We are precluded from enlarging the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">Bellamy\u2019s notice of appeal was filed beyond both the ten-day period and the additional thirty-day period. Because Bella<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>my\u2019s appeal is clearly untimely, we lack jurisdiction and dismiss the appeal. Bellamy\u2019s contention that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a timely appeal is appropriately raised in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
