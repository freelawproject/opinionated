He claims the district court mistakenly believed it did not have authority to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines based on the double counting of his previous conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We lack .jurisdiction to Peview a refusal to depart downward, however, unless it was based on a mistaken belifef that the court lacked authority to so depart. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 612, (5th Cir.2000). i The record reflects that the .district (hurt was aware Ithat it had the Authority to depart downward; if did not believe-that Rodriguez\u2019 case warranted it. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the determination. <em>See id.; United States v. DiMarco, </em>46 F.3d 476, 477-78 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
