Blakeney bases error on the finding that his being placed in a restraint chair from 1:00 p.m. on 24 July 2001 until approximately 9:00 a.m. the next day (20 hours), was not punishment. He also contends that being denied food, water, access to a toilet, and exercise while in the restraint chair was deliberate indifference. Blakeney has waived the other claims he raised in his complaint. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 868, 115 S.Ct. 189, 130 L.Ed.2d 122 (1994). (Blakeney\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-18\">Blakeney\u2019s first claim \u2014 due process right not to be punished violated by being placed in restraint chair \u2014 is premised on the rule that pre-trial detainees cannot be subjected to punishment. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). \u201c[Ujnder <em>Bell, </em>a pretrial detainee cannot be subjected to conditions or restrictions that are not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose\u201d. <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, </em>74 F.3d 633, 640 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). The <em>Bell </em>test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>applies \u201cwhen a pretrial detainee attacks general conditions, practices, rules, or restrictions of pretrial confinement\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Blakeney\u2019s second claim involves a standard of deliberate indifference. When a claim is based on the \u201cepisodic acts or omissions\u201d of jail officials, the standard of subjective deliberate indifference is applicable. <em>See id. </em>at 643, 650. Blakeney contends that not providing him with food, water, toilet-access, and exercise while he was in the chair was such an episodic act.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Regardless whether Blakeney\u2019s 20-hour confinement in the restraint chair was a condition of confinement or an episodic act, Blakeney has not shown reversible error. Facts found through a bench trial are reviewed only for clear error. <em>Williams v. Kaufman County, </em>352 F.3d 994, 1001 (5th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">With respect to the claim under the BeZZ-standard, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">In the present case, Rusk County jail officials were confronted with an unruly and dangerous pretrial detainee who was creating havoc in the jail. He was placed in the restrictive chair after he disobeyed orders and engaged in destructive practices, such as starting fires, knocking holes in the wall and pulling pipes out of the wall____ With respect to the incident on July 24, 2001, the Plaintiff was again engaging in misconduct and destructive behavior, which included setting fires and flooding his cell. A tactical team was again sent into the cell, and the plaintiff was strapped to the restraint chair.... It is clear that Lt. Kesinger was using the restraint chair and other restrictions as a means of controlling a particularly unruly and destructive detainee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Based on this, the court did not err in holding that the restraint chair had not been used for punishment. Because the challenged condition or restriction \u2014 the restraint chair \u2014 was reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective \u2014 to stop Blakeney\u2019s destructive behavior \u2014 the court did not err in not inferring a punitive purpose. <em>See Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861. There was no violation of his rights as a pre-trial detainee under <em>Bell. See Hamilton v. Lyons, </em>74 F.3d 99, 104 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Concerning Blakeney\u2019s contention that keeping him in the restraining chair without providing him food, water, toilet-access, or exercise, amounted to actionable subjective deliberate indifference, the court found that defendants \u201cacted with the proper intent of endeavoring to stop the Plaintiff from engaging in extreme misconduct in a nonpunitive manner\u201d and they \u201cdid not act with deliberate indifference\u201d. As discussed below, these findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">Regarding Blakeney\u2019s not-fed claim, Lieutenant Kesinger testified that he did not order that Blakeney not be fed; and Sergeant Dickerson testified that an inmate will be given a meal in the restraint chair if it is meal time and the inmate allows it. The jail log indicates that Blakeney actively resisted being in the chair through 10:00 p.m. on 24 July, then slept much of the night, and was fed breakfast at 6:10 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">Regarding Blakeney\u2019s no-water claim, Sergeant Dickerson testified that an inmate will be given water while in the restraint chair if the inmate will accept it; that she did not offer Blakeney any because he slept most of the night; but that she gave him juice in the morning. Lieutenant Kesinger testified that an inmate in the restraint chair who requests water will be given water; and that he never left instructions that Blakeney not be given water. Blakeney offered no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>he had requested water while in the restraint chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Regarding Blakeney\u2019s no-toilet claim, the log does not show that Blakeney was allowed to use it; but Lieutenant Kesinger testified that, had Blakeney requested to do so, an evaluation would have been made to determine whether it was appropriate to allow that. Blakeney did not demonstrate that he ever asked to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Finally, regarding Blakeney\u2019s no-exercise claim, Lieutenant Kesinger testified that he had consulted with a doctor and had been told that restraint chair use should not exceed 24 hours. Blakeney\u2019s restraint did not exceed this, and he has not shown that Lieutenant Kesinger was deliberately indifferent.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">\n<em>MOTION DENIED; AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
