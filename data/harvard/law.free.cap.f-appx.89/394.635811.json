Demissie is the primary applicant for asylum; the claims of his son, Negussu, are derivative of his application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-23\">Rather than challenging the merits of the Board\u2019s decision on appeal, the Petitioners contend that the Board erroneously failed to address one of their issues, testimony, and much documentation of record, in violation of their due process rights. We have reviewed this challenge and find it to be without merit. As we have previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ously stated, the \u201cBoard need not ... \u2018write an exegesis on every contention. What is required is merely that it consider the issues raised and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Casalena v. U.S. INS, </em>984 F.2d 105, 107 (4th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Becerna-Jimenez v. INS, </em>829 F.2d 996, 1000 (10th Cir.1987)). We find the Board\u2019s opinion to be more than adequate to satisfy due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
