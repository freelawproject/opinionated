Harrington argues that he may challenge his sentence despite his waiver of his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">This court reviews de novo whether a waiver of appeal bars an appeal. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). Harrington\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, and the Government had requested that the district court depart upward from the guideline range. Neither of the two exceptions to the waiver of appeal applies in this case. Harrington knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Dees, </em>125 F.3d 261, 269 (5th Cir.1997). Harrington\u2019s waiver of appeal is enforceable and bars the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
