Croman Corporation moves to vacate the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims decision in <em>Croman Corp. v. United States, </em>49 Fed. Cl. 776 (2001) and to remand to the trial court for further proceedings. The United States takes no position with respect to Croman\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Croman sought damages after the government suspended performance of timber sale contracts following the listing of a seabird, the marbled murrelet, as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In the trial court, Croman contended that the contracts did not provide authority for the government to unilaterally suspend performance. The trial court disagreed and ruled in favor of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Croman argues that the trial court\u2019s decision should be vacated in light of this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Scott Timber Co. v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1358 (Fed.Cir. 2003). Croman argues that in <em>Scott Timber </em>we determined that a contractual clause substantially similar to the one at issue in this case did not authorize the government to suspend unilaterally work on a contract. We agree that it is appropriate to vacate and remand under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-10\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to stay is moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-11\">(2) Croman\u2019s motion to vacate and remand for further proceedings is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-12\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
