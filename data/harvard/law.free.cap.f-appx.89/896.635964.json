Belasco (Belasco), federal prisoner no. 15787-053, is serving a 216-month sentence for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>drug-trafficking conspiracy. Belasco filed suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 complaining that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is calculating his good-time credits in a manner contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) and thus depriving him of earned good-time credits \u2022without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The district court dismissed Belasco\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte </em>on grounds that Belasco has no constitutionally protected right to good-time credits. We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. See Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Although there is no intrinsic constitutional right to good time credit, when the government creates such a right, a prisoner\u2019s interest in good time falls within the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s liberty concerns. <em>See id. </em>at 768. We have yet to determine whether a federal statute creates a constitutionally protected interest in good-time credits. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b); <em>see also Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (addressing state statute); <em>Henson v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>213 F.3d 897, 898 (5th Cir.2000) (assuming without deciding). If there is a constitutional interest, Belasco\u2019s claim would be properly raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas proceeding. <em>See Davis v. Fechtel, </em>150 F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Cleto </em>956 F.2d 83, 84 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Here, however, the factual record is undeveloped, particularly with regard to the time Belasco has served and the good-time for which he has been credited. In addition, the BOP has not had an opportunity to clarify, for the record, its methods of calculating good-time in general or Belasco\u2019s good-time credit in particular. Consequently, the record on appeal is inadequate for us to conduct a meaningful appellate review. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case to that court for further development of the record. <em>See Madison, </em>104 F.3d at 769 (vacating and remanding).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Belasco has filed a motion for appointment of counsel and for consolidation of this case with another case, which he asserts is pending in the Northern District of Texas. These and any other outstanding motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">JUDGMENT VACATED AND REMANDED; ALL MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
