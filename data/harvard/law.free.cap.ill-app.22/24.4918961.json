On the 28th day of April, 1883, the defendant in error loaned to the plaintiff in error the sum of $550 for the term of one year, with interest at the rate of eight per cent, per annum. The interest for the year was paid in advance. To secure the payment of this money, the plaintiff in error together with one \u00a1Richard Alldritt as security made, executed and delivered to the defendant in error their promissory note and power of attorney in the words and figures as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-9\" pgmap=\"23\">\u201c$550.

That on the 10th day of January, 1885, the defendant in error caused a judgment to be confessed and entered in vacation by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Whiteside County, on said note, for the sum of $550 and $60 attorney\u2019s fee. That at the next term of the Circuit Court after this judgment was so entered, the plaintiff in error filed his motion in the court, asking to have this judgment vacated. On the hearing of the motion the defendant in error entered a remitter of the unearned interest money, and the court overruled the motion and exceptions were taken, and the case is now brought to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-8\" pgmap=\"24\">Messrs.

By this new contract the bank, in consideration of the sum of \u00a744 as interest for the use of this money until April 28, 1885, paid by the plaintiff in error, agreed with him to extend the time of payment of the money loaned for the further period of one year and until April 28, 1885.

The money mentioned in the promissory note upon which the judgment-was rendered was not due or payable at the time the judgment was rendered, therefore the attorney who signed the cognovit had no authority to confess such judgment, 'nor had the clerk any right to enter such judgment on the records of the court, and the same is void.</p> <p id=\"b26-9\" pgmap=\"26\">2d. The warrant of attorney upon which this judgment was rendered was more than a year and a day old at the time the judgment was so confessed, and there was no affidavit hied in the case showing that the defendant was then living and that the debt or any part of it was then due and owing.</p> <p id=\"b26-10\" pgmap=\"26(91) 27(423)\">It is insisted by counsel for plaintiff in error that the note by its terms did not become due and payable until one year after the date thereof; that \u00e1fter it did mature, there was an extension granted for another year by the defendant in error to the plaintiff in error, the plaintiff in error paying the interest on the same for another year in advance; and that whatever may have been the rights or liabilities of these parties under the original contract, entered into between them at the time this money was first loaned and the note and warrant of attorney were executed, that contract was on the 28th day of April, 1884, entirely abrogated so far as the terms and condition of the payment of the money mentioned in the note was concerned. We assent to the proposition that the contract for an extension of time abrogated the original contract between the parties. In case of the Central Bank v. Willard, 17 Pick. 150, it was proved that after a promissory note discounted by the bank had become due, the bank, upon the application of the promisor for a renewal, indorsed on the wrapper of the note the words \u201c renewed for three months,\u201d and that the promisor paid the interest in advance; the note was retained by the bank and no new note was given. It was held that the evidence proved an independent agreement which could not bar the action on the note; that at most it would be evidence of a collateral contract. The same rule is announced in Payne v. Weible, 30 Ill. 166. The note and warrant of attorney as said in Sherman v. Baddely, 11 Ill. 622, \u201c having been executed at the same time and in reference to the same subject-matter, must be construed together and considered as forming one transaction. It amounts to this: \u201c The debtor is to have a credit of ninety days with the right on the part of the creditor, if he chooses to arrest it, of having a judgment entered up at any moment for the amount of the debt. * * * The creditor says to his debtor, I will take your note, payable in ninety days, if. you will permit me, in case I shall find it necessary for the protection of my interests, to take a judgment previously for the: amount of the debt. The debtor accedes to the proposition by 1 executing and delivering to the creditor a warrant of attorney expressly stipulating that the judgment maybe taken. * * * The defendant has no right to complain of the judgment, for he deliberately authorized it to be entered. The note was due for the purpose of the judgment by the express stipulation of the maker.\u201d The same rule is announced in Adams v. Arnold, 86 Ill. 185. In Towle v. Gonter, 5 Ill. App. 409, under the authorities, siipra, we held that the first point made by counsel for the plaintiff in error is not well taken.</p> <p id=\"b27-5\" pgmap=\"27(11) 28(213)\">The second point urged by counsel for plaintiff in error is, \u201cthat the warrant of attorney upon which this judgment was rendered was more than a year and a day old at the time the judgment was so confessed, and that there was no affidavit filed showing that the defendants were then living, and that the debt or any part of it was then due and owing.\u201d This objection does not go to the. jurisdiction to enter the judgment, and the failure to file such affidavit can only be taken advantage of upon equitable grounds. In Rising v. Brainard, 36 Ill. 79, the court says: \u201c Before a judgment .will he set aside because an affidavit was not filed showing that the defendant was alive and that the debt was due and unpaid, the party making the application is required to show some equitable reason therefor.\u201d The same rule is announced in Stuhl v. Shipp, 44 Ill. 133. The rule announced in Hinds v. Hopkins, 28 Ill. 344, \u201c that it wa's necessary that the affidavit should be filed, showing that the defendant is alive and that the debt was due and unpaid when the judgment was entered in vacation, more than a year and?\"a day after the power was executed,\u201d was modified as stated in Rising v. Brainard, 36 Ill. 79.</p> <p id=\"b28-6\" pgmap=\"28(220) 29(88)\">This court, after a careful consideration of all the decided cases of our Supreme Court upon the question of judgment, in vacation as to what papers were jurisdictional and what were not, held that failure to file affidavit that the defendant was alive and that the debt was due and unpaid when the power of attorney was more than a year and a day old, was not jurisdictional, and that advantage could only be taken of it upon equitable grounds, which case was affirmed by the Supreme Court \u2014 Stein, Block &amp; Co. v. Good, 16 Ill. App. 516. In Gibboney v. Gibhoney, 2 Ill. App. 322, it was said, this being a judgment by confession by virtue of a warrant of attorney and without actual notice to the appellee, it would be competent for the court upon a proper showing to so far vacate such judgment as to permit appellee to defend against the same, to permit an issue to be made up and tried by a jury as to whether upon the merits of the case he has a defense to the whole or any part of the judgment. But we are not familiar with any rule of law or practice by which such right to defend in such cases will be ordered on motion, unless upon the face of the record, or some showing as a foundation for such motion it shall ap pear, prima facie at least, that the defendant has a defense in whole or in part to the said judgment upon the merits. Same rule announced in Knox v. Winsted Savings Bank, 57 Ill. 330. Applying to this case the rule announced swpra, we are unable to find any showing in the record of any defense to this judgment. Order overruling motion and judgment for costs is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b29-5\" pgmap=\"29\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
