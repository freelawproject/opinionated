Substantial and positive injury must always be made to appear to the satisfaction of a court of equity before it will grant an injunction, and where the acts sought to be enjoined are being done under such circumstances that, if not injurious in tendency the complainant has no right to complain, satisfactory proof must be made that said acts have a natural or necessary tendency to produce the injury. When the injury claimed to result from the act appears to be uncertain, contingent, theoretical or possible only, equity will not interfere by injunction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b375-3\" pgmap=\"375\">2. Upon bills filed by owners of property fronting on Lake Michigan for an injunction to restrain the defendants from excavating or removing sand or other material from the bed of the lake in front of said property, or so contiguous thereto as to interfere with the formation or accretion resulting from the operation of natural causes, it is held: That the evidence does not show that the acts of defendants had a tendency either to prevent accretions upon complainants\u2019 lands, or to cause their shore to be washed away by the action of the waves; and that, in the absence of evidence showing a present injury or impending future injury from the continuance of the defendants\u2019 operations, an injunction was properly denied by the court below.</headnotes><decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b375-4\" pgmap=\"375\">[Opinion filed January 26, 1887.]</decisiondate><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\" pgmap=\"375\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook County; the Hon.

We do not find it proven that the acts done by the defendants had a tendency to either prevent accretions upon appellants\u2019 land, or to cause their shore to be washed away by the action of the waves. We, therefore, find it unnecessary to enter upon a discussion or determination of the questions at law as to the rights of the appellants and appellees in the premises, which have been so elaborately discussed by counsel. Substantial and positive injury mnst always be made to appear to the satisfaction of a court of equity before it will grant an injunction, and where the acts sought to be enjoined are being done under such circumstances that if not injurious in tendency a party has no right to complain, satisfactory proof must be made that the acts have a natural or necessary tendency to produce the injury. A failure to show injury actually threatened or certainly impending, is as fatal to the right to an injunction as the failure to establish a clear legal right. When the injury to result from the act is shown by the evidence to be uncertain, contingent, theoretical or possible only, equity will not interfere by injunction.</p> <p id=\"b380-5\" pgmap=\"380\">The evidence, in our opinion, failing to show injury in the past, or impending future injury from the continuance of the operations of appellees, the decree of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b380-6\" pgmap=\"380\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
