The motion to suppress was granted by the trial court <em>(Spallone, J.). </em>The state\u2019s motion to reargue the motion to suppress was denied, and on the same day the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>motion to dismiss was granted. With the permission of the trial court, the state appealed from the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The only issue presented is whether the affidavit in support of the application for the search and seizure warrant established probable cause to believe that marihuana was located at apartment 7A, Jedholme Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In the application for the search and seizure warrant, the affidavit of the police disclosed, inter alia, the following facts:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 15, 1978, Trooper David Zupnik of the state police learned from Tim Malo that Malo had sold $15,000 worth of marihuana, and that he had acquired the drug from a person named \u201cDoug,\u201d whom he contacted by telephone at number 376-2266. Trooper Zupnik learned from the state police criminal intelligence division that this telephone number was listed to Rita DeChamplain at apartment 7A, Jedholme Apartments. Malo would meet \u201cDoug,\u201d who operated a yellow MG, in Canterbury, and Malo would buy the marihuana for $425 per pound. On June 27, 1978, at 4:05 p.m., Malo telephoned \u201cDoug\u201d at the above number and verified that a $425 deal he previously had made to purchase marihuana would take place at 4:30 p.m. on Depot Road, Canterbury. At about 3:53 p.m. that same day, Officer Frank Gavigan of the Norwich police saw a tan MG<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tered to Douglas A. DeChamplain parked near the building that houses apartment 7A, Jedholme Apartments. Officer Gavigan observed the MG leave the apartment complex area at 4:20 p.m. and watched it until it turned east onto Depot Road; the car did not stop en route.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Trooper Zupnik observed the MG arrive at the location where the drug sale was arranged to take place and saw it stop behind a vehicle occupied by Tim Malo and state police trooper Michael Meehan, who was working undercover. Trooper Zupnik learned from Trooper Meehan that DeChamplain, the operator of the MG, showed Malo and him a plastic bag containing plant material which DeChamplain represented to be one pound of marihuana. At that time, DeChamplain, \u201cof\u201d apartment 7A, Jedholme Apartments, was arrested on Depot Road, Canterbury and charged with possession of marihuana with intent to sell and with possession of over four ounces of marihuana. Two plastic bags containing plant materials were seized at the time of DeChamplain\u2019s arrest; a field test of this substance confirmed the presence of marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">On the basis of the above facts, a search and seizure warrant was issued by a judge of the Superior Court <em>(Quinn, J.) </em>for the seizure of marihuana, scales, and drug records from apartment 7A, Jedholme Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">As previously noted, the state, with the permission of the trial court, has appealed from the judgment dismissing the case. The state claims that the trial court erred in ordering the suppression of the use of marihuana as evidence when it decided that the affidavit in support of the application for the search and seizure warrant did not establish proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ble cause to believe that marihuana was located in apartment 7A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not agree with the claim of the state and hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that the facts set forth in the affidavit do not establish probable cause to believe that marihuana would be found at apartment <em>7A.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The fourth amendment to the United States constitution provides that \u201cno warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Conn.

First, it guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d In addition, this Court has interpreted the amendment to include the requirement that normally searches of private property be performed pursuant to a search warrant issued in compliance with the warrant clause. See, e.g., <em>Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 390 [98 S. Ct. 2408, 57 L. Ed. 2d 290] (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 9 [97 S. Ct. 2476, 53 L.

Purely conclusory affidavits by the affiant or informant that he or she believes that probable cause exists, however, cannot be relied upon; the underlying circumstances upon which that belief is based must be detailed in the affidavit. <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 109, 84 S.

The factors differ if probable cause to <em>arrest </em>is at issue. In that case, probable cause exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed; and (2) there is probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested committed that crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 685; 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment (1978) \u00a7 3.7, p. 680; see also <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 36 n.8, 83 S.

Chi. L. Rev. 664, 687 (1971) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">There is no question that marihuana is connected to the criminal activity for which DeChamplain was arrested. Possession of marihuana is an element of the crime of possession of marihuana with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 19-480a (b) of the General Statutes. With respect to the place to be searched, however, the affidavit in the application for the search and seizure warrant did not provide the issuing judge with sufficient facts to permit the determination of the probable \u201cpresent location\u201d of the marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The issuing judge, in determining whether probable cause exists, must consider only the information contained in the affidavit. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u00a7 54-33a (c) ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>170 Conn. 618, 628, 368 A.2d 140, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 865, 97 S.

The consideration of other information is improper. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>170 Conn. 618, 628, 368 A.2d 140 (1976). In considering the sufficiency of the affidavit, we confine ourselves \u201cto the facts which appear on the face of the affidavit or which properly may be inferred therefrom.\u201d Id., 629. Whether a search is unreasonable under the fourth amendment depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 58, 59, 87 S. Ct. 788, 17 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1966), reh. denied, 386 U.S. 988, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 243 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>166 Conn. 126, 135, 348 A.2d 603 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">As previously stated, the trial court did not err in concluding that the facts set forth in the affidavit do not establish probable cause to believe that marihuana would be found at apartment 7A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The affidavit here contained a conclusory statement to the effect that the affiants had probable cause and reasonable grounds to believe that there was marihuana in apartment 7A. To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>that underlying circumstances appear in the affidavit, these circumstances do not logically support the conclusion that there was probable cause to believe that marihuana ever was located in the apartment in question, much less that it was located there at the time the warrant was issued. There is no indication in the affidavit that either Trooper Zupnik or Officer Gavigan, the affiants, or the informant, Tim Malo, ever saw or learned from other sources that marihuana was located in apartment 7A. The affidavit contains no statement to the effect that either of the affiants or the informant was ever in apartment 7A. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Bose, </em>supra. Nor does it set forth facts observed or perceived by any of these persons from which the presence of marihuana in apartment <em>7A </em>reasonably could have been inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Telephone calls by an informant to a particular number to \u201corder\u201d illicit drugs do not per se establish probable cause to believe that the drugs themselves are located in the same premises as the telephone at which the \u201corder\u201d is received. Further, the other underlying circumstances in the affidavit do not add anything which would support probable cause to believe that marihuana was located in apartment 7A. Although Officer Gavigan saw the MG parked \u201cnear\u201d the building that houses apartment 7A, there was no indication in the affidavit that anyone saw DeChamplain leave apartment <em>7A </em>or that he was carrying a package when he exited from that apartment. It was just as likely that the marihuana sought to be seized was in another location \u2014 for example, in another apartment in the complex or in the MG \u2014 as it was that it was in apartment <em>7A. </em>Certainly the allegation that telephone number 376-2266 was listed to a Rita DeChamplain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>at apartment 7A does not provide the additional support needed to establish probable cause. In and of itself the listing of a telephone number to this individual suggests no criminal activity. See <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 418, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1968). Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>165 Conn. 239, 332 A.2d 64 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We recognize that \u201cin judging probable cause issuing magistrates are not to be confined by niggardly limitations or by restrictions on the use of their common sense, and that their determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 419. Nonetheless, the distinction between probable cause and mere conjecture still exists. \u201c[T]he grounds for a search must satisfy <em>objective </em>standards which ensure that the invasion of personal privacy is justified by legitimate governmental interests.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Puerto Rico, </em>442 U.S. 465, 471, 99 S. Ct. 2425, 61 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979). Although one may surmise that there was a chance that marihuana might have been found at apartment 7A, such conjecture does not rise to the level of probable cause to believe that marihuana, in fact, was located there.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In this opinion Cotter, C.

I agree with all of the legal principles which the majority opinion sets forth, but I respectfully disagree with the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>sion that the facts recited in the affidavit, when taken as a whole, are insufficient to support probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Our disagreement, no doubt, arises from our different interpretations of what constitutes probable eause. In <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 173, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879 (1948), the court discussed the difference between proof of guilt in a criminal case and probable cause to arrest or search, and stated that \u201c[t]here is a large difference between the two things to be proved, as well as between the tribunals which determine them, and therefore a like difference in the modes of proof required to establish them.\u201d And, as the term \u201cprobable cause\u201d implies, the issue is one of probabilities, and our determination is to be reached by an application of the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent persons act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 445, 294 A.2d 517 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>153 Conn. 39, 41, 212 A.2d 75 (1965), citing <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The test is best stated in <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969), where the court said (p. 419): \u201c[W]e do not retreat from the established propositions that only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause, <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 96 [85 S. Ct. 223, 13 L. Ed. 2d 142] (1964); that affidavits of probable cause are tested by much less rigorous standards than those governing the admissibility of evidence at trial, <em>McCray </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>386 U.S. 300, 311 [87 S. Ct. 1057, 18 L. Ed. 2d 62] (1967); that in judging probable cause issuing magistrates are not to be confined by niggardly limitations or by restrictions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the nse of their common sense, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108 [85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684] (1965); and that their determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 362 U.S. 257, 270-71 [80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697] (1960).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It is true that a reading of the affidavit renders it possible that the defendant had narcotics stashed in his automobile or in a location outside his apartment, but in dealing with probable cause we are dealing with probabilities. This is a close case, but in my opinion the affidavit was sufficient to establish a reasonable inference upon which reasonable and prudent persons would act in issuing the search warrant. \u201cAlthough in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>supra, 109. See also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 362 U.S. 257, 270, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L.

And that at about 4:20 PM, Officer Gavigan observed this vehicle leave that location with one white male occupant and drive north on Rte. 169, Lisbon, Connecticut until it turned east onto Depot Rd., Canterbury, Connecticut at about 4:24 PM and noted no stops enroute.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">6.

DeChamplain, DOB 08/05/58, of Apt. 7A, Jedholme Apartments, Rte. 169, Lisbon, Conn, was arrested on Depot Rd., Canterbury, Conn., and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell and possession of over four ounces of marijuana, and advised of his rights by Tpr.

DeChamplain to be one pound of marijuana that DeChamplain was offering for sale for $425.00, a pre-arranged price, and Tpr.
