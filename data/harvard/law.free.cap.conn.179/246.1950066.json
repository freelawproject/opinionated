In fact, however, NJB Prime Investors had in March of 1975 assigned the note and mortgage instrument to the United States Trust Company of New York. Consequently, upon a motion duly made, the trial court on August 2,1976, approved the substitution of the United States Trust Company of New York as party plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, on April 7, 1977, the court, after a hearing on the merits, rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure and set the law day for April 18, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The defendant owners subsequently transferred their equity interest to Luxury Property, Inc. On April 4, 1978, Luxury Property, Inc. was made a party defendant, and on April 17,1978, the judgment was opened and the law day extended to commence September 28, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On June 30, 1978, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to allow it to file a special defense attacking the corporate capacity of the plaintiff to maintain the action. From a denial of that motion the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The basis for this motion is as follows: the defendant claims that the original plaintiff, NJB Prime Investors, lacked corporate capacity to bring the action because it failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 47-6a of the General Statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the present plaintiff, United States Trust Company of New York, as NJB\u2019s assignee, has no better rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record reveals, however, that no challenge to the capacity of either the original or the present plaintiff to bring this foreclosure action was raised at any point in the proceedings below until the defendant filed the motion which forms the basis of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">At the outset, we observe that we need not decide whether an appeal lies from the denial of a motion to open a judgment of strict foreclosure. See <em>Sebastiano </em>v. <em>Corde, </em>171 Conn. 324, 370 A.2d 946 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Section 160 of the 1978 Practice Book provides that if a defendant intends to controvert the right of a plaintiff to sue as a corporation he must specially raise that issue in his answer. Section 164 further provides that any claimed illegality not apparent on the face of the pleadings must be specially pleaded. It is thus clear that an attack on the corporate capacity of a plaintiff to sue must be raised by way of special defense. See <em>Alfred M. Best Co. </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>124 Conn. 597, 599, 1 A.2d 140 (1938); <em>Whitney Frocks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jobrack, </em>135 Conn. 529, 531, 66 A.2d 607 (1949). We further note that there is no claim being made that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the instant proceedings. The only question raised is as to the corporate capacity of the plaintiff to maintain this suit. Such a claim is but a voidable defect, waived if not raised by a defendant in a timely manner. <em>Whitney Frocks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jobrack, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">It is also clear from the record that the defendant Luxury Products, Inc. was in effect asking the trial court to set aside the entire foreclosure proceedings ab initio, proceedings over which the court retained jurisdiction over a three and a half year period and during which it has heard and ruled upon many complex evidentiary and legal issues. To allow the defendant now to raise a defense of a lack of corporate capacity which was admittedly available to the defendant or to its predecessors from the inception of this action,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and which should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>raised, by way of special defense prior to the entry of final judgment, is in the posture of this case inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> See \u00a7 52-109 of the General Statutes which provides as follows: \u201cWhen any action has been commenced in the name of the wrong person as plaintiff, the court may, if satisfied that it was so commenced through mistake, and that it is necessary for the determination of the real matter in dispute so to do, allow any other person to be substituted or added as plaintiff.\u201d See also Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> Section 49-15 of the General Statutes provides that a judgment of strict foreclosure may, at the court\u2019s discretion, be opened and modified at any time before the title becomes vested in any encumbrancer. This procedure is commonly used, as it was in this case, to extend the law day. See, e.g., <em>Sebastiano </em>v. <em>Corde, </em>171 Conn. 324, 370 A.2d 946 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 47-6a.

It did not, however, comply with the requirements of \u00a7 52-270 of the General Statutes which authorizes the granting of a new trial under certain circumstances. The defendant did not even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>allege a basis under which a petition for a new trial could have been granted. There is, for example, no allegation that the defendant did not have a reasonable opportunity to appear and present the defense of lack of standing. That its predecessors in interest were the actual defendants at the trial is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
