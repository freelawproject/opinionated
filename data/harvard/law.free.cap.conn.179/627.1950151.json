The defendants are the city of New Haven (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe city\u201d), Martin J. Griffin, the tax collector of the city, and Edward Clifford, the tax assessor of the city. In three separate actions the plaintiffs each sought, inter alia, declaratory judgments that the act and the ordinance are unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By agreement of all parties, the cases were combined for the purposes of trial and for appeal. From the declaratory judgments of the trial court holding the act and the ordinance unconstitutional as violative of the equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>protection clauses of both the Connecticut and United States constitutions, the defendants have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">To place this case in its proper context, it is first necessary to consider certain legislation enacted prior to the adoption of Public Acts 1978, No. 78-256. Under \u00a7 12-62 of the General Statutes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> commencing October 1,1978, the assessor of each municipality must revalue all real property no later than ten years following the last preceding revaluation and every ten years thereafter. Section 12-62a (b) of the General Statutes<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> mandates that all property, both realty and personalty, is to be assessed at a rate of 70 percent of true and actual value.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Because real property in New Haven had not been revalued since 1964, the defendant tax assessor revalued such property as of October 1, 1978. Further, the city was required to abandon its prior assessment rate of 60 percent of true and actual value and to assess in accordance with \u00a7 12-62a (b) at the uniform rate of 70 percent of true and actual value.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In 1978, \u00a7 12-62a of the General Statutes was amended by the act, Public Acts 1978, No. 78-256, \u00a7 3 (now codified at \u00a7 12-62a (e) of the General Statutes).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The act, which took effect from its passage, essentially allows municipalities whose total real property assessments increased after revaluation pursuant to \u00a7 12-62 of the General Statutes by at least 30 percent over the assessment of the prior year to phase in the increase in assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ment. The legislative body of the qualifying municipalities may \u201cdefer all or any part\u201d of the increase in assessment provided that the amount deferred is phased in in equal amounts over a period not to exceed five years from the year of revaluation. The phase-in plan is, of course, inapplicable to those pieces of real property whose revaluation has not resulted in a higher assessment. Further, by its terms, the statutory phase-in applies only to real property; personal property is uniformly assessed at 70 percent of its real and actual value as required by $ 12-62a (b) of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Pursuant to the act, the city adopted the ordinance, as amended, which is set forth in the footnote below.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Simply stated, the ordinance, as it pertains to this case, provides that if the city is a qualifying municipality (that is, if the assessment list of October 1, 1978, reflects an increase in the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>assessed value of real property which is at least 30 percent greater than the value of realty on the October 1, 1977 list) the increase in the assessed value of a parcel of real property is to be divided into five equal increments, one to be added to the tax list for each of the five successive years beginning October 1, 1978. In other words, the increase in assessment will be phased in at a rate of 20 percent per year for five years; and, therefore, real property whose assessment increased as a result of the 1978 revaluation will not be assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>at 70 percent of the true and actual value as determined by the 1978 revaluation until the 1982 grand list.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found the following: On the list of October 1, 1977, the true and actual value of all real property in the city was $842,519,410; on the October 1, 1978 list it was $1,264,915,897. This represented an increase of approximately 50 percent. Without the act and the ordinance, the assessed value of all real property on the October 1,1978 list would have been $885,441,127 ($1,264,915,897 x 70%). Application of the act and ordinance resulted in the assessed value of all real property on the list being $549,762,456. Thus, the assessments on the list of October 1, 1978 amounted only to 43.5 percent of the true and actual value of all real property in the city. As stated previously, personal property was assessed at 70 percent of its true and actual value.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Because the act and ordinance resulted in a reduction in the grand list in excess of $335,000,000, the tax rate for both real and personal property in the city for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1979 was approximately 66.5 mills as opposed to approximately 47.3 mills.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To the extent that the grand list decreases, the mill rate must increase for a constant revenue to be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Both UI and the Water Co. own real and personal property located in New Haven; the Gas Co. owns personalty only. The court below found that, assuming the board of aldermen of the city would not make any substantial changes in the 1979 budget <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>or in the rate of 66.5 mills proposed by the board of finance of the city, the UI would pay $1,500,000 more in taxes during the first year of the phase-in than it would without the phase-in; the Water Co. would have to pay an additional $184,000 in taxes, and the Gas Co., $106,000. Because these taxpayers are affected in a pecuniary manner, their standing to bring the present action is clear. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>174 Conn. 493, 498, 391 A.2d 154 (1978); <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>169 Conn. 613, 617, 363 A.2d 1038 (1975). See also Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 390 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The trial court held both \u00a7 12-62a (e) of the General Statutes, which codifies Public Acts 1978, No. 78-256, \u00a7 3, and the ordinance unconstitutional under the equal protection provisions of both the state and federal constitutions. We will consider the constitutionality of the act and ordinance under both constitutions simultaneously because these provisions have a like meaning and impose similar constitutional limitations. <em>Leech </em>v. <em>Veterans\u2019 Bonus Division Appeals Board, </em>179 Conn. 311, 312-13, 426 A.2d 289 (1979); <em>Caldor\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 314-15, 417 A.2d 304 (1978); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>173 Conn. 506, 509, 378 A.2d 572 (1977), appeal dismissed, 434 U.S. 1057, 98 S.

Ed. 2d 758 (1978); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 639, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 485, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In determining whether the act and ordinance constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws, we first consider the standard to be applied. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>plaintiffs claim that tlie phase-in act and ordinance violate the equal protection clauses of the United States and Connecticut constitutions because: (1) they provide for \u201csystematic and intentional under-assessment\u201d of certain property within a class of like property; and (2) the classifications resulting from the act and ordinance are \u201carbitrary and irrational.\u201d Thus, it appears that the plaintiffs are urging us to apply either of the above two standards when determining the constitutionality of the act and ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Where legislation, such as the phase-in act and ordinance, which neither contains a suspect classification nor impinges on a fundamental right is challenged on equal protection grounds, we have stated that the plaintiff to prevail must establish that the statutory classification is without rational basis. <em>Waterbury Motor Lease, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>174 Conn. 51, 60, 381 A.2d 552 (1977); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 509; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 486. We have explained the \u201crational basis\u201d test numerous times in the past: The classifications must be reasonable and rest upon \u201c \u2018some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u2019 <em>F. S. Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S. Ct. 560, 64 L.

Ct. 305, 100 L. Ed. 811 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Recently, in the context of regulation of economic activity, we described the \u201crational basis\u201d test in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the following manner: \u201c[A]n act regulating economic activity must bear a reasonable relationship to a proper legislative purpose in a manner that is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>127 Conn. 126, 130, 14 A.2d 754 (1940) .... The constitutional issue is whether legislative classifications or discriminations bear \u2018a rational relationship to a legitimate state end and [are] based on reasons related to the pursuit of that goal.\u2019 <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 295, 363 A.2d 1, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976).\u201d <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>supra, 314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The United States Supreme Court has applied the \u201crational basis\u201d test to legislation involving taxation. <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16, reh. denied, 411 U.S. 959, 93 S. Ct. 1919, 36 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1973) (\u201c[t]he constitutional standard under the Equal Protection Clause is whether the challenged state action rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose or interest\u201d). Id., 55. Further, that court has a long history of applying the \u201crational basis\u201d test to such legislation. See, e.g., <em>Allied Stores of Ohio </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>358 U.S. 522, 527, 79 S. Ct. 437, 3 L. Ed. 2d 480 (1959) (ad valorem tax on contents of warehouses except merchandise of nonresidents if held in storage warehouse for storage only); <em>Louisville Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>277 U.S. 32, 37, 48 S.

Ct. 12, 69 L. Ed. 169 (1924) (franchise fee charged by the state of Ohio against a foreign corporation for the privilege of exercising its franchises in Ohio); see also <em>Rast </em>v. <em>Van Deman &amp; Lewis Co., </em>240 U.S. 342, 357, 36 S. Ct. 370, 60 L. Ed. 679 (1916) (tax on offering with merchandise bargained or sold in the course of trade any coupon, profit-sharing certificate, or other evidence of indebtedness or liability, redeemable in premiums). Even treatise writers have set forth the \u201crational basis\u201d test as being applicable to legislative action in the area of taxation. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) \u00a716-5, p. 1000; see also Nowak, Rotunda &amp; Young, Constitutional Law (1978), pp. 361-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The plaintiffs rely primarily on <em>Sunday Lake Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>247 U.S. 350, 38 S. Ct. 495, 62 L. Ed. 1154 (1918) (a two-page opinion); <em>Cumberland Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Revision of Tax Assessments, </em>284 U.S. 23, 28-29, 52 S. Ct. 48, 76 L. Ed. 146 (1931); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>449 F. Sup. 480 (D. Ala. 1978); and <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of Tennessee, </em>249 F. Sup. 894, 899, 902 (D. Tenn. 1966), aff\u2019d, 389 F.2d 247 (6th Cir. 1968); to support the \u201csystematic and intentional underassessment\u201d standard. The terms \u201csystematic and intentional underassessment\u201d appear in each of the above cases. In at least two cases, however, in which the United States Supreme Court has cited <em>Sumday Lake Iron Co., </em>supra, it specifically has employed the \u201crational basis\u201d test without indicating that it was adopting a new test. <em>Allied Stores of Ohio </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>supra, 527; <em>Ohio Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>281 U.S. 146, 160, 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>S. Ct. 310, 74 L. Ed. 775 (1930). Likewise, at least two cases citing <em>Cumberland Coal Co., </em>supra, have employed the rational basis test. <em>Liggett Co. </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>288 U.S. 517, 533, 53 S. Ct. 481, 77 L. Ed. 929 (1933); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission of Mississippi, </em>286 U.S. 276, 283, 52 S. Ct. 556, 76 L. Ed. 1102 (1932). Simply because we are confronted with a case involving the assessment value of property for the purposes of taxation is no reason to create a new, distinct test. The lower federal court cases and state cases cited by the plaintiffs do not convince us to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The plaintiffs would have us attach to the words \u201csystematic and intentional\u201d a pejorative meaning which they do not necessarily bear. Presumably whenever the legislature creates classifications (i.e., exemptions) in taxation legislation it intends to include certain taxpayers in one group and to exclude those not so included. This would be systematic and intentional; yet, it would not be per se unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Although we follow only the rational basis test, we do point out that even under the test of constitutionality urged by the plaintiffs, the act and ordinance are constitutional. Under that test, systematic and intentional underassessment of certain property <em>within a class of like property </em>is what is prohibited. Realty and personalty are not part of a class of like property. Neither are realty which has appreciated and that which has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">In part I of this opinion we briefly have mentioned some of the applicable principles in determining the constitutionality of a statute. \u201cWhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>legislation neither containing a suspect classification nor impinging upon a fundamental right is challenged on equal protection grounds, the burden is on the complaining party to establish that the statutory distinction is without rational basis. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill </em>[172 Conn. 615, 640, 376 A.2d 359 (1977)]; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 486, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S.

A classification is allowable if it bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate purpose of governmental action. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>141 Conn. 129, 134, 104 A.2d 212 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\u201cThat the states may classify property for taxation; may set up different modes of assessment, valuation and collection; may tax some kinds of property at higher rates than others . . . these are among the commonplaces of taxation and of constitutional law.\u201d <em>Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Ry. </em>v. <em>Browning, </em>310 U.S. 362, 368, 60 S. Ct. 968, 84 L. Ed. 1254 (1940). \u201cA legislature is not bound to tax every member of a class or none.\u201d <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>supra, 509. \u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that inequalities which result from a singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption, infringe no constitutional limitation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Further, a state, in exercising its taxing power, \u201cis not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value.\u201d <em>Allied Stores of Ohio </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>supra, 527. \u201cAs long as some <em>conceivable </em>rational basis for the difference exists, \u2018a classification is not offensive merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety.\u2019 <em>Karp </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>Zoning Board, </em>156 Conn. 287, 299, 240 A.2d 845 [(1968)].\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 512. (Emphasis added.) No scheme of taxation has been devised which is completely free of all discriminatory impact. <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 41. \u201c \u2018The broad discretion as to classification possessed by a legislature in the field of taxation has long been recognized.... [T]he passage of time has only served to underscore the wisdom of that recognition of the large area of discretion which is needed by a legislature in formulating sound tax policies. ... It has . . . been pointed out that in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification. Since the members of a legislature necessarily enjoy a familiarity with local conditions which this Court cannot have, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes. . . .\u2019 <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>309 U.S. 83, 87-88 [60 S.

There is a presumption of constitutionality which attaches to a statutory enactment ; the burden which rests upon a party asserting its invalidity is to establish that it is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 569, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979); <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 134, 394 A.2d 731 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>169 Conn. 207, 217, 363 A.2d 91 (1975); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Product Development Corporation, </em>167 Conn. 111, 114, 355 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>A.2d 72 (1974); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra. \u201cIt is established that a distinction in legislation is not arbitrary, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, and the existence of that state of facts <em>at the time the law was enacted </em>must be assumed. <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78 [31 S.

The one attacking the legislation has the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it. <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>309 U.S. 83, 88, 60 S. Ct. 406, 84 L. Ed. 590 (1940); <em>Waterbury Motor Lease, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 60-61; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 487-88. \u201cOnly by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation [presumption of constitutionality] is it possible to preserve to the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.\u201d <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>supra, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Finally, we consider whether there is any conceivable basis which might support the act and ordinance. It cannot be assumed that the legislature could not have reasonably concluded that by the coincidence of \u00a7\u00a7 12-62 (revaluation required every ten years) and 12-62a (b) (uniform assessment rate of 70 percent) of the General Statutes numerous owners of real property might have been faced with a dramatic and sudden increase in taxes. Because of the coincidence of these statutes, not only is appreciation in realty which accrued over a period of years being compressed into a single revaluation, but also assessment is imposed at a uniform rate of 70 percent of true and actual value (a rate which is higher than that previously imposed at least by the city). Perhaps to ameliorate the potential hardship and deleterious consequences on the social structure of certain communities that the above statutes might impose \u2014 for example, numerous foreclosures \u2014 the legislature enacted \u00a7 3 of Public Acts 1978, No. 78-256. This is a legitimate purpose for governmental action. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is the duty and function of the legislature to discern and correct evils, and by evils we do not mean some definite injury but obstacles to a greater public welfare.\u201d <em>Rast </em>v. <em>Van Deman &amp; Lewis Co., </em>supra, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Having determined that the purpose of the act and ordinance is a legitimate one, we now examine the classifications drawn by the act and ordinance to determine if they invalidate the legislation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>parties have delineated three distinct classifications contained in the act and the ordinance: first, municipalities in which revaluation has resulted in an increase of no less than 30 percent in the total assessed value of real property over the previous year\u2019s total real property assessment as opposed to municipalities in which the increase is less than 30 percent; second, real property as opposed to personal property; and third, real property having increased assessments as opposed to real property having no increase or having a decrease in assessment. The question is whether these classifications have a rational basis. We need to examine each to see if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived to sustain it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">As to the <em>first </em>classification, the trial court indicated in its memorandum of law that \u201c[t]here seems to be no particular reason for . . . the designation of 30% as the dividing line.\u201d We agree that the 30 percent figure is arbitrary; however, \u201c \u2018when it is seen that a line or point there must be, and that there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark.\u2019 <em>Louisville Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>277 U.S. 32, 41, 48 S. Ct. 423, 72 L. Ed. 770 [1928].\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>267, 297, 363 A.2d 1, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976). \u201c[A]ll laws, especially those in the tax area, are necessarily dotted with such fine distinctions. \u2018It is only a difference in numbers which marks the moment when day ends and night begins, when the disabilities of infancy terminate and the status of legal competency is assumed.\u2019 <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>supra, 510.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 512. \u201c[I]n every instance where a line must be drawn or a cutoff established there are those who fall directly on either side. This is but one of the vagaries of life to which we accustom ourselves and which we accept in our daily affairs, but we cannot, for this reason, find the act unreasonable in its purpose and overall effect.\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>supra, 297-98. If a conceivable rational basis exists for the distinction, then the classification passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Several rational bases are conceivable for the classification regarding the 30 percent increase in real property assessments which triggers the act and ordinance. This percentage increase requirement ensures that there be no deviation from the 70 percent assessment rate imposed by \u00a7 12-62a (b) of the General Statutes unless there is sufficient overall impact in terms of increased assessment to justify the legislative remedy made available by the act. Additionally, municipalities not having the threshold increase of 30 percent are prevented from incurring the administrative costs of implementing a phase-in program; the use of the act is confined to those municipalities in which the potential of significantly enlarged tax burdens on real property owners or the possible disruption of the real estate market is sufficiently substantial to justify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>administrative costs of the phase-in program. Further, the requirement of a 30 percent increase helps ensure that the phase-in process is equitable. Where such a city-wide problem does not exist, and the overall real property assessments do not necessitate a phase-in of assessment, the act cannot be used solely to benefit selected individuals or for other political purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">As to the <em>second </em>classification, the real property-personal property distinction, a conceivable rational basis likewise exists. The legislature may have drawn this line because it considered that there was a potential for a sudden and dramatic increase in the assessment of realty because revaluation of such property for assessment purposes may occur at intervals as far apart as ten years. General Statutes \u00a7 12-62. The previous revaluation of a piece of real property revalued in 1978 may have occurred in 1968. The legislature may well have feared that although the appreciation in the value of that property may have been gradual over the years, the cumulative appreciation may have been so substantial that when reflected in the subsequent assessment, forced sales, foreclosures, and other conceivable hardships might result. Such a dramatic increase in assessment may have been thought not to exist for personal property which is revaluated annually. With annual revaluation there would be no cumulative appreciation accruing over a period of years which would be compressed into one revaluation. The real property-personal property distinction certainly is not irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Further, in light of what the legislature may have considered an already poor real estate market, it may have wanted to cushion an increased tax bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>den on real property owners during a revaluation year by having it shared by all property owners within a municipality. It is interesting to note that although the act extends to commercial, residential, industrial, and other real property, legislative history reveals that homeowners were of special concern, and the act was to insulate them from at least some of the burden of revaluation. See, e.g., 21 H.R. Proc., pt. 10, 1978 Sess., pp. 4237-39 ; 4241-42; 4249; 4251-52; 4253.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The major thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument appears to be against the <em>third </em>classification, that between real property which has appreciated in value and that which has not. The plaintiffs claim that this classification violates equal protection because, inter alia, \u201cthose whose real property has increased sufficiently in value will be subsidized by those owners of real property which has decreased, remained the same or increased less in value.\u201d Although such a \u201csubsidy\u201d may result from the act and ordinance, the classification does not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws because of the existence of at least the following conceivable rational bases. To achieve the purpose of mitigating the burden of increased assessments of real property in a revaluation year, a logical distinction exists between pieces of realty which have appreciated since the prior revaluation and those which have not. The legislature might have reasonably believed that only owners of appreciated property potentially would face a significant \u201cdouble barrel\u201d tax impact resulting from the coincidence of the legislation involving mandatory periodic revaluation; General Statutes \u00a7 12-62; and that imposing a uniform assessment rate; General Statutes \u00a7 12-62a (b). Owners of unappreciated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>property would be in less need of protection from a sudden and dramatic increase in tax burden. Likewise, the distinctions between pieces of real property which have appreciated more than others are rational. Inasmuch as the phase-in formula is based on equal amounts of the increase of assessment being added to the prior assessment value for a maximum of five years, owners of realty who arguably receive the greatest protection from a sudden, significant increase in assessment are precisely those who would otherwise be threatened with the greatest increase in assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Moreover, the distinction between realty with an increased assessment and that without such an increase conceivably gives a municipality an administratively convenient and cost effective method to implement the phase-in program. Rather than applying a complex formula to all realty, it is more convenient and economical to apply that formula to realty with an increased assessment. Administrative convenience and expense in the measurement or collection of taxes provide justification for the difference in treatment among classes of taxpayers. <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal &amp; Cokje Co., </em>supra, 511; 16A C.J.S., Constitutional Law, \u00a7490, p. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The plaintiffs challenge this classification also on the ground that the phase-in legislation has the effect of prolonging inequities \u2014 those benefiting from the phase-in would be those who were under-assessed previously. Although the phase-in act may result in what may be perceived as some continued temporary inequities that the mandatory periodic revaluation and uniform assessment rate were designed to ameliorate, it cannot be disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that the legislature may proceed one step at a time to remedy a harm. \u201c[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not require that a State must choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.\u201d <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 486-87, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1970). Neither can the act be condemned because it imperfectly effectuates the legislature\u2019s goals. <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">When the act and ordinance were enacted, the state and local legislators necessarily lacked precise information about future budgets, mill rates, and assessments. In retrospect, perhaps another mechanism or formula may have been more well-suited to achieve the goals sought by the legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Whether the prescribed mode of taxation is wise, however, is not a matter before us. <em>Waterbury Motor Lease, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 62; <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>141 Conn. 129, 135, 104 A.2d 212 (1954); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>127 Conn. 126, 130, 14 A.2d 754 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The plaintiffs have failed to sustain their burden of proving that the legislation is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, they have not overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the act and ordinance. We hold that the act and ordinance do not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws, that they are constitutional, and that the trial court erred in its declaratory judgments holding them unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>There is error, the judgments are set aside, and the cases are remanded with direction to render judgments declaring that \u00a7 12-62a (e) of the General Statutes and the ordinance of the city of New Haven effective October 18, 1978, as amended effective January 2, 1979, are not in violation of the equal protection clauses of the United States or Connecticut constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"><em> </em>Section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cAll persons bom or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

The trial court issued injunctions granting all the relief sought. In its preliminary statement of issues the city had raised the question of whether the trial court erred in granting the \u201cmandatory injunction\u201d and the \u201cpermanent injunction.\u201d The issue is now moot because on June 14, 1979, we granted the defendant\u2019s motion for review and vacated the trial court\u2019s order terminating the stay of judgment.
