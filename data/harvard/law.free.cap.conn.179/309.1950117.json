Thus, any controversy which may have existed between the parties regarding the power of the juvenile court to impose in its order of commitment conditions, which the commissioner of the department of children and youth services was to follow regarding the care of the minor delinquent children involved, necessarily became moot. Appellate jurisdiction requires that there be an actual controversy; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions. <em>United Liquors of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Teamsters Local 443, </em>179 Conn. 211, 212, 425 A.2d 1262 (1979); <em>Harkins </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>165 Conn. 407, 409, 334 A.2d 901 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The appeal of the defendant in each case is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
