The defendant in this case asks us to reexamine and overrule <em>Branham. </em>The most recent expression by the United States Supreme Court on this subject appears in <em>Lakeside </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 98 S. Ct. 1091, 55 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1978). Nothing in that case or in other cases cited by the defendant in his brief persuades us to come to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\"><em> </em>Since the trial of this case General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 has been amended to read, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201c(b) Unless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused's failure to testify. . . .\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
