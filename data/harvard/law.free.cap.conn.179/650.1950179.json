Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF3\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Common Pleas from the decision of the defendant Trumbull zoning board of appeals (hereinafter the board) granting a variance to the defendant Ronald L. Esposito allowing him to subdivide into two lots a parcel of land zoned Residence AA and owned by Guido Gismondi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That court dismissed the appeal and the plaintiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have appealed to this court upon the granting of certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The record discloses that on March 23, 1977, the Trumbull planning and zoning commission (hereinafter the commission) approved an application made by the defendant Esposito to subdivide the 1.79 acre parcel into two lots and to extend an existing road known as \u201cQuail Trail\u201d through the parcel. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-25. This subdivision would result in two approximately three-quarter acre lots in between which Quail Trail would extend. See appendix. The subdivision approval was contingent upon several factors, including the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>board\u2019s grant of a variance of \u00a7 I, article III of the Trumbull zoning regulations, which sets a minimum lot size of one acre in the residence AA zone in which the parcel in question is located. The commission\u2019s approval also required Esposito, as the developer, to construct the extension of Quail Trail through the divided parcel. Quail Trail is presently a dead end street and the 1.79 acre parcel lies between Quail Trail in the so-called Laga\u00f1a subdivision and Foster Avenue, an existing street. The record discloses that it has been the intention of the planning and zoning commission to extend this section of Quail Trail to connect with Foster Avenue when it originally approved the Laga\u00f1a subdivision in 1969. Therefore, the Laga\u00f1a subdivision was not finally approved by the commission<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in 1969; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-25; until the subdivision map provided for the future extension of Quail Trail to Foster Avenue. The approved subdivision map, which includes the lots of the plaintiffs and was recorded in the Trumbull land records, shows a turnaround at the end of Quail Trail, where the lot in question is located, with the following notation: \u201cTempEorary] turnaround, to be discontinued on extension of road.\u201d The warranty deed to the Whittakers recites that their premises are subject to this turnaround as shown on the recorded Laga\u00f1a subdivision map.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The defendant board granted Esposito\u2019s application for a variance of the one acre lot size requirement in order to permit the construction of dwellings on each of the two lots, and gave nine reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>for its decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, Patricia Whittaker, an abutting property owner, and Alexander and Sally Ann Nestor, other property owners, commenced this action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See General Statutes, \u00a7 8-8. The trial court found the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to be without merit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The question before us essentially is whether the court erred in ruling that the board properly granted the lot size variance the defendant Esposito sought. The plaintiffs argue basically that Esposito demonstrated no true hardship because the undivided lot conformed to the lot size regulation for that zone; and that, because the town did not take the property by its power of eminent domain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>to construct the road, no hardship has been shown to exist. This argument, of course, implicates the reasons the board gave to support its decision to grant the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The ultimate issue raised by this appeal is whether the trial court correctly concluded that the action of the defendant board was not arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of its discretion. <em>Bogue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>165 Conn. 749, 752, 345 A.2d 9 (1974); see also <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>162 Conn. 621, 623, 295 A.2d 556 (1972). Courts <em>are </em>not to substitute their judgment for that of the board; <em>Koproski </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>162 Conn. 635, 636, 295 A.2d 564 (1972); <em>Wil-Nor Corporation </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>146 Conn. 27, 30, 147 A.2d 197 (1958); and decisions of local boards will not be disturbed so long as honest judgment has been reasonably and fairly exercised after a full hearing. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Town Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>151 <em>Conn. </em>235, 245, 196 A.2d 427 (1963). \u201cUpon appeal, the trial court reviews the record before the board to determine whether it has acted fairly or with proper motives or upon valid reasons. . . . We, in turn, review the action of the trial court.\u201d <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>152 Conn. 247, 248-49, 206 A.2d 110 (1964). See <em>Krejpcio </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>152 Conn. 657, 662, 211 A.2d 687 (1965). The burden of proof to demonstrate that the board acted improperly is upon the plaintiffs. <em>Horvath </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>163 Conn. 609, 316 A.2d 418 (1972); <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>156 Conn. 619, 621, 238 A.2d 400 (1968); <em>Talmadge </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>141 Conn. 639, 642, 109 A.2d 253 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>A local zoning board has the power to grant a variance nnder General Statutes \u00a78-6 (3)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> where two basic conditions are satisfied: \u201c(1) the variance must be shown not to affect substantially the comprehensive zoning plan, and (2) adherence to the strict letter of the zoning ordinance must be shown to cause unusual hardship unnecessary to the carrying out of the general purpose of the zoning plan.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>174 Conn. 323, 326, 387 A.2d 542 (1978). We must determine whether the trial court was correct in concluding that the zoning board of appeals was entitled to grant the variance under the terms of General Statutes \u00a78-6(3), which have been substantially incorporated in Article VI \u00a7 IB<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the zoning regulations of the town of Trumbull. Because the trial court made no finding, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>consulted the memorandum of decision to ascertain the basis for its judgment. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 325; <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 23, 26, 376 A.2d 385 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">There was evidence before the board that supported its conclusion that the variance would be in harmony with the purpose and intent of the zoning regulations in this area. In reviewing the board\u2019s action, the trial court properly recognized that the board could not grant a variance for a use that would impair the integrity of the comprehensive plan. <em>Miclon </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>173 Conn. 420, 424, 378 A.2d 531 (1977); <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Apepals, </em>140 Conn. 290, 295, 99 A.2d 149 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The comprehensive plan is to be found in the scheme of the zoning regulations themselves; see <em>Loh </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 32, 35, 282 A.2d 894 (1971); <em>Lebanon </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>153 Conn. 182, 188, 215 A.2d 112 (1965); see General Statutes \u00a7 8-2; as well as in the maps and plans, if there be any, filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-25, 8-29. See <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>141 Conn. 349, 355, 106 A.2d 173 (1954). The board found, and justifiably so, that the variance would be \u201cin harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning Regulations in carrying out the proper arrangement and development of streets in this area.\u201d See footnote 4, supra. If the 1.79 acre parcel had been developed as a single lot, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>plaintiffs suggest, the comprehensive plan would have been impaired because such development would have prevented the commission from improving traffic flow and thereby reduce congestion and facilitate the delivery of vital health and protective services. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-2; footnote 4, supra. Moreover, the zoning commission\u2019s approval of the extension of Quail Trail in 1969, when the development was laid out, and its recent approval of the subdivision plan submitted by Esposito, further support the board\u2019s conclusion that the variance would not conflict with the town\u2019s comprehensive plan but would, instead, implement it.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Thus, the first requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 (3) having been satisfied, we take up the second requirement: demonstration that adherence to the strict letter of the zoning ordinance causes \u201cunusual hardship unnecessary to the carrying out of the general purpose of the zoning plan.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 326. The plaintiffs argue essentially that the hardship complained of by Esposito is self-created and, therefore, that the variance was improperly granted. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">As we have pointed out in a prior decision, \u201c[t]he meaning of \u2018exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship\u2019 as used in General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 has been extensively litigated.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 327. In <em>Smith </em>we said that \u201c[i]t is well-settled that the hardship must be different in kind from that generally affecting properties in the same zoning district, and must arise from circumstances or conditions beyond the control of the property owner.\u201d Ibid. Where the hardship involved \u201carises as the result of a voluntary act by one other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>than the one whom the variance will benefit, the board may, in the sound exercise of its liberal discretion, grant the variance.\u201d <em>Belknap </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 380, 384, 232 A.2d 922 (1967). Where the claimed hardship arises from the applicant\u2019s voluntary act, however, a zoning board lacks the power to grant a variance. <em>Abel </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>172 Conn. 286, 289, 374 A.2d 227 (1977); <em>Booe </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>151 Conn. 681, 683, 202 A.2d 245 (1964); <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 719, 722, 137 A.2d 755 (1957); <em>Devaney </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>132 Conn. 537, 544, 45 A.2d 828 (1946). The hardship which justifies a board of zoning appeals in granting a variance must be one that originates in the zoning ordinance; <em>Booe </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra; cf. <em>Devaney </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra; <em>Highland Park Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 40, 43, 229 A.2d 356 (1967); and arises directly out of the application of the ordinance to circumstances or conditions beyond the control of the party involved. <em>Misuk </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>138 Conn. 477, 481, 86 A.2d 180 (1952); <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 433, 442, 101 A.2d 284 (1953); see <em>Berlani </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>160 Conn. 166, 170, 276 A.2d 780 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The applicant for the variance, Esposito, was presented with a genuine hardship beyond his control and not of his or the record owner\u2019s making. The 1.79 acre parcel involved has been designated as the location through which Quail Trail is to extend to connect to Foster Avenue since 1969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>when the town planning and zoning commission approved the Laga\u00f1a subdivision upon that condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Esposito\u2019s application for a variance was filed in April, 1977, long after the commission\u2019s 1969 decision to extend Quail Trail was expressed in an official map filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-25.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, Espositio\u2019s proposed plan for subdividing the 1.79 acre parcel was approved by the commission only upon the condition that Quail Trail be extended to Foster Avenue. This was a condition the commission had the power to impose; <em>Nicoli </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 89, 95-96, 368 A.2d 24 (1976); and one that Esposito was not entitled to ignore. See <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>159 Conn. 1, 9, 266 A.2d 396 (1969); <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>95 Conn. 357, 362, 111 A. 354 (1920); 4 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 23.04, 24.01 to 24.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The plaintiffs argue that the existing undivided parcel satisfies the one acre lot size requirement for this zone and, hence, that no hardship exists. They suggest that it is only when the public authority takes land for a public street by the power of eminent domain, as was the ease in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, that the unusual hardship requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 (3) is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The plaintiffs misconstrue the power of a local planning commission. Such a commission, unlike a municipality, does not acquire title to land in a subdivision that it designates for use as a public street through the power of eminent domain. In his treatise on the subject Professor Anderson has written: \u201cThe imposition of subdivision controls is an exercise of the police power, and it seeks to accomplish the orthodox ends of the police power by serving the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community. . . . The public benefit which flows from subdivision control does not require that such control be exercised through the power of eminent domain rather than the police power.\u201d 4 Anderson, op. cit. \u00a7 23.04; see also \u00a7 23.32.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have held that a commission\u2019s power to regulate the use of land, where reasonable and impartial, does not constitute a taking of property without due process of law or just compensation. See <em>Aunt Hack Ridge Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 109, 112-120, 273 A.2d 880 (1970). \u201c \u2018Where the free exercise of one\u2019s rights of property is detrimental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>to the public interest, the State has the right to regulate reasonably such exercise of control under the police power.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kievman, </em>116 Conn. 458, 463, 165 A. 601 (1933), quoting <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>95 Conn. 357, 368-69, 111 A. 354 (1920). One who chooses to engage in subdividing land by that decision thus chooses also to be subject to the reasonable regulation of the local planning commission. See <em>Aunt Hack Ridge Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>supra, 118-19. The decision of a planning commission on a subdivision plan is binding and final unless an appeal is taken therefrom. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-28, <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>159 Conn. 1, 9, 266 A.2d 396 (1969). Therefore, we see no practical difference, where hardship is concerned, between taking a parcel of land by the state or a municipality, and a planning commission\u2019s binding decision to approve a subdivision plan only upon a particular layout of streets. A person choosing to subdivide land is no less restricted in his use of that land by the commission\u2019s action than a property owner is by the action of the condemning authority; the hardship imposed upon him due to the restricted use is no less real.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, the extension of Quail Trail can hardly be said to be the voluntary act of Esposito. Therefore, the board was legally justified in concluding that a strict interpretation of the zoning regulations would result in undue hardship to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p

(4) The lots have more than sufficient area to meet the minimum yard requirements required for light and air. (5) It would be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning Regulations in carrying out the proper arrangement and development of streets in this area. (6) The Board found adequate proof that the parcel cannot be developed in conformity with the Zoning Regulations as additional land is not available. (7) It would not be detrimental to the neighborhood by reason of traffic as the additional traffic which would be introduced on these two streets, if connected, would be minimal and of a local neighborhood character which would primarily be used to provide access to homes in the area. (8) The fact that Quail Trail would not remain a permanent dead-end street at this present terminus was and is a matter of public record.
