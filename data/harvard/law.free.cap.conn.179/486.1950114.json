The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability and the case proceeded to trial before a jury on the issue of damages. The jury returned a verdict in the amount of $10,000 for the plaintiff who subsequently moved to set that verdict aside on the grounds that it was inadequate. The court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion and rendered judgment on the verdict. The only issue on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>is whether the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict in favor of the plaintiff, as being inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict is entitled to great weight and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness. <em>Waldron </em>v. <em>Raccio, </em>166 Conn. 608, 618, 353 A.2d 770; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Shiels, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 3, 19, 347 A.2d 102.\u201d <em>Katsetos </em>v. <em>Nolan, 170 </em>Conn. 637, 656, 368 A.2d 172. \u201c \u2018The ultimate test which must be applied to the verdict by the trial court is whether the jury\u2019s award falls somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages or whether the size of the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury were influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption.\u2019 <em>Birgel </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>163 Conn. 23, 28, 301 A.2d 249; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7197.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>171 Conn. 412, 416, 370 A.2d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">There was conflicting evidence at the trial concerning the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and the causal relationship between those injuries and the accident. The resolution of these issues is properly within the province of the jury who determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony; <em>Angelica </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>174 Conn. 534, 535, 391 A.2d 167; <em>Hamill </em>v. <em>Neikind, </em>171 Conn. 357, 370 A.2d 959; <em>Rood </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>161 Conn. 1, 3, 283 A.2d 220; and it is their function to determine the damages suffered by the plaintiff. <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>174 Conn. 373, 375, 387 A.2d 699; <em>Angelica </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>supra; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>supra; <em>Birgel </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018The fact that both the court and the jury concurred in their determination is a persuasive argument for sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>taining the action of the court on the motion [to set aside the verdict]. [Citations omitted.]\u2019\u201d <em>Birgel </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict since, on the evidence presented, the jury could fairly reach the verdict they rendered. <em>Giammattei </em>v. <em>Chieppo Bus Co., </em>171 Conn. 97, 98, 368 A.2d 13; <em>Hamill </em>v. <em>Neikind, </em>supra; <em>Fabrizio </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>164 Conn. 385, 386, 321 A.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
