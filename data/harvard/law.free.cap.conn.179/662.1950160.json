The defendants\u2019 appeal challenges the court\u2019s decision to strike the findings made by the commissioner and to substitute findings of fact and a contrary conclusion of its own, the court\u2019s holding that an employee is entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for a disease which is neither an occupational disease nor a disease resulting from an accident, and the court\u2019s decision to set aside the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had not proven that her disease arose out of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The plaintiff Mary Anne Grady filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for a case of pulmonary tuberculosis which she alleged arose out of her employment as an x-ray technician at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Waterbury. The workmen\u2019s compensation commissioner entered a finding and award in favor of the defendants St. Mary\u2019s Hospital and Travelers Insurance Company on July 10, 1975, and dismissed the claim. The commissioner con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>eluded that the claimant failed to sustain the burden of proof that her pulmonary tuberculosis was caused by any particular accident which could be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred or that her condition was causally connected to the employment as a direct result of repetitive trauma and repetitive acts incident to such employment. The commissioner also concluded that the claimant had failed to sustain the burden of proof that pulmonary tuberculosis is a disease peculiar to the occupation of x-ray technician in a general hospital, regardless of whether she may have contracted the disease due to contagion in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such. The commissioner\u2019s finding therefore eliminated the three types of compensable conditions included in the definition of the terms \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cinjury\u201d which are interchangeable terms under the act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-275.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The commissioner also concluded that even if pulmonary tuberculosis were to be considered an occupational disease in this case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>claimant had failed to sustain the burden of proof that the pulmonary tuberculosis from which she suffered arose out of and in the course of her employment at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The claimant appealed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the decision of the commissioner denying compensation. The claimant also moved to have the commissioner correct his finding of fact based on a review of the transcript and hearing record pursuant to Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 515. Upon the commissioner\u2019s denial of the motion, the claimant filed a second appeal under \u00a7 31-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The Superior Court acted solely on the claimant\u2019s appeal from the commissioner\u2019s denial of compensation. The court denied relief on the second appeal from the commissioner\u2019s refusal to correct the findings, despite the plaintiff\u2019s motion requesting that it do so. Instead the court ordered stricken a substantial portion of the commissioner\u2019s finding, substituted a finding of its own, and concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the plaintiff had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that her disability arose out of her employment as a radiology technician conducting special procedures at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital. The court held the claim proven and remanded the action to the commissioner to effect the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The defendants assign as error the trial court\u2019s decision to make a complete finding, contrary to that of the commissioner, upon an independent review of the transcript. In <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/ Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117-18, 411 A.2d 924 (1979), we said: \u201c[T]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . . Moreover, on review of the commissioner\u2019s findings, the trial court does not retry the facts nor hear evidence. It considers no evidence other than that certified to it by the commissioner, and then for the limited purpose of determining whether or not the finding should be corrected, or whether there was any evidence to support in law the conclusions reached. It cannot review the conclusions of the commissioner when these depend upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. Its power in the correction of the finding of the commissioner is analogous to, and its method of correcting the finding similar to, the power and method of the Supreme Court in correcting the findings of the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) These limitations on the scope of review of the Superior Court on an appeal from the finding of a workmen\u2019s compensation commissioner are well-established principles of Connecticut law; <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>Red Star Express Lines, </em>156 Conn. 245, 248-49, 240 A.2d 859 (1968); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hotel Bond Co., </em>89 Conn. 143, 147-51, 93 A. 245 (1915); which have been embodied in Practice Book, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>1978, \u00a7 519.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the Superior Court acknowledged these principles restricting the scope of review, it appears that the court was of the opinion that the case law, as well as \u00a7 519, authorized the substitution of an independent contradictory finding by the words: \u201cWhen it appears necessary to protect substantial rights of a party, the court may order a transcript of the evidence and make such findings therefrom and render such judgment therein as it deems the law requires.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Lanyon </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>139 Conn. 20, 30, 89 A.2d 558 (1952), we said of this sentence in \u00a7519: \u201cWhatever may have prompted the adoption and retention of [this] rule, the fact remains that it has never been construed to extend the power of the court to make additions to the finding other than those which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) The Superior Court erred in failing to limit its scope of review within the confines of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The defendants also assign as error the court\u2019s conclusion that an employee is entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for a \u201cdisability, whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>its nature, which was sustained in the course of and arose out of the claimant\u2019s employment.\u201d The defendants contend that a compensable claim under the act is one which entails a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as defined by one of the three categories in General Statutes \u00a7 31-275.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In view of the case history,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we agree with the defendants\u2019 assertion that the act\u2019s definition of three categories of compensable personal injury is exclusive. In its substituted finding, the court did not find that the claimant had sustained her burden of proving either of the two types of compensable injuries on which her claim was based. The court\u2019s memorandum states that proof of the first and third types of compensable personal injuries was not required, only \u201cproof by a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>preponderance of the evidence that the disability, whatever its nature, was sustained in the course of and arose out of the claimant\u2019s employment.\u201d The court\u2019s conclusion is in error because it is contrary to the legislature\u2019s definition of personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The defendant\u2019s third assignment of error attacks the trial court\u2019s order setting aside the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had not sustained her burden of proving that the disease arose out of her employment. \u201cThe conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 118, 411 A.2d 924 (1979). To the extent that the commissioner\u2019s finding discloses facts, his finding cannot be changed unless the record discloses that the finding includes facts found without evidence or fails to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed. <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>Red Star Express Lines, </em>156 Conn. 245, 248, 240 A.2d 859 (1968). In view of the errors found on the first two issues raised by the defendants and the court\u2019s refusal to act on the claimant\u2019s motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s finding which would have been the appropriate course of action in view of its decision to make a substitute finding, it cannot be determined whether the court\u2019s order to set aside the commissioner\u2019s conclusion was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case remanded with direction to reinstate the finding of the commissioner and to proceed on the two appeals in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 contains, inter alia, the following definitions : \u201c \u2018Personal injury,\u2019 or \u2018injury,\u2019 as' the same is used in this chapter, shall be construed to include, in addition to accidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred, an injury to an employee which is causally connected with his employment and is the direct result of repetitive trauma or repetitive acts incident to such employment, and occupational disease as herein defined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\u201c \u2018Occupational disease\u2019 includes any disease peculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such and includes any disease due to or attributable to exposure to or contact with any radioactive material by an employee in the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> See IB Larson, Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 41.40, pp. 7-391 \u2014 7-395 for a discussion of similar eases involving tuberculosis where the claimant has been held covered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\"> To be compensable under the act, an employee\u2019s injury must, among other things, arise out of and in the course of her employment.

This term is defined in J 31-275 as follows: \u201c\u2018Arising out of and in the course of his employment\u2019 means an accidental injury happening to an employee or an occupational disease of such employee originating while he has been engaged in the line of his duty in the business or affairs of the employer upon the employer\u2019s premises, or while so engaged elsewhere upon the employer\u2019s business or affairs by the direction, express or implied, of the employer. ...

Such appeals are heard by the court upon the certified copy of the record filed by the commissioner. The court does not retry the facts or hear evidence.

There we said that \u201c \u2018personal injury\u2019 within the meaning of the Act involves both an accident and a bodily injury, as distinguished from a disease.\u201d By the time <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Norwalk Lock Co., </em>100 Conn. 533, 124 A. 17 (1924), was decided, however, the legislature had amended the act to include in the definition of injury any disease which is due to causes peculiar to the occupation and which is not of a contagious, communicable or mental nature. The following year, the court broadened the definition of personal injuries compensable under the act on its own initiative by including contagious diseases. <em>De la Pena </em>v. <em>Jackson Stone Co., </em>103 Conn. 93, 130 A. 89 (1925). But the legislative response was to tighten the definition of a compensable personal injury \u201cto include <em>only </em>accidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred, and occupational disease as herein defined.\u201d Public Acts 1927, e. 307 \u00a7 7. (Emphasis added.) In <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Brother, Inc., </em>121 Conn. 664, 666-67, 186 A. 616 (1936), this court recognized that \u201c[t]he purpose of the amendment was to limit the scope of the act as it applied to diseases and to include in it only certain types which occupied a definite relationship to the occupation of the employee.\u201d The only substantive change in the definition since then has been the addition of the second category of compensable personal injury which is immaterial to this case because the plaintiff does not claim it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
