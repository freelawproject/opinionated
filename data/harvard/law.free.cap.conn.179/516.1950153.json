The defendant has come before this court on certification from the Appellate Session.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The main issue to be determined at this juncture is whether the burden is upon the state to prove the lack of a permit, or whether the requirement of having a permit is an affirmative defense, to be pleaded and proved by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">There is no material conflict as to the basic facts. On July 20, 1977, at 9:30 p.m., two Hartford police officers set up surveillance outside a two-family residence of three floors. After approximately forty-five minutes one of the officers identified the defendant on the roof of the dwelling. The officer testified that he saw the defendant carrying a shotgun or rifle. Additional police units were summoned. Upon the arrival of the additional police units, the officer entered the building under surveillance and arrested the defendant. Others were also arrested. Another officer searched the roof of the building and found two sawed-off shotguns, one long-barreled shotgun, a large bayonet and two Molotov cocktails. The shotguns were loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In affirming the decision of the trial court, the Appellate Session ruled that the phrase \u201cunless such person has been granted a written permit\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>was not a constituent part of the offense, but was merely an exception. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nathan, </em>138 Conn. 485, 489, 86 A.2d 322 (1952). The Appellate Session cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoffan, </em>228 Pa. Super. Ct. 127, 142, 323 A.2d 318 (1974), for the proposition that \u201cwhere the exception merely furnishes an excuse for what would otherwise be criminal conduct, the duty devolves upon the defendant to bring himself within the exculpatory provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The defendant, on the other hand, urges that the essence of the crime is not the carrying of a dangerous weapon, but rather the carrying of a dangerous weapon <em>without a permit. </em>The defendant argues that without proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he did not possess a permit, a finding of guilty is improper. He cites the constitutional right to bear arms; Conn. Const., art. 1 \u00a7 15; U.S. Const., amend. II; and stresses that carrying a weapon is not criminal per se, but only becomes criminal if the weapon is carried without a proper permit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Our decision on this issue is premised on a fundamental principle of our law. The burden in a criminal case is placed squarely upon the prosecution to prove each essential element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the defendant to prove his innocence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beauton, </em>170 Conn. 234, 240, 365 A.2d 1105 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 52, 64, 301 A.2d 547 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>153 Conn. 209, 215, 214 A.2d 903 (1965). See <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>160 U.S. 469, 487, 16 S. Ct. 353, 40 L. Ed. 499 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>An examination of the statute brings this court to find a close analogy to the statute interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vuitch, </em>402 U.S. 62, 91 S. Ct. 1294, 28 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1971). In that case the government had charged the defendant with producing an abortion in violation of the District of Columbia Code. The statute stated that \u201c[wjhoever . . . produces . . . an abortion or miscarriage on any woman, unless the same were done as necessary for the preservation of the mother\u2019s life or health and under the direction of a competent licensed practitioner of medicine, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one year or not more than ten years.\u201d D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 22-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The court reversed a Court of Appeals ruling which had held that the prosecution was not required to prove, as part of the ease in chief, that the operation was not \u201cnecessary to preserve life or health.\u201d The court stated (p. 70) in <em>Vuitch: </em>\u201cIt is a general guide to the interpretation of criminal statutes that when an exception is incorporated in the enacting clause of a statute, the burden is on the prosecution to plead and prove that the defendant is not within the exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">More recently, this court applied similar reasoning and analysis in <em>State </em>v. <em>Beauton, </em>170 Conn. 234, 365 A.2d 1105 (1976), a case dealing with a statute and fact situation analogous to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In <em>Beauton, </em>the defendant was found guilty of carrying a dangerous or deadly weapon in a vehicle in violation of \u00a7 29-38 of the Ueneral Statutes, which provides a penalty for any person who knowingly has, in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by him, \u201cany weapon for which a proper permit has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>not been issued as provided in section 29-28 or section 53-206.\u201d At trial, the state offered no evidence on the question of whether the defendant had a proper permit for the weapon in question. This court concluded (p. 240) that \u201cthe lack of a proper permit is an essential element of the crime charged and that the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a proper permit for the weapon had not been issued as provided in \u00a7 29-28.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">A significant factor in reaching that decision is the fact that the words of \u00a7 29-38, \u201cfor which a proper permit has not been issued,\u201d appear as part of the enacting or prohibition clause. The words are an integral part of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beauton, </em>supra, 241; see 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a74 153, 154. Similarly, we find the construction and placement of the words in \u00a7 53-206, \u201cunless such person has been granted a written permit,\u201d to be an integral part of the enacting or prohibition clause of that statute. Accordingly, we hold that the prosecution has the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did not possess a written permit under \u00a7 53-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside, and the ease is remanded with direction to render judgment that the defendant is not guilty and to order that he be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53-206. carrying and sale of dangerous weapons, (a) Any person who carries upon his person any slung shot, air rifle, BB gun, blackjack, sand bag, metal or brass knuckles, or any dirk knife, or a switch knife, or any knife having an automatic spring release device by which a blade is released from the handle, having a blade of over one and one-half inches in length, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>or stiletto, or any knife the edged portion of the blade of which is four inches or over in length, or any other dangerous or deadly weapon or instrument, <em>unless sueh person has been granted, a written permit issued and signed by the first selectman of a town, the mayor or chief of police of a city or the warden of a borough, authorising such person to carry such weapon or instrument within sueh town, city or borough, </em>shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than three years or both. . .
