The legal implications of this relationship flow, as a mixed question of law and fact, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>language of the relevant contracts, and the conduct of the parties with reference thereto. On the facts before him,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the state referee was not in error in concluding that there was neither a direct nor an indirect contractual relationship between the named defendant and the plaintiff. Nor was the referee in error in concluding that the plaintiff had not established claims in fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"At6\"> Despite the plaintiff's extensive attack on the findings of fact, our review indicates that the findings are supported by the evidence before the referee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
