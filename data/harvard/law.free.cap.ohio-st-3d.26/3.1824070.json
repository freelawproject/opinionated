Appellant offers several arguments in support of his position, but we find that only one of these arguments need be addressed in the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">Appellant contends that the commission\u2019s order is confusing, contradictory and not supported by the evidence. Specifically, appellant notes that although the order <em>grants </em>his appeal and <em>denies </em>Crestline\u2019s appeal (of the award of temporary partial disability benefits), it also <em>affirms </em>the decision of the regional board of review which effectively terminated appellant\u2019s temporary total disability benefits and awarded temporary partial benefits. Appellant asserts that the foregoing inconsistencies in the commission\u2019s order, combined with a lack of evidence in support of an award of temporary partial disability benefits, evinces a lack of compliance with the requirement that the commission \u201cspecifically state which evidence and only that evidence which has been relied upon to reach * * * [its] conclusion, and a brief explanation stating why the claimant is or is not entitled to the benefits requested.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, 483-484. This argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">First, the commission\u2019s order <em>is </em>internally inconsistent and contradictory. By granting appellant\u2019s appeal, one would assume that the commission was ruling in his favor and reinstating his temporary total disability benefits.' In affirming the regional board of review, however, the commission merely maintained the status quo and provided no relief to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Second, it is impossible to resolve the foregoing inconsistency by reference either to the \u201cevidence\u201d relied upon by the commission or to the commission\u2019s non-existent \u201cexplanation\u201d of its conclusion. The evidence cited by the commission consists solely of the medical reports of Drs. Fallon and Friedman. While Dr. Fallon\u2019s report states that it is his \u201cfeeling\u201d that appellant \u201cis not under temporary total impairment\u201d and \u201ccould return to his former job activities,\u201d the report also states that appellant has a \u201cpermanent partial impairment\u201d of twenty percent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Friedman\u2019s report, on the other hand, reaches the conclusion that appellant is \u201ctemporarily and totally disabled.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither of these reports provides a factual basis for the award of temporary partial disability benefits at twenty-five percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>this court emphasized that the commission <em>must </em>succinctly set forth a basis for its decision, so that (1) the parties have some notice as to the reasons for the approval or denial of compensation, and (2) the courts do not have to search the record for \u201csome evidence\u201d in support of the commission\u2019s determination and <em>assume </em>that the commission, in fact, relied upon that evidence in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The commission\u2019s order in the instant case falls short of the standard discussed in <em>Mitchell. </em>The contradictory nature of the order itself raises a question as to whether the commission, by granting appellant\u2019s appeal, actually intended to award temporary total disability benefits to the appellant, or whether the commission, in fact, intended to adopt the regional board of review\u2019s decision to award only temporary partial disability benefits. The commission offers <em>no </em>explanation that might assist the court in resolving the order\u2019s inconsistencies, nor does the evidence cited by the commission support an award of temporary partial disability benefits. Although the report of Dr. Fallon might support an order that denies reinstatement of the appellant\u2019s temporary total benefits, the report of Dr. Friedman appears to support <em>only </em>an order that awards those benefits. Additionally, neither report even indirectly discusses temporary partial impairment or disability; and Dr.- Fallon\u2019s finding of a permanent partial impairment of twenty percent has no correlation to an award of temporary partial benefits at twenty-five percent, which appears to have been \u201cpulled from thin air.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u25a0 Based on the foregoing, we grant a limited writ of mandamus and direct the commission to vacate its order of August 2, 1984 and issue a new order that clearly decides the parties\u2019 respective appeals, states which evidence has been relied upon, and succinctly explains the basis of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and a limited writ of mandamus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b68-7\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b68-8\">Locher, Holmes and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> The twenty percent figure was actually based in part on an earlier 1981 injury suffered by appellant with a different employer, for which a claim was allowed. The instant 1982 injury constituted only five percent of the twenty percent impairment, according to Dr. Fallon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\"> Dr. Friedman\u2019s report also considered the earlier 1981 injury suffered by appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b68-9\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArU\">dissenting. I must dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion because I do not feel that the Industrial Commission\u2019s order was an abuse of discretion. Granting a writ of mandamus is clearly inappropriate where the record contains some evidence in support of the commission\u2019s findings. <em>State, ex rel. G F Business Equip., Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 446, 447 [20 O.O.3d 379], citing <em>State, ex rel. Humble, </em>v. <em>Mark Concepts, Inc. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 77 [14 O.O.3d 275]; <em>State, ex rel. Davis, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 160 [14 O.O.3d 402]; <em>State, ex rel. Republic Steel, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 193 [15 O.O.3d 216]; <em>State, ex rel. Dodson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 408 [16 O.O.3d 439].</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The commission ordered affirmance of the regional board of review\u2019s order to allow temporary partial compensation at twenty-five percent. It based such order on the reports of Drs. Fallon and Friedman. This court has consistently held that a simple recitation of which reports the commission has relied on is sufficient to satisfy the rule of <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, that commission orders must state which evidence the commission relied upon in reaching its conclusion. See <em>State, ex rel. Hutt, </em>v. <em>Frick-Gallagher Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 184, 185 (the commission\u2019s mentioning of medical reports of four doctors meets the <em>Mitchell </em>requirement); <em>State, ex rel. Burdette, </em>v. <em>Dayton Walther Corp. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 29 (commission\u2019s statement that its order was \u201c \u2018based on the reports of Drs. Chinn and Graham, evidence in the file and evidence adduced at the hearing\u2019 \u201d <em>[id. </em>at 29-30] did articulate the evidence relied on by the commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">It is clear that the medical reports of Drs. Friedman and Fallon provide some evidence in support of the commission\u2019s decisions. Dr. Friedman\u2019s initial opinion that appellant was temporarily totally disabled, in a report dated October 17, 1983, addressed only prior injuries appellant had received while working for a former employer. In that claim, No. 81-5991, appellant had been allowed an award of five percent permanent partial disability (September 27, 1982). Upon reconsideration (decision of November 17, 1982) a ten percent permanent partial disability for injuries to upper and lower back was awarded; and, by additional order dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>March 30,1983, the claim was allowed for right shoulder strain and tear of tendon cuff. Although these allowances have never been appealed, the hearing officer\u2019s order dated July 13, 1983, under the claim related to the more recent injury, No. 82-17094, ordered appellant to undergo a COLSP exam under both claim numbers and then to reset both files for hearing. This state of the record makes it unclear which injuries are at issue and, thus, which medical reports are relevant to the case <em>sub judice. </em>However, this October 17, 1983 report declaring appellant to be temporarily and totally disabled, upon which the majority relies to conclude that the evidence does not support the commission\u2019s findings, dealt <em>only </em>with the first claim, No. 81-5991, and clearly is not relevant to the instant appeal of claim No. 82-17094.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">In a later report, dated December 6, 1983, Dr. Friedman does address both the prior and more recent injuries. There, not only does he opine that the prior injury (that he once believed to be a temporary total disability) now amounts to only a permanent partial impairment of twenty percent, but he also believes that the later injury, which may include some of the prior back injury, resulted in permanent partial impairment of twenty-five percent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An even later report by Dr. Friedman implies appellant could return to work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These reports, even without Dr. Fallon\u2019s opinion, based on a September 1983 examination, that appellant was \u201cnot under temporary total impairment,\u201d but only a twenty percent permanent partial impairment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> surely provide some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s finding that appellant has a partial disability of twenty-five percent. It is important to note that the mere use of the medical term \u201cimpairment\u201d does not limit the value of his opinion as to \u201cdisability,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201ccould return to his former job activities.\u201d See <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Ohio Brass Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 147, 148-149; and <em>State, ex rel. Dallas, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 193. Both Drs. Friedman and Fallon were of the opinion that appellant could return to his former employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">While the medical reports conflict as to the extent of appellant\u2019s disability, the commission\u2019s resolution of such factual matters is subject to reversal by mandamus action only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State, ex rel. Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 16 [58 O.O.2d 70]. Nothing in the commission\u2019s order allowing the twenty-five percent disability even approaches an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is merely a substitution of its own judgment for that of the commission, prohibited by this court\u2019s ruling in <em>State, ex rel. Marshall, </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 203, 205 [44 O.O.2d 184], Its additional argument that the commission\u2019s order is internally inconsistent is equally unpersuasive. Allowance of an appeal is not axiomatic to ruling in favor of appellant, as an appellant has no right to judgment merely because his appeal is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and deny the writ requested.</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-6\">Locher and Wright, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-5\"> Dr. Friedman\u2019s report, dated December 6, 1983, concerns claim No. 81-5991, not here at issue, and No. 82-17094, with their respective dates of injury of January 27, 1981 (Eagle Crusher Co.) and July 22, 1\u00a3)82 (Crestline Auto Wrecking Co.). It opines the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cBased on lower back injury, I would place his permanent partial impairment of at least 25% and of the right shoulder strain and right shoulder tendon cuff tear I would place his permanent partial impairment of 20%.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\"> Dr. Friedman\u2019s letter dated April 12, 1984 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201cI still feel the need for a CAT scan and a myelogram by a competent neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon to rule out the possibility of a herniated disc would be indicated first before he could return to his regular duty which requires heavy lifting.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\"> Dr. Fallon\u2019s report dated September 9, 1983 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">\u201cFrom the standpoint of allocation of the impairments it would be my feeling that due to the impairment which occurred in 1981 \u2014 claim number 81-5991 that he would have a 15% permanent partial impairment. The LS strain which was super-imposed on a prior low back injury in the second claim or claim no[.] 82-17094 would result in an impairment of some 5% additionally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Such expert conclusions provide not only notice of the commission\u2019s reasons for denial of total disability but also establish the physician\u2019s awareness of the two claims and injuries related to each. It is for the commission to determine the credibility and the weight to be given to submitted, relevant evidence. <em>State, ex rel. Teece, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 165, 169 [22 O.O.3d 400].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\"> It may be an abuse of discretion for the commission to order \u201ctemporary partial\u201d disability benefits as R.C. 4123.56 provides for temporary disability compensation only when such disability is total, <em>State, ex rel. McDaniel, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio App. 3d 55, and R.C. 4123.57 seems to provide for partial disability only when such is permanent. See <em>State, ex rel. Brown, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App. 3d 273. However, this issue is not addressed by the majority and it is sufficient for purposes of this dissent to note that this court upheld an award of temporary partial disability benefits in <em>State, ex rel. Petros, </em>v. <em>Connor </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St. 3d 176, 178.
