R.C. 4123.46 provides in part that \u201c[t]he industrial commission shall disburse the state insurance fund to employees of employers who have paid into said fund the premiums applicable to the classes to which they belong when such employees have been injured in the course of their employment, wherever such injuries have occurred, and provided such injuries have not been purposely self-inflicted * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is not to make an employer an absolute insurer of the employee\u2019s safety, but only to protect the employee against risks and hazards incident to the performance of his work. In order for compensation to be denied on the basis that an employee was intoxicated, \u201cthe employee must be so intoxicated, as shown by the evidence, that the court can say, as a matter of law, that the injury arose out of his drunken condition and not out of his employment.\u201d <em>Hahnemann Hospital </em>v. <em>Indus. Bd. of Illinois </em>(1918), 282 Ill. 316, 327, 118 N.E. 767, 771; <em>Frith </em>v. <em>Owners of S.S. Louisianian </em>(1912), 2 K.B. 155, 5 B.W.C.C. 410. An employee who drinks intoxicating liquor to such an extent that he can no longer engage in his employment abandons his job and, when injured in that condition, his injury does not arise out of his employment. But intoxication which does not incapacitate the employee from following his occupation is not sufficient to defeat the recovery of compensation although the intoxication may be a contributing cause of his injury. Our statute was not designed to make contributory negligence of the employee, or a defense of that nature, a bar to his recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, where his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. See <em>Hahnemann Hospital, supra, </em>at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The parameters of the necessary causal connection between the employee\u2019s injury and his employment were discussed in <em>Highway Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Bricker </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 175 [4 O.O. 101]. In that case the employee was injured when a gun he had brought to work, without authorization from his employer, discharged and injured him. In disallowing the benefits, this court at 178-179 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201c \u2018An injury is received \u201cin the course of\u201d the employment when it comes while the workman is doing the duty which he is employed to perform. It \u201carises out of\u201d the employment, when there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the results and injury. Under this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises \u201cout of\u201d the employment. <em>But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment of the contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger </em>* * * <em>must be in</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>cidental to the character of the business </em>and not independent of the relation of master and servant. * * *\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The court concluded in <em>Highway Oil Co., supra, </em>that there was no connection between the gunshot injury and the work of the employee. The employee brought the gun to the employer\u2019s premises and \u201cthereby became subject to a danger of his own creation, to which the performance of his duties did not expose him <em>* * *.\u201d Id. </em>at 181-182.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Although intoxication alone does not necessarily constitute a departure from employment sufficient to preclude recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, voluntary intoxication which renders an employee incapable of performing his work is a departure from the course of employment. See 1A Larson, Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1985), Section 34.00. And when the employee is injured in that condition, his injury does not arise out of his employment. Under the facts of this case, it is apparent that petitioner was incapable of performing the activity incidental to the duties of his employment, that is, driving to the work site. The evidence shows that Phelps was drinking continuously in the same bar from approximately 7:00 p.m. until 12:00 a.m. When he left that bar he stopped at another bar to have another drink. The legislature, on the basis of extensive research into the problem of drunken drivers, has determined and statutorily established that a blood alcohol level of .10 percent has an adverse effect on an individual\u2019s coordination and control and that an individual with that blood alcohol level is incapable of safely operating a motor vehicle. R.C. 4511.19. In this case, the analysis showed that Phelps\u2019 blood contained substantially more than is required to raise the presumption of intoxication. With a blood alcohol level of .21 percent, Phelps was well above the minimum needed to impair his driving ability. Impairment of judgment and sensory perception as well as slowed reaction time are commonly known effects of excessive drinking. The fact that there were no skid marks, indicating that the brakes had not been applied prior to impact, the fact that Phelps was unable to remember how the accident occurred, and the fact that he admitted to his physician that he fell asleep at the wheel militate the conclusion that Phelps in fact was grossly intoxicated at the time of the accident. Thus, we hold that under the facts of this case, Phelps\u2019 voluntary intoxication was tantamount to his abandonment of employment and that his injury was proximately caused by his gross state of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Our decision is consistent with those of other jurisdictions that have no statutory defense of intoxication but recognize intoxication as a bar to recovery where an employee was so intoxicated that he was incapable of performing the duties of his contract. See, <em>e.g., King </em>v. <em>Alabam\u2019s Freight Co. </em>(1931), 38 Ariz. 205, 220, 298 P. 634, 639; <em>Simpkins </em>v. <em>State Banking Dept. </em>(1935), 45 Ariz. 186, 192, 42 P. 2d 47, 49; <em>Ortega </em>v. <em>Ed Horrell &amp; Son </em>(1961), 89 Ariz. 370, 372, 362 P. 2d 744, 745; <em>Sherrill &amp; LaFollette </em>v. <em>Herring </em>(1955), 78 Ariz. 332, 279 P. 2d 907; <em>Embree </em>v. <em>Indus.

Comm. </em>(1973), 55 Ill. 2d 252, 256, 302 N.E. 2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Based on the foregoing, this court finds as a matter of law that Phelps\u2019 injury arose out of his intoxicated condition and not out of his employment. Accordingly, the decision of the court of appeals is reversed and final judgment is entered for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-7\">Locher and Holmes, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b208-8\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the syllabus, but dissents from the judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b208-9\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b208-10\">Celebrezze, C.J., and C.

Appellee argues that the visit to the oil rig was work-related and that he was subsequently in the course of his employment when the auto accident occurred. He also contends that intoxication is not a defense to a claim for workers\u2019 compensation. We do not decide whether appellee was in the course of his employment, for we think that in any event appellee was so incapacitated at the time of his accident that he was outside the scope of his employment. The trial court refused to instruct the jury regarding the effect of appellee\u2019s intoxication on his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.

I am in complete agreement with the majority opinion herein, and only write to note that the public policy consideration of prohibiting the payment of workers\u2019 compensation when one has so departed from his employment by way of intoxication has been pronounced yet further by the General Assembly. Section 4123.54 of the newly enacted Am. Sub. S.B.

While I agree in the abstract with the syllabus set forth in the majority opinion and would support its application in an appropriate case, I cannot agree with its application in <em>this </em>case. The issue of whether the plaintiff was intoxicated \u201cto such an extent that he [could] * * * no longer engage in his employment\u201d was fully litigated before the jury. Counsel for the bureau specifically stated to the jury in his closing argument that \u201cit\u2019s been stipulated * * * that Mr. Phelps\u2019 blood alcohol was .21. * * * [Because of] the amount of drinking that night, you may find that took him out of his employment. * * * Mr. Phelps didn\u2019t go off the road because of a tire blow-out. He didn\u2019t lose control of his car because of a tire. He lost control of that car that evening * * * because he had too much to drink and he fell asleep at the wheel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Additionally, the trial court\u2019s instructions clearly stated, in part: \u201cAn employee\u2019s injury does not arise out of his employment when the cause of the injury is outside of and disconnected from the employment, even though the employee may have been engaged in the work of his employer in the usual way at the time of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Thus, based upon the extensive arguments of the parties and the trial court\u2019s instruction, the question of the plaintiff\u2019s intoxication properly was before the jury; and, because evidence properly was offered on <em>both </em>sides of this issue, the jury\u2019s determination \u2014 that the plaintiff was within the scope of his employment and therefore entitled to workers\u2019 compensation \u2014 should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">There is no doubt that the abuse of alcohol and driving under the influence of alcohol are serious problems in our society. The severity of these problems, however, does not warrant a reweighing of evidence and the substitution of a majority of this court\u2019s views for those of any jury which determines in a workers\u2019 compensation case that a plaintiff\u2019s consumption of alcohol did <em>not </em>result in an \u201cabandonment\u201d of employment or serve as the <em>sole </em>cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. See <em>C.E. Morris Co. </em>v. <em>Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 279 [8 O.O.3d 261]; <em>Seasons Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 77.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b209-7\">Celebrezze, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIx\">dissenting. The prevailing view, absent express statutory provision to the contrary, is that voluntary intoxication at the time of a worker\u2019s injury is ordinarily not a bar to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See 1A Larson, Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1985), Section 34.00. Since Ohio, like a number of its sister states, had not yet enacted a special statute concerning intoxication, the issue herein is whether by reaching an advanced stage of intoxication, the worker has abandoned his employment to an extent whereby it can be concluded that the injury did not arise in the course of employment, but rather was a product of the intoxication. Larson, <em>supra, </em>at Section 34.21; 81 American Jurisprudence 2d (1976) 886, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Section 234; Annotation, Workmen\u2019s Compensation: Effect of Employee\u2019s Intoxication (1926), 43 A.L.R. 421, 423. In this regard, it has been stated that \u201c[v]oluntary intoxication which renders an employee <em>incapable of performing his work </em>is a departure from the course of employment. Otherwise, apart from special statute, evidence of intoxication at the time of injury is ordinarily no defense, at least unless intoxication was the sole cause of injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Larson, Intoxication as a Defense in Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1974), 59 Cornell L. Rev. 398, 416-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Nationally, the instances where intoxication has barred recovery are exceedingly rare because it can seldom be concluded that the employee was \u201c \u2018so intoxicated, as shown by the evidence, * * * that the injury arose out of his drunken condition and not out of his employment. * * * <em>[Ijntoxication which does not incapacitate the employee from following his </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>occupation is not sufficient to defeat the recovery of compensation although the intoxication may be a contributing cause of his injury. \u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>District 141, Internatl. Assn. </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 79 Ill. 2d 544, 557-558, 404 N.E. 2d 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">One unusual case where recovery was denied is relied on by appellants. It concerned a chauffeur who was so intoxicated that his fare stopped the car and sent the worker back to the garage where he was employed. The chauffeur\u2019s employer told him to go home because he was too drunk to drive. The chauffeur was soon thereafter found dead. <em>Emery Motor Livery Co. </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1920), 291 Ill. 532, 126 N.E. 143. In denying death benefits, the Illinois court reasoned that \u201c[a]fter he was sent from the building he was no longer in the employ of the plaintiff in error, and whatever occurred to him after the employment ceased can not be said to have occurred in the course of his employment.\u201d Hence, the injury probably would have been held to be out of the course of employment irrespective of the chauffeur\u2019s drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Scenarios where it can be said that employment has been abandoned occur infrequently because, \u201cif the claimant continues actively to perform his duties, even while admittedly intoxicated, he has not abandoned his employment.\u201d Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 6-84, Section 34.21. Justice in this case has been led astray by the majority\u2019s blurring of \u201cabandonment of employment\u201d because of blind drunkenness with those situations where a worker has continued to perform his employer\u2019s business pursuits while in an impaired state. In the former instance, the injury does not arise out of the employment because the worker is not engaged in his or her employment. In the latter, more common situation, the employee is not barred from recovery even though the intoxication may constitute a contributing factor to a work-related injury. For example, as noted above, in <em>Emery Motor Livery Co., supra, </em>the drunken worker had been sent from the building and told to go home, thus ending his employment for the day. However, in another Illinois decision expressly relied on by today\u2019s majority, <em>Hahnemann Hospital </em>v. <em>Indus. Bd. of Illinois </em>(1918), 282 Ill. 316, 118 N.E. 767, the court actually held in favor of the intoxicated worker. In <em>Hahnemann, </em>the court recognized the more numerous situations where the impaired employees are still attending to their duties. The court correctly observed, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c* * * intoxication which does not incapacitate the employee from following his occupation is not sufficient to defeat the recovery of compensation although the intoxication may be a contributing cause of his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Similarly, the Arizona decisions relied on by the majority compel a conclusion opposite that reached by Justice Wright\u2019s opinion. Of special interest is the decision in <em>Ortega </em>v. <em>Ed Horrell &amp; Son </em>(1961), 89 Ariz. 370, 362 P. 2d 744, which, like the instant case, concerned a nighttime automobile accident with an intoxicated worker-driver. In <em>upholding </em>the award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the court observed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>worker\u2019s intoxication \u201cwould not have deprived decedent of the ability to recall his employer\u2019s instructions and carry them out. * * * [Although a reading of 0.16 renders a person an unsafe driver, it would not indicate inability to operate a car. In view of this testimony and because of the lack of certainty regarding sobriety or lack thereof at the time of the accident, we cannot say that the evidence warranted a conclusion that either man had drunk liquor to such an extent that he could no longer follow his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372-373.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">In a transparent attempt to add an air of respectability to its opinion, the majority includes without analysis an isolated citation to an old English decision. However, on closer examination, British workers\u2019 compensation law lends little support to the majority\u2019s decision in this instance. For example, in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Star Line </em>(1908), 45 S.L.R. 935, 1 B.W.C.C. 177, cited in the <em>Hahnemann </em>decision relied on by today\u2019s majority, the denial of benefits was <em>not </em>based on the seaman\u2019s intoxication during his shore leave on the night previous to the injury. Rather, the finding that the seaman was outside the course of his employment was principally because he was injured while off-duty, at a location aboard ship where he was not authorized to go, and where he had no work-related reason to be. Similarly, the decision cited in today\u2019s opinion, <em>Frith </em>v. <em>Owners of S.S. Louisianian </em>(1912), 2 K.B. 155, 5 B.W.C.C. 410, also contains an inapposite factual setting and the majority\u2019s reliance is, at best, unsettling. In <em>Frith, </em>it was noted by Buckley, L.J., at 160 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cIf the accident arises out of the employment and death results it is immaterial that there was misconduct. * * * Misconduct is no defence to a claim in respect of an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cThe whole question here is whether the accident to this man arose out of his employment. I have not the smallest hesitation in answering that in the negative. It arose out of the <em>fact </em>that <em>he was so hopelessly drunk that he could not stand, </em>and I doubt whether he could see. He had gone on shore without leave, which by itself is misconduct, and had got drunk there; he <em>came back so drunk that he was thrown on the deck like a sack of sand; </em>he staggered to his feet after a minute or two and fell over the side of the ship. <em>He was not engaged on his employment; </em>he was not fit for the performance of his employment. <em>If he had been in his employment he would not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>have been in that part of the ship, but elsewhere. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See, also, the opinion of Lord Cozens-Hardy, M.R., <em>supra, </em>at 157-159.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The difference between a worker who is so intoxicated that he is \u201clike a sack of sand\u201d and a worker who, though intoxicated, suffers a compensable injury during the course of his employment, was enunciated in the post <em>-Frith </em>case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Llandudno Coaching &amp; Carriage Co., Ltd. </em>(1915), 2 K.B. 101, 8 B.W.C.C. 143. In <em>Williams, </em>an intoxicated stable worker was going up a ladder to a loft for feed when he slipped, fell sideways, and struck his head causing injuries which resulted in his death. Citing the <em>Frith </em>decision, the employer disputed the widow\u2019s and children\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. The employer reasoned that the accident was not caused by any \u201crisk incidental to the employment\u201d but by the added risk of his being drunk. <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 103. The court unanimously rejected the employer\u2019s premise, Swinfen Eady, L.J., holding that if the worker \u201c* * * is acting within the scope of his authority, and is doing an act which it was part of his duty to do, and the accident arises from his being engaged in doing that act, * * * the employer is liable to pay compensation, although the workman is doing the act negligently, or contrary to the rules laid down for his guidance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108. Master of the Rolls Lord Cozens-Hardy, who was previously a majority member of the <em>Frith </em>panel, had no difficulty distinguishing between the two cases and found no inconsistency in their results. The sailor in <em>Frith </em>was not injured in the course of his employment because he was blind drunk, was partially carried to the ship, could not stand on his own and, in fact was <em>not working. </em>The injury occurred at the work site but not in the course of employment. In comparison, the <em>Williams </em>situation \u201cis rather like a case which I put by way of illustration in <em>Frith\u2019s </em>Case, that if a sailor, told to go aloft, does so, when in the state of intoxication, and meets with a fatal accident, that might be an accident arising out of the employment, notwithstanding his drunkenness.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 106. Accord, <em>e.g., Frazer </em>v. <em>John Riddell &amp; Co. </em>(1913), 51 S.L.R. 110, 7 B.W.C.C. 841 (worker who was fatally injured while driving a traction engine at a time when he was drunk and unfit for work, held entitled to benefits because the accident arose \u201cout of\u201d his employment since the man was actually performing the duty for which he was employed).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Likewise, the majority\u2019s decision is contrary to Ohio\u2019s legal precedent. For example, in <em>City Ice &amp; Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Karlinsky </em>(1929), 33 Ohio App. 42 (a decision ignored by today\u2019s majority) an intoxicated worker was killed when he fell from a coal wagon he was driving. The widow\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits was initially denied on the ground that the worker\u2019s death resulted from his voluntary intoxication (drunk driving). On appeal, the court definitively held that if a claimant continues actively to perform his duties, even while intoxicated, he has not abandoned his employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Ohio appellate court also recognized that the issue con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>cerning his level of intoxication was a factual question. Since the record of the trial court (which held in favor of the worker\u2019s widow) supported its finding that the inebriated driver had not left the course of his employment, the appellate court could see no error in the lower court judgment and upheld the award of benefits.

First, as the majority correctly observes, intoxication will only constitute a defense where the facts demonstrate an abandonment of employment so that the injury arises from the intoxication and not from the course of employment. Second, where it can be fairly stated that the intoxication contributed to an injury, occasioned during the course of employment, recovery will not be barred. This is so because workers\u2019 compensation Acts are designed to remove contributory negligence of the employee as a defense. <em>District 141 </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra, </em>at 558. Third, the determination of whether the drinking employee has abandoned his employment or whether the intoxication merely was a contributing factor to a work-related injury involves questions of fact for determination by a trier of fact. If the fact-finder determines that the employee has forsaken the employment relationship, the court will apply the law and bar recovery. However, if the fact-finder determines that the worker was still in the course of employment, even though alcoholic impairment may have contributed to the injury, the court must apply the law and allow participation in the fund. This was accomplished in the case <em>sub judice </em>by the lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In my opinion, today\u2019s decision has unraveled all three of these common threads. Contrary to Ohio law, the majority has applied a sterile legal truism without considering the underlying foundation of reason radiating from the cases from which they selectively draw today\u2019s one-sided syllabus. Additionally, through the misguided application of its syllabus rule, the majority has judicially resurrected one of the \u201cunholy trinity\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>common-law defenses, namely, contributory negligence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lastly, and most crucially, the majority squarely rejects the trier of fact\u2019s conclusions and has substituted its judgment in place of the jury which, of course, is always in a better position to assess the credibility and weight to be given to the testimony of the witnesses than is a reviewing appellate court. <em>Painesville Utopia Theatre Co. </em>v. <em>Lautermilch </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 167, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">And what is the truth in this case? Was Phelps in an alcohol-induced comatose state like the unconscious sailor who was tossed on to the deck of his ship \u201cin such condition of incapacity, due to intoxication, as to resemble a sack of sand\u201d? <em>Frith, supra, </em>at 156. Or, was Phelps\u2019 accident analogous to the sailor who, though in a state of intoxication, went aloft and met with a compensable \u201caccident arising out of the employment notwithstanding his drunkenness\u201d? <em>Id. </em>at 159. It may be that Master of the Rolls Lord Cozens-Hardy would not be familiar with blood alcohol test reports nor with the aftereffects of a truck tire blowout. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that he would have concluded, as did the jury below, that Phelps\u2019 conduct does not preclude the recovery of benefits because the accident <em>in fact </em>arose out of and in the course of his employment. R.C. 4123.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In order to affirm the judgment below, however, we are not called upon to determine what exactly occurred on that dark unfortunate night. Rather, our mandate in reviewing this workers\u2019 compensation appeal is to ascertain if there is evidence present to support the jury's award. The Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals, in upholding a jury award to a worker, set forth this basic tenet in the case of <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Ochenduska </em>(1928), 30 Ohio App. 442, 445, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cIt is the established rule of reviewing courts in Ohio that a verdict cannot be set aside on the ground that it is clearly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence, unless it appears from the record as a matter of law that there has been a serious mistake made by the court or jury, and this mistake must be so violent that its source is found in a misapprehension of the facts to such an extent that the verdict is a shock to the senses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cAs has been repeatedly stated, if there are two views that may be derived from the record, it is error for a reviewing court to reverse the verdict, because it would be an invasion of the province of the jury, and, if such a status exists, there is only one thing under the authorities that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>reviewing court can do, and that is to affirm the judgment on the ground that there is credible evidence, appearing upon the issues, to sustain the verdict. This law is well stated in <em>Painesville Utopia Theatre Co. </em>v. <em>Lautermilch, </em>118 Ohio St. 167, 160 N.E. 683.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">As an abstract proposition, I certainly agree with a contention that one may reach such an extreme level of voluntary intoxication that an injury does not arise in the course of employment. Again, however, the application of this legal bar is entirely dependent on factual determinations such as the level of intoxication, its effect on the employee\u2019s work capacity and whether the employee was injured in the course of employment. Thus, the jury\u2019s decision should not be disturbed in this case because there is competent evidence from which the trier of fact could render a verdict favorable to appellee. Accord <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Daugherty, supra, </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The instant record is replete with evidence which sustains the verdict. For example, there was credible evidence before the jury that, among other things, appellee was driving a company truck; he had received a telephone call from a PATCO worker regarding a plant production problem; such calls were routine because of the nature of Phelps\u2019 supervisory position; he was en route to the plant; he had, immediately preceding the accident, been on a recruiting visit at a drilling site; his route indicated he was on the way to PATCO from the drilling site; and the accident in fact resulted from a front tire blowout and had nothing to do with alcohol. The court of appeals sensibly concluded that the level and effect of intoxication were questions of fact and that the record contained sufficient evidence to support the trier of facts\u2019 conclusion that the \u201cintoxication was not extreme enough to take him out of his course of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Further, the trial judge herein advised the jury concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>course of employment, departure from business for personal pleasure, the relationship between employment and injury, Phelps\u2019 stipulated blood alcohol level, and also instructed the jurors that an injury does not arise out of employment if the cause of the harm is disconnected from the employment. So instructed by the trial judge, the jury sifted through the evidence, weighed the testimony, considered the arguments of counsel, and found that appellee is entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Accordingly, I would uphold the judgment below and would have added the following two paragraphs to the majority\u2019s incomplete syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">2. An employee\u2019s intoxication, which contributes to an otherwise compensable injury incurred in the course of employment, will not preclude recovery of workers\u2019 compensation disability or death benefits because contributory negligence is not a defense to recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">3. Questions of fact concerning whether an intoxicated worker\u2019s injuries arose in the course of employment are for determination by a trier of fact and will not be disturbed by a reviewing court on appeal unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>(C.E. Morris Co. </em>v. <em>Foley Constr. Co. </em>[1978], 54 Ohio St. 2d 279 [8 O.O.3d 261], followed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Had my brothers adhered to these fundamental principles, the judgment below would have been affirmed. However, the majority has chosen to usurp the jury\u2019s sacrosanct role, violated settled tenets of appellate review, enacted a new law which is at war with Ohio workers\u2019 compensation laws, and resurrected an archaic common-law defense to recovery which was long ago repudiated in this state, all of which again threaten the safety, security and well-being of Ohio\u2019s workforce.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Based on the foregoing, the essence of Justices Sweeney\u2019s and Brown\u2019s poignant observations, and the underdeveloped rationale of the majority,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-8\">C.

Now, upon that point there can be but one answer, and that it is that he was employed to deliver coal for the plaintiff in error company, and was returning with their team and wagon from delivering coal when the accident occurred. Whether that injury resulted in his death might be questionable, but as to the question of receiving an injury while in the course of his employment there can be but one answer, and that to the effect that he did receive such an injury; and, even though he was intoxicated, that would not make him any less an employee of the company, nor would it make him any less entitled to compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">\u201cWe do not understand that, if a person is seeking compensation, he is debarred because of his own negligence. We do not understand that the law in Ohio anywhere says that, if a man is intoxicated when he is working for another and is injured, he cannot recover compensation. It would be a singular proposition if the defendant company could employ a man who was in the habit of becoming intoxicated, and then when he became intoxicated, while in their employ and driving their vehicle, a team of horses attached to a coal wagon, injured somebody, the company could escape responsibility because the man, being intoxicated, ceased to be the employee of the company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Most recently, the <em>Karlinsky </em>decision was approved and unanimously followed by the Court of Appeals for Lorain County in the case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Bernard Co. </em>(June 26, 1985), Lorain App. No. 3819, unreported, at 5. In <em>Martin, </em>the appellate court was presented with a factual scenario and procedural posture not unlike the instant cause. Approximately two hours following completion of his work as a welder at a remote job site in Toledo, Martin was driving a company-owned welding rig back to the employer\u2019s truck yard when he had an accident. The rig ran off the road, struck a guardrail and overturned. Martin was crushed in the collision and died from the injuries. Subsequent medical tests revealed alcohol in both his blood and stomach. Martin\u2019s widow and children applied for death benefits under the Act and, after denial of the claim by the commission, they appealed to the common pleas court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>As in the instant case, the employer theorized that the worker\u2019s intoxication barred participation.

Relying on the <em>Karlinsky </em>decision, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\"> In <em>Embree </em>the Arizona appellate court stated in relevant part at 413:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201cIt is clear under the law in Arizona that \u2018simple\u2019 intoxication does not bar recovery, however, if this intoxication reaches a point where \u2018he can no longer follow his employment\u2019 recovery is barred.

This is for the reason that any intoxication (consumption of alcohol) tends to impair the ability of an individual to function. If we say that a sober individual performs properly, any amount of consumption of alcoholic beverages is therefore going to impair that performance and a state of being \u2018no longer capable of performing properly\u2019 will exist.

There was competent, credible evidence from which the jury could reasonably find this issue in Phelps\u2019 favor, such as the fact that Phelps, a short while before the accident, was clear-minded enough to seek out a specific welder at the drilling site to recruit for his employer. It is evident from the jury\u2019s verdict that it believed this evidence. By overturning the verdict, this court is usurping the jury\u2019s role and substituting its own views for those of the trier of fact. This, of course, is completely contrary to the most basic principles of appellate review. See, <em>e.g., C.E. Morris Co. </em>v. <em>Foley Constr.

I would certainly join eagerly in such a sentiment were this an appropriate setting. But this is not a drunk driving case. Nor is this a case, as the majority apparently wishes it to be, where intoxication was the actual cause of the injury for which the claimant seeks benefits. The jury in the instant cause determined that intoxication was <em>not </em>the proximate cause of the injury. Proximate cause is normally a question of fact for the jury. See, <em>e.g., Cascone </em>v. <em>Herb Kay Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 155; <em>Shinaver </em>v. <em>Szymanski </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 51. In its haste to announce its condemnation of drunk drivers, this court has ignored this basic principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">There is no basis whatsoever for overturning the jury verdict on the ground that Phelps\u2019 intoxication was the sole cause of the accident. The \u25a0 evidence presented below was conflicting on this point. There was testimony below, which if believed, proved that the accident was caused by a tire blowout. Again, this court is invading the province of the jury by essentially holding that such evidence is not worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Lastly, this court is indulging in judicial legislation. By holding that Phelps\u2019 intoxication disqualifies him from receiving compensation as a matter of law, the majority is creating a new requirement never contemplated by the legislature. R.C. 4123.54 sets forth the sole requirements for entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cEvery employee, who is injured or who contracts an occupational disease, and the dependents of each employee who is killed, or dies as the result of an occupational disease contracted in the course of employment, wherever such injury has occurred or occupational disease has been contracted, <em>provided the same were not purposely </em>self-inflicted, is entitled to receive * * * such compensation for loss sustained on account of such injury, occupational disease or death, and such medical, nurse, and hospital services and medicines, and such amount of funeral expenses in case of death, as are provided by sections 4123.01 to 4123.94 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">It is clear from the foregoing that the only requirements for eligibility for benefits are that the injury must be incurred in the course of employment and that the injury must not be <em>purposely self-inflicted. </em>Yet this court today grafts a third requirement onto the statute: the employee must not have been intoxicated at the time of the injury. This exception is not only unjustified, it also sets a dangerous precedent. After today\u2019s decision, a worker who has an alcoholic beverage with his lunch, returns to the work site and is promptly injured by a careless co-worker may lose eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation due solely to the fact that he had indulged in alcohol, even though such fact has not the remotest connection to his injury. The legislature could never have intended such a bizarre result.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">By ruling as it does today, the majority fails to exercise judicial restraint and indulges in judicial legislation, despite its alleged abhorrence for such practices. See, <em>e.g., Strohofer </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 118, 125-127 (Locher, J., dissenting); <em>Albritton </em>v. <em>Neighborhood Centers Assn. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St. 3d 210, 218 (Holmes, J., dissenting); <em>Balyint </em>v. <em>Arkansas Best Freight System, Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 126, 137 (Wright, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
