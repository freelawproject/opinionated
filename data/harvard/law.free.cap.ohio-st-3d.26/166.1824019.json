For the reasons to follow we hold for the municipality and reverse the appellate court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">The appellate court construed the off-street parking requirements contained in Chapter 923 of the Fire Prevention Code <em>in pari materia </em>with Chapters 711 and 715 of the Zoning Code to prevent enforcement of the Fire Prevention Code. We cannot agree for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">First, Section 711.01(v) defines \u201cZoning Code,\u201d as used in Section 711.05, as follows: \u201c \u2018Zoning code\u2019 means Ordinance 450, passed June 13, 1938, as amended.\u201d While this \u201cZoning Code\u201d definition expressly includes Part Seven of the Codified Ordinances of Gates Mills, it does not include any other ordinance provision. Second, Section 711.02, a provision entitled \u201cInterpretation; Purpose,\u201d indicates \u201c[t]his Zoning Code shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way interfere with any existing provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>sions of law or ordinance * * *.\u201d In short, the Zoning Code indicates it <em>cannot </em>be read <em>in pari materia </em>to abrogate or interfere with any other section of the Gates Mills Codified Ordinances. Because a clear intent was manifested for the Zoning Code to be interpreted separately from the remaining code parts, use of the statutory interpretation doctrine of <em>in pari materia </em>in this case is inappropriate. <em>Cicerella </em>v. <em>Jerusalem Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App. 2d 81 [13 O.O.3d 99]; cf. <em>Brauer </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(App. 1964), 94 Ohio Law Abs. 464, 467 [31 O.O.2d 348].</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Third, at the time of its enactment, Section 923.01 of the Fire Prevention Code was applicable only to \u201cany building or structure designed or intended for institutional, retail business or office use\u201d constructed or altered after the passage of the ordinance. (June 30, 1959.) Section 923.02 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">\u201cWHEN REQUIRED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cAccessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall be determined in conformance with this chapter and shall be provided for as a condition precedent to the occupancy and use of such building or structure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201c(a) Whenever a building or structure is constructed or a new use established * * * [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">\u201c(b) Whenever the use of an existing building or structure is changed to a use requiring more parking facilities, or whenever an existing building is altered and there is an increase in the seating capacity or floor areas of the building or structure * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">In effect, even after passage of Chapter 923, appellee\u2019s restaurant <em>continued to operate lawfully, </em>with only fourteen off-street parking spaces, because this ordinance contained a \u201cgrand-father clause,\u201d Section 923.02, which allowed those operations, which predated this legislation, to continue lawful existence. Thus, appellee\u2019s business was not, as it contended, ever \u201ca valid non-conforming business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Fourth, the term \u201cnonconforming use\u201d is a term of art. This term is employed to designate a use of property which was lawful prior to the enactment of a <em>zoning ordinance </em>and which use may be continued after the effective date of the ordinance even though it does not comply with the applicable use restrictions. R.C. 713.15; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 482 [58 O.O. 325]. Logically then, a permitted use is not a nonconforming use. The use of this building as a restaurant was always, and would still be, a conforming use under the Zoning Code. Since appellee\u2019s building was never a nonconforming use, the Zoning Code use exception provision is clearly inapplicable and the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">Appellee argues \u201cthat it had a vested interest in the right to use its property as a nonconforming use, which right was protected by the Constitution, State Statute, Municipal Ordinance and the Decree of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>mon Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\u201d Although we have resolved appellee\u2019s argument, that the property was a proper nonconforming use, against appellee, an additional observation is appropriate. Both conforming and nonforming uses are subject to ordinances and regulations of a police nature predicated upon protection of the public health, safety, welfare, and general good.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead </em>(1962), 369 U.S. 590; <em>Akron </em>v. <em>Klein </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 207 [12 O.O.2d 331]. An owner of property does not acquire immunity against the exercise, by a municipality, of its police power because such owner began his original operation or use of property in full compliance with existing laws. As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Queenside Hills Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Saxl </em>(1946), 328 U.S. 80, 82-83:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\u201cLittle need be said on the due process question. We are not concerned with the wisdom of this legislation or the need for it. * * * Protection of the safety of persons is one of the traditional uses of the police power of the States. * * * Many types of societal legislation dimmish the value of the property which is regulated. * * * <em>\u201cBut in no case does the owner of the property acquire immunity against exercise of the police power because he constructed it in full compliance with the existing laws. </em>* * * The police power is one of the least limitable of governmental powers, and in its operation often cuts down property rights. * * * <em>The question of validity turns on the power of the legislature to deal with the prescribed class. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Pursuant to R.C. 3781.11, municipalities may require all building repairs and construction to conform to current building codes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such regulatory legislation, enacted pursuant to a state or municipality\u2019s police power, will be enforced so long as such power is not exercised arbitrarily. <em>Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Sebastian </em>(1915), 239 U.S. 394. The specific legislation in this case, Chapter 923, was adjudged to be a \u201cvalid and legal ordinance\u201d by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County in the case of <em>Gates Mills </em>v. <em>McNally-Doyle Restaurants, Inc. </em>(Feb. 3, 1964), Cuyahoga C.P. No. 788040, unreported. Additionally, as noted by this court, in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 93, 96 [20 O.O.3d 88]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201c* * * [Accessory off-street parking requirements * * * are rationally related to several safety hazards which the city may lawfully regulate pursuant to its police powers: protection of pedestrians and drivers, elimination of traffic congestion and reduction of air and noise pollution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Accordingly, this ordinance, enacted pursuant to the proper exercise of appellant municipality\u2019s police powers, is enforceable. Any vested interest which appellee might have had in the right to maintain the use of its property would be subject to such legislation. In <em>Hadacheck, supra, </em>at 410, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cIt is to be remembered that we are dealing with one of the most essential powers of government, one that is the least limitable. It may, indeed, seem harsh in its exercise, usually is on some individual, but the imperative necessity for its existence precludes any limitation upon it when not exerted arbitrarily. A vested interest cannot be asserted against it because of conditions once obtaining. * * * To so hold would preclude development and fix a city forever in its primitive conditions. There must be progress, and if in its march private interests are in the way they must yield to the good of the community.\u201d (Citation deleted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Adoption of appellee\u2019s position would have far-reaching consequences and might nullify or prevent appellant from enforcing other provisions of the Fire Prevention Code, such as the Ohio Fire Code (Chapter 941); plumbing and sewer regulations (Chapters 931-937); the National Electrical Code (Chapter 927); chimney and wall construction requirements (Chapters 915, 919). Based upon the foregoing law and logic we cannot accept appellee\u2019s argument against enforcing the fire regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Finally, appellee argues that the off-street parking issue was litigated in the 1963-1964 action and is thus barred from relitigation by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>We disagree. The village in that action sought an injunction to prevent C.D.S. from expanding the restaurant without complying with off-street parking requirements. Although the present action refers to the same subject matter of off-street parking, the former judgment neither authorized nor prevented C.D.S. from continuing its operation as it existed. That issue was never litigated, and therefore <em>res judicata </em>is not a bar. See <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>McDonough Power Equip., Inc. </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St. 3d 193, 201; <em>Trautwein </em>v. <em>Sorgenfrei </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 493 [12 O.O.3d 403], syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">It is apparent that appellee has no legal basis to support its stance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the cause at bar. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-5\">Celebrezze, C.J., Looker, Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b233-6\">Sweeney and C. Brown, JJ., separately concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\"> The fact that zoning ordinances in this state and elsewhere except preexisting uses of land from the operation of use restrictions can be explained on the basis of constitutional principles. An existing use is said to be the subject of a vested right in the user. As such, to prohibit such use by enforcing subsequently enacted zoning ordinances would amount to the taking of the user\u2019s property without due process of law. <em>Clifton Hills Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>(1938), 60 Ohio App. 443; see, also, <em>Cicerella </em>v. <em>Jerusalem Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1978), 59 Ohio App. 2d 31 [13 O.O.3d 99].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> See <em>Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Sebastian </em>(1915), 239 U.S. 394; <em>Block </em>v. <em>Hirsh </em>(1921), 256 U.S. 135.

Although recognizing, and having sympathetic tendencies toward the equitable approach of the allowance of the operators of the Red Fox Inn Restaurant to resurrect that which has been accidentally altered and to continue its business as before, I must concur with the majority particularly upon the basis of one portion of the majority opinion. The enactment of the Building and Fire Prevention Code (\u201cFire Prevention Code\u201d) is within the most important areas of municipal exercise of its home rule police power. It is vital that the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry be protected through such powers, even if the equitable considerations might appear to be disadvantageous to some of the citizens, as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">However important the zoning regulations of a municipality might be for its appropriate development, where the city laws do not specifically call for the reading of such laws into other sections of the law pertaining to the Fire Prevention Code, such should not be so interpreted. In this regard, as pointed out by the majority, other extremely important provisions of the Fire Prevention Code such as the Ohio Fire Code, the National Electrical Code, the chimney and wall construction requirements, all measures significantly promulgated for the health and safety of the general public, must not be bypassed or excepted in the rebuilding of any facility. The same reasoning must apply to the off-street parking facility requirements that are to serve the newly constructed facility, in that such off-street parking ordinance requirements have not been so enacted for the convenience of the customer patronizing the facility, but have been enacted with the appropriate flow of automobile traffic and emergency vehicular traffic as the reasonable purposes of the legislation, with the end result being the health, safety and welfare of the general public.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b233-9\">Sweeney, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ApJ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. With respect to the issue of res <em>judicata, </em>I agree with the majority opinion that the court of appeals\u2019 judgment in this vein should be sustained. Although the 1963-1964 litigation between the parties concerned off-street parking, the precise issue involved in the cause <em>sub judice </em>has never been litigated, as correctly noted by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Nevertheless, on the basis of equity and fairness, I must dissent from the majority\u2019s disposition of the court of appeals\u2019 reversal of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In this cause, appellee\u2019s building was completely destroyed by fire through no fault of its own. Although the building was nonconforming with respect to the off-street parking ordinances, I do not believe that such an alleged police power regulation should prevent appellee from constructing a replica building, especially since Section 711.05 of appellant municipality\u2019s Zoning Code permits such reconstruction where circumstances, such as a fire, allow the reconstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In my view, the majority\u2019s holding increases the fortuitous hardship that has already befallen the appellee. As noted in Justice Clifford Brown\u2019s dissent, the appellant was content to regard the appellee\u2019s former operation of a restaurant with limited parking as a nonconforming use entitled to continue, because it predated the off-street parking ordinances. Once appellee\u2019s building was destroyed, appellant ignored its prior stance in order to prevent reconstruction of the building. The majority\u2019s assent to the appellant\u2019s inconsistent course of conduct is totally inequitable and patently unfair. I would affirm the court of appeals\u2019 reversal of the summary judgment rendered below.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b234-6\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A93\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition of appellee\u2019s <em>res judicata </em>argument. However, equitable considerations compel me to dissent from today\u2019s decision for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">For over twenty-two years, the appellant village found no reason to take action to compel appellee to conform with the off-street parking regulations contained in Chapter 923 of its Building and Fire Prevention Code. Obviously, appellee would never have had to comply absent the 1982 fire. When appellee\u2019s business was destroyed without appellee\u2019s fault, the village suddenly resurrected the parking regulations as a reason to deny permission to rebuild, thereby working a severe hardship on appellee. From 1959 to 1982, the village was content to regard appellee\u2019s former operation of a restaurant with limited parking as a nonconforming use entitled to continue because it predated the relevant parking regulations. After appellee\u2019s structure burned down, the village abruptly reversed its stance and denied that appellee\u2019s business was ever a nonconforming use entitled to be continued or restored. Unlike the majority, I am not inclined to endorse such a harsh, inconsistent and inequitable course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Such equitable considerations are clearly applicable in this case, since appellee\u2019s complaint prayed for equitable relief in the form of a mandatory injunction ordering defendants to grant the building permit. The equitable maxim \u201cequity aids the vigilant\u201d is particularly relevant to the facts herein. See Clark, Principles of Equity (1919) 35, Section 31. The appellant village has been anything but vigilant in this case. As noted above, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>pellant countenanced appellee\u2019s restaurant as a \u201cnonconforming use\u201d entitled to protection for over twenty-two years. Now that the restaurant has been destroyed, appellant awakens from its slumber and discovers that the restaurant was never a nonconforming use and that it must comply with parking regulations. I do not count the 1964 action as evidence of appellant\u2019s vigilance in this matter, since that action was to prevent appellee from expanding its capacity, not to force appellee to bring its existing operation into compliance with parking regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">I acknowledge that the analysis of the majority is technically correct from a strictly legal standpoint. But its cold disregard of justice and equity calls to mind the words of Charles Dickens: \u201c \u2018If the law supposes <em>that,\u2019 </em>said Mr. Bumble, \u2018the law is a ass, a idiot.\u2019 \u201d Oliver Twist, Chapter 51. It also does violence to the words of the Apostle Paul: \u201cThe letter of the law killeth; the spirit giveth life.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
