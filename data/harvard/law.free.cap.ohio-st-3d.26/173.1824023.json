The appellant argues that neither of the medical reports that formed the basis for the commission\u2019s denial of benefits properly evaluated the <em>combined </em>effect of the appellant\u2019s physical and psychological conditions. The appellant\u2019s argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\u201cWe held in <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra </em>[ (1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166 (16 O.O.3d 199) ], that where the issue before the commission is whether a claimant is permanently and totally disabled on account of the combined effect of two or more allowed conditions, medical testimony not evaluating the combined effect of those conditions can <em>not </em>constitute evidence that the claimant is <em>not </em>permanently and totally disabled. That is still good law, and therefore applies to discrediting the medical reports upon which the commission relied in finding a claimant <em>not </em>permanently and totally disabled.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Thompson, </em>v. <em>Fenix &amp; Scisson, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 76, 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Neither the report of Dr. J.Q. Brown nor the report of Dr. Robert L. Turton, both of which were expressly replied upon by the commission, evaluates the combined effect of the appellant\u2019s medical conditions. Dr. Brown\u2019s report, dated March 20, 1984, is limited to orthopedic evaluation; and, while Dr. Brown recognizes that conditions of \u201cpost traumatic anxiety with strong conversion overlay, schizophrenic like reaction\u201d were previously allowed, he does not expressly or impliedly accept any findings of psychiatric or psychological examiners relating to the appellant\u2019s psychological condition. Dr. Brown expressly addresses only the appellant\u2019s physical impairment and then states that \u201cany additional impairment would have to be the result of [her psychological condition] * * *. She is to see the psychiatrist today.\u201d Dr. Brown thus withholds comment on the appellant\u2019s total impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Dr. Turton\u2019s report, dated March 19, 1984, deals directly with the appellant\u2019s psychological condition, and he adopts the findings of a psychiatrist and psychologist who determined that the appellant\u2019s physical injury \u201chas been an aggravating stress\u201d on her schizophrenic illness. Dr. Turton does not state, however, that he examined the appellant to determine the extent of her physical injury, nor does he adopt the findings of any examining physician that pertain to this injury. A non-examining physician who renders an opinion on the level of a claimant\u2019s impairment must \u201cexpressly adopt the factual findings of one or more examining physicians, which appear in the record, as the basis of his opinion. This rule, as interpreted in <em>State, ex rel. Teece, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 165 [22 O.O. 3d 400], also extends to medical opinions in combined effect claims, where the examining physician only examines for one allowed condition.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 72, 74. Because Dr. Turton\u2019s report does not comply with the foregoing rule, like the report of Dr. Brown, it does not constitute evidence that the appellant is not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We thus are left only with the reports of Dr. Robert Williams and Dr. Allan Korb which were submitted as support for the appellant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Williams\u2019 report, dated July 8, 1975, indicates that he was not a treating physician, and speaks only in general terms of the appellant\u2019s physical and psychological conditions. Dr. Williams\u2019 report is only two paragraphs in length and does not provide any detail regarding either his physical examination or psychological or psychiatric evaluation of the appellant. For these reasons, the reliability of Dr. Williams\u2019 opinion, that the appellant has a \u201c[o]ne hundred percent (100%) total and permanent disability,\u201d is called into question. Dr. Korb\u2019s report, on the other hand, provides a thorough discussion of the appellant\u2019s history, diagnosis, prognosis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>level of impairment. The report, dated February 6, 1984, expressly states that physical, psychological and psychiatric evaluations contained in the record of the appellant\u2019s claim \u201cwere extensively reviewed.\u201d The report then discusses, at great length, the appellant\u2019s psychological condition; and, although Dr. Korb does not detail his findings with regard to the appellant\u2019s physical condition, he adopts the findings in appellant\u2019s prior physical evaluations by his express diagnosis of \u201cchronic lumbosacral strain.\u201d Dr. Korb\u2019s diagnosis further states that the appellant suffers from \u201c[generalized anxiety disorder (Post-Traumatic)\u201d and \u201c[schizophrenia, residual type, chronic, aggravated by [appellant\u2019s physical condition].\u201d In conclusion, Dr. Korb\u2019s report opines that the appellant\u2019s \u201cunfortunate back injury devastated her precarious emotional balance and as a consequence of her combined physical and psychiatric disorders she is permanently and totally disabled. She will require appropriate medical and psychiatric care for an indefinite period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The appellee Industrial Commission contends that Dr. Korb\u2019s report is unreliable because, both prior and subsequent to the date of his report, Dr. Korb submitted to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation \u201cC-19\u201d billing forms on which he (or someone in his employ) had checked boxes indicating that the appellant\u2019s disability was \u201ctemporary total\u201d rather than \u201cpermanent total.\u201d We find that the commission\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">First, the \u201cC-19\u201d form is designated as a \u201cfee bill.\u201d Its purpose is to allow the treating physician to be reimbursed for services rendered \u2014 not to provide a medical record of the claimant\u2019s condition or history, or to state an <em>opinion </em>of the claimant\u2019s level of disability. Second, such forms are often filled out by secretaries or bookkeepers, who simply report the claimant\u2019s legal status (in terms of disability) according to the determination of the bureau. Last, the description of the appellant\u2019s disability on Dr. Korb\u2019s \u201cC-19\u201d forms as \u201ctemporary total\u201d is accurate, because, at the time the forms were submitted, the appellant\u2019s last legally recognized disability was that of \u201ctemporary total\u201d; and, even though Dr. Korb was of the opinion that the appellant had a permanent total disability, it would have been inaccurate to state on his \u201cfee bill\u201d that the appellant\u2019s disability was \u201cpermanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Based on the foregoing, we find that the record that was before the commission \u201ccontains reliable, probative and substantial evidence in accordance with the law to support a factual finding and determination that [the appellant] * * * is permanently and totally disabled, and there is no evidence to the contrary which meets such standards * * <em>State, ex rel. Thompson, </em>v. <em>Fenix &amp; Scisson, Inc., supra, </em>at 81. The commission\u2019s determination that appellant is not permanently and totally disabled therefore is an abuse of discretion, and appellant is entitled to relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed insofar as it is inconsistent with this opinion, the writ prayed for is allowed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the commission is ordered to vacate its denial of appellant\u2019s motion for permanent total disability and to issue an order that appellant is entitled to benefits for permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-4\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney and C.

I dissent because I believe the record of this case supports the Industrial Commission\u2019s disallowance of permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The Industrial Commission based its ruling upon the medical reports of Drs. Robert L. Turton and J. Q. Brown. Dr. Robert L. Turton performed a psychiatric examination of appellant, Riggs, and submitted a report, noting that Riggs\u2019 allowed claims were for \u201c[ajbrasion of the right leg and a lumbosacral back strain, posttraumatic anxiety with a strong conversion overlay.\u201d Dr. Turton also noted that his report concerned \u201c[determination of permanent total impairment and [sic] view of the fact that the claim has been allowed for more than one condition. The totality of claimant\u2019s impairment is requested.\u201d Dr. Turton reviewed Riggs\u2019 medical history, including her treatment for both physical and psychiatric problems. He then expressed his opinion that \u201c* * * the [schizophrenic] illness itself is completely unrelated to the [physical] injury,\u201d but that the physical injury had been an \u201caggravating stress.\u201d Dr. Turton concluded that the \u201ctotality\u201d of Riggs\u2019 impairment was twenty-five to thirty percent. These observations in Dr. Turton\u2019s report reveal that he most certainly was aware that other allowed conditions existed that might potentially influence his conclusions with respect to impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Similarly, Dr. J. Q. Brown noted in his report that Riggs had an allowed psychiatric condition in addition to the physical condition concerning which Dr. Brown had examined Riggs. Dr. Brown did not \u201c* * * consider * * * [Riggs] to be permanently and totally imparied [sic] but only to have a partial impairment of low degree 10%.\u201d He noted that \u201c* * * any additional impairment would have to be the result of the post traumatic anxiety with strong conversion overlay of schizophrenic like reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The majority refers to this court\u2019s previous requirement that an examining physician who only examines a claimant for one allowed condition must \u201cexpressly adopt\u201d the findings of one or more physicians who examined the claimant with regard to the other allowed conditions. See <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 72. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>evidence relied upon by the majority to support the issuance of the writ does <em>not, </em>however, satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The majority analyzes Dr. Robert Williams\u2019 report and determines that its reliability is \u201ccalled into question.\u201d In doing so the majority is weighing the evidence, in contravention of this court\u2019s longstanding \u201csome evidence\u201d rule. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Hudson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St. 3d 169; <em>State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 396 [23 O.O.3d 358]. The majority then relies on the medical report of Dr. Allan Korb. Dr. Korb, who specializes in psychiatry, not orthopedics, indicated a diagnosis of \u201c[c]hronic lumbosacral strain,\u201d despite the fact that he only examined claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition. Dr. Korb did <em>not </em>expressly adopt the findings of any doctor who examined claimant\u2019s physiological condition; such adoption can only be implied from his stated diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Both of these doctors were obviously aware that Riggs complained of another condition that was outside that doctor\u2019s particular field of medical expertise and which could influence the commission\u2019s ultimate decision as to disability. Each doctor referred to all of the allowed conditions in his report. Each of these reports provides evidence that the commission is entitled to consider and rely upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">This court should not approach the record of this case on a <em>de novo </em>basis, using unrealistic evidentiary rules to exclude evidence the Industrial Commission has deemed credible and relevant. I respectfully suggest that the majority has simply substituted its judgment for that of the commission by rejecting the evidence that the commission deemed credible and relevant, and by weighing the credibility of other evidence that had been rejected by the commission. Certainly, some evidence existed to support the commission\u2019s findings. Clearly, the appellant has not demonstrated that the commission abused its discretion, nor has she shown that she has a clear legal right to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-8\">Locher and Holmes, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
