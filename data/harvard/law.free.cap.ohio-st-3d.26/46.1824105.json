The anniversary date of his employment for the purpose of computing the amount of his vacation leave, unless deferred pursuant to the appropriate law, ordinance, or regulation, is the anniversary date of such prior service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Because municipalities are political subdivisions of the state, this provision applies to municipal employees who have previously worked for the state or for any subdivision. The controversy in the case at bar stems from the last sentence of R.C. 9.44: \u201cThe anniversary date of his employment for the purpose of computing the amount of his vacation leave, unless deferred pursuant to the appropriate law, ordinance, or regulation, is the anniversary date of such prior service.\u201d The city argues that, pursuant to this language, it avoided the application of R.C. 9.44 by enacting Sylvania Codified Ordinances 139.07(a) and 139.04(d). The ordinances provide that city employees\u2019 vacation leave be based upon each employee\u2019s period of continuous service with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The city argues that it is entitled to regulate the vacation leave of its employees pursuant to its powers of local self-government under Sections 3 and 7, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. State law must govern, however, when a statute addresses a matter of general and statewide concern in an area otherwise subject to municipal regulation. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Evans, </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 88 [23 O.O.3d 145]. Further, the constitutional home-rule powers of municipalities are subject to the requirement that municipal regulations \u201cnot [be] in conflict with general laws.\u201d Section 3, Article XVIII. In <em>State, ex rel. Villari, </em>v. <em>Bedford Hts. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 222, 225, this court held that R.C. 9.44 addresses a matter of general and statewide concern. The court stated, however, that \u201ca municipality may avoid application of R.C. 9.44 by appropriate legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We are now required to determine whether this statement in <em>Villari </em>accurately construes the language of R.C. 9.44 and, if so, whether Sylvania properly avoided application of the statute by enacting Ordinances 139.07(a) and 139.04(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Under R.C. 9.44, a municipal employee\u2019s \u201canniversary date\u201d for purposes of computing vacation leave, \u201cunless deferred pursuant to the appropriate law,\u201d is the anniversary date of his prior service. We decline to adopt the city\u2019s interpretation of this language that R.C. 9.44 may be avoided entirely. The word \u201cdefer\u201d is not equivalent to \u201cavoid.\u201d Also, the statute only allows deferral of an \u201canniversary date.\u201d The legislature could have provided in straightforward language for political subdivisions to completely circumvent R.C. 9.44. It did not do so and we will not stretch the language of the statute to give it this effect. We, therefore, reject the statement noted above in <em>Villari, supra, </em>at 225, which implies such a construction of R.C. 9.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A public employee\u2019s claim for wages or benefits that are granted by statute or ordinance is actionable in mandamus. <em>Villari, supra; State, ex rel. Bossa, </em>v. <em>Giles </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 273 [18 O.O.3d 461], The writ is properly issued when the right to relief is clear and the amount can be established with certainty. <em>Villari, supra, </em>at 224. We hold that the officers\u2019 right to relief is clear because, in R.C. 9.44, the language \u201c[t]he anniversary date of his employment for the purpose of computing the amount of his vacation leave, unless deferred pursuant to the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>law, ordinance, or regulation, is the anniversary date of such prior service\u201d does not enable political subdivisions of the state to entirely avoid the statutory provision in R.C. 9.44 for vacation leave credits attributable to prior public employment. Because the city admitted the length of prior service of each officer, the amount of vacation leave attributable to such service is ascertainable with certainty. Therefore, we affirm the issuance of the writ and order the city to credit the officers with vacation leave attributable to prior public employment in accordance with R.C. 9.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-5\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, C.

In <em>State, ex rel. Canada, </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 191 [5 O.O.2d 481], this court observed in paragraph seven of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201cWhere a municipality establishes and operates a police department, it may do so as an exercise of the powers of local self-government conferred upon it by Sections 3 and 7 of Article XVIII of the Constitution; and, if it does, the mere interest or concern of the state, which may justify the state in providing similar police protection, will not justify the state\u2019s interference with such exercise by a municipality of its powers of local self-government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The establishment and operation of a police department is therefore well within the ambit of local municipal control.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">In <em>Benevolent Assn. </em>v. <em>Parma </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 375 [15 O.O.3d 450], this court indicated that a state statute compelling a municipality to pay city employees their full salaries while on military leave was in conflict with a local ordinance which specified that only the difference between the city and the military salary would be paid. In resolving this conflict we noted at 378 that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that an ordinance, similar to the one at bar, if enacted by a chartered municipality, would prevail over the state law irrespective of any conflict. <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Akron </em>* * * [(1962), 116 Ohio App. 417 (22 O.O.2d 251)].\u201d We held in <em>Benevolent Assn, </em>that any such conflict would also be resolved in favor of a non-charter municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">I believe the conflict at bar can only be resolved in favor of Sylvania because this court has articulated that the establishment and operation of a police department is an exercise of municipal self-government as delineated in Ohio\u2019s Constitution with respect to home-rule powers. See <em>State, ex rel. Canada, supra. </em>Where local ordinance and state statute conflict in matters of local self-governmental concern, the municipal ordinance should prevail. Accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-12\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
