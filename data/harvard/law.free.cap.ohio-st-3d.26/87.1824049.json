We must decide whether State Farm was also required to offer underinsured motorist coverage with the March 15 policy, thereby treating Hoskins as an \u201capplicant for new automobile or motor vehicle liability insurance,\u201d when he paid the renewal amount. We answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">R.C. 3937.181(B) required insurers to allow their insureds to accept or reject underinsured motorist coverage at the first opportunity. Such coverage was to be offered to each new applicant and also at the initial renewal if the insured did not have the coverage. An insurer was not required to re-offer the coverage after the insured had rejected these initial opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Hoskins had previously rejected State Farm\u2019s offer of underinsured motorist coverage. When he paid the amount due on his renewal notice, he did not submit a new application for insurance. State Farm simply reinstated Hoskins\u2019 coverage with the same limits. Under these circumstances, Hoskins was not an \u201capplicant for new automobile or motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 3937.181. State Farm was not required to offer underinsured motorist coverage when it reinstated Hoskins\u2019 coverage on March 15. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-6\">Locher, Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b151-7\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b151-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b151-9\">Sweeney and C.

I find the analysis of the court of appeals and Justice Brown\u2019s discussion concerning the operation of former R.C. 3937.181(B) to be consistent with our exemplary decision in <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Pioneer Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 161 [51 O.O.2d 229].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, for the reasons which follow, I believe a remand is appropriate in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>R.C. 3937.31 provides a mandatory two-year motor vehicle insurance policy renewal period. For a policy cancellation to be effective, R.C. 3937.32 requires the insurer to provide at least a ten-day written notice of cancellation where the reason for cancellation is nonpayment of a premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In considering coverage under a \u201clapsed\u201d insurance policy which was to have been effective in 1978-1979, this court held in <em>DeBose </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 65, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cIn order to terminate an automobile insurance policy for nonpayment of premiums and within the mandatory renewal period set forth in R.C. 3937.31, the issuer of the policy must send, pursuant to R.C. 3937.30 <em>et seq., </em>a notice of cancellation to the policyholder. <em>(Morey </em>v. <em>Educator &amp; Executive Insurers, </em>45 Ohio St. 2d 196 [74 O.O.2d 305], overruled.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Based on the court\u2019s former holding contra in the 1976 <em>Morey </em>case, which was not overruled until 1983 in <em>DeBose, </em>it is conceivable that State Farm may not have sent the required notice of cancellation upon appellee\u2019s nonpayment. The record is silent on this point. If this actually happened, the old insurance policy would not have terminated. <em>DeBose, </em>at 67. See, also, 43 American Jurisprudence 2d (1982) 947, Insurance, Section 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Similarly, <em>if the </em>replacement policy contained in the record is the same as the original policy, the terms specifically provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that the insurer \u201cmay cancel this policy by written notice, mailed to <em>you\u201d; </em>that \u201c[t]he mailing of it shall be sufficient\u201d; and that the notice will be mailed \u201cat least: * * * 10 days before the cancellation date if the cancellation: (1) is because <em>you </em>did not pay the premium when due.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Again, it can not be determined from the record if this 1981 policy is the same as the older policy. However, if the contract terms are consistent, the insurer\u2019s failure to act (send ten-day notice) is essential and a policy forfeiture (cancellation) for mere nonpayment of the premium on the day named would not have occurred. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>French </em>(1876), 30 Ohio St. 240; 43 American Jurisprudence 2d (1982) 945, Insurance, Section 912. Even if the policies are not the same, the directing statutes, R.C. 3937.30 <em>et seq., </em>would command the same result. <em>DeBose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Although the litigants agree that there was a gap in coverage because of nonpayment, resolution of such legal conclusions rests upon the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>uninfluenced by stipulations of the parties relative to the determination of such questions of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Accordingly, if State Farm did not provide notice of cancellation as required by law, the policy would not have terminated, coverage would be continuous, and there would not have been a <em>new </em>policy issued in March 1981. This fact can not be determined from the record and therefore its absence precludes the granting of summary judgment favorable to appellee, absent an agreement or demonstration that State Farm did serve the mandatory notice of cancellation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\"> To add further confusion, three members of the majority concluded last year in <em>Benson v. Rosler </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 41, that automobile insurance policy renewals, following conclusion of the first period of coverage, <em>\u201c* </em>* * when written for specific [six-month] periods, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>may be considered term policies rather than continuing policies.\u201d Hence, \u201c* * * at the expiration of the six-month period with the company\u2019s subsequent acceptance of the premiums, there was a new contract of insurance coverage entered into by the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44. Inconsistently, today\u2019s majority concludes that such a renewal does not constitute a new policy but rather is a continuation of the original policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> In <em>Gittings </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1853), 2 Ohio St. 21, we long ago recognized that although parties are free to stipulate \u201cthat certain facts exist\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 23), they can not \u201crequire the court to give an effect to a written contract, other than its legal import\u201d nor can they \u201crequire the court to draw other than the legal and natural conclusion from given premises\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 24). See, also, 73 American Jurisprudence 2d (1974) 539, Stipulations, Section 5, and 50 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d (1961) 354, Stipulations, Section 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-5\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">dissenting. Today the majority takes another whack at insurers\u2019 statutory obligation to offer underinsured motorist coverage with each application for automobile insurance coverage. I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The parties agree that appellee Hoskins obtained an automobile insurance policy from appellant State Farm at some time prior to September 1, 1980. The parties have also agreed, for purposes of this appeal, that State Farm offered underinsured motorist coverage to Hoskins at the first policy renewal after September 1, 1980, as required by R.C. 3937.181(B), effective June 25, 1980, and that Hoskins rejected such coverage <em>at that time. </em>However, as the parties also agree, Hoskins\u2019 insurance policy lapsed, and he had <em>no coverage </em>from February 13, 1981 to March 15, 1981, when, in response to Hoskins\u2019 tender of payment, State Farm issued him a new policy with a new policy number.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Under then-effective R.C. 3937.181(B), as correctly quoted by the majority, if Hoskins was an \u201capplicant for new * * * insurance\u201d as to the policy issued by State Farm on March 15, 1981, then the clear terms of this statute required State Farm to affirmatively offer underinsured motorist coverage to Hoskins as to that new policy, and its failure to do so would result in coverage as a matter of law. See <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Pioneer Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 161 [51 O.O.2d 229].</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The undisputed facts of this case compel the conclusion that Hoskins was such an applicant as to the March 1981 policy. The prior policy apparently did not provide any grace period during which a late payment could result in continuous coverage. Not only was the policy issued after a <em>total </em>lapse in coverage, but State Farm had absolutely no obligation to issue the policy simply because Hoskins had tendered such a late payment. The majority\u2019s observation that no formal application was required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>State Farm prior to issuance of the new policy is irrelevant. Rather, as the court of appeals below observed in its well-reasoned opinion, State Farm\u2019s own operations superintendent, Gordon Carlson, admitted by affidavit that \u201csince Mr. Hoskins\u2019 <em>payment was received after the deadline for continuous coverage, </em>a <em>new policy </em>was issued for the policy period from March 15, 1981 * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In my view, the only reasonable conclusion on those facts, under the applicable statutory language, is that Hoskins was clearly an \u201capplicant\u201d as to the policy State Farm issued in March 1981, because absolutely no policy was in effect at the time of the premium payment tendered by Hoskins, such that the March 1981 policy could reasonably be considered a \u201crenewal\u201d of earlier coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-6\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
