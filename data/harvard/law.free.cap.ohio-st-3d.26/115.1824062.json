Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 16 [58 O.O.2d 70]. The commission abuses its discretion when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>there is \u201cno evidence\u201d to support its factual conclusion. <em>State, ex rel. Hutton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 9 [58 O.O.2d 66], syllabus. Thus, the issue in this case is whether there was some evidence in the commission\u2019s file to support its factual conclusion that appellant was not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The commission based its factual conclusion on the medical reports of Drs. McCloud, Turton, Hardie and Davies.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The McCloud and Turton Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166, 168 [16 O.O.3d 199], the court held that the commission, when determining whether a claimant is permanently and totally disabled, cannot admit an examining physician\u2019s report as evidence where the examining physician has not evaluated the combined effect of all conditions for which workers\u2019 compensation benefits have been allowed. The commission abused its discretion by admitting the reports of Drs. McCloud and Turton as evidence since neither evaluated the combined effect of appellant\u2019s physical and psychiatric conditions. Dr. McCloud did not evaluate the effect of appellant\u2019s psychiatric impairment and Dr. Turton did not evaluate the effect of appellant\u2019s orthopedic impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The Hardie Report</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55, 59 [11 O.O.3d 216], the court held that the commission cannot admit a non-examining physician\u2019s report as evidence where the non-examining physician did not expressly adopt the factual findings of an examining physician as the basis for his opinion. The commission abused its discretion by admitting the report of Dr. Hardie, a non-examining physician, as evidence since Dr. Hardie did not expressly adopt the factual findings of an examining physician as the basis for his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The Davies Report</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">In <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Ohio Brass Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 147, the court noted that the terms \u201cimpairment\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d as used by the commission are not synonymous. \u201cImpairment\u201d is a medical term measuring the amount of the claimant\u2019s anatomical and/or mental loss of function as a result of an injury or occupational disease. \u201cDisability\u201d is a legal term indicating the effect that the medical impairment has on the claimant\u2019s ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">A doctor\u2019s opinion as to the degree of a claimant\u2019s bodily or mental <em>impairment </em>affords no basis upon which the commission can predicate a determination of the degree of <em>disability. State, ex rel. Morris, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 38. Since Dr. Davies\u2019 report dealt only with the degree of appellant\u2019s physical and psychiatric <em>impairment, </em>the commission abused its discretion by considering it as evidence of appellant\u2019s <em>disability. </em>There was no competent, credible evidence in the record con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>cerning appellant\u2019s <em>disability, </em>and the commission, therefore, had no evidence to support its factual conclusion that appellant was not entitled to permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals in issuing a writ of mandamus is hereby affirmed. Furthermore, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 instructions that the commission shall \u201cvacate its order * * * and * * * reexamine the evidence and issues and enter a new order determining whether * * * [appellant] is permanently and totally disabled, predicated upon the controlling issue [disability] and appropriate evidence considering the combined effects of the allowed [physical and psychiatric] conditions upon * * * [appellant\u2019s] ability to work, and to set forth briefly the reason for such determination and the evidence relied upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b180-6\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b180-7\">Locher, J., concurs with opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b180-8\">Wright, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b180-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., and C.

I concur with today\u2019s result. I do so because, in this instance, the grant of a \u201climited writ\u201d serves judicial economy. Had we rejected the writ completely, a subsequent writ regarding the relief we now provide would ultimately be granted. In future cases, however, it should be noted that ordinarily <em>only </em>the relief requested should be either denied or granted. Until we adopt clear guidelines on this issue, I am satisfied, at present, in concurring in the <em>per curiam </em>judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b180-11\">Celebrezze, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFD\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the majority\u2019s determination that pursuant to our holdings in <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166 [16 O.O.3d 199], <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55 [11 O.O.3d 216], and <em>State, ex rel. Morris, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 38, the commission\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s claim for permanent total disability benefits was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to grant only a limited writ of mandamus in this case. Appellant put forth reliable, probative and substantial .evidence in support of her claim for permanent total disability benefits and the issue in this case, properly framed, is whether the commission\u2019s evidence to the contrary met such standards. <em>State, ex rel. Thompson, </em>v. <em>Fenix &amp; Scisson, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 76, syllabus. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>view of the complete lack of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support the commission\u2019s determination to deny appellant\u2019s claim, a full writ ordering a finding that appellant was permanently and totally disabled should have issued pursuant to <em>Thompson, supra.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b181-4\">C. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b181-5\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbR\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. The majority correctly concludes that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d upon which the Industrial Commission could have properly based its denial of permanent total disability benefits. This is clearly true. However, the majority then proceeds to grant only a <em>limited writ </em>directing the commission to issue an order evaluating the effect of appellant\u2019s medical impairment upon her ability to engage in sustained remunerative employment. This is clearly <em>incorrect </em>for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">This court has recently held that where there is no evidence upon which the commission could have based its denial of permanent total disability benefits, such denial constitutes an abuse of discretion for which the claimant will be afforded relief in mandamus. <em>State, ex rel. Thompson, </em>v. <em>Fenix &amp; Scisson, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 76, syllabus. In <em>Thompson, </em>this court found such an abuse of discretion and issued a full writ directing the commission to find claimant permanently and totally disabled. I see no basis whatsoever for the \u201climited writ\u201d granted herein. Under <em>Thompson, </em>appellant in this cause is entitled to the issuance of a full writ ordering a finding that she is permanently and totally disabled. This is the relief prayed for in appellant\u2019s complaint. This is the relief to which she is entitled. See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Morris, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 38.</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
