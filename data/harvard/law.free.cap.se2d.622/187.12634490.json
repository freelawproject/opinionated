Defendant contends on appeal the trial court erred in concluding that she committed fraud or unfair and deceptive practices. Plaintiffs also appeal, arguing the trial court failed to award appropriate attorneys' fees. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment and order of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs presented evidence at trial tending to show the following, as found by the trial court: On or about 2 May 2000, plaintiffs read an advertising circular featuring for sale property owned by defendant in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Plaintiffs subsequently viewed the property, an estate of approximately twenty-two acres of land with a large house, known as \"Deverill,\" and received marketing material advertising Deverill as \"peaceful\" and \"serene.\" Plaintiffs subsequently met with defendant at Deverill and informed her of their desire to have a rural setting in which to raise their four small children. Defendant had been raised at Deverill and had resided on property adjacent to Deverill for more than forty years. Defendant had purchased Deverill only two months earlier at a partition proceeding for $685,000.00. She informed plaintiffs that Deverill was suitable for raising children and told them stories of her own upbringing on the property to encourage their belief as to the property's suitability. Defendant never informed plaintiffs that Deverill was not, in fact, peaceful or serene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In reliance upon defendant's representations concerning Deverill, including her description of the property as peaceful and serene, plaintiffs executed two purchase agreements with defendant: One for the house and surrounding eight acres at a purchase price of $700,000.00, and the other for the remaining approximately fourteen acres at a purchase price of $238,165.00. The contracts provided that plaintiffs would be excused from closing on the property if they were unable to sell their existing residence by 30 August 2000. The contracts also provided plaintiffs the right to inspect the property and to walk away from the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During an inspection of the property on 1 July 2000, plaintiffs encountered defendant's niece, Sherry Langevin (\"Langevin\"). Langevin had resided on property adjacent to Deverill since 1987. During their conversation, Langevin mentioned that there had been problems with \"kids coming onto the property after high school football games around Halloween.\" Stephan subsequently telephoned defendant and specifically inquired whether Deverill suffered from a trespass problem. Defendant denied any trespass problem existed, and stated that such incidents had only happened once or twice. Defendant told Stephan that Langevin often exaggerated, and that her statement about the trespassing was one such example.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs were unable to sell their home by 30 August 2000. They did not elect to terminate their contract, however, as was their right, and eventually closed on the purchase of Deverill on 29 September 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly after moving into their new home, plaintiffs discovered that Deverill suffered from a material, long-standing, and year-round problem with trespass and vandalism. Over the ensuing two years, plaintiffs experienced frequent incidents of trespass and vandalism. Plaintiffs lost numerous items of personal property due to theft, suffered suspected arson at one of their buildings, were\n   verbally accosted in their own yard, and had windows and lights shot out with guns. Stephan was physically assaulted. These incidents caused plaintiffs to develop a \"siege mentality\" which materially altered their lifestyle. In response to the trespass and vandalism problems, plaintiffs installed a new gate at the entrance of their driveway, a home security system, and a security fence around a portion of the perimeter of their home. For cost reasons, plaintiffs did not fully encircle their home or the entire twenty-two acres of property. The security measures taken by plaintiffs, however, failed to eliminate the trespass and vandalism problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stephan wrote to defendant in March 2001 concerning her failure to inform plaintiffs of the trespass problems associated with Deverill and asked that she participate in appropriate security measures. Defendant responded to the letter by having her attorney meet with Stephan, through whom defendant denied knowledge of the problem and informed him that the rule of\n   <em>\n    caveat emptor\n   </em>\n   absolved her of responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court found that defendant was aware of the scope and severity of the trespass and vandalism problems at Deverill, but purposely withheld this information from plaintiffs. In response to plaintiffs' specific inquiry, defendant denied the existence of any trespassing problem and represented Deverill as peaceful and serene, although she knew these representations were false. Further, defendant \"engaged in an artifice intended to discourage [plaintiffs] from making further inquiry about [the trespass and vandalism problems] by discrediting the Langevins. . . .\" The trial court also found that \"there were not sufficient indicia of trespass and vandalism problems visible on or adjacent to Deverill in 2000 to have put reasonable persons in [plaintiffs'] position on notice of the pervasive trespass problems associated with the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court concluded that defendant's conduct constituted fraud and unfair and deceptive practices and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of $322,753.59. The trial court also awarded reasonable attorneys' fees in the amount of $55,000.00 and costs of $3,284.18. Defendant and plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I. Defendant's Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred in concluding that she committed fraud. Specifically, defendant contends plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they were denied the opportunity to investigate the property, or that they could not have discovered the trespass and vandalism problem through the exercise of due diligence. We find no merit to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"`It is well settled in this jurisdiction that when the trial court sits without a jury, the standard of review on appeal is whether there was competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact and whether its conclusions of law were proper in light of such facts.'\"\n   <em>\n    Keel v.

Plaintiffs' Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to award more than $55,000.00 in attorneys' fees. The trial court found that \"the time spent by plaintiffs' counsel in the prosecution of this matter was reasonably warranted by the complexity of the case, the scope of the harm suffered by the [plaintiffs] and the defendant's refusal to resolve the matter before trial.\" The trial\n   court also found that \"[p]laintiffs' counsel were experienced lawyers within the community, and the hourly rates they and their staff charged were reasonable both in the context of their levels of experience and in relation to their peers.\" Plaintiffs' attorneys submitted affidavits showing the reasonable value of the legal services rendered to plaintiffs to be $112,869.50. Given that the trial court found that (1) the time and (2) the hourly rates by plaintiffs' attorneys were both reasonable, plaintiffs argue the trial court abused its discretion by failing to award any amount less than the sum of these two factors (in this case, $112,869.50). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   \"[e]ven if the requirements are met, an award of attorney's fees under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-16.1 is in the trial court's discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8528002\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/114/777/#p781\">\n    114 N.C.App. at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20S.E.2d%20108\">\n    443 S.E.2d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even where the trial court finds that the plaintiff is the prevailing party, and the defendant willfully engaged in unfair and deceptive practices and made an unwarranted refusal to resolve the matter, the trial court may still, in its discretion, refuse to award attorneys' fees. Given that the trial court may refuse to award any attorneys' fees, we cannot say that the decision to award approximately half of the amount requested by plaintiffs' attorneys constitutes an abuse of discretion, manifestly unsupported by reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20S.E.2d%20108\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We conclude there is no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its award of attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs have also requested attorneys' fees incurred during this appeal. \"`Upon a finding that [appellees] were entitled to attorney's fees in obtaining their judgment [under N.C.
