Allen Mullinix (\"Allen\") and Karl Mullinix (\"Karl\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\") appeal from an order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant Goldia M. Mabry (\"Goldia\") and husband Scott Mabry (\"Scott\") (collectively \"defendants\"). Plaintiffs present the following issues for our consideration: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to sue defendants, and (2) whether plaintiffs' action for constructive fraud is barred by the statute of limitations. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse the grant of summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claims against defendant Goldia, and affirm the grant of summary judgment as to defendant Scott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The evidence tends to show that Mrs. Irene Allen Mullinix (\"decedent\") was the mother of Allen, Karl, and Goldia. Decedent, who was widowed in 1967, lived near Goldia, who interacted with her on a daily basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Decedent possessed several accounts through the State Employees' Credit Union (\"SECU\") and also purchased certificates of deposit (\"CDs\") throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Goldia assisted decedent with various banking transactions, but did not personally deposit funds into any of decedent's accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1986, Goldia discussed with decedent Goldia's plans to lower her retirement annuity investment from the maximum contribution she had withheld by payroll, due to increased expenses from further educational endeavors by both Goldia and Goldia's son. Goldia stated that decedent instructed Goldia not to lower the retirement investment, and began writing $400.00 checks monthly to Goldia marked as \"investment\" or \"annuity.\" Plaintiffs allege that decedent's payments to Goldia were to invest in an annuity for the benefit of decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1989, decedent granted Goldia a general power of attorney. Goldia used the power of attorney, at the request of decedent, to set up a CD at the Albemarle SECU in the same manner as previous CDs taken out by decedent which named Goldia as beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1990, Allen suggested that decedent needed a will, after learning about the CDs listing Goldia as beneficiary and certain debts owed to decedent by Goldia and Karl. Decedent later executed a will distributing half of her estate to Goldia, and one-quarter to Karl and Allen respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around 1993, decedent began showing early symptoms of dementia. Decedent's dementia became more apparent in 1995 when she began to not recognize Allen, and her short-term memory grew progressively worse in the following years. In 1999, decedent lost her checkbook at a salon. Goldia stated that she transferred $12,000.00 from decedent's account into Goldia's personal account, due to concerns about someone draining decedent's account with stolen checks. Goldia later put the $12,000.00 in a CD in Goldia's name only. Goldia stated that decedent told her on multiple occasions to treat the accounts as Goldia's own, and that she wanted defendants to have the CDs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Decedent died testate on 5 December 2000. The will appointed Goldia executrix, and a preliminary inventory of the estate showed a value of $4,307.04. Goldia contends that decedent wanted the will division to be from personal and real property, but that the estate did not include the joint bank accounts that Goldia claimed through right of survivorship. Allen recalls decedent bragging to him in the mid 1980s of having saved over $40,000.00, but plaintiffs had no direct knowledge of decedent's actual financial situation until the estate was inventoried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants on 14 December 2001, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, actual fraud, and conversion. On 23 January 2004, defendants filed an amended motion for summary judgment. After a hearing on 9 February 2004, the trial judge entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants as to all claims on 18 February 2004. Plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The appeal from summary judgment is based on two issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing against defendants; and (2) whether the claim of constructive fraud against defendants is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The standard of review for summary judgment is \"'whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'\"\n   <em>\n    Satorre v.

Plaintiffs, therefore, have standing as decedent's heirs to bring the action as successors to the rights of decedent. Furthermore, because the claim of constructive fraud arises from pre-estate assets, plaintiffs did not fail to join a necessary party, Goldia in her official capacity as the executor of the estate, to the action. As plaintiffs are real parties in interest and may properly bring an action for constructive fraud occurring prior to decedent's death, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants also contend that plaintiffs lack standing as Goldia was a joint account holder with decedent on several accounts. Defendants argue that funds in those accounts would vest in Goldia through right of survivorship and would not be part of the estate, depriving plaintiffs of any interest in the funds. We disagree, as a material issue of fact exists as to the status of the accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"In North Carolina, joint property subject to a right of survivorship is not part of a decedent's estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Stat. \u00a7 41-2.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, the record does not contain conclusive evidence as to which of decedent's accounts, if any, Goldia was a joint holder with right of survivorship. A material issue of fact exists as to whether decedent's various accounts were a part of her estate, and defendants are, therefore, not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs are heirs under decedent's will succeeding to her interests, and may bring claims arising from alleged fraudulent actions against decedent by Goldia occurring prior to decedent's death.
