Defendant was convicted of having attained the status of being an habitual felon. We find no error in part, vacate in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant, a detainee at the Pitt County Detention Center in Greenville, North Carolina, was cleaning the center's common area when he was told to return to his cell. Defendant became frustrated, clogged his toilet, and flooded his cell. To prevent further flooding, Detention Officer Steven E. McKinney, (\"Officer McKinney\") turned off the water in defendant's cell. Defendant told Officer McKinney that he was going to \"get\" him when he had the opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later in the day, Officer McKinney served lunch to the detainees, including defendant, through a small door which meal trays were passed. A detainee assisted Officer McKinney by distributing drinks. The drinks available to the detainees included water, milk, tea, and orange juice. The State's evidence tends to show defendant forcefully threw urine through the small door at Officer McKinney before defendant received his drink. Officer McKinney testified that he could tell the liquid was urine because of its distinct smell and warm temperature. Defendant maintains he threw tea at Officer McKinney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer McKinney immediately asked to be relieved of his duties to remove his clothes and clean himself. The State did not present Officer Mckinney's uniform into evidence. He testified that it was standard procedure in the Pitt County Sheriff's Department to immediately wash any uniforms stained by bodily fluids. Officer McKinney reported the incident, but he did not include the names of the inmates who had assisted him while handing out the meals, and he could not remember their names at trial. No other witnesses testified to the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 13 October 2004, defendant was tried by a jury and found to be guilty of malicious conduct by a prisoner and assault on a government employee which resulted in a conviction for habitual misdemeanor assault. Defendant was sentenced as an habitual felon to an active sentence of a minimum of 168 months and a maximum of 211 months of confinement for his conviction of malicious conduct by a prisoner, such sentence to run at the expiration of the sentence imposed in 03 CRS 58379. For the crime of misdemeanor\n   assault, defendant was sentenced as an habitual felon to a consolidated term of imprisonment of a minimum of 151 months and a maximum of 191 months confinement, such sentence to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for defendant's habitual felon conviction of malicious conduct by a prisoner to commence at the expiration of the sentence imposed in 03 CRS 58379. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant argues: (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the trial of a charge of malicious conduct by a prisoner when the indictment did not allege that defendant was in custody; (2) the trial court cannot enter judgment for both malicious conduct by a prisoner and habitual misdemeanor assault when identical conduct was alleged to establish both malicious conduct by a prisoner and the current misdemeanor assault of a government employee; (3) the trial court cannot sentence defendant as an habitual felon without a jury's determination of habitual felon status or express waiver of jury determination and admission of habitual felon status by defendant himself; and (4) a stipulation by defense counsel that defendant had been convicted of the prior misdemeanors alleged in an indictment charging habitual misdemeanor assault is not sufficient to establish the prior conviction element of that charge without submission of that element for determination by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    III. Allegations in the Indictment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Concerning the allegations in the indictment, defendant argues the trial court: (1) did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the trial of a charge of malicious conduct by a prisoner when the indictment did not allege that defendant was in custody; and (2) cannot enter judgment for both malicious conduct by a prisoner and habitual misdemeanor assault when identical conduct was alleged to establish both malicious conduct by a prisoner and the current misdemeanor assault of a government employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    A.

This Court also stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   the legislature apparently intended to address a different problem with each offense. Assaults on government officials have been criminalized to punish, and prevent, attacks against government officials trying to perform public duties. Quite differently, the criminalization of malicious conduct by a prisoner is directed at deterring and punishing the projecting of bodily fluids or excrement at governmental employees by those in custody, whether or not such misconduct amounts to an assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The entry of judgment on habitual misdemeanor assault and the underlying offense of assault on a government employee and malicious conduct by a prisoner contains separate elements.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant did not object to his sentencing as an habitual felon at trial. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1446(d)(16) provides, \"[e]rrors based upon any of the following grounds, which are asserted to have occurred, may be the subject of appellate review even though no objection, exception or motion has been made in the trial division . . . (16) Error occurred in the entry of the plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The judgments regarding malicious conduct by a prisoner as a habitual felon and habitual misdemeanor assault as an habitual felon indicate that defendant pled guilty to habitual felon status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1022(a)(1)-(4) (2003) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (a) Except in the case of corporations or in misdemeanor cases in which there is a waiver of appearance under G.S. 15A-1011(a)(3), a superior court judge may not accept a plea of guilty or no contest from the defendant without first addressing him personally and:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (1) Informing him that he has a right to remain silent and that any statement he makes may be used against him;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (2) Determining that he understands the nature of the charge;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (3) Informing him that he has a right to plead not guilty;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (4) Informing him that by his plea he waives his right to trial by jury and his right to be confronted by the witnesses against him. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The State admits that the transcript includes no such inquiry of defendant and no plea agreement exists in the record on appeal. The only dialogue between the trial court and defendant in the transcript concerning his status as an habitual felon occurred when the court asked him, \"What do you have to say?\" and he responded, \"What I say doesn't matter in this courthouse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although Defendant did stipulate to his habitual felon status, such stipulation, in the absence of an inquiry by the trial court to establish a record of a guilty plea, is not tantamount to a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9441739\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/142/465/#p471\">\n    142 N.C.App. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=542%20S.E.2d%20694\">\n    542 S.E.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699 (2001) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Here, the inquiry by the trial court failed to satisfy the requirements of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1022(a). The trial court did not: (1) determine that defendant understood the nature of the habitual felon charge; (2) inform defendant of his right to deny habitual felon status; or (3) inform defendant that his admission of attaining habitual felon status would waive his right to jury determination of that issue. The record on appeal does not contain a plea transcript of defendant's guilty plea. Defendant's habitual felon conviction is vacated. We remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    V. Habitual Misdemeanor Assault\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues that a stipulation by defense counsel that he has been convicted\n   of the prior misdemeanors alleged in an indictment charging habitual misdemeanor assault is not sufficient to establish the prior conviction element of that charge without submission of that element for determination by the jury. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defense counsel did not object to an entry of judgment on the habitual misdemeanor assault charge at trial. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1446(d)(16) provides, \"[e]rrors based upon any of the following grounds, which are asserted to have occurred, may be the subject of appellate review even though no objection, exception or motion has been made in the trial division . . . (16) Error occurred in the entry of the plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The written judgment regarding habitual misdemeanor assault indicates that defendant pled guilty. Defendant argues he was not properly arraigned on the habitual misdemeanor assault charge and that the trial court erred in not discussing with him the effect of a stipulation to his prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-928(a)-(c) (2003) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (a) When the fact that the defendant has been previously convicted of an offense raises an offense of lower grade to one of higher grade and thereby becomes an element of the latter, an indictment or information for the higher offense may not allege the previous conviction. If a reference to a previous conviction is contained in the statutory name or title of the offense, the name or title may not be used in the indictment or information, but an improvised name or title must be used which labels and distinguishes the offense without reference to a previous conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (b) An indictment or information for the offense must be accompanied by a special indictment or information, filed with the principal pleading, charging that the defendant was previously convicted of a specified offense. At the prosecutor's option, the special indictment or information may be incorporated in the principal indictment as a separate count. Except as provided in subsection (c) below, the State may not refer to the special indictment or information during the trial nor adduce any evidence concerning the previous conviction alleged therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (c) After commencement of the trial and before the close of the State's case, the judge in the absence of the jury must arraign the defendant upon the special indictment or information, and must advise him that he may admit the previous conviction alleged, deny it, or remain silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The trial court did not inquire of defendant regarding the prior convictions alleged to establish habitual misdemeanor assault. Before imposing sentence the trial court asked defendant, \"What do you have to say?\" Defendant responded, \"I ain't got really nothin to say . . . they know it all, you know. I mean what I say doesn't matter in this courthouse.\" Defendant contends the failure to arraign him or ask him whether he wanted the issue regarding his prior convictions submitted to a jury prejudiced his rights to a jury trial guaranteed by Article I, Section 24 of the North Carolina Constitution and by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Our Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The failure to conduct a formal arraignment itself is not reversible error.\n   <em>\n    State v.
