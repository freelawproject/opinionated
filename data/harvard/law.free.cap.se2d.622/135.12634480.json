Defendant argues on appeal primarily (1) that the State failed to present sufficient evidence that defendant had a specific intent to kill the child and (2) that the trial court committed plain error in admitting testimony that defendant had failed to answer the mother's questions regarding why he had taken the child. We hold that the State's evidence was sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss when it tended to show that, in order to avoid paying child support, defendant, in 30-degree weather, abandoned an infant in a remote, dilapidated shed where she would not likely be found. We further hold that since the record contains no evidence that the mother's inquiries were instigated by the State, they did not constitute custodial interrogation and, therefore, the mother could permissibly testify about defendant's failure to respond to her questions. Although we conclude that defendant received a trial free of prejudicial error, we agree with defendant's subsequently filed motions for appropriate relief that the trial court erred under\n   <em>\n    Blakely v.

We, therefore, remand for a new sentencing hearing in accordance with\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3796256\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/425/\">\n    359 N.C. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633238\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/256/\">\n    615 S.E.2d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show the following. Daquana Battle testified that defendant was the father of her six-week-old daughter. When Battle told defendant that she was pregnant, he told her that he did not want to go to court, but that \"he would pay out of his pocket like he did with his other kids\" and that \"whenever [she] needed something just to call and he would get it to [her].\" After the baby was born, however, Battle's mother told defendant that she was going to take him to court to force him to make child support payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   David Parker, defendant's former roommate, testified that on 4 November 2002, defendant asked him to help take the baby from Battle. Parker believed that defendant wanted to avoid paying child support. Defendant told Parker that he would get Battle to leave her house by calling her on the phone and that Parker could then go into the house and take the child. After defendant promised to \"take care\" of Parker, Parker agreed to the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant and Parker drove to Battle's house. Battle and her daughter were lying in bed when defendant called and asked if he could talk to Battle about a Christmas present for the baby. Battle walked outside to talk with defendant, leaving her daughter on the bed. The conversation lasted for about\n   10 to 15 minutes. During that time, Parker entered the house, went into the bedroom, picked up the baby, and left the house by the back door while holding the baby underneath his jacket. As Battle started to go back inside her house, defendant blew his car horn - the agreed-upon sign to let Parker know Battle was returning. At the sound of the horn, Battle turned around, but defendant looked as if he was motioning to someone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Battle then turned back towards the house and saw Parker running from the back door towards defendant's car with \"his arms balled up.\" When Parker saw Battle he changed direction and started running toward the backyard. After Battle went back inside, defendant telephoned her again and explained that he had been honking at his cousin. While on the phone, Battle realized her daughter was missing and told defendant. After defendant asked her not to call the police or her mother because he had \"to drop this dope off,\" Battle waited 20 minutes and then called both the police and her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the meantime, Parker had walked with the baby back to his house where he met defendant. The two men then drove with the baby to a house owned by Stan Dempsey that was located in the country, a few miles south of Rocky Mount. When they arrived at Dempsey's house, defendant knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Defendant told Parker to take the child to an unheated shed located approximately 100 yards from the house. The shed had partially collapsed and there were shrubs and trees growing all around it. Inside, the shed was full of trash, debris, broken glass, and bottles, and the ceiling rafters had come down and were leaning. Parker left the child in the center of the shed. As defendant and Parker were leaving, Dempsey walked outside. Defendant told Dempsey that he would return later. Later that morning, defendant called Dempsey and told him that \"he might need [Dempsey] to cover something [up].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Edward Collins of the Rocky Mount Police Department responded to Battle's call, Battle told him that defendant was angry about the prospect of paying child support because he already had other children and did not need additional financial responsibilities. Defendant subsequently returned to Battle's house. During Collins' interview of defendant, defendant showed no \"outward emotion\" and claimed he did not know that the baby was missing. Defendant and Battle then went to ask Parker to return to Battle's house, but when Parker saw the police, he left immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That evening, the police arrested Parker, who admitted that he had helped defendant take the baby from Battle's house. Following defendant's arrest, defendant claimed he did not know why Parker would implicate him. Defendant continued to deny any type of involvement in the baby's disappearance. At some point on the evening of 4 November 2002, defendant called Dempsey and said that \"Parker had got [defendant] in some trouble.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Two days later, Dempsey called the Rocky Mount Police Department after reading a story about a baby being kidnapped accompanied by defendant's and Parker's pictures. Dempsey told Detective Mike Lewis that he had seen defendant and Parker at his house on the morning of 4 November 2002. After talking with Dempsey, Detective Lewis began searching and found the baby lying on some dirt behind a pile of trash in the shed. The child's mouth and nose were covered with a towel tied in a knot and she did not have a jacket or coat. During the two days that the child was missing, it had rained and the temperature had dropped into the 30s. At first, the officers thought the baby was dead, but they rushed her to the hospital once they realized she was still alive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 13 January 2003, defendant was indicted on one count of attempted first degree murder, one count of first degree kidnapping, and one count of felony conspiracy. At trial, defendant testified on his own behalf. According to defendant, Parker told defendant at 3:30 a.m. on the day the baby disappeared (1) that he owed a large amount of money to Jamaican drug dealers and needed help and (2) that Battle's mother had threatened to go to the police about Parker's sexual activity with Battle's younger sister. Defendant testified that he did not see Parker until later\n   that day when he and Battle asked Parker to come to the house to help look for the baby. Defendant claimed that he learned the child was missing when he was driving to Dempsey's house to \"cook cocaine.\" Defendant denied any part in the kidnapping and testified he thought Parker took the baby because Parker was mad at defendant for moving out and leaving him to pay the bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty on all three counts. During sentencing, the trial judge found as an aggravating factor that the victim was very young and found as mitigating factors that defendant had been honorably discharged from the armed services, had supported his family, and had a support system in the community. The judge determined that the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factors and sentenced defendant in the aggravated range to consecutive sentences of 196 to 245 months on the attempted murder conviction, 92 to 120 months on the first degree kidnapping conviction, and 80 to 105 months on the conspiracy conviction. Defendant timely appealed and, while this case was pending on appeal, filed two motions for appropriate relief based on\n   <em>\n    Blakely.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant first assigns error to the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss, arguing that the State presented insufficient evidence that defendant had a specific intent to kill the child. When considering a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence, the trial court must determine whether the State has presented substantial evidence of every essential element of the crime and that the defendant was the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State offered evidence that defendant left a six-week-old baby with a towel knotted around her face in a collapsing shed some distance from the nearest house with temperatures in the 30-degree range. During the next two days, defendant did nothing to retrieve the child or assure her discovery by others. A jury could reasonably infer from this evidence that defendant did not intend for anyone to find or hear the\n   child and that he intended her to die from exposure or lack of food and hydration. The State also offered evidence that defendant acted in order to avoid paying child support, a goal that a jury could reasonably infer could only be ensured by the death of the child. Based upon this circumstantial evidence, the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v.

Battle testified that defendant was the father of her child and multiple witnesses testified regarding defendant's desire to avoid paying child support. No evidence was presented suggesting defendant was not the baby's father. Nevertheless, following sentencing, the State argued to the trial court that defendant should \"have to register as a sex offender being that he kidnapped a child and that there's been no proof that he's the parent of the child.\" On the judgment, the trial court recommended that defendant be required to register as a sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Equitable estoppel prevents one party from taking inconsistent positions in the same or different judicial proceedings, and `is an equitable doctrine designed to protect the integrity of the courts and the judicial process.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Even assuming that the principle of judicial estoppel may be applied against the government in a criminal proceeding, the State's inconsistent positions in this case regarding paternity do not require a new trial. The State's theory throughout trial was that defendant was the father, and at no point did the State deviate from that position. It was only after trial and sentencing - and for the purpose of an entirely different statute, registration of sex offenders - did the State assert that there was no evidence of paternity. The inconsistent position only resulted in a \"recommendation\" by the trial judge that defendant be required to register as a sex offender. We can perceive of no prejudice with respect to the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As held below, however, this case must be remanded for resentencing. Upon resentencing, the trial court should revisit the recommendation regarding registration. We note that the only evidence in the record indicates that defendant is the father of the kidnapped child. The State's assertion to the trial judge \"that there's been no proof that he's the parent of that child\" is incorrect. On this record, there is no basis for requiring defendant to register as a sex offender. The kidnapping of a child is deemed an offense against a minor only if the offense was not committed by a parent of the minor. N.C.
