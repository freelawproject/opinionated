(Hidden Valley), appeal the trial court's denial of their motion to change venue from Harnett to Wake County. For the reasons discussed herein, we reverse the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, Son-Lan Development Co., Inc. (Son-Lan), is a North Carolina corporation with its principal office in Wake County. Defendant Hidden Valley, is a North Carolina corporation with its principal office in Wake County. Defendant Wells is a resident of Harnett County. Defendant Gupton is a resident of Johnston County. Plaintiff commenced this action seeking the enforcement of three contracts, each involving the conveyance of real property located in Wake County. On 11 February 2004, Gupton and Wells entered into a contract for the sale of 148.41 acres located in Wake County. The contract required Wells and Hidden Valley to convey the real property to Gupton. On 7 May 2004, plaintiff entered into a contract with Gupton, in which plaintiff agreed to purchase the 148.41 acres from Gupton following the Wells/Hidden Valley/Gupton closing. The closing was scheduled for 26 May 2004. However, disputes arose and neither transfer took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 9 August 2004, Gupton, Hidden Valley, and Wells entered into a settlement and release agreement. As part of the agreement, Wells agreed to sell the land to Gupton for an increased purchase price. On 30 September 2004, plaintiff filed this action in Harnett County seeking specific performance of the contracts, as well as monetary damages. Defendants filed motions for change of venue pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-76\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1-83. The trial court denied these motions. Defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The sole issue before this Court is whether the trial court erred in denying defendants' motion for change of venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although the denial of a motion for change of venue is interlocutory, it affects a substantial right.\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

In\n   <em>\n    Fox,\n   </em>\n   the defendant agreed to convey to plaintiff a convenience store located in Carteret County. The defendant did not own the real estate the convenience store was located on, but occupied the property pursuant to a sublease with a third party. Plaintiff filed suit in Craven County seeking specific performance of the agreement, including an order compelling the defendant to assign its lease of real estate. The defendant moved for a change of venue pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-76\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court held the sublease was an interest in the real estate. We further held that since the principal remedy sought by the plaintiff was specific performance requiring a direct determination of an interest in real property, the action was local. As a result, we reversed the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion for change in venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the instant case, plaintiff makes five claims for relief in its complaint for: (1) breach of contract and specific performance of the contracts to sale; (2) tortious interference with a contract; (3) civil conspiracy; (4) unfair and deceptive trade practices; and (5) fraud. In its prayer for relief, plaintiff sought specific performance and in the alternative, damages for breach of contract, treble damages for the unfair and deceptive trade practices claim, and punitive damages. Where a party seeks multiple remedies, affecting both title to property and\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   claims, this Court has held \"`it is irrelevant that judgment will operate\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   if judgment also directly affects title to the property.'\"\n   <em>\n    Fox,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955204\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/161/47/#p51\">\n    161 N.C.

Plaintiff asserts specific performance operates\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   for venue purposes and does not affect title to land, therefore all the remedies it seeks are\n   <em>\n    in personam,\n   </em>\n   making the action transitory and venue proper in Harnett County. This Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Fox,\n   </em>\n   that it is only where land is located in another state does the issue of personal jurisdiction arise, making it necessary for the court to \"compel the execution of a conveyance by decree\n   <em>\n    in personam.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20S.E.2d%20429\">\n    587 S.E.2d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In its own words, plaintiff prays the court to \"enter an order compelling specific performance of the contracts and directing Defendants to execute and deliver to the Plaintiff a good and sufficient general warranty deed for the land described in the contracts.\" Although plaintiff also seeks actual and punitive damages, these\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   claims are merely incidental to its principal claim seeking conveyance of the title to the real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, plaintiff's filing of a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   further demonstrates that its primary objective in this litigation is to affect title to property. This is so because \"a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   can be filed against real property only in an action affecting its title.\"\n   <em>\n    McGurk v.
