Whittington (\"defendant\") appeals the trial court's judgment entered upon his conviction by a jury of second degree murder. For the reasons discussed herein, we hold that defendant received a trial free of prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State's evidence presented at trial tends to show the following: In March 2003, defendant lived in Spring Lake, North Carolina, with his wife, Patricia Whittington (\"Patricia\"), and his son, Jamel Whittington (\"Jamel\"). On the night of 21 March 2003, defendant returned home from work and began arguing with Patricia over a bill. During the argument, Patricia told defendant she was planning to leave him. At that time, Patricia was in the living room of the residence and defendant was in a bedroom. As the couple continued to argue, defendant retrieved a metal pipe from a nearby bathroom and approached Patricia from behind. Defendant struck Patricia in the side of the head with the pipe and, after she fell to the floor, continued to strike her with the pipe. At approximately 12:15 a.m. on 22 March 2003, defendant called \"911\" and informed the emergency telecommunicator he had \"just killed his wife\" and \"needed some help.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Harnett County Sheriff's Department Sergeant Thomas Parker (\"Sergeant Parker\") was the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the scene. He observed defendant smoking a cigarette and sitting on the front porch. Sergeant Parker inquired if there was \"a problem.\" Defendant replied he \"had just killed his wife.\" Inside the residence, Sergeant Parker saw Jamel sitting near \"a pool of blood.\" After removing Jamel, Sergeant Parker discovered Patricia lying on the back steps of the residence, \"partially in the door but mostly out\" of it. Sergeant Parker subsequently handcuffed defendant and placed him in the patrol car. Shortly thereafter, emergency medical personnel arrived and pronounced Patricia dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon further investigation, law enforcement officials located the metal pipe and additional blood stains in the living room of the residence. They also noted a \"trail of blood\" leading from the living room into the kitchen, indicating Patricia had been dragged from the living room and towards the rear door. Patricia's body was wrapped in a bloodstained blanket, and the officers observed a pillow case stained with blood and brain matter, a towel, and a rag nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant was transported to the Harnett County Law Enforcement Center. Following his execution of a waiver of rights form, he was interviewed by Harnett County Sheriff's Department Detective Bernice Smith (\"Detective Smith\") and Lieutenant Johnny Hawley (\"Lieutenant Hawley\"). Detective Smith's narration of the interview, which was read to, initialed, and signed by defendant, contains the following statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Patricia was in the other part of the trailer. She told defendant she was going to leave him. He got up and got the pipe and after getting the pipe he walked back to the living room where Patricia was at.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant advises that her head was turned away from him and she did not see him coming toward her and he swung the pipe striking her on the side of the head, she went down, she had begun to cry and he swung again while she was laying face down on the floor. Defendant states that he struck Patricia seven times, she did not say anything she only cried, she did not put her hands up around her head or anything. He stopped hitting her because she stopped moving.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant then went to the master bedroom and got the cover off the bed and took the cover into the living room and wrapped Patricia up and he dragged her body to the back door of their home and was going to bury her out in the yard and he thought to himself, no that's not right I need to do the right thing and he called 911 and told them what he had done. Defendant then waited for the officers to arrive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 7 April 2003, defendant was indicted upon a charge of first degree murder. Prior to trial and pursuant to defendant's \"Notice of Intention to Use Insanity Defense,\" Judge Ola M. Lewis conducted a hearing regarding defendant's capacity to proceed in the matter. Following the presentation of evidence and argument by both parties, Judge Lewis found defendant capable of proceeding to trial in a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order entered 2 August 2004 (\"the order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, subsequent to the State's presentation of evidence, defendant presented evidence tending to show he was either legally insane at the time of the commission of the crime or mentally incapable of premeditating, deliberating, and forming the specific intent to kill Patricia. The trial court submitted the offenses of first and second degree murder in its jury charge, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty of second degree murder on 30 July 2004. After determining defendant had two prior record points and prior felony record II, the trial court imposed a sentence of 189 to 236 months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred by: (I) concluding defendant was competent to stand trial; (II) preventing members of the public from entering or exiting the courtroom during the trial; (III) refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter; and (IV) sentencing defendant to a term of 189 to 236 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the issue of competency to stand trial, defendant maintains the order should be reversed because Judge Lewis failed to include specific findings of fact to support her conclusions of law. We disagree. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1001(a) (2003) provides in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   No person may be tried, convicted, sentenced, or punished for a crime when by reason of mental illness or defect he is unable to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to comprehend his own situation in reference to the proceedings, or to assist in his defense in a rational or reasonable manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1002(b) (2003) states that \"when the capacity of the defendant to proceed is questioned, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the defendant's capacity to proceed.\" \"The issue of the defendant's capacity to proceed may be resolved by the trial court with or without the aid of a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal, defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the order's findings of fact. Rather, defendant insists the order must be reversed because it fails to contain specific findings of fact that defendant was able \"to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him,\" able \"to comprehend his own situation in reference to the proceedings,\" and able \"to assist in his defense in a rational or reasonable manner.\" Defendant's first argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The order included the following, denominated as \"conclusions of law\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1.

The test pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes 15A-1001 is:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a.

Whether defendant is able to assist in his own defense in a rational and reasonable manner,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   9. This court finds after reviewing the evidence presented, the testimony, transcripts of the proceedings, records presented that the defendant is able to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   a. Understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   b. Comprehend his own situation in these proceedings, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   c. Assist in his own defense in a rational and reasonable manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The foregoing amply reflects consideration of the evidence introduced by the parties and application of the proper legal standard. While several of the conclusions of law may more properly be characterized and denominated as \"findings of fact,\" we are not persuaded that any such mislabeling requires reversal of the order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In short, we perceive no abuse of discretion in Judge Lewis' ruling, and defendant's first argument therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant next maintains the trial court erred by preventing members of the public from entering or exiting the courtroom during the trial. The instant record reflects that members of the public were prohibited from entering or exiting the courtroom (i) while the jury pool was being instructed on the case, (ii) while the parties were making their closing arguments, and (iii) while the jury's verdict was being read.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although asserting \"there were no findings justifying the closing of the courtroom, and there was no overriding interest in its closure,\" defendant fails to cite any instance in the record where he objected to the trial court's decision to close the courtroom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.R. App. P. 10(b)(1) (2005) (in order to properly preserve a question for appellate review, \"a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context\"); N.C.R. App. P. 10(c)(1) (assignments of error \"sufficiently\" preserve an issue for appeal only when they \"direct the attention of the appellate court to the particular error about which the question is made, with clear and specific record or transcript references\").
