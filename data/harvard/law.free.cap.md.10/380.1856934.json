Kridler, for materials alleged in the claim to have been furnished to Kridler as contractor, builder and architect, of a house erected on a lot, of which the appellant was at the time of their delivery the owner or reputed owner. The writ, return, advertisement, claim, pleas and issues, are fully stated in the opinion of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\"><em>Exception. </em>The proof in the case shows, that Kridler was building three houses adjoining each other, one of which is the house in question; <em>that </em>the lumber was obtained for these three houses from various places, and all of it was usually dropped at defendant\u2019s house, and was used indiscriminately for all three; <em>that </em>the items of which this claim is composed, were sometimes ordered by Kridler and sometimes by his hands. The plaintiffs then offered in evidence the <em>notice to the appellant, </em>which is set out in the opinion of this court, and also a deed from Kridler and Israel to the defendant, dated the 20th of November 1854, of the leasehold interest in the lot sought to be charged with the lien. The defendant then offered in evidence an agreement between himself and Kridler, dated the 11th of July 1854, by which Kridler contracted, for $6000, to build the house for him, and convey or have conveyed to him the lot free of incumbrances, except the ground-rent, and also proved the lease of the lot by Williams and wife, to Kridler, dated the 19th of September 1854, and the assignment thereof by Kridler to Israel, dated the 20th of October 1854, subject to the defendant\u2019s title, and with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>agreement on the part of Israel, to convey the property to the defendant, on repayment of the sum of $2500, for which Kridler had pledged it to him. It was admitted by the plaintiffs, that it was their invariable custom to settle with Kridler on the first of July and January, every year, for purchases made by him during the previous six months, and that on the 1st of July 1854 he gave them his note for $518.85, in pursuance of that custom; which, however, has not been paid. The defendant then offered the following prayers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">1st. (This prayer is fully stated in the opinion of this court.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">2nd. That if the jury find that Kridler executed the contract given in evidence by defendant, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover for any materials which they may find to have been furnished to Kridler, on account of the property in question, previous to sixty days before the 5th of January 1855, provided they find there was no special contract between the plaintiffs and Kridler, for furnishing materials generally to the house, but that the same were sent for, and furnished from time to time, as the state of the job required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">4th. That if the jury believe from the evidence, that the materials claimed for, were furnished on the individual credit of Kridler, and not on that of the house in question, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">5th. That in order to entitle the plaintiffs to recover in this action, the juiy must first find that the materials were furnished on the credit of the house in question, and that such was the understanding at the time they were furnished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">The court, (Presstman, J.,) granted the <em>fourth </em>prayer, with this modification; \u201cbut that the jury are not at liberty to infer, that the note offered in evidence, and given by said Kridler, was a waiver of the lien of the plaintiffs, unless they shall also find that the said note was paid,\u201d and rejected the others. To this ruling the defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, G. J., Eggleston, Tuck and JBartol, J,</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>N. <em>T. Wallis </em>for the appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">1st. That the contract for furnishing the materials, having been made with \u201ca contractor or builder,\u201d the lien cannot be affixed to the defendant\u2019s property, without the <em>notice </em>required by the acts of 1838, ch. 205, sec. 9, and 1845, ch. 176, sec. 1. Whether he was owner <em>in point of fact </em>or not, he was so for the <em>purposes of this case. </em>The claim, the <em>scire facias, </em>the notice, all allege that lie was the owner, and that the materials were furnished to a <em>contractor. </em>The testimony shows the same fact. He was the equitable owner, in point of fact, from the date of his contract with Kridler, on the 11th of July 1854. If, therefore, the acts of Assembly require notice to the party, who was the owner at the time the lien was attempted to be enforced, and who was the equitable and \u201creputed owner\u201d all the time, then Thomas was the proper person to whom the notice was to be given. 7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>315, <em>Mills vs. Matthews. </em>But, as has been already said, the <em>scire facias </em>and the notice, treat him as owner or reputed owner, and there can be no recovery except upon proof that all the formalities required in the case of an owner or reputed owner, have been strictly complied with as to him. The plaintiffs have so put their own case. The notice to Thomas was not sufficient. The act of 1838, ch. 205, sec. 9, provides, that the party furnishing materials, shall not be entitled to a lien, when his \u201ccontract\u201d for furnishing them was made with a contractor-, unless he shall give notice of the <em>Usumef </em>that is, of the <em>contract </em>to the owner, and \u201cthat he intends to claim the benefit of the lien. \u201d No notice of the <em>contract </em>was given, or of any thing from which it was possible for Thomas to learn what the contract was. The act of 1845, ch. 176, sec. 1, provides, that in a similar case, the claimant shall not be entitled to a lien, \u201cunless within sixty days after furnishing such work or materials, he shall give notice of the <em>samef </em>(that is, notice of the furnishing of <em>such </em>materials,) \u201cand of his intention to claim the benefit of the lien.\u201d Both, acts require notice of two things. Thomas had notice but of one, viz., their intention to claim the benefit of the lien. There is nothing from which he could learn the nature of the contract, to which he was a stranger, the kind and character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of the materials, the amount due for them, or any thing else he was entitled to know; nothing to enable him to retain in settlement with Kridler, as by the act of 1845, ch. 287, sec, 8, he was entitled to do, the amount for which he might be made responsible to the claimants. The lien had not then been filed to come in aid of the notice and supply defects. It was not filed until the 10th of April, three months afterwards. There is no other proof when the notice was served, than that the endorsement says, the 5th of January. Seel 11 of the act of 1838, ch.' 205, prescribes, what the lien-claim must contain; the nature or kind of work done, and the kind or amount of the materials furnished, and the time when they were furnished. Yet in a case in which the letter of the law was complied with, and all this information given, the Court of Appeals say its spirit was not fulfilled; he must not only state the amount claimed, but must give a bill of particulars, whereby all who may be interested in the premises can ascertain, not only the amount demanded but the correctness and reasonableness of the demand. The <em>items </em>must be furnished, in order that persons interested may know for what services and materials the sum alleged to be due is claimed, and thus have an opportunity of proving the injustice or the extravagance of the demand. 6 <em>Gill, </em>27, <em>Carson vs. White. </em>If a stranger to the contract is entitled to this information from the claimant, he is surely equally entitled to it in the notice, when no claim has been filed, and there is no other source from which he could learn it. For these reasons the appellant insists, there was no sufficient notice to bind him as owner, and that the court, therefore, erred in refusing his first prayer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-5\"><em>Note. </em>The argument upon the other prayers is omitted, inasmuch as they are not noticed in the decision of the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-6\"><em>Cornelius McLean </em>and <em>George EL. Williams </em>for the appellees, argued\u2019:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-7\">1st. That the ruling of the court below upon the first prayer was correct. The evidence shows that Kridler <em>was owner, </em>and as such contracted for the materials, and no notice was necessary to be given to Thomas in any event. He bought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tile house from Kridler as its owner, after the deli very'of these materials, and was bound to know that ajKouse in progress of erection was responsible under the lien law. He affirms Kridler to have been such owner, by receiving^ conveyance from him, and there is not a particle of evidence in the cause, to show that Kridler was at any time the contractor or builder of Thomas. His agreement was to sell his own house to Thomas, when he had finished it. If that be so, then the notice to Thomas Was mere surplussage, only given for abundant caution, and a defective notice to one not entitled to any notice at all, cannot vitiate a claim properly preferred against the house, and against the person truly liable; and for a like reason, the addition of the name of Thomas in the claim as filed, cannot be a fatal defect, if indeed it be a defect at all. Further, this is a proceeding <em>in </em>rein, and the <em>scire facias </em>either brings in the true parties, or concludes the property by judgment rendered, and had it turned out that neither Kridler nor Thomas were owners, still the claim was sufficiently filed to bind the properly, if either was the owner or reputed owner-, which is all that the act requires. The jury may have found that Kridler was the owner, and no notice necessary, and the wording of the prayer, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, by reason of a defective notice to Thomas, excluded the jury from finding that Kridler was the owner, and that the notice was otherwise sufficient, or in fact that no notice at all was necessary; and also excludes from the consideration of the jury the first and third issues, which do not at all involve the question of notice, but only the furnishing of the materials and the sufficiency of the claim of lien. And the prayer assumes, that in filing the claim, the law requires the claimant, at his hazard, to ascertain the true owner, and so much of the law as provides for filing it against the reputed owner would be repealed. The act evidently makes the true description of the lot when the claim is filed, and when the <em>scire facias </em>is published, the important matter, and in this case in which Kridler was at the outset the owner without a proper title, and subsequently became contractor to finish, demonstrates the propriety of this construction of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>2nd. Assuming that Kridler was contractor and builder, the \u2022notice, so far as <em>time </em>is concerned, was sufficient. It was within sixty days after furnishing the materials.- November <em>17th was the </em>date of the last delivery, and January 5th was \u2022 the date of the notice. In substance it was sufficient, because the lien law only requires, that the particulars should be filed in the clerk\u2019s office, 6 <em>Gill, </em>17, <em>Carson vs. White</em>. The act of 1845, ch. 176, sec. 1, does not entitle the owner to notice of any thing, but that the benefit of the lien is intended to be claimed, and that the materials have been furnished under contract to the contractor. It does not, nor does any act, provide that- the particulars are to be furnished with the particularity required when the claim is lodged in the clerk\u2019s office, and the court therefore was not in error in refusing the first prayer. The second section of the act of 1845, draws a distinction between giving notice, and the filing of a claim or statement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b394-5\">Eccleston, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av_\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The <em>scire facias </em>in this case issued from the Superior Court of Baltimore city, for the purpose of enforcing a claim under the lien laws. The writ recites, that on the 10th of April 1855, William E. Barber and Samuel W. Barber filed a claim in the said court, \u201cagainst Jacob F. Kridler and John H. Thomas, for the sum of $95.31, on a three-slory brick tenement, with a three-story back building, twenty-two and-a-half feet front, fronting on the south-west side of McCulloh street, first house north-west of Hoffman street in said city, with a depth of about fifty-three feet, and on the lot whereon said tenement is erected, and the ground adjacent thereto and used therewith, of which the said John H. Thomas was the owner, or reputed owner, for lumber sold and delivered by the said William E. Barber and Samuel W. Barber, to the said Jacob F. Kridler, as contractor, builder and architect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The writ was issued on the 11th of April 1855, and on the return-day the sheriff made the following return:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cCopy served on John H.

Barber, according to the form of the act of Assembly in such case made and provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Thomas appeared and filed three pleas:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">1st. That the materials were not furnished, and that the sum of money was not due and unpaid as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">2nd. That the contract for furnishing the said materials was made with an architect, builder, or other person than the owner of the lot on which the building was erected, and that the plaintiffs did not, in manner and form as required by the acts of Assembly in such case made and provided, give notice of the same, and of their intention to claim the benefit of the alleged lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">3rd. That no lawful sufficient claim of lien was filed as required by the acts of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Upon issues based on these pleas the cause was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The lien-claim, as filed, does not appear in the record, but, by agreement, is to be used as if it liad been inserted. It is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201c <em>William E. Barber and Samuel W. Barber, vs. Jacob F. Kridler and John H.

Thomas was, <em>at the time of the delivery hereinafter </em>mentioned, the owner, or reputed owner,\u201d of the property designated as that on which the lien is claimed, \u201cfor lumber sold and delivered by the said William E. Barber and Samuel W. Barber to the said Jacob E. Kridler, as contractor, builder and architect, of the kind, at the prices, and delivered at the respective times stated in the account hereto annexed and filed herewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">With such proceedings before us, so far as this case is concerned, we must regard Thomas as <em>oioner, </em>a&amp;d Kridler as contractor, <em>builder and architect. </em>This being so the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover under this <em>scire </em>facias, unless notice was given to Thomas according to the requirements of the acts which have been referred to, and this we think has not been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The claim was not filed until the 10th April 1855 j the notice was given on the 5th of January preceding, merely stating an intention \u201cto claim the benefit of the lien provided by the acts of Assembly for materials furnished, and work done for and about the erection and construction of a certain three-story building,\u201d &lt;fec. It says nothing as to the nature or kind of materials furnished or work done, leaving the owner entirely without information in regard to the amount intended to be claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The act of 1845, ch. 176, sec. 1, requires in such a case as this that a claimant shall, within sixty days after furnishing work or materials, \u201cgive notice of the same, \u201c(that is, notice of the furnishing of such work or materials,)\u201d and of his intention to claim the lien.\u201d In a case where the notice makes no reference to a claim filed, and could'make none in consequence of there being no such claim on file, how can such a notice as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the present be considered a compliance with the act? What useful information did it furnish in reference to the amount of the claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The 8th section of chapter 287 of the same session, confirms us in the belief, that this notice is not such as the Legislature designed it should be. That section gives the owner who receives notice of a lien claimed for materials, the right to retain out of the cost of the building, as between himself and the contractor, athe amount which he may ascertain to be due to the party giving such notice.\u201d This provision is an equitable one, and designed for the protection of the owner. Requiring such a notice to be given as will render the law practically useful to him, imposes no hardship upon a material man or mechanic, whilst it only secures to an owner what the Legislature evidently intended for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">As the notice received by Thomas says nothing in regard to the amount claimed, it gave him no information in reference to what amount he would be entitled to retain out of the contractor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Like the case before us, the <em>scire facias, </em>in <em>Hess &amp; others, vs. Poultney &amp; Brown, </em>was issued upon a claim for materials. There the want of a proper notice to the owners was held to be a defect, which so effectually defeated the claim that the court did not award a <em>procedendo. </em>And considering the present notice defective, we think the first prayer of the defendant should have been granted. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and no <em>procedendo </em>ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">This renders an examination of the other prayers unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, without a procedendo.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
