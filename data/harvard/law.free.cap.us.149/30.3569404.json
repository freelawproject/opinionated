In pursuance of that and subsequent ordinances the sewer was constructed, and the cost thereof cast by a special- assessment upon the lots and blocks within a prescribed district. The validity of this assessment was challenged by this suit, the plaintiffs being lot owners in the sewer district. The suit was commenced in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the county of Multnomah. That court sustained a demurrer to an amended complaint, and dismissed it, and this decree of dismissal was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 16 Oregon, 450.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The burden pf the complaint rested upon these allegations: \u201c Said' ordinance numbered 5068,\u2019approved March 5, 1887, is unconstitutional and void, in this :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-6\">\u201c\u00a7 121 of chapter 10 of the charter of the said city of Portland, providing for the construction of sewers, under and by virtue of which said ordinance numbered 5068 was passed, is in' violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as it provides for taking private property for public use without due process of law; and said ordinance numbered 5068 is also unconstitutional and void, as it determines arbitrarily and absolutely that the property therein described is benefited by said Tanner Creek sewer without giving to the owners of said property any notice or opportunity to be heard upon that question.

Railway </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>131 U. S. 418. That court holds, in the case of <em>Strowbridge </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>8 Oregon, 67, approved in this case, that no notice is provided for and none is necessary to persons whose property is to be assessed for the construction of sewers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>This construction, then, is to be taken by this court as at part of the city charter; and, therefore, the plain question here presented is: Can the real property of a citizen of Portland, Oregon, be constitutionally assessed one hundred or five-hundred or a thousand dollars, or any other sum, for the construction of a sewer in that city, and such property, if necessary, be seized and sold to pay such assessment, without any notice to the owner at any stage of the proceedings, or any opportunity given him to be heard before any tribunal or court, upon the subject ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-5\">Moreover, the question here is whether or not the Supreme-Court of the State of Oregon made a correct decision in this-case. That court decided that the. charter did not make any provision for notice.,to persons who are to be charged for the-expense of constructing a sewer, and - that in such case no-notice is n\u00e9cessary; ancl this decision has not been overruled by any argument or illustration in the case of <em>The King Real Estate Association </em>v. <em>City of Portland, </em>but will stand as the-law of the State of Oregon unless it is reversed by this court.. There is no alternative. This court must either affirm that-decision, and -hold that no notice is- required and none is necessary to persons whose- property is to be charged for the construction of a sewer in the city of Portland, or it must, by a. reversal of that decision, decide that notice of some kind is-necessary under such circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-6\">We respectfully submit that this question ought to be put. at rest in an emphatic decision by this court.. It is a vital and far-reaching question, and seems not to be so fully settled as it-should be. Municipal corporations are multiplying indefinitely in all parts of the United States. Tow;ns of -only a few hundred inhabitants are everywhere being incorporated as cities. City governments are proverbial for their reckless extravagance in the expenditure of money. They are more or less-influenced, and sometimes controlled, by selfish partisans and unscrupulous jobbers. City taxation and assessments in some-cases approach the confiscation' of private property. Under these circumstances, the citizen cannot be too carefully protected. The spirit of the Constitution and the claims, of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>will never be fully recognized till the citizen has personal notice served upon him, or public notice equivalent thereto, of every proceeding in which 'he may be divested of life, liberty \u2022or property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-5\"><em>Mr. William, T. Muir </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-6\">Mr. Justice Brewer</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The question is that of notice to the taxpayer. It is insisted that the Supreme Court held that section 121 did not provide for notice; that such construction of the State statute is binding upon this court; and that we must consider the case as though no notice was provided for. It is not entirely clear what construction has been placed upon section 121 by the Supreme Court of Oregon. In the case of <em>Strowbridge </em>v. Portland, decided in 1879, 8 Oregon, 67, 83, the provisions of the city charter in these respects being then substantially like those in the act of 1882, it was said by Judge Boise, delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u201c The elaborate manner pointed' .out in the charter - for acquiring the authority to construct street improvements \u2022does not apply to the construction of sewers. The latter may be laid when, in the judgment of the city council, the same shall be necessary. They may' b\u00e9 made without previous notice, the council alone being the judge of their necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">This language is quoted with approval by Chief Justice Thayer, in delivering the opinion of the court in this case. <em>Paulsen </em>v. Portland, 16 Oregon, 450, 464. But on the petition for a rehearing, which was denied by two judges to one, each of the judges in favor of denying gave a brief opinion, and Judge Strahan in his says:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u201c But- it is objected that neither the charter nor ordinance \u2022expressly provides for notice, and that, therefore, though notice, may have been in' fact given, the constitutional' objection of want of notice is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">\u201c Sections 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99 of the charter all provide for and regulate notice in case of improvement of streets; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u00a7 121, which authorizes sewers, provides, among other things,, \u2018and'when the council shall direct the same (costs) to be assessed on the property directly benefited, such expense shall in every other respect be assessed and collected in the same manner as is provided in the case .of street assessments.\u2019 The charter expressly provides for notice in case of street assessments, and \u00a7\u2019 121 makes the provisions applicable in case of sewers where the expense is ordered by the council to be made a charge on- the property directly benefited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">In the subsequent case in the same court of <em>King Real Estate Association </em>v. Portland, decided in 1892, and reported in 31 Pac. Pep. 482, it was held that: \u201cThe provision that such expense shall be assessed in the same manner as is provided in the case of street improvements, necessarily makes such sections, in regard to street improvements, with the exceptions noted, a part of section 121, for .that purpose.\u201d It would seem from this that the final construction pl\u00e1ced by the Supreme Court was to the effect that the charter requires notice\u2019 as much in the matter of sewers as of street improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Put were it otherwise, while not questioning that notice to the taxpayer in some form must be given before an assessment, for the construction of a sewer can be sustained, as in any other demand upon the individual for a portion of his property, we do not think it essential to the validity of a section in the charter of a city granting power to construct sewers that there should in terms be expressed either the necessity for or the time, or .manner of notice. The city is a miniature State, the council is its legislature, the charter is its constitution; and it is enough if, in that, the power is granted in general terms, for when granted, it must necessarily be exercised subject to all limitations imposed by constitutional. provisions, and the power to prescribe the mode of its exercise is, except as restricted, subject to the legislative discretion of the council. Thus, in the case of <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Hentig, </em>33 Kansas, 156, it was held thus: \u201c Where a statute authorizes a city to provide for the construction of sewers and drains, and to tax the costs thereof upon the adjacent property owners, but does not require that any notice sh\u00e1ll be given to the property owners, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>held, </em>that such failure to- require notice does not render the statute unconstitutional or void, but notice must nevertheless be given, and the. city would have a broad discretion with reference to the kind of notice and the manner of giving the same.\u201d See also <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>13 R. I. 50; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Lynchburg, </em>84 Virginia, 861; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>2 Michigan, 560; Ga<em>tch </em>v. <em>Des Moines, </em>63 Iowa, 718; <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh, Wheeling &amp;c. Railroad, </em>17 W. Va. 812, 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">But it is. further insisted that, even if the general grant of power in a charter to do a work of this kind is sufficient without an express provision. in it as to notice to the taxpayers, the city in the execution of that power must by ordinance provide for notice and prescribe its terms, and that these ordinances contained no such provision. Here again we are met with an apparent difference in opinion of the two judges of the Supreme Court of Oregon, concurring in the judgment in favor of the city. The Chief Justice seems to consider the matter of notice immaterial, relying upon the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>that the right of the city to carry through such a work without any notice had been settled years ago in the <em>Strowbridge Case; </em>while Judge Strahan makes these observations :</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u201cIn addition to this, \u00a7 12 of ordinance No. 5068 provides that the viewers shall hold stated meetings at the office of the auditor and clerk of said city, and all persons interested may appear before said viewers and be heard in the matter of making said estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u201c I think it would be a reasonable construction of this ordinance to hold that the right to be heard implies that notice shall be given, and, if this be so, the ordinance does provide for notice by necessary implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u201c That which is implied in a statute is as.much a part of it as what is expressed. <em>Minard </em>v. <em>Douglas County, </em>9 Oregon, 206.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">But what- was in fact done by the city <em>% </em>By ordinance 5068 it ordered the construction of a sewer, and directed what area should be drained into that sewer, and created a taxing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>district out of that area. For these, no notice or assent by the taxpayer was necessary. A sewer is constructed in the exercise of the police power for the health and cleanliness of the city, and the police power is exercised solely at the legislative will. So also the determination of a territorial district to be taxed for a local improvement is within the province of legislative discretion. <em>Willard </em>v. Presbury, 14 Wall. 676; <em>Spencer </em>v. Merchant, 125 U. S. 345, 355. By the same ordinance the city also provided that the cost of the sewer should be distributed upon the property within the sewer district, and appointed viewers to estimate the proportionate share .which each piece of property should bear. Here, for the first time in proceedings of this nature, where an attempt is made to cast upon his particular property a certain proportion of the burden of the cost, the. taxpayer has a right to be heard. The ordinance named, a place at which the viewers should meet, directed that-they should hold stated meetings-at that place, and that all persons interested -might appear and be heard by them in the matter of making the estimate... The viewers, upon their appointment, gave notice by publication in the official paper of the city of the time of their first meeting. Notice by publication is a sufficient notice in proceedings of this nature. <em>Lent </em>v. <em>Tillson, </em>140 U. S. 316, 328. As- the form of the notice and the time of its publication are not affirmatively disclosed in the complaint, it must be assumed that there was no defect in respect to these matters. The precise objection is, that although proper and sufficient notice may have been given, it was not in terms prescribed by the ordinance appointing the viewers. But, as held by the Supreme Court of Oregon in the-case referred to, <em>Minard </em>v. <em>Douglas Co., </em>9 Oregon, 206, that which is implied in a statute is as much a part of it as that which is expressed ; and where a statute or an .ordinance provides for stated meetings of a b\u00f3ard, designates the place at which the meetings ar\u00e9 to be held, and directs that all persons interested in the matter may be hear,d before it, it is,, as said by Judge. Strahan, not a strained interpretation that it is implied thereby that some suitable notice shall be given to the parties interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>But, further, the viewers made formal report to the council of what they had done, stating that they had, in accordance with the requirements of ordinance 5068, given notice by publication, and the council, in the subsequent ordinance 5162, recites that their report is satisfactory and adopted. In other words, the council by this latter ordinance approved the construction placed by the viewers upon the first, to the effect that it required notice. It would seem that when notice was in fact given, notice whose sufficiency is not challenged, a construction put by the council upon the scope and effect of its own ordinance should be entitled to respect in any challenge of the regularity of the proceedings had under that ordinance. It is settled that, if provision is made \u201c for notice to and hearing of each proprietor, at some stage of the proceedings, upon the question what proportion of the tax shall be assessed upon his land, there is no taking of his property without due process of law.\u201d <em>McMillen </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>95 U. S. 37; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>96 U. S. 97; <em>Hagar </em>v. <em>Reclamation District, </em>111 U. S. 701; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Merchant, </em>125 U. S. 345. If, before the viewers had in fact met, yet after they had published notice, the council had passed an ordinance reciting an approval of that act of notice,, it could hardly be doubted that the full requirements of law as to notice were satisfied. Because this approval was not made until after the hearing before the viewers, is it thereby worthless, of no validity? And can this court say, when those proceedings have been sustained by the Supreme Court of the State, that rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution have been stricken down, and that these individuals have been deprived of their property without due process of law ?</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Another matter- may be nientioned : The second section of ordinance 5162 directed the ordinary publication of notice of the assessment. The charter, section 102, required a \u201c docket of city liens,\u201d in which was entered, first, the description of each piece of property assessed; second, the name- of th\u00e9 owner, or that the owner is unknown; and, third, the sum assessed upon such piece of property, and the date of the entry; and by section 104 it was provided that \u201ca sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>money assessed for the improvement of a street cannot be collected until, by order of the council, ten days\u2019 notice thereof is given by the auditor, by publication in a daily newspaper published in the city of Portland. Such notice must substantially contain the matters required to be entered in the docket of city liens concerning such assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Now, without deciding that this notice is sufficient notice to bring the proceedings within \u201c due process of law,\u201d it is worthy of remark that during the ten days of publication, made as required by said section 104 and section 2 of ordinance 5162, the plaintiffs did not challenge the regularity of the proceedings or apply to the. council for an inquiry into the justness of the apportionment, nor did they commence any suit until a month after the time when warrants for the collection of delinquent assessments had been ordered by the council. In other words, only after payment had been made by a portion of the taxpayers did these plaintiffs ask any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Without continuing this inquiry any further, we are of the opinion that, notwithstanding the doubt arising from the lack of express provision for notice in ordinance 5068, it cannot be held, in view of the notice which was given, of the construction placed upon this ordinance by the council thereafter, and of the approval by the Supreme Court of the proceedings as in conformity to the laws of the State, that the provisions of the federal Constitution, requiring due process of law, have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The judgment is, therefore, <em>Affirmed,</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b62-7\">' Mr. Justice Field did not hear the argument or take part in the decision of this. case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
