McComb had previously-obtained a lease for himself and' his associates. The capital, of this association was $1,500,000, of which Henry S. McComb subscribed $415,000 personally, and also $60,000 as trustee; Josiah Bardwell, $100,000; the balance being taken by ten associates. \u2022 On January 14, 1869, this association became-incorporated, under a special act of the legislature of Tennessee,, and to this corporation the voluntary association, on January 22, 1869, transferred its. property. On January 21, 1869, such action was taken by this incorporated company that the capital stock named in its charter, to wit, $2,000,000, was issued to-the subscribers of the original unincorporated association in proportion to the amounts of their subscriptions. In this way, Hhe subscription in the name of Henry S. McComb, trustee, was enlarged from' $60,000 to $80,000, and represented 800 shares of stock, for which eight certificates of one hundred shares each, and numbered from 157 to 164, inclusive, were-formally issued by the incorporated company on October 6, 1870, to Henry S. McComb, trustee, and so remained on the books of the company at the time of his death, December 30, 1881. It is undisputed that the subscription was taken originally by McComb as trustee.for Josiah Bardwell. In the' fall of 1869 this correspondence took place between Bardwell and McComb:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-4\">\u201cMy Dear McComb: Will you please acknowledge that you hold in \u2018 the Southern Ass\u2019n,\u2019 as trustee for (the benefit) or rather for.

The pleadings having been perfected, proofs were taken, and the case submitted for final hearing, which resulted in a decree on July 3, 1889, for the sum of $42,000 principal, and $49,420 as interest; making in the aggregate $91,420. 39 Fed.

The matters in controversy have already been passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction in the suit brought by Bardwell against McComb in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which, begun in Boston in 1875, and terminated in 1878 in a verdict and judgment for the defendant, raised the same questions and was decided upon practically the same facts as belong in this controversy. The case is therefore <em>res judicata. Smith </em>v.

McComb, even if a trustee for the complainants\u2019 decedent, committed no act, and neglected no duty to his <em>cestui que trust </em>in respect to the shares of stock in suit, such as makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>his estate liable for their original cost, with interest, or for any other sum of money. The Circuit Court, in holding tha,t the amount of the recovery is to be governed by the alleged cost of the stock instead of by what it was worth, violated a thoroughly well established and reasonable principle. <em>Galigher </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>129 U. S. 193; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bolles. </em>132 U. S. 125:</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-5\"><em>Mr. George Gray </em>closed for Frink and another, administrator and administratrix of Snyder, deceased.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b653-6\">Mr. Justice Brewer,</author>\n<p id=\"AMj\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">That some kind of a trust was created by this declaration of McComb appears on the face of the paper itself, and from its language, taken in connection with the correspondence which induced and accompanied it, it- is also clear that it was an absolute, unqualified, unconditional trust which was declared by McComb. \"Whatever of doubt might from the mere \u2022 language of the declaration arise as to whether this trust was limited or qualified by some arrangement with Josiah Bard-well, and whatever suggestiveness there might be in such language, of a foundation for the claim now put forward, that this subscription and stock was by arrangement with Bardwell held primarily as security for advances made or to be made by McComb to him, and for the benefit of Snyder, as <em>eestui gue trust </em>only thereafter, and subject to this primary burden, is clearly displaced by the two letters which called for and accompanied the declaration. Bardwell\u2019s letter to McComb is a request that he acknowledge the holding to be in trust for Snyder, and because Snyder had paid therefor its cost and interest. That clearly is a request for an absolute arid unqualified declaration of trust, and because the property had' been fully paid for by Snyder to the original <em>eestui gue trust. </em>That McComb intended and supposed by this declaration that he was giving the absolute declaration' of trust requested is -evident from th\u00e9 letter which he wrote accompanying it, for in that he says \u201c if it is' not in conformity with your wishes in any manner, please return it to me with such instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>to be carried out as you shall be disposed to make.\u201d Iu other words, the transaction is this: Bardwell writes asking for an absolute' declaration of trust in behalf of Snyder; McComb sends this declaration, accompanying it with a letter saying that if this does not comply with your wishes, send it back with such changes as you desire. Evidently the reference to an arrangement in the declaration was for the purpose of identifying the stock and subscription; and that there might not arise any pretence that any part of the subscription and stock standing in his own name was held in trust for Snyder. He simply meant to identify the trust property as that which all along had stood in his name as trustee, and to guard against the assertion of. a trust in some other portion of the stock. If we go outside of the papers themselves, the testimony tends strongly to uphold the claim of plaintiffs that this was an absolute and unconditional trust. Bardwell did get from Snyder $45,000, as shown in this way: On April 22, 1869, Bardwell drew three drafts on Strang <em>&amp; </em>Snyder, in favor of McComb, for $15,000 each. On the same day this receipt was given by McComb:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">\u201c Received, Boston, April 22, 1869, of J. Bardwell his three drafts of $15,000 each, 30, 40, and 50 days\u2019 date, on Strang &amp; Snyder, New York, being in payment for-one-fourth interest in 10,000-share transaction in the stock of the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad Co., to be managed by John F. Tracy, as agreed between myself and said Tracy, through Smith, Randolph &amp; Co., of New York, as brokers, for the account of myself and Bardwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">\u201cH. S. McComb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">This was found among the papers of Mr. Snyder, with the following minute attached to it, signed by Mr. Snyder:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\u201c The three drafts mentioned in the foregoing receipt were paid by Strang <em>&amp; </em>Snyder, and by them charged to my account on their books after the transaction in Chicago and Rock Island Railroad Company\u2019s stock was closed. The whole or no part of the money or interest was returned to me, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>$42,000 was applied to the subscription to stock in the Southern Railroad Association, for which amount I hold H. $. McComb\u2019s receipt, as trustee, dated November 23, 1869.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\u201c Boston, January 23, 1870. C. B. Snyder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">McComb received and discounted these drafts, and sent the proceeds\u2018to Smith, Randolph <em>&amp; </em>Co., which, by (heir letter of May 6, amounted to $44,709.38. On August 4,1869, McComb gave Bardwell a'draft on Smith, Randolph &amp; Co. for $44,709, the exact amount of the deposit on May 6, the cents omitted; and on August 6 a check on the Bank of North America for $2500; and on the 15th of September wrote to Bardwell. stating, among other things, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">\u201c The net of your account is.....................'$36,719 80 '</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">From which deduct payment of................ 2,500 00</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Leaving due you and subject to call..........$34,219 89</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">\u201c Shall I pay your trustee call S. R. R. A. due the 20th inst. <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">\u201c Ever yours, H. S. McComb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">These transactions, including the letters, show that Snyder (or the -firm of Strang &amp; Snyder) advanced to Bardwell $45,000, and there is no testimony that it was ever repaid to Snyder, other than in this trust matter. The letter of September 15 also shows that McComb held money to the amount of $34,000 and over, subject to Bard well\u2019s call. It appears also that Bardwell was very much embarrassed in \u2022 October,' and that this embarrassment was known to McComb:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">The following is* one letter that passed between them:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">\u201c (Personal.) Bost\u00f3n,. <em>Oct. </em>5, 1869.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">\u201cMy Dear Friend McComb; I am in trouble, and.first to you I write. I left here Saturday night for New York, and returned Sunday; since Sunday I have not closed my eyes. I have been duped and swindled by that man Barry, and it is my own fault that makes the matter so much the worse. I had his honor pledged to me, and was credulous enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>believe. Since Sept. 23 I have paid $260,000 for him. From -a, sick bed he came to see me in New York Sunday when my worst fears were realized, and he owned that he had lost $120,000 in stocks. After talking with, him six hours I left, feeling disgusted and tired. I only fear now that I do not know the worst, he owes me $700,000 and I fear he has misapplied or used some $150,000 of acceptances, he said he had them on hand unused, but I have reason to think otherwise, when he-told me that there were no more drafts o.n us, and \u25a0that as it stood Friday, so it was and no more. I carn\u00e9 home to find his drafts for $350,000 drawn on Saturday, these of mine have gone back. The sufferings of hell cannot compare but unfavorably with mine, but I won\u2019t write more.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">\u201cYours always, J. Bardwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\u201c Don\u2019t say a word about this to any one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">With knowledge of Bardwell\u2019s condition, as shown by this letter, as well as otherwise, McComb g^ve this declaration of trust. Can it be believed that it would have been issued in that form, and sent in a letter accompanied with an implied promise to put it in any other form that might be desired, if at the time the stock was held by McComb as security for advances made, and to be made, to a man so financially embarrassed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Further, so far as appears from the testimony, McComb never suggested to Snyder, or, for that matter, to any one else, that this was other than an absolute and unqualified declaration of trust, until July 21, 1874, and then in this way. On June'3, 1874; Snyder wrote to McComb :</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\u201c I have unexpectedly been called on to pay $40,000, a debt of F. Skinner. <em>&amp; </em>Co. and myself, which I supposed was paid long since. Not owing anything, my means are all invested in. a way that I cannot reach them at present. I can get along with $30,000. What I want is for you to let me have in some way the above amount, ($30,000,) so that I can use it at once, and then you can reimburse yourself from the sale of consolidated bonds when they are issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>To which, on June 15, McComb replied as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\u201cI do not know how I can help you. I will do anything-I can consistently with the obligations that are already on me,, and hope to be able, at the meeting on Monday next, at New York, to suggest something that will relieve you, and not. hurt me. You can depend upon my doing everything I cart reasonably be expected to do in the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">On July 16, Snyder wrote again, and urgently, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201c I trust you will do me this favor, because I am really in a tight place and am borrowing the money from day to day, from my friends. I would not ask you for the favor if I could possibly get along without it. Will you help me ? Please let me know when you will be in N. Y. or where I can see you next week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In replying to this, on July 21,'McComb said :</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">\u201c I can send you the $30,000 Southern P. P. Ass\u2019n .paper, and will do it if you will return me the paper I signed, giving you so much of the benefits of the stock which was in my name as trustee for Mr. Bardwell, and which I held, by agreement from him, as collateral for advances made to him and P. Skinner <em>&amp; </em>Co., which advances more than cover all this, .stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">And this is the first intimation that the trust was not wholly for the benefit of Snyder. In addition, there is the testimony of Charles Marsh, that in the year 1873 he was in the office-of the Southern Pailro\u00e1d Association, in the city of New York, at a day on which there was to be a meeting of the directors, and that while there McComb came in, and after-saying good morning and passing the time of day, said: \u201c Now, gentlemen, to-day I am prepared to offer you cost and interest of your stock. I had to guarantee Mr. Snyder that, before he would take his at all; but this isn\u2019t anything you want to sell,-this stock.\u201d And again, the testimony of Prancis C. Cross that in June, 1874, he was present at a conversation between Snjffier and McComb, which was substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Mr. Snyder asked Mr. McComb to perform his agreement. in regard to the Southern Pailroad Association stock. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>McComb replied to Mr. Snyder that he had better keep it and do as the other gentlemen were about to do, put in some more money; that it was a good thing and was worth two for one. Mr. Snyder told him that he wished the money, as he desired to foster other interests that were pressing him. Mr. McComb said that he had no money, but he would let him have some notes to the extent of $30,000, and Mr. Snyder replied that he would. If the_notes were good he would use them and would carry the \"balance f\u00f3r a time. No time was stated, however. Mr. McComb told Mr. Snyder to come down to a meeting that was to be held \u2014 as to the time of the meeting I have no recollection\u2014if he would come there he would fix it up with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Further than that, on October 25, 1873, Edmund-F. Cutter wrote to McComb:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\u201c Are the interests of. F. S. <em>&amp; </em>C. in the Southern R. R\u2019d Association, on which you advanced' 60 M dollars, still intact, and are they worth the loan and principal <em>\u00cd </em>How does the 60 M of Mr. Snyder\u2019s stand affected ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">To which McComb replied as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u201cWilmington, Del., <em>October </em>27, 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"AQr\">\u201cE. F. Cutter, Esq., Boston, Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\u201c Dear Sir : The South\u2019n R. R.

McComb, <em>Pres.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">In June, 1875, Snyder began an action against McComb, in the city of, New York. It was an action at law to recover $75,000 on account of-the alleged conversion by McComb of this trust property to his own use. Mr. McComb\u2019s testimony was taken as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">\u201c Q. What has become of the original subscription mentioned in this letter ? A.

I ask you how that subscription was paid ? A. I pre sume it was paid by Mr. Bardwell to the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Subsequently the action was voluntarily dismissed by plain tiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Putting all these things together,, there can be no reasonable doubt as to the nature of the transaction. There was an ab solute and unqualified declaration of trust given by McOoml to Snyder for the amount of this subscription so far as it hao been paid, and the Circuit Court did not err in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Again, it is insisted that the.matters in dispute between the parties have been once determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the principle of <em>res fa'dicata </em>is invoked as \u00e1 defence to this saction. It appears that, after the voluntary dismissal of the action in the New York court, Snyder, in October, 1875, commenced a like action at law in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which was tried without a jury, and resulted in a judgment in favor of the defendant, on December 23, 1878. The original declaration was in five counts. To this the defendant filed an answer denying <em>\u201c </em>each and every allegation in each and every count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration,\u201d and specifically denying any indebtedness ; and, for a further, defence, he demurred to the first four counts. Thereafter,' by leave of the court, these first four counts were stricken out, and two substituted in their place. To this amended declaration the defendant filed an answer denying the allegations in the first two counts \u2014 the new portions of the declaration; and also, as a further defence, a demurrer to the third count \u2014 that being the fifth count in the original declaration. This amended declaration, in substance, alleged that the defendant, on July 16, 1869, had in his. possession $45,000 belonging to the plaintiff; that in consideration of plaintiff permitting such sum to remain in his (defendant\u2019s) hand, he would purchase for plaintiff stock in the Southern Railroad Association; and, further, that he would, if re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>quested, take the said shares of stock from plaintiff and pay~ him $45,000, with interest; that, relying upon such promise- and agreement, the plaintiff left the sum of $45,000 with defendant, but that he failed to purchase stock in the association ; and that he, plaintiff, thereupon demanded payment of the sum of $45,000 and interest, which was refused. The-second count was \u201c for money had and received,\u201d the bill of particulars attach\u00e9d being as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">\u201c <em>Bill of Particulars.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">(1) To cash retained by you to be applied to pur-</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">chase of stock in the Southern Railroad</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Association........................... $45,000 00</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">(2) To interest on same, July 15,1869, to October</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">29,1875.............................. 16,978 50</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">$61,978 50\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The third count, being the fifth in the original declaration, was an allegation of the conversion of six hundred shares of stock, and in these-words :</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">\u201cAnd the plaintiff further says that the defendant has. converted to his- own use six hundred shares of the capital stock of the Southern Railroad Association, a corporation duly established by the laws of the States of Mississippi and Tennessee, the property of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">The record of the proceedings in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts fails to show any ruling of the court on the-demurrer to this third count, and one of the counsel for the plaintiff in that action testified that by mutual consent this third count was abandoned, testimony which seems to be-supported by an extract from the brief of the defendant\u2019s counsel, in which it is stated \u201cthe count in tort has been abandoned.\u201d On the trial of that case the plaintiff made application to amend his declaration into a bill in equity, a bill, founded upon this trust, but such application was denied by the court, such denial being, within the statutes of Massachusetts as Well as the general practice, a matter of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>So that the case, as finally determined, was simply one at law for breach of a contract to invest in the \u25a0 stock of the .Southern Eailroad Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">This mere recital of the facts concerning that action at law seems sufficient answer to the plea of <em>res </em>judicata, for among the essentials of an estoppel by judgment is identity of the cause of action. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>Jefferson. County, </em>12 Kansas, 127; 2 Bonv. Law Dic. title \u201c Res Judicata.\u201d When an action at law for breach of a contract to invest in stocks fails because the testimony develops that the investment was made and a declaration of trust given in respect to the stock so purchased, it would seem strange to hold that such judgment is a bar to a suit in equity for a breach of the trust, especially when it appears from the records in the law case that an application to change the declaration info a, bill in equity in respect to the trust was denied. As was said in <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>County of Sac, </em>94 U. S. 351, 353: \u201c In all cases, therefore, where it is sought to apply the estoppel of a, judgment rendered upon one cause of action to matters arising in a suit upon a different cause of action, the inquiry must always be as to the point or question actually litigated and determined in the original action, not what might have been litigated and determined. Only upon such matters is the judgment conclusive in another action.\u201d What might have been determined in the Massachusetts court if the amendment, of the declaration had been permitted can only be conjectured <em>~ </em>what was determined was that no such contract as charged existed, or, if it existed, was broken. Copious extracts were in evidence in this case from the brief of the defendant\u2019s counsel in the Massachusetts case, which show that the defence relied upon was that no action at\u2019 law could be maintained in consequence of the disclosure of the trust receipt.. It is enough to quote these, which are but samples of others:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201c It is, of course, unnecessary to give any consideration to the \u2018 trust receipt,\u2019 except as it disproves the agreement alleged,, because \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\u201c (1.) It is not the contract alleged and declared on and for breach of which money is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>\u201c </em>(2.) Because its only scope and effect is to create a trust, for the enforcement of which no action of law can be brought, but only a remedy sought in equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\u201c It becomes wholly unnecessary, as it is entirely impracticable, to inquire, consider, or determine what anybody\u2019s rights may be under the trust created or declared on in this transaction</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201c When, if ever, a bill in equity shall be brought, and all parties in interest brought into court, that may be an interesting as it will be a necessary question. Till then it is enough that the trust created and acted upon for more than six years by all parties clearly negatives any other agreement concerning this original subscription, and necessitates a judgment for the defendant in this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Properly, therefore, the Circuit Court held against this claim of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">It is suggested that the plaintiffs have been guilty of laches; but in view of the fact that defendant, when called as a witness in the first law action, testified that the stock stood as it always had stood, and of the further fact that no breach of the trust was discovered until just before the commencement of this suit, this defence is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The final question is as to the measure of damages. The court charged the defendant with the amount invested by plaintiff, and recognized by the declaration of trust, to wit, $42,000, and interest. Both'parties challenge the question of correctness of this amount. The plaintiffs insist that McComb sold his own stock for $125 a share, and that, therefore, in the accounting he should be charged for the 800 shares held by him in trust for Snyder at that price per share, for which, sum, together with interest to date, a decree should be passed. The defendant claims that McComb never did anything with this trust stock, other than in the fair discharge of his duties as trustee; that, owing to causes over which he had no control, and for which he was not responsible, the stock finally ceased to be of any value, and, therefore, that his estate should not be called upon to account for anything. It become^ necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>to see exactly what McComb did with this stock. The Southern Railroad Association was the lessee of the Mississippi Central Railroad Company, and was incorporated for the purpose of taking a lease of and operating said road. This road extended from Jackson, Tennessee, to Canton, Mississippi; there it connected with the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern railroad, running from that place to New'-Grleans, Louisiana. McComb was a large holder of stock in that company. On November 8, 1811, he made an arrangement by which he sold to the Pennsylvania Company 14,000 shares in the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad Company, at $50 per share, and 5000 shares in the Southern Railroad Association at $125 a share. At the same time he transferred to the Pennsylvania Company an additional 14,000 shares in the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern railroad, and 5000 shares in the Southern Railroad Association. Included in this last 5000 shares was the 800 shares standing in the name of McComb as trustee, which were transferred by an endorsement on the' certificates, vesting apparently an absolute title in the Pennsylvania Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">' The stock which he sold was. his own, and the whole cash payment, $1,325,000, passed to him, and, so far as appears, was appropriated to his own uses. By means of this transfer the Pennsylvania Company obtained control of the Southern Railroad Association, as well as'of the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad Company. The transaction between McComb and the Pennsylvania Company is evidenced by three documents, executed on November 8, 1871, but though evidenced by these separate instruments, there was manifestly but a single transaction by which' McComb transferred to the Pennsylvania Company the control of these two corporations, accomplishing this vesting of control by the sale of his own stock, at a large price, and a transfer of this trustee and other stock, without receiving a dollar.' Obviously it was the use of this latter stock that enabled him to sell his own. If this-were all, the obligation to account would unquestionably reach to $125 per share; but the purchase of McComb\u2019s stock was subject to an obligation tt&gt; repurchase .at the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>two years, at the same price and thirty per cent advance, less dividends received by the company. \u2022 This condition may well be deemed to have entered largely into the fixing of the price,, and prevents that price from being a fair test of the value.. Neither should one or two extravagant statements made by McComb, apparently to quiet any fears on the part of Snyder-as to his investment and to continue his confidence therein,, be considered sufficient to justify placing any such valuation on the stock. On the other hand, it is quite clear, that the-stock was worth at least what it had cost at the time of the-trust declaration. Indeed, we do not think this is seriously questioned by the defendant. Little need be said with respect to the contention of defendant, that McComb did no more-with this stock than a trustee might rightfully do, and that he-used it simply to induce the Pennsylvania Company to take-hold of this association, and manage it for the best interests-of all the stockholders. On the contrary, it is more correct to-say that he used this stock to induce the Pennsylvania Company to buy his own, or at least to increase the price at which it bought. Evidently the Pennsylvania Company wanted the-control, and for that end a majority of the shares. It might not have been willing to pay $125 a share if it had been, compelled to buy the 10,000 shares; but -would naturally. be&gt; willing to pay a larger price for half if the other half could be-placed in its-hands without cost, and thus the control obtained.. Yery likely the <em>cestui que trust </em>would have preferred $125 in cash to -the* promise of even the Pennsylvania Company to-manage the interests of the association for the benefit of all stockholders..</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Ve think, taking all the circumstances into consideration,, that the Circuit Court reached as nearly as possible what, justice demands when it awarded a return of the amount for which McComb acknowledged himself a trustee and interest.. The decree will, therefore, be</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">' <em>Affirmed. The costs of this court will be equally divided', between the parties.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
