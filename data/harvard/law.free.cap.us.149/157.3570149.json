and such construction made it necessary to use high explosives, such as dynamite, and machinery run by electricity, steam and compressed air, which required sober, skilled labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\">That the defendants, except the county commissioners, at and near Tunnel City, and along the line of the railroad so being constructed by the plaintiff, \u201cfor several months last past, have been running retail drinking and lager-beer saloons, and selling spirituous, malt and fermented liquors to the said employ\u00e9s of said plaintiff; and that the said sales of said liquors to said employ\u00e9s have frequently and continuously caused drunkenness of said employ\u00e9s; and that' the said drunkenness incapacitated the said employ\u00e9s, so that they were not able to perform the labor assigned to them, and the labor they were expected to do and for which they were employed ; and that the said drunkenness increased the risk and danger incident to the necessary use of the said explosives and machinery, and increased the danger to the employ\u00e9s employed in constructing the road as aforesaid, and to the officers and agents of said plaintiff, and has caused and is causing many of-said employ\u00e9s to quit their said employment on account thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">\u2022 That \u201cduring the four months last past the said railroad company has employed and transported, in and upon said work at and near Tunnel City, in Kittitass County, about eight thousand men, at an average expense of ten dollars for each man ; that about four thousand of said men so employed, for the reason aforesaid, quit and left the work of said plaintiff \u201d ; and that the plaintiff, by reason of such sales of liquors to its employ\u00e9s, had been prevented from obtaining and retaining enough employ\u00e9s to complete its road as far as Tacoma during the present year, and would be obliged to continue the work during the coming winter, and at an increased expense of more than $100,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>That .\u201c said saloons have been so conducted, and drunkenness and gambling permitted and carried on to such an extent, that they, the said saloons, have been for months and are now public nuisances, and also a private nuisance in so far as the said plaintiff is concerned;

and that the said plaintiff, by said saloons and the sale of intoxicating liquors therein to said employ\u00e9s, and said drunkenness and said gambling, has sustained great and irreparable injury.?\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-3\">That \u201c said saloons and the said beer halls have been and are now running, and selling at retail said intoxicating liquors as aforesaid to employ\u00e9s of the plaintiff and others, without a license, and without any right' or authority so to do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-4\">That \u201csaid saloons during the past have, and will in the future, unless enjoined, continuously and constantly continue to sell said intoxicating liquors to said employ\u00e9s, and constantly and continually permit said drunkenness, and maintain said gambling houses and said public and said private nuisances, to the great injury, danger, discomfiture and annoyance of the said plaintiff and the said plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9s and the said property of plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">That the saloons aforesaid were on unsurveyed lands, owned one half by the plaintiff and the other half by the United States, and were run and maintained under licenses issued by the county commissioners without right or authority; that the other defendants intended to apply, and were now. fraudulently applying, to the county commissioners for licenses to sell intoxicating liquors at retail, without filing the consent, of the owners of the lands, as required by law; that the county commissioners, knowing this, intended to grant such licenses; and that \u201c the granting of said licenses will greatly complicate said matters, and injure and damage said plaintiff, and will deprive plaintiff to a great extent, if not absolutely, of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>remedy against said defendants, and cause the plaintiff great and irreparable damage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-4\">That the defendants were insolvent and unable to respond in damages;

The plaintiff thereupon, on March 7, 1889, appealeu toothis court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-7\"><em>Mr. James MeWaught, Mr. A. H.

May </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-8\">The allegations in the bill bring the cause within the definition of- nuisance, both at common law and under the Code of Washington Territory. These nuisances are shown to -be continuous. It is admitted that the appellees are insolvent. All this affords good reason for an appeal to a court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-9\">These nuisances were both public and private in their character, inasmuch as they were an annoyance to, and an interference with, both private and public rights and interests. Code Wash. Ter., \u00a7\u00a7 1235, 1243, 1247; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>State, </em>12 Vroom, (41 N. J. Law,) 6. See also c. 50 of this Code, which, regulates the proceedings in civil actions for damages, and other remedies. From these provisions it will be seen, that it-recognizes nuisances both as. defined by the common law and by the statute. The statutory remedies were cumulative, butAvere like those given by the common law and in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-10\">The particular nuisances complained of were the result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the sale of intoxicating liquors, and of the maintenance of gambling bouses. A right of action is given by the Code to any one who may be injured by the sale .of intoxicating liquors. \u00a7\u00a7 2059-2061. These sections may fairly be regarded as <em>in pari materia </em>with the other sections already referred to. By fair construction of \u00a7 2059 of the Code, the remedy here sought is given; but \u00a7\u00a7 605, 606,.providing for an action for damages and for other and further relief, and for a writ of injunction when an action at law is inadequate, when considered in connectionswith \u00a7 2059, place this beyond controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-4\">And further, it is well settled in general equity jurisprudence, that such jurisdiction exists to prevent a multiplicity of suits ; to prevent the continuance, of a wrong which cannot be remedied at law; and where the defendants are' insolvent and unable to respond in compensation for damages.

Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 920, 923, 925, 927.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-5\">IN o appearance for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b181-6\">Mr. Justice Gray,</author>\n<p id=\"AtF\">after stating the case, deliver\u00e9d the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The Northern Pacific Railroad Company asks for an injunction against the county commissioners and the other defendants, because the latter, under pretended licenses from the former, keep and maintain gambling and drinking saloons at the village of Tunnel City and along the line of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad, and there sell intoxicating liquors at retail to the plaintiff\u2019s employes, and thereby make them drunk and unfit to work under their several contracts with the plaintiff, and thus increase the danger to its agents and employes from the use of the machinery and explosives required in constructing its railroad, cause many of the employ\u00e9s to quit its employment, delay and increase the expense of constructing its. railroad, seriously annoy its agents and their families, and consequently diminish the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">It is not alleged that the defendants have conspired or intend to injure the plaintiff\u2019s property or business, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>prevent the plaintiff\u2019s workmen from performing their contracts' of service. Nor is it alleged that any one of the saloons kept by the several defendants is a disorderly house, which, by reason of noises in or about it, or otherwise, is, a nuisance to property in the neighborhood. The whole complaint is based upon the theory that by the general principles of equity jurisprudence, and by the provisions of the Code of Washington Territory, the saloons kept by the defendants severally are, by reason of the sales of intoxicating liquors therein to the plaintiff\u2019s workmen, and their consequent drunkenness and incapacity to work, public nuisances, and cause special damage to the plaintiff, to prevent the repetition and continuance of which it is entitled to an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">But the usual, and at the suit of a corporation the only, ground on which, independently of express statute, a court of equity will grant an injunction in a private action for a nuisance is special injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property. 3 Bl. Com. 216; <em>Robinson </em>v. Kilvert, 41 Ch. D. 88; <em>Georgetown </em>v. <em>Alexandria Canal Co., </em>12 Pet. 91, 99. No employer has such a property in his workmen, or in their services, that he can, under the ordinary jurisdiction of a court of chancery, maintain a suit, as for a nuisance, against the keeper of a house at which they voluntarily buy intoxicating liquors, and thereby get so drunk as to be unfit for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Nor is there anything in the provisions of the Code of the Territory, cited in behalf of the plaintiff, which enlarges the equitable jurisdiction in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">By that code, a nuisance, other than the obstruction of a highway, or of navigable or running waters, is defined to be \u201c whatever is injurious to health, or indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstacle to the free use of property, so as to essentially interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of the life and property \u201d ; and again, <em>\u201c </em>unlawfully doing an act, or omitting to perform a duty, which act or omission either annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose,, health or safety of others, offends decency, or in any way renders other persons insecure in life, or in the use of property \u201d; \u201c the remedies against a public nuisance are indictment or civil action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>or abatement \u201d ; and an action for damages may be brought, and an injunction or abatement obtained, \u201cby any person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance.\u201d Secs. 605, 606,\u2019 1235, 1242. As a corporation cannot be said to have life or health or senses, the only ground on which it can obtain either damages or an injunction, under these provisions, is injury to its property. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">.The code further provides, in section 1247, that all houses of ill fame; \u201c all public houses. or places of resort where gambling, is carried on or permitted; all houses or places within any- city, town or village, or upon. any public road dr highway, where, drinking, gambling, fighting or breaches-of th\u00e9 -peace ar\u00e9 carri\u00e9d on or permitted\u201d ; and.all opium dens ; are. nuisances, and may be abated, and the owners or keepers thereof punished. This section. is aimed at nuisances which affect the public morals or the-public peace, and affords no countenance for a private action, unless by an owner of property, the use or enjoyment of which is specially .affected by the existence of such a nuisance in its immediate neighborhood. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Columbus, </em>5 Cranch C. C. 304; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>State, </em>12 Vroom, (41 N. J. Law,) 6; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Whitridge, </em>11 Maryland, 128; <em>Inchbald </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>L. R. 4 Ch. 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The Code of Washington Territory contains no enactment, such as exists in some States, declaring all houses or tenements kept for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors to be common nuisances, and conferring jurisdiction in equity to restrain them by injunction, at the suit of the district attorney or of a private citizen'.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The plaintiff relies on section 2059, which provides that \u201c any husband, wife, child, parent, guardian, employe[r ?], or other person who shall be injured in person or. property, or means of support, by any intoxicated person, or in consequence of the intoxication, habitual or otherwise, of any person, shall have a right of action in his or her own name, severally or jointly, against any person or persons who shall, by selling or giving intoxicating liquors, have caused the intoxication in whole, or in part, of such person,\u201d as well as against the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of the building or premises in which the liquors are sold, if ho&gt; has leased it with knowledge that such liquors are to be there-sold, or has knowingly permitted their sale therein. But this-section, creating a-new liability, unknown to the common law,, is to be strictly construed, and is not to be extended beyond the clear import of its terms; and, as the only remedy which it gives is an action against the seller of the liquor, or against-the owner-of the place where it is sold, to recover damages; suffered by reason of sales to particular persons, it cannot becoristrued as authorizing an injunction to prevent the use of the building for future sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The complaint in this case has no foundation, in common law or statute, in principle or precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed~</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
