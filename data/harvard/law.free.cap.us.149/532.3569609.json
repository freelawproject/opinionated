The defendant claimed that articles are not materials for hat trimmings, when the imported articles bear the commercial name of ribbons, or belong to that commercial class; that, being made of silk, the imported articles in question fell within Schedule L; and, that if the jury believed that the articles belonged to the class commercially distinguished under the general name of ribbons, then the plaintiffs could not recover, even if their chief use was as trimmings for hats, as claimed by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">The issues thus raised were submitted to the jury in a charge, the correctness of which is the subject of our judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\">The essential deliverances of the court, which determined-the verdict of the jury, were in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-9\">\u201c Upon the uncontroverted proofs in this case, ribbons are trimmings. The issue here is, what kind of trimmings are the particular ribbons in controversy? Are they trimmings chiefly for hats, bonnets, or hoods?

The following is a summary of his argument.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-6\">It is with no intention of questioning the high authority of this court, and with no desire to transgress the limits of proper discussion at this bar, that I assert that the construction contended for by the importers is not authorized by the language-alone of the act of March 3, 1883. I, therefore, r\u00e9quest that I may be permitted in the first instancp to argue the question involved as an original one, before proceeding to--discuss the. two cases which. it is insisted in behalf, of the importers qre decisive of those at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-7\">The^ articles in question are within the silk schedule of'the tariff act of March 3, 1883, and are also within the terms of the act of February 8, 1875. To classify them under the hat-material clause an inquiry has been made into the <em>use </em>of the materials, and it having been ascertained, that they were used for many purposes, the inquiry was then extended to their so-called <em>chief </em>use. In behalf of the United States,' it is insisted that there is a difference between, an <em>article </em>and a <em>material; </em>that one is nominative, distinctive in its character, implying the idea of a completed, independent thing, while the other is general, embracing the substance from which... articles aye made. The words \u201c braids, plaits, fiats, laces, trimmings, tissues, willow sheets and'-squares,\u201d each denominate a<em>n article </em>as distinguished from the materials of which it is made; this requires that to the word trimmings \u201d should be given its ordinary meaning, -which is, an <em>article </em>used, as an ornamental fitting; therefore, evidence as to the chief use of the <em>materials </em>from which trimmings are made is beyond the scope of the statute. Attention is called to the fact that no attempt was' made to limit this inquiry to the date .of the act of 1883,' and prior thereto, <em>(Eossman </em>v. Hodden, 145 U. S. 561, 570,) but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>in the cases decided against the government the inquiry related to the date of the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-4\">The doctrine of <em>chief use </em>is not found in the .statute, is impracticable in application, and renders the law uncertain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-5\">The words \u201cnot specially enumerated as provided for in this act\u201d limit and qualify the words \u201cother substance or material \u201d and not the words \u201c braids, plaits, flats, laces, trimmings, tissues, willow sheets and squares,\u201d and therefore the articles in controversy are not entitled to classification under this clause even if it be admitted, for sake of argument, that they are \u201c trimmings \u201d used for making or ornamenting hats, bonnets and hoods, because they are not composed of straw, chip, grass or any other material not specially enumerated, but. on the contrary are composed of silk, a substance or material which is specially provided for in the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-6\">\u25a0 The act of February 8, 1875, established a rule of classification for all goods made of silk or of which silk is the component material of chief .value, with certain exceptions not embracing the articles in controversy. This act is yet in force, except as to rates of duty established by act of March 3, 1883. This latter act was only intended and declared to be a substitute for Title 33 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, of which the act of February 8,1883, never formed a part. Repeals by implication are not favored.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-7\">In each of the cases at bar, it being conceded that the goods were made either of silk or of silk as their component material of chief value, it follows .that they are within the silk clause, and therefore, so far, at least, subject to the duty at the rate of 50 per centum ad valorem. The question then arises, are they also within the hat-material paragraph, and hence also subject to the 20 per centum rate ? That question was left to the jury in the <em>Cadwalader </em>and <em>JJartranft </em>cases. In the <em>Walker </em>case the jury was instructed to bring in a verdict for defendant if they found the goods were composed of silk or of silk as their component material of chief value. It being conceded that they were so composed, that instruction ended the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The argument then, deals with these two' questions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">First. Are the goods classifiable for duty under th\u00bf hat-material clause of the act of 1883.?</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-6\">Second. If both the hat-material clause and the silk clause of 1883 are literally applicable to the given articles, which clause prescribes the legal rate of duty ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-7\">The question of predominant or chief use is one' not susceptible of proof by expert or opinion evidence. In these cases the inquiry was not what the articles were, for what they were purchased, or of what composed, nor yet to what .use they were adapted, but <em>to what use they were the more generally put. </em>. The witnesses, being importers or e\u2019mploy\u00e9s of importers, could have no familiar knowledge of the actions or conduct of consumers merely because they were employed in such; walks of life. There is a difference between evidence of the fact that any given article has been put to a certain use, and evidence that a larger quaiitity of the article is consumed in the; one use than in any other, especially when predicated as in these cases, of articled used for many purposes, and throughout the country, and in different quantities at different times. Herein lies the difference between guessing and expert opinion, which latter, <em>within the limits of personal observation </em>or study, is deemed a relevant fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-8\">The popular or received import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of public laws as well as of private transactions. <em>Maillard </em>v. Lawrence, 16 How. 251. According to this test, even upon the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 own witnesses, the articles in dispute are popularly known as ribbons, chinas and marcelines. This brings the cases squarely within <em>Schmeider </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>113 U. S. 645, 647, 648.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-9\">The doctrine of chief use as applied in the <em>Gadwalader </em>and <em>Hartranft </em>cases has never received the approval of this court. In the <em>Langfeld </em>case (125 U. S. 128) where the goods in controversy were velvet ribbons, the court assures us that \u201c there was no controversy in the evidence as to whether these velvet ribbons were or were not trimmings; all the witnesses agreed. that they were.\u201d (p. 133.) In. deciding that case the'court meant-only to hold that the ordinary habitual use of the article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>should be considered, and'this was not to be defeated by proof of a single or occasional use for some other purpose..</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-4\">Although in the <em>Edelhoff </em>case (132 U. S. 614) it is said that the words \u201cnot specialty enunlerated or provided for in this act \u201d relate to the eight articles, (braids, plaits, flats,, etc.,) and not to the words \u201c hats, bonnets, and hoods,!\u2019 it is submitted that they should be held to limit and modify specialty the words, \u201c-other substance or material \u201d and that a \u201c trimming,\u201d used for <em>making </em>or ornamenting, a hat or hood could be classified under this clause, <em>only </em>when composed of the materials specialty enumerated, or of some \u201c other substance or. material \u201d that is not specially enumerated or .provided for elsewhere in the act. If the article to be classified is found to be a trimming composed of none of the substances named,- but of a substance or material specialty, enumerated or provided for, in the act, it is not within this clause of the' statute, and the. court should have directed a verdict for the .government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-5\">In. cases at bar the goods are composed Wholly or partly of silk. In Schedule L a <em>substance </em>or <em>material </em>known as \u201c silk \u201d is both \u201cenumerated.\u201d and \u201cprovided for\u201d in the act. It follows that goods composed of such \u2022 substanee or material cannot property be classified under the hat-material clause, wherever else they may belong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-6\">\u25a0The word \u201ctrimmings\u201d is property defined as \u201canything used for decoration or finish; an ornamental fitting- of any sort; usually in the plural: as the -trimmings of a harness or pf a hat...... Hence any accessory or accompaniment, usually in the plural.\u201d Cent. Dictionary, <em>sub. </em>\u201ctrimming;\u201d In the <em>.Hartranft </em>and <em>Cadwalader </em>cases, the jury were instructed'that they should not give, the term \u2018^trimmings\u201d any technical or particular commercial meaning. They were substantially told that. the question was whether the goods in controversy were \u201c materials out of which trimmings for hats were mad\u00bf.\u201d This'was a misconception of the language of the clause in question. T\u00a3 the court shall hold that the words \u201cnot specialty enumerated or provided for\u201d refer to and limit the words \u201csubstance or material,\u201d then, practically, all the\u2019 instructions in the <em>Cadwalader </em>and <em>Harrtranft </em>cases were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>erroneous and the action in the <em>Walker </em>case correct; and upon such a holding there is an end to the-\u00a3\u00a3 hat-material\u201d controversy.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-13\"> Together with this case were argued the cases of <em>Walker </em>v. Seeberger, No. 161, <em>post, </em>p. 541, and <em>Hartranft </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>No. 860, <em>post, </em>p. 544.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b559-5\">Mu. Justice Shirks,</author>\n<p id=\"AeB\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It will be observed that the court below was- controlled in its charge by the decision of this court in the case of <em>Hartranft </em>v. Langfeld, 125 U. S. 128, and construed that decision as ruling that, if the imported articles were trimmings, and were more generally used for the ornamentation of hats 'than for any other purpose, then such articles must be regarded as coming within Schedule N of the tariff act of 1883, and subject to a duty of 20 per centum.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">An examination of that case, in the light of the extended criticism bestowed upon it in the briefs filed in the present case,satisfies us that the court below did not misinterpret the decision. The case was, in all important respects, like the present one. It was an action by an importer to recover an alleged illegal excess of duties, and wherein ribbons made of silk and cotton, of which silk ivas the material of chief value, were the articles in question. The testimony on the part of the plaintiff tended to show that the ribbons were chiefly used in making or ornamenting hats, bonnets, and hoods, but that they might be, and sometimes were, used for trimming dresses. The testimony on the part of the defendant tended to show that they were dress trimmings equally with hat trimmings, and were commonly used as much for the one purpose as the other. In this state of the evidence the trial court charged the jury thus : \u201c It is the use to'which these articles are chiefly adapted, and for which they are used, that determines their character within the meaning of this clause of the tariff act. . - . . It is the predominant use to-which articles are applied that determines the character. . . . You will, therefore,, determine to which use these articles in question are chiefly devoted. If they are hat trimmings, and used for making and ornamenting hats, then the' rate of duty was excessive. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\"The question is simply and purely one of fact, namely, what is the predominant use to which these articles are de~voted <em>% </em>As you determine that question you will return your verdict.\u201d These instructions were approved by this court, and \u201cthe judgment of the court below in favor of the importer was -affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">It is quite apparent tfiat if the law was Correctly laid down in <em>Hartranft </em>v. Langfeld, the court below, in the present case, \u2022did not err in its treatment of the subject. Substantially the \u00abame question came afterwards before this court in the case of <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Edelhoff, </em>132 U. S. 614, on error to the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York. _ Again the question was as to the correct classification, under the act of March 3, 1883, of ribbons composed of silk and cotton, in which silk was the component material of chief value. The court below gave peremptory instructions to the jury to find for the plaintiff, the undisputed evidence being that the articles in question were used exclusively as trimmings for ornamenting hats and bonnets, and had a commercial value only for that purpose. And this action of the trial court was approved by this court in an elaborate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">It will be noticed that the case of <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Edelhoff </em>differs from the case of <em>Hartranft </em>v. Langfeld, and from the present case, in the particular that the fact was conceded that the ribbons in question were exclusively used for hat trimmings, and that question was not submitted to the jury; whereas in the other cases there was conflicting evidence as to the use made of the ribbons, and it was submitted to the jury to find what was the chief or predominant use made of the articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In view of these decisions of this court, it is evident that the court below, in the present case, cannot be convicted of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">A very earnest and able effort has been made, on behalf of the government, to lead us to reconsider the doctrine of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We have read with care the elaborate briefs submitted to us by the Solicitor General, but as we are unable to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the conclusions there urged upon ,us, nothing would he gained, by a minute discussion of the several arguments advanced. If the subject had come before us unembarrassed by previous decisions it would have been worthy of a more thorough discus\u201esion. As it is, we are content to abide by the views that have-heretofore prevailed in this court, expressed in two unanimous. ' decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The judgment of the court below is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\n<em>Affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b561-7\">Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Brown concurred in the judgment for reasons stated in the dissenting opinion in <em>Hartranft </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>No. 860, <em>post, </em>544.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
