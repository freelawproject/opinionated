On the 25th day of January, 1929, the claimant filed a receipt acknowledging the payment to him by the Bethlehem Steel Company of the sum of $131.15 in settlement of all amounts due for compensation on account of the above mentioned award.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">The claimant, on November 15th, 1929, filed a petition, alleging that he had suffered a permanent disability as a result of the injuries sustained by him, and asked that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>be reopened that the nature and extent of bis injury might be determined. After a hearing thereon, the commission by its order denied bis petition, or refused to reopen the case, and from that order the claimant appealed to the Baltimore City Court. The appellee filed a motion therein to dismiss his appeal, limiting its appearance to the purposes of the motion. The court, after a hearing thereon, granted its motion and dismissed the appeal. It is from that order, dismissing the appeal, that the appeal to this court was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The motion filed by the appellee in the Baltimore City Court to dismiss the appeal from the commission was upon the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to hear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Section 56 of article 101 of the Code of Public General Laws of this state provides that \u201cany employer, employee, beneficiary or person feeling aggrieved by any decision of the commission affecting his interests under this article may have the same reviewed by a proceeding in the nature of an appeal and initiated in the Circuit Court of the County or in the Common Law Courts of Baltimore City having jurisdiction over the place where the accident occurred or over the person appealing from such decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The language of this statute is, we think, clear and specific as to the courts to which jurisdiction is thereby given to review, on appeal, the action of the State Industrial Accident Commission in any given case. It is either the court \u201chaving jurisdiction over the place where the accident occurred,\u201d ox the court having jurisdiction \u201cover the person appealing from such decision\u201d of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">In this ease, the accident occurred in Baltimore County, and not in the city, and the Baltimore City Court was without jurisdiction over the person appealing, who was a resident of Baltimore County. To hold that the Baltimore City Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal from the Industrial Accident Commission, we would have to ignore the plain and simple provisions of the statute, as well as its object and purpose, for if it were within the power of the claimant in this case to appeal to the Baltimore City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Court, there would seem to be nothing to prevent him from appealing to the circuit court for any county of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">As stated by this court in <em>Brenner v. Brenner, 127 Md. </em>189, 96 A. 287, 288, in construing the section of the Code now before us, the object and purpose of this legislation was, \u201cin cases of injury to employees, to provide a speedy and inexpensive method by which compensation might be made to them or those dependent upon them without the delay of long and tedious litigation, and at a minimum of cost.\u201d If persons and corporations were not restricted by the provisions of the statute and were allowed to appeal to far off courts of the state, it would, in some instances at least, defeat the above stated object and purpose of the statute. The court, we think, acted properly in dismissing the appeal, and the order appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
