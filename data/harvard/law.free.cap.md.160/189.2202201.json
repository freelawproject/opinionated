Store\u201d for injuries sustained by the plaintiff as a result of a practical joke perpetrated by it. Under the decisions of this court damages may be recovered for physical injuries caused by fright or shock. <em>Baltimore City Passenger Ry. Co. v. Kemp, </em>61 Md. 80; <em>Green v. Shoemaker, </em>111 Md. 69, 73 A. 688; <em>Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Harris, </em>121 Md. 254, 88 A. 282; <em>Patapsco Loan Co. v. Hobbs, </em>129 Md. 9, 98 A. 239; <em>Boh</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>len\u2019s Studies in the Law of Torts, </em>288-290. The declaration as drawn is in accord with the cases cited, and the demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">There was no evidence to support the facts alleged in the' declaration as against the defendant and employer, and, if there had been a variance prayer for an instructed verdict for the defendant on the ground that no legally sufficient evidence had been offered to support the allegations contained in the declaration, the trial court should and wordd have granted it, and the plaintiff would have been obliged to submit to a verdict against her, to have <em>non prossed </em>her case, or to have amended her declaration to conform with the legally sufficient facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">There was evidence from which the jury might have found, as they did, that the plaintiff had ordered and expected to receive from the defendant a loaf of bread, and that in sending the bread to her home the defendant\u2019s manager, in the performance of his duty while acting within the scope of his employment, had carelessly and negligently performed his duty in substituting by mistake the dead rat for the loaf of bread, and that when the plaintiff opened the package containing the dead rat the sight of it. so frightened and shocked her that she became a \u201cnervous wreck.\u201d The evidence was. so contradictory that any verdict, would have had ample evidence to support it, but it is not the province of this court to express an opinion as to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The rule, as stated in <em>Cate v. Schaum, </em>51 Md. 299, 308, is that \u201cthe master is responsible for the wrongful acts of his servant, even though they be wilful, or reckless, if the act done by the servant be within the scope of his employment, and in furtherance of his master\u2019s business.\u201d And as expressed in <em>Evans v. Davidson, </em>53 Md. 245, 249 : \u201cIf the servant be acting at the time in the course of his master\u2019s service and for his master\u2019s benefit, within the scope of his employment, then his act, though wrongful or negligent, is to be treated as that of the master, although no express command or privity of the master be shown.\u201d See <em>Consolidated Ry. Co. v. Pierce, </em>89 Md. 495, 502, 43 A. 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>For the reasons herein stated, we find no error in the refusal of the defendant\u2019s prayers for a directed verdict in its favor, either on the question of the legal sufficiency of all the evidence or that the defendant\u2019s manager was not acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The appellant insists in its brief, and it was ably and forcibly argued, that <em>Carroll v. Hillendale Golf Club, </em>156 Md. 542, 144 A. 693, is decisive of this case. If the evidence in the instant case had not. exceeded the bounds of the declaration, the same principle would have controlled in both cases, and that is, as <em>Pollock </em>(quoting Baron Parke) expresses it, each servant would have been engaged in a \u201cfrolic of his own,\u201d for which the master would not have been responsible. All of the evidence which fits the declaration makes of the incident a practical joke perpetrated by West, the manager, for which the defendant could not have been held, What made this case different from <em>Carroll v. Hillendale Golf Club </em>was the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s husband that West said to him shortly after the boy delivered the package: \u201cI am sorry, Mr. Roch, I made a mistake. ' I sent your wife the wrong package\u201d; which was substantially the same statement made to her mother. If this admission had not gotten into the case there would have been nothing to tie the act complained of to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The exception to all rulings on the prayers adverse to the defendant included the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s only (damage) prayer, which was not discussed in the brief. It was the form repeatedly approved by this court, and is here again approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
