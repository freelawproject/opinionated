A play named \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front,\u201d one not listed but constituting an additional play under the contract, was offered to the complainant upon special terms stated, and not accepted within a time limited in the offer, the complainant demanding the privilege of a preliminary screening of the film before being required to decide to accept or reject it; and then, before any exhibition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the producer and distributors exercised their right under the contract to withdraw and exclude the particular play as a road show. In this case, too, the injunction was issued upon the bill of complaint, answers and exhibits and demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">This court finds the action erroneous for the reasons stated with reference to similar facts in the last preceding opinion, and conclude dhat the bill could not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\n<em>Order reversed and bill of complaint dismissed, with costs to the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
