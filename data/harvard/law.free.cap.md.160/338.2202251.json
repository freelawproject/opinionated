The property was acquired by the vendor in 1923 by conveyance from the trustee under a deed of trust executed, in 1915, by Harry P. Golds-borough and wife, vesting a large estate in the trustee for the joint benefit of the grantors for life, with remainder to their ten children. The deed from the trustee to the present cendor was executed about two years after both of the life estates granted by the deed of trust had expired. A doubt has been expressed by the present purchaser as to whether the trustee was authorized to make a sale of the property at that time. It appears from the agreed statement of facts in the record that the trustee had no earlier opportunity to make the sale advantageously, and that the property was not susceptible of an equal division in accordance with the terms of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The following are the only provisions of the deed of trust which need be quoted for the purposes of this inquiry. .</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\u201cUpon the death of the last survivor of the grantors herein this trust shall forthwith terminate and the entire estate shall be equally divided among the ten children of the said Harry P. Goldsborough and Helena Goldsborough, his wife, share and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">\u201cThe said trustee shall not be required to give bond for the faithful performance of his trust and shall have full power at any or all times to sell and dispose of any of the property, real, personal and mixed, hereby conveyed to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>or which may at any time be a portion of this estate with the sanction of any court nor shall any purchaser from him in any manner be required to look to the application of the purchase money. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The suggestion that the trustee may have been without power to sell the property after the'death of the surviving grantor is based upon the provision that the trust should then terminate. But that provision must be construed in relation to the direction, which immediately follows it, that the estate should be equally divided among the remaindermen. The duty of making the division was clearly intended to be performed by the trustee. It was essential to the complete fulfillment of the trust which the deed created. An equal division, with respect to the real estate in question, could be accomplished\u2019 only by a sale and distribution of the proceeds. \u201cThe full power\u201d conferred upon the trustee \u201cat any or all times to sell and dispose of any of the property\u201d conveyed by the deed of trust was amply sufficient to validate his sale and conveyance of the title proffered in this proceeding. The conclusion to that effect is required by the evident intent of the deed of trust, which is the controlling consideration and is in accord with principles of interpretation which this court has heretofore approved. <em>Taylor v.
