Neither the pleadings nor the proceedings at the trial are a part' of the record. From the stipulation it appears that prior to January 1, 1898, when the new charter of the city of New York took effect, the plaintiff was a doorman in the park department, and by operation of the charter he became a doorman in the police department of the city of New York; that he has been paid a salary of $730 per annum, which was the amount received by him as doorman in the park department prior to the consolidation of the police of the park department with the police of the city of New York, and he brought this action to recover from the city of New York the difference between the amount that he had received and the salary attached to the position of doorman in the police department; that, the action having come on for trial at a trial term of this court before a jury, the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff, as prayed for in the complaint. The defendant thereupon moved for a new trial or for a reduction of the verdict. The motion for a new trial was denied, but the verdict was reduced upon the ground that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the sum of $730, the salary received by the plaintiff as a doorman in the park department prior to the consolidation, plus three annual additions, of $90 each, so that for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the third year after such consolidation the plaintiff\u2019s salary would be $1,000. The respective parties agreed that the only question to be determined on this appeal is whether the plaintiff is entitled to be paid the salary of $1,000 a year from the 1st day of January, 1898, or whether the salary of $1,000 a year attached to the office of doorman in said department should be made uniform within three years from January 1, 1898, by equal annual payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">The question presented arises under section 299 of the charter of the city of New York (chapter 378, Laws 1897). Section 277 of the charter provides that \u201cthe members of the police force of the city of New York and the members of the police force appointed by the commissioners of public parks in said city, as said forces are provided for by section 265 and 690 of the New York City consolidation act of 1882, and by the statutes amendatory of and supplementary to said sections, who shall be such members of said forces respectively when this act takes effect, shall be members of the police force, specified in section 276 of this act.\u201d Section 276 of the charter provides that the uniform force shall include \u201cdoormen of police, not exceeding two in number to each fifty of the total number of patrolmen.\u201d The plaintiff thus became on the 1st day of January, 1898, a doorman in the police force of the city of New York. Section 299 of the charter first makes provision for the salaries of officers and members of the police force, and provides that the salary of each doorman shall be $1,000 per year. The section then provides for the classification of the members of the police force of the various municipalities consolidated by the new charter into the city of New York, and continues: \u201cSalaries of all officers in the forces so transferred, other than officers in the New York police prior to January 1, 1898, shall be equalized on the same basis. If the difference in pay is not more than $50 the pay shall be equalized at once. If the difference is more than fifty dollars the pay shall be made uniform within three years by equal annual additions.\u201d The evident intent was by this provision to equalize the salaries of all members of the police force included within the new city of New York holding the same positions; but, where the equalization of such salaries would cause an increase in the annual salary of any officer of more than $50, the salary of such officer should be increased each year for three years by one-third of the difference between the salary that he had theretofore received and the salary which an officer of his rank would be entitled to receive under the new charter, so that for the third year his salary would be the same as that of other officers of equal rank in. the department, and the application of this provision to the case of the plaintiff would be that determined by the court below in the order appealed from. Thus, prior to the consolidation, the plaintiff was receiving $730 a year. Upon the consolidation he became a doorman in the police department. The difference between the salary that he had received prior to the consolidation and that fixed for the office by the charter was $270 a year, and, this increase being over $50, there was to be added to the salary that the officer had received upon consolidation one-third of the difference each year. Thus, the first year after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>consolidation he would be entitled to $730, plus $90, making $820; the second year he would be entitled to $820, plus $90, making $9x0; and the third year after consolidation he would be entitled to receive $910, plus $90, making $1,000, which would be his salary for subsequent years, if he continued in the service of the department. We agree with the court below that this was the proper rule to adopt, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to any greater amount than that to which the verdict was reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It follows that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
