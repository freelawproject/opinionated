Proc. \u00a7 2284, relating to proceedings to punish a contempt of court other than criminal, providing that if an actual loss has been produced a fine must be imposed not exceeding the amount of complainant\u2019s costs and expenses and $250 in addition thereto, it was improper to impose a fine of more than $250 and costs and expenses, there being no proof of the damage actually sustained, for the purpose of indemnifying the aggrieved party.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b945-18\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b946-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Action by the East River National Bank against Thomas R.

The damage must be proved as in an action. It therefore appears that the fine imposed was far in excess of the sum which the court had power to inflict in the absence of proof of the extent of the loss sustained. Moffat v. Herman, 116 N. Y. 131, 22 N. E. 287; Burnham v. Denike, 53 App. Div. 407, 65 N. Y. Supp. 1028. Therefore the fine could not have exceeded the sum of $250 and costs and expenses. Order modified by reducing fine to $250, and $30 costs, and as so modified affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">Order modified, and as so modified affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
