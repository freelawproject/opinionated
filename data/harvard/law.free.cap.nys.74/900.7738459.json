We think :the justice\u2019s finding that the work was done for the defendant is correct. Requests for an estimate, and that Mr. Gillin, plaintiff\u2019s .agent, should call in reference to same, although written upon the printed letter head of the defendant\u2019s corporation, are signed by the defendant personally, without any indication of corporate capacity, and contain language denoting individual, not corporate, .action. \u201cPlease quote me,\u201d \u201cLet me have this information,\u201d \u201cCall and see me,\u201d\u2014these are phrases in letters over the defendant\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">Although defendant\u2019s Exhibit i for identification, which is a bill made out for the work in question to the corporation, of which defendant is president, was, erroneously as we believe, not admitted in evidence, the error does not call for a reversal of the judgment. For Mr. Gillin, the plaintiff\u2019s representative, swore that it -was a clerical error to make the bill out against the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">The defendant\u2019s motion, made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, for a dismissal on the ground that there was no proof of incorporation, was properly denied. Conceding the correctness of the ^appellant\u2019s contention that, in an action by a corporation in the \u25a0.municipal court, it is not necessary, in order to deny the existence \u2022of the corporation, to set up by an .affirmative allegation in a verified answer that the plaintiff is not a corporation, it would seem that where the pleadings are oral, as in this case, and there is af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>firmative proof that plaintiff is a corporation, such proof is conclusive, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The plaintiff\u2019s witness swore to the fact of corporate existence and the return contains no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
