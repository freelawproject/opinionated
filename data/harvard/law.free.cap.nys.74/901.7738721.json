Upon October 27, 1897, the defendant Smith was appointed receiver of the property of Seeney in proceedings supplementary to execution. This liquor-tax certificate, having been found in the possession of Seeney, was, upon the 1st day of November following, surrendered to defendant Barckley, as treasurer of Albany county, together with a petition in due form, for its cancellation, and the payment to him of the proper rebate. The treasurer thereupon gave to the receiver a receipt for the certificate, and a statement of the amount of rebate, and by whom payable, and sent to the state commissioner of excise, as he was by law required to do, a duplicate of the receipt, together with the certificate and petition for cancellation. Thereupon this action was brought against the said Barckley, as treasurer of Albany county, for a conversion of this certificate. Upon motion of the plaintiff the defendant Smith was thereafter made a party defendant, upon the allegation that he claimed to have some interest in the certificate, which interest, if any, arose subsequent to the plaintiff\u2019s interest. The action was brought to trial, and the plaintiff recovered a judgment for conversion against the said Barckley, which judgment was by this court reversed, and a new trial ordered. See 42 App. Div. 335, 59 N. Y. Supp. 65. Upon the new trial, upon motion of plaintiff, the complaint was dismissed against the defendant Barckley, and, against the defendant Smith\u2019s objection, the jury were directed to render a verdict that under the facts in this ease, and as between the plaintiff and defendant, the receiver, \u201cthe plaintiff has an equitable claim upon the certificate in question and any rebate thereon, and that the receiver took such certificate subject to such claim.\u201d Thereupon a judgment was entered adjudging that the plaintiff have judgment, without costs, against the defendant Smith as receiver, etc.; \u201cthat the plaintiff has an equitable claim upon the certificate in question and any rebate thereon, and that such receiver took such certificate subject to such claim.\u201d From this judgment the defendant Smith, as receiver, has appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Argued before PARKER, P.

The jurisdiction of that court is prescribed by statute. There is no statutory authority for a trial by the \u25a0county court of the issue which was here tried between the plaintiff and defendant Smith, nor for the granting of any judgment upon such an issue. This want of jurisdiction is not cured by any proceeding-on the part of the defendant Smith,'as a defendant is powerless, even !by consent, to confer jurisdiction of the subject-matter in litigation upon a court of limited jurisdiction. It becomes unnecessary, therefore, to examine the other objections discussed upon the briefs of counsel. The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Judgment reversed on the law and facts, and new trial granted, with \u2022costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
