The natural objects of her bounty were a sister, two nieces, a nephew, and a grandniece. She gave something more than $2,000 each to her sister, her nieces, and her grandniece, and made the grandniece the residuary legatee. She gave $300 to certain charities, $600 to Father Flannery, or whoever may be parson of the Roman Catholic church at Far Roclcaway, out of which he was to distribute $300 for specific benevolent purposes. She also gave either $900 or $1,200 to three different priests of the church, and requested that they should say masses for the repose of her soul and of the souls of her husband and her son, who had been a student for the priesthood. She made no mention of her nephew, who lives in Ireland. The testimony of Judge Healy, who prepared the will, her physician, and of the subscribing witnesses, is clear and convincing as to her competency, her free agency, and of the due execution of the will and its codicil, and we do not think that the learned surrogate erred in his determination, which upheld the will. It is objected that the testimony of Father Sullivan was prohibited by section 827 of the Code. We fail to find that alone it could be held to refer to' any personal transaction or communication with the testator, or that any objection was made, save in one instance. Mr. Sullivan testified that he would go' to the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>three or four times a year. \u201cQ. And upon those occasions whom did you see in the Crane house? (Objected to on same grounds as before; i. e., irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent. Objection overruled. Exception.) A. Mrs. Crane and the girl, Agnes Car-berry, I think.\u201d No motion was made to strike out. Conceding that the objection was sufficiently definite, this testimony was in rebuttal. Testimony had been given relative to Mr. Sullivan\u2019s visits to the house, and I think the evidence was admissible, under Pinney v. Orth, 88 N. Y. 447. This testimony was quite unimportant, and may be entirely disregarded without affecting the result one whit. Disregarding it, and examining the case as we may do (In re Rogers, 10 App. Div. 593, 42 N. Y. Supp. 133; In re Welling\u2019s Estate, 51 App. Div. 355, 64 N. Y. Supp. 1025), we think that the decision of the learned surrogate was right. The mere fact that there was no attestation clause to the codicil does not invalidate it. Lewis v. Merritt, 98 N. Y. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">I think, however, that the decree must be modified by striking out the allowance made to the counsel for Mr. Sullivan, and by making the other allowance directly to the party, and not to Daniel Brown (In re Welling\u2019s Estate, supra), and by providing that the same shall be payable out of the estate. As thus modified it should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Decree of the surrogate\u2019s court of Queens county modified in accordance With the opinion of JENKS, J., and as modified affirmed, with costs, payable out of the estate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
