It is the law that the seller is entitled- to know who the proposed purchaser was, and with whom he was expected to enter into contract. Gerding v. Haskin, 141 N. Y. 514, 519, 36 N. E. 601. It was competent for him, however, to relinquish this right, as he did, when he waived the production, or, so to say, tendering, of the intending purchaser and the consequent information. Duclos v. Cunningham, 102 N. Y. 678, 6 N. E. 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
