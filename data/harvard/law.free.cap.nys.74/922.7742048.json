It appears that the affidavit was made in the state of Iowa, where was attached a certificate which the appellant claims is insufficient to enable the party desiring its use to read in evidence, or make any use whatever of it in this state in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>the action. He cites the case of Stanton v. Pipe Line Co., 90 Hun, 35, 35 N. Y. Supp. 629, in support of his contention. Section 844 of the Code states in detail the requirements of the certificate of the officer which must accompany a foreign affidavit \u201cas to his official character and the genuineness of his signature as are required to entitle a deed acknowledged before him to be recorded within the state, etc.,\u201d and the Laws of 1896 (chapter 547, \u00a7 249, subd. 5) state that the affidavit may be made before \u201cany officer of the state authorized by the laws thereof to take the acknowledgment or proof of deeds to be recorded therein.\u201d Under these imperative requirements it would seem that the foreign certificate, which merely states \u201cthat M. J. Tobin is a duly elected and qualified notary public in and for the said county and state aforesaid,\u201d is insufficient to uphold the contention of the respondent that the papers are without legal infirmity.' If this view be correct, it is needless for us to discuss the merits of the affidavit upon which the order for examination was granted. We think that the order appealed from should be reversed, with costs and disbursements of the appeal, but with leave to the respondent to renew her application upon proper papers therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\">Order reversed, with costs and disbursements, with leave to respondent to renew application upon proper papers. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
