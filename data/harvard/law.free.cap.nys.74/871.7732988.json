There were two shipments. The invoiced value of the first shipment was $183.60, and that of the second $24.30. On the trial the defendant counterclaimed for $183.60, the value of the first shipment only. The invoice of these goods, coupled with the testimony of the defendant\u2019s only witness, shows that they were consigned, not sold; and said witness testified that the defendant made the plaintiffs a present of the second shipment. The appellant contends, however, that, even assuming there was no sale, but a consignment, the plaintiffs could not recover for expenses, because by the written contract between the parties it was provided that the plaintiffs should \u2018\u25a0bear all expenses of any nature incurred or found necessary in the prosecution of said work, without recourse upon the parties of the first part\u201d (plaintiffs). This point, however, cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. Kafka v. Levensohn, 18 Misc. Rep. 202, 205, 41 N. Y. Supp. 368; Appleton v. Welch, 20 Misc. Rep. 343, 45. N. Y.

If it had been raised, the defendant\u2019s objection might have been obviated. No exception was taken upon the trial, and the justice\u2019s finding is fully sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
