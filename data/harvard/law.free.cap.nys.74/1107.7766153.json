The complaint, after stating the formal allegations as to the defendant\u2019s incorporation, etc., the happening and manner of the occurrence of the accident, and the negligence of the defendant, alleges that \u201cthe plaintiff received severe and painful injuries and suffered great pain.\u201d Then follow specific allegations of permanent injuries to the ear and hearing, and then the following: \u201cHis right shoulder, head, neck, back, and hip were bruised and lacerated, and he was in other respects bruised and wounded, and became and was sick, sore, lame, and disordered, and so remained and continued for a long space of time, and he also received a severe shock to his nervous system; and that some of the said injuries are permanent.\u201d The complaint is quite full and complete upon the subject of injuries, and the order denying the motion for the bill would be affirmed were it not for the fact that in the last statement in the fifth paragraph of the complaint it is stated \u201csome of said injuries are permanent.\u201d This statement leaves the whole matter of permanent injuries open, and gives to the defendant no notice of the injuries which are claimed to be permanent as distinguished from those that are temporary. We think, therefore, in view of this allegation, that the defendant becomes entitled to a bill of particulars specifying what injuries the plaintiff claims are permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>The order should therefore be reversed, with $io costs and disbursements, and the motion for a bill of particulars granted to the extent of specifying the injuries which plaintiff declares are permanent, with $io costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
