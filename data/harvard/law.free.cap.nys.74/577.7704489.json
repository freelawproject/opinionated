A clause of the mortgage securing the bonds provided that the railroad company should before the 1st of September of each year furnish the trustee with a statement showing the amount of the earnings and income of the previous fiscal year, and of the rate of interest to be determined to be payable on such bonds, and provided for the publication of the rate of interest determined, and that the ascertainment and declaration by the railroad company should be final as between the parties, but that between the 1st and 30th of September a certain number of bondholders might object, in a manner prescribed by the mortgage, to the interest rate. Suit dismissed, and complainant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AG9\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b597-13\">The following is the opinion of the court below (LBVENTRITT, J.):</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-14\">\u201cThe plaintiff rests his cause of action on the terms of the eighth clause of the mortgage, and his right to an inspection of the statements of other years is dependent on the language of that clause, together with its reasonable implication. Relief is demanded against the trustee under the terms of the instrument creating the trust, and not by virtue of any inherent relation existing between a trustee and the cestui. The mortgage, which, for the purposes of this case, is the final measure of the trustee\u2019s duties (Hollister v. Stewart, 111 N. Y. 644, 651, 19 N. E. 782; 19 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 732), contains no express provision granting an inspection of the interst statements to the bondholders, but surely an implied one, authorizing it between the 1st and 30th days of September of each year, as that is the period during which the requisite number of bondholders may, through the defendant, object, in the manner prescribed by the mortgage, to the interest rate, and after which the rate becomes final and unassailable except for fraud. It is clear to me, however, that, under the terms of the instrument, the implied right to inspect is limited to the statement for the current year, inasmuch as the object contemplated by filing the statement with the trustee is to permit an objection to the interest rate for that year only. In the absence of a provision of the mortgage by which the railway company is to file with the trustee this annual statement, no right to an inspection could arise in the bondholders, and the right, therefore, that has arisen by virtue of the presence of a provision, is to be measured by its reasonable intent. The plaintiff, who has been a bondholder since 1897, should have protected himself by demanding an inspection for each year during the month of September. Even had he become a bondholder only during the year in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>demanded the inspection of prior statements, nevertheless he would be deemed charged with the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. In this case the plaintiff presents nothing to the court as a court of equity to call for an exercise of its inherent power to compel disclosure between trustee and cestui. Without showing any reason or object, he demands relief based solely on the implied terms of the mortgage. These do not warrant it. Complaint dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b598-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
