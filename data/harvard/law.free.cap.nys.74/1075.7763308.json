M. Co. from showing, displaying, or otherwise using the name of H. in or upon any papers, devices, or signs used in the business. Thereafter defendant issued a circular announcing H.\u2019s death, and stating that he, as survivor, was the sole owner of the business. It appeared by affidavit, controverted by defendant, that in at least one instance the circular was inclosed in an envelope printed, \u201cAfter 8 days return to H. M. Co., M., Prop.,\u201d and on which the name H. was plainly visible, though some blue ink was spread over it. <em>Held </em>sufficient to justify a finding that the order had been violated.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1095-8\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1095-9\">Injunction by Demie W.

Y. Supp. 1072. After that order was granted and served, appellant issued and mailed a circular to retail dealers in honey,' beeswax, maple sugar, and maple sirup, announcing the death of Henry P. Hildreth, which occurred several weeks before, and stating that he, as survivor,was the sole owner of the-business carried on at Nos. 120 and 122 West Broadway. It appears, by an affidavit, which is, however, controverted by the defendant,, that in one instance, at least, this circular was inclosed in an envelope.upon which was originally printed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-14\">\u201cAfter 5 days return to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-15\">Hildreth, McCaul Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-16\">Jos. M. McCaul, prop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-17\">120 &amp; 122 West Broadway,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-18\">New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-19\">\u2014And upon which the name Hildreth was left plainly legible, although some blue ink had been spread over it. The court was justified in finding that this circular thus issued was calculated and intended to continue the deception which it was the design of the injunction order to prevent, and the defendant was properly adjudged guilty of contempt. Devlin v. Devlin, 69 N. Y. 212, 25 Am. Rep. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-20\">The order should therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
