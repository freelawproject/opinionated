The complaint charges that defendant\u2019s books do not correctly show the account, and that false entries of credits to plaintiff and of the net profits have been, made therein. The principal material allegations of the complaint are -denied. The answer, for a fourth defense and counterclaim, repeats the allegations of the second defense, to the effect that from dime to time during the period of plaintiff\u2019s employment by defendant it rendered and delivered to him full and true statements in writing, showing the true condition of his accounts as they appear upon the books of the defendant, and that the same were accepted by the plaintiff as correct and true; and it alleges that an account was stated between the parties on or about the 30th day of June, 1901, and the sum of $1,529.19 was found to be due thereunder by \u25a0the plaintiff to the defendant, no part of which has been paid, and for which, with interest, the defendant demands judgment. The \u2022plaintiff, by reply, denies the allegations constituting the counter\u25a0claim. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney in due time duly demanded verified \u25a0items of \u201call the accounts alleged in the answer and counterclaim,\u201d and a verified bill of particulars of the counterclaim, \u201cwhich shall contain a detailed statement thereof, including the information de-manded in the following paragraphs.\u201d Here followed 14 separate \u25a0paragraphs calling for specific information as to the accounts and -claims set up in the answer. Paragraph 11 specifically calls for the .items of the accounts alleged to have been stated from time to time, .and paragraph 14 specifically calls for the items of the account : alleged to have been stated on or about the 30th day of June, 1901, :and which constitutes the counterclaim for which an affirmative Judgment is demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">We are of the opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to a copy of the alleged account stated, and. of the items thereof, upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the defendant\u2019s counterclaim is based. The allegations of the answer are to the effect that the accounts rendered from time to time, which it is claimed constitute its accounts, \u201cwere full and true statements in writing showing the true condition\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s accounts, and that on the account stated on June 30, 1901, \u201cthe sum of $1,-529.19 was found to be due thereunder by the plaintiff to the defendant.\u201d It is to be inferred from these allegations that the account stated contains items. It thus appears that plaintiff not only denies that any account was stated,, but he questions the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s books of account. In these circumstances it is important to him to have a copy of the account stated, which, if established as such, may only be impeached for fraud or mistake. An account stated which contains items falls within the provisions of section 531 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which entitled the adverse party to a verified copy thereof. Sanchez v. Dickinson (Sup.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 733; Wells v. Van Aken, 39 Hun, 315; Cunard v. Francklyn, 15 Civ. Proc. R. 134, 1 N. Y. Supp. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The motion for'a bill of particulars of the other agreements set up in the answer, and of the names of the parties with whom it is claimed that plaintiff made the same, was properly, denied. Where an action is based upon an agreement alleged to have been made with a corporation, and the corporation denies the making of the agreement and any knowledge concerning the same, a bill of particulars stating with what officer or agent the contract was made, and the substance of the contract, may be required of the adverse party. Construction Co. v. Marks, 48 App. Div. 51, 62 N. Y. Supp. 621. In such case it is necessary for the corporation to have this information in order to enable it to be prepared to show that the alleged officer or agent acted without authority. This necessity, however, does not exist where it is claimed that a contract was made with an individual in his own right. The plaintiff, therefore, was not entitled to a bill of particulars concerning the agreement alleged in the answer to have been made between him and certain stockholders of the defendant authorized to represent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to preclude defendant from giving evidence of the alleged account stated, constituting its counterclaim, granted, with $10 costs, unless the defendant serves a copy thereof upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney within 10 days from the service of the order entered on this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
