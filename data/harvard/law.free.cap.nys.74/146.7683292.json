In Weinstein v. Frank, 56 App. Div. 275, 67 N. Y. Supp. 746, we considered the general nature of such orders, and held that it was not every person not worth $100 who could sue in forma pauperis, but \u201conly those who would otherwise be. unable to prosecute their actions.\u201d This petitioner merely says that she has not now the means to prosecute the action, but she does not say she cannot get them, nor that she will be unable to present her cause unless the order should be granted. She receives wages, but what her earnings are, or whether she is compelled to support herself, does not appear, nor is it shown that her parents are not able to support her. Applications of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>character have become very frequent, and they amount in most cases to an abuse of the statute authorizing them. The discretion was not properly exercised in this case, and the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
