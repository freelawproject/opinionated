The attorney\u2019s representative at once called upon the plaintiff\u2019s husband, and, after some conversation, in which he informed Mr. Whitesell that he had interviewed his\" wife, and that she had informed him that said Herman Gottlieb had been retained by two other persons who had been injured in the same accident, and requested him to retain the said Herman Gottlieb as attorney in behalf of himself and wife,\u2014which statement, according to his own -affidavit, was false,\u2014induced him to sign this agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-19\">\u201cIn consideration of legal services rendered and to be rendered to me by Herman Gottlieb, attorney and counselor at law of New York City, in and about my claim for damages against New Jersey and Hudson R. R. Ferry Company may be liable for injuries sustained by myself and wife in the accident which occurred on the 12th day of May, 1901, any action* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>which Herman Gottlieb may bring or institute, I, A. S. Whiteseil, do hereby agree to give Herman Gottlieb the exclusive right and power to prosecute my said claim for damages, and the said Herman Gottlieb hereby agrees to give me one-half of the net proceeds recovered, and I hereby agree with the said Herman Gottlieb that he shall retain one-half of the net proceeds recovered, together with the costs and counsel fees of the action as allowed by the defendant and the court. No settlement of this case can be made in or out of court without the consent of both parties hereto. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 13th day of May, 1901.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">\u201cA. S. Whiteseil.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The consideration for the agreement is the legal service \u201crendered and to be rendered\u201d by the attorney to the plaintiff\u2019s husband in and about the husband\u2019s claim for damages against the defendant for injuries sustained by the husband and his wife in the accident which, occurred on the 12th of May, and the husband agreed that in any action which the attorney might bring or institute the husband would, give to the attorney the exclusive right and power to prosecute his (the husband\u2019s) claim for damages, and the attorney agreed to give the husband one-half of the net proceeds recovered. In this agreement there is no authority to act on behalf of the plaintiff, or to bring any action for her. In explaining this agreement the plaintiff\u2019s husband swears that he and his wife were passengers upon this car; that he was \u201cshaken up, and at the time thought he might have received injuries, but subsequently felt no bad effects\u201d; that on the following day Grossman, the attorney\u2019s representative, called on the deponent, and asked him to allow Mr. Gottlieb to bring an action for him, and that deponent consented to this, and signed a paper for that purpose; and that two or three days afterwards he wrote a letter to Mr. Gottlieb, in which he stated that he had suffered no substantial injury, and that he did not wish an action brought in his name, or to take further steps in the matter. Grossman swears that he had some conversation with the plaintiff\u2019s husband about bringing an action for the plaintiff, but both the plaintiff and her husband positively swear that they never authorized such an action to be brought. Mr. Gottlieb brought an action for the plaintiff by the service of a summons upon the defendant on the 15th day of May,\u2014two days after this interview of Grossman\u2019s with the plaintiff and her husband,\u2014but no complaint was then served. He subsequently, in June, served an unverified complaint upon the defendant\u2019s attorney, but that was after the action had been discontinued, and the complaint was returned upon that ground; and that is all that the attorney seems to have done in the matter. It is quite apparent that the attorney was never authorized to commence an action for the plaintiff. He sent to the plaintiff to obtain authority, but she refused to give it, and referred his representative to her husband. The representative went to the husband, making the representation above referred to as to what his wife told him, and got authority from him to commence an action in his behalf, but obtained no authority to commence an action for the plaintiff. The representative was careful to get written authority from the husband, and, if either the husband or the plaintiff had authorized the-attorney to commence an action on behalf of the plaintiff, undoubt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>edly some written authority such as was obtained from the husband would have been obtained from the wife. Nothing of that kind is claimed. The plaintiff expressly repudiated the attorney\u2019s authority to bring this action, and swears that she gave none; and there is nothing but the affidavit of Grossman that states that any action by the wife was ever directly or indirectly authorized or contemplated; and as this is specifically denied by both the husband and the wife, and the attorney is unable to produce the slightest written authority, I think the clear preponderance of evidence is against the claim of the attorney. Even Grossman does not pretend that he ever had an agreement with the wife by which the attorney was to receive one-half or any other portion of the damages that she should recover. According to Grossman\u2019s story, there was a simple authority to commence the suit, which was revoked a few days after by the plaintiff\u2019s agreeing to discontinue the suit that Gottlieb had commenced in her name. If this were true, he would be entitled to no more than the legal value of his services, which consisted in -serving a summons upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The order appealed from first directs the defendant to pay to Herman Gottlieb, the attorney for the plaintiff, one-half of the amount of the settlement effected between the plaintiff and the defendant, besides the costs and disbursements of the action up to the time of the aforesaid settlement, within io days after service of a copy of the order and notice of entry thereof; and upon a failure on the part of the defendant to pay said sum of money, Herman Gottlieb, the attorney for the plaintiff, was permitted to continue and prosecute this action to judgment, and to enforce his lien to the extent of one-half of any recovery obtained therein; and, in the event that it should become necessary to prosecute the action to judgment, the order discontinuing the action upon the plaintiff\u2019s consent was vacated, and Gottlieb is given $io costs of the motion to abide the event. Just why one-half of the amount of the settle-ment was given to Gottlieb, is not apparent. In his agreement with the plaintiff\u2019s husband he had agreed that the husband should be allowed to receive one-half of what he was to recover; but, as before stated, he had no such agreement with the wife, and, so far as appears, up to the time that his authority was repudiated, he did nothing but serve the summons. Both the plaintiff and the defend.ant expressly deny that the claim has been settled, and allege that the plaintiff has commenced an action in the state of New Jersey, where the accident happened, to recover for the damages that she sustained. So that, if this order is sustained, the defendant has two actions on its hands,\u2014one in New Jersey, for the benefit of the plaintiff, who sustained the injury; and the other in New York, for the benefit of this attorney, who has sustained no injury, and rendered no service, except sending his representative to induce the plaintiff to commence an action, and serving a summons on the defendant. I think the order appealed from, upon the facts, was entirely unjustified. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney performed no service, obtained no agreement as to compensation, and was entitled to $15 \u2022costs of the action if he had been authorized to bring the action; but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>not having been authorized to bring it, he was entitled to no compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order of discontinuance denied, with $10 costs, to be paid by the respondent\u2019s attorney personally. All concur, except LAUGHLIN, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
