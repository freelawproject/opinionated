The evidence adduced established the following facts: The defendant was the owner of the premises No. 28 East Seventy-Second street, in the city of New York, on August 15, 189S, when the accident occurred. The house had been built by her (the defendant), and was never occupied. The cellar was a dark cellar, with a stairway leading down to it; and in the cellar was a furnace pit, which was 3 feet 1 inch deep, 6 feet 9 inches wide, and 11 feet 6 inches long, and was filled with water. The width of the cellar was 15 feet 6 inches, and the furnace was 3 feet 11 inches square. The pit was parallel to the stairs, and was situated 1 foot 4)4 inches from it. The plaintiff was requested by defendant to put coal into the cellar. The defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">\u201cI offered plaintiff a candle to go down into the cellar. I told him to take a candle, and go in the cellar. I held the candle in my hand, and some matches. He did not take them, but said, \u2018I have matches of my own, and have been in the cellar before.\u2019 He further answered: \u20181 am an old coal man, and I do not require a candle, i know all the cellars in New York, and don\u2019t require a candle.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">On cross-examination defendant further testified that the plaintiff had been in the cellar before, and was familiar with it. One Michael Grimmins, the caretaker of the house, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-14\">\u201cThat plaintiff went into the cellar first, and witness went after him; that when plaintiff reached the bottom of the stairs he lit a match, and that the match went out; that the passageway between the pit and the stairs was wide enough to pass along; that when plaintiff came down he lit a match, and passed the little passageway all right, and went over to the front of the cellar; that any one could see the furnace and pit when the match was lit; that plaintiff walked ahead of witness between the furnace pit and stairs; that all the way back the plaintiff lit a match, and witness told him to be careful, and keep in the left, not to go near the pit; that before going down to the cellar he told plaintiff there was a pit there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">We must assume that the jury, in rendering a verdict in favor of defendant, credited the foregoing testimony. Under this state of facts, we maintain that the ninth request, viz.: \u201cThat if, when the plaintiff got in the cellar, and relied on matches to light him through, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>instead of a candle, that he took the risk of the matches being extinguished, and if he proceeded in the darkness after the matches were extinguished he is guilty of contributory negligence, and cannot recover,\u201d\u2014was not error. Hilsenbeck v. Guhring, 131 N. Y. 674, 30 N. E. 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">There -were no railings around the furnace pit, nor was there any covering on it. The appellant assigns as error the fact that the question, \u201cWas the pit properly or improperly constructed?\u201d was allowed to be answered by three witnesses, namely, two architects- and one mechanical engineer, over appellant\u2019s objections, to which-exceptions were taken. We do not think this was error. Finn v. Cassidy, 165 N. Y. 584, 59 N. E. 311, 53 L. R. A. 877. Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
