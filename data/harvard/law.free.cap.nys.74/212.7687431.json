It was also admitted that the plaintiff herein received the premises by deed from the defendant dated June 17, 1889, and recorded July 9, 1889, and that the plaintiff paid to Margaret Cosgrove $100, and $100 for legal services in connection with the matter; and there is in evidence a quitclaim deed, dated June 14, 1899, admitting receipt of $100 by Margaret Cosgrove. The court rendered its decision in favor of the plaintiff, and from the judgment so entered the defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b232-16\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

We agree with the appellant that Mrs. Cosgrove\u2019s right was one to redeem from the purchase-money mortgage, and not to recover dower; and the remaining question is as to when such right accrued. Upon the answer to this is to be determined whether or not the statute of limitations has run. Although some of the earlier cases incline to the view that the right to redeem accrues upon the death of the husband, the later cases, which we regard as controlling, are to the effect that a wife is entitled, even during the life of her husband, to redeem such premises by paying the mortgage debt. Thus it was expressly held in Taggart v. Rogers, 49 Hun, 265, 1 N. Y. Supp. 900, that the wife could maintain, because of her inchoate dower interest therein, an action to redeem the mortgaged premises during the lifetime of her husband. And in Campbell v. Ellwanger, 81 Hun, 259, 30 N. Y. Supp. 792, the question, which was answered in the affirmative, was thus stated: \u201cCould the plaintiff redeem during the life of her husband, whilst her right was inchoate?\u201d It having been determined in that case that the plaintiff could have maintained such an action, the precise question was presented which we are here called upon to answer,\u2014whether the statute of limitations had thus been set running; and it was held that it had, and that, the wife having delayed bringing an action for 35 years, her claim was barred, \u201cboth under the ten year statute of the old Code (section 97, Code Proc.), and under the new Code of Civil Procedure,\u201d which provides, in section 379, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cAn action to redeem real property from a mortgage, with or without an account of rents and profits, may he maintained by the mortgagor or those claiming under him, against the mortgagee in possession or those claiming under him, unless he or they have continuously maintained an adverse possession of the mortgaged premises for twenty years after the breach of a condition of the mortgage or the nonfulfillment of a covenant therein contained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The principle supporting this conclusion seems to be sound, because the effect of a foreclosure action wherein the wife is not served with process, and wherein the property is sold to the mortgagee or a third person, is to make the purchaser who goes into possession under the deed a mortgagee in possession, whose title, however, is subject to the wife\u2019s right to redeem from the mortgage, which right immediately accrues, and must, under the present Code (section 379, Code Civ. Proc.), be enforced within 20 years. In the present case, therefore, as Mrs. Cosgrove\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations,, she had no legal interest affecting the property in any way, and the payment made to her by the plaintiff was gratuitous for which recovery cannot be had against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">It follows that the judgment must be reversed, with costs; and as there is no dispute about the facts, and these could not be changed upon a new trial, there should be judgment for the defendant, dismissing the complaint, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
