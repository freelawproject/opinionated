For more than five years prior to the <em>2d </em>day of December, 1898, cabs were permitted, by the acquiescence of the public authorities, to stand on West Thirty-Fifth street, Broadway, and Sixth avenue, next to the curb, adjacent to the triangle known as \u201cHerald Square,\u201d for the purpose of receiving passengers for hire. The custom was for the cabs to face west on Thirty-Fifth street, north on Sixth avenue, and south on Broadway. The most desirable position was on West Thirty-Fifth street, next Broadway, and ordinarily that was the head of the line. When one vehicle moved out of the line, the others generally moved forward, thus maintaining a continuous line from Broadway easterly, southerly, and northerly, to the extent of the carriages upon the stand at a given time. It was the custom for the cabs, on arriving, to take a position at the end of the line. The plaintiff was accustomed to have a cab upon this stand, and on the day mentioned he sent a hansom there, the driver being his son, The son drove down Broadway, and, seeing the rear cab in the line on West Thirty-Fifth street pull out, he turned into West Thirty-Fifth street, and stopped next the Herald Building for a few moments to see whether the line would close up. At that time one of the defendant\u2019s electric cabs occupied the head of the line on Sixth avenue, a position which some of the drivers preferred. The defendant\u2019s driver was upon the sidewalk, reading a book. The plaintiff\u2019s, driver, after waiting about three minutes, seeing no indication of any intention on the part of defendant\u2019s driver to take the vacant position, after it had been vacant five minutes, drove across the street, and occupied it himself. He stopped the hansom with the horse\u2019s head about three feet from the cab in front. Thereupon the defendant\u2019s driver mounted his cab, and came around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>on West Thirty-Fifth street, and told the plaintiff\u2019s driver that that was his place, and to move out or back up. The plaintiff\u2019s driver made no effort to comply with this request, and held the place. The defendant\u2019s driver then cut in ahead of plaintiff\u2019s vehicle, and backed into his horse, knocking or crowding the horse onto the sidewalk, and inflicting substantial injuries. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a dismissal of the complaint, upon the grounds : (i) That plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; (2) that it was not shown that defendant was negligent ; and (3) that it was not shown that defendant was operating the electric vehicle. The record indicates that the motion was granted upon the ground of contributory negligence. Counsel for the-plaintiff duly excepted, and moved for a new trial upon the minutes, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">If the damages were caused by a negligent act, rather than a trespass or assault, of course, plaintiff could not recover, if his driver was guilty of contributory negligence. But, manifestly, that was a question for the jury. The defendant\u2019s servant was aware of the location of plaintiff\u2019s horse and hansom, and there was nothing to indicate\u2014at least as matter of law\u2014that he had lost control of the electric cab. Nor could it be said as matter of law that plaintiff\u2019s driver had reason to apprehend a collision. The plaintiff\u2019s driver had a right to assume that the defendant\u2019s driver would not take the law into his own hands, and deliberately inflict an injury or commit a trespass. Jetter v. Railroad Co., *41 N. Y. 154; Willy v. Mulledy, 78 N. Y. 310, 34 Am. Rep. 536; McCambley v. Railroad Co., 32 App. Div. 346, 52 N. Y. Supp. 849; Marino v. Dehmaier, 62 App. Div. 43, 70 N. Y. Supp. 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We also think that the defendant\u2019s liability was for the jury. The complaint alleges the facts, and in one subdivision characterizes the act of the defendant\u2019s driver as \u201cnegligence,\u201d and in another avers that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was \u201cnegligently and willfully\u201d moved against plaintiff\u2019s horse. If the injury was willfully inflicted, that would constitute a crime (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654), and the presumption is in favor of innocence. If there was no intent to run into plaintiff\u2019s horse, then the act may be properly characterized as negligence, or a trespass. Even if plaintiff\u2019s driver usurped the place to which defendant was entitled,\u2014which is not the necessary inference from the facts proved,\u2014that did not justify defendant\u2019s driver in attempting to accomplish a \u201clegal object in an unlawful way.\u201d Sullivan v. Dunham, 161 N. Y. 290, 55 N. E. 923, 47 L. R. A. 715, 76 Am. St. Rep. 274. It is, however, immaterial to the present inquiry whether the action be regarded as one for injuries to property, willfully inflicted, or for a negligent act constituting a wrongful injury to the property in the nature of a trespass, to which latter class, we think, the case more properly belongs. The jury would have been justified in finding that defendant\u2019s driver was acting in the course of his employment, and for the purpose of furthering his master\u2019s business; and, whether the injury was willfully or negligently inflicted, the defendant would be liable. Mott v. Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543; Girvin v. Railroad Co., 166 N. Y. 289, 59 N. E. 921; Manufacturing Co. v. Gors<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>line, 63 App. Div. 517, 71 N. Y. Supp. 619; Sullivan v. Dunham, supra; Lipscomb v. Railroad Co. (Tex. Sup.) 64 S. W. 923. The defendant was incorporated for the purpose of owning and operating electric vehicles in the city of New York. The driver of the electric cab which collided with plaintiff\u2019s horse had upon his hat a plate with the words \u201cElectric Vehicle\u201d and a number, and the same words were upon a plate upon the cab. It was shown that the drivers in the employ of the defendant, from the time it began business in New York until the month of June before the accident, wore a similar inscription upon their hats. This was the only evidence tending to show that the driver of the electric cab was in the employ of the defendant. We think it was sufficient to establish a prima facie case. Seaman v. Koehler, 122 N. Y. 646, 25 N. E. 353; Baldwin v. Abraham, 57 App. Div. 67, 67 N. Y. Supp. 1079; Hodgson v. Conklin, 50 App. Div. 604, 64 N. Y. Supp. 76; Isenman v. Miles, 38 App. Div. 469, 56 N. Y. Supp. 420; Wylde v. Railroad Co., 53 N. Y. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">These views lead to the conclusion that the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur, except O\u2019BRIEN, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
