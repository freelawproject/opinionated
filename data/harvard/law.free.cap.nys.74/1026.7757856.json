The answer admits the delivery of the goods, sets up an equitable counterclaim, and, as a second counterclaim, alleges that it has sustained damages, aggregating $15,000, by reason of the failure of plaintiff\u2019s assignor to deliver the goods involved in the litigation within the time specified in the contract. The allegations of this second counterclaim, involving special damages, are that \u201cthe defendant was unable to complete its works at that place (Rahway, N. J.), to its great damage,\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant did enter into agreements with various persons to furnish them' with wood carvings, planed wood, water and fire proof wood turned, out under patented processes by means of the machinery referred to in the specifications, whereby it agreed to deliver within certain dates certain quantities thereof,\u201d and that by the fault of plaintiff\u2019s assignors the defendant \u201cwas unable to comply with the contracts entered into between it and the various persons with whom it had entered into-contracts\u201d; that \u201clarge quantities of wood were destroyed\u201d; and that defendant \u201cwas prevented from obtaining large and valuable contracts, which would have resulted in great gain to this defendant,\u201d etc. The plaintiff demanded a bill of particulars, and, upon the defendant failing to give the desired information, moved for a bill. The learned court at special term granted only so much of the relief asked for as related to the allegations of the quantity and value of the wood destroyed, and directed the defendant to furnish \u201cdetails of the $352.38, part of the damages claimed to have been suffered by the defendant, as set forth in its answer herein.\u201d There appears to be no controversy in respect to this portion of the alleged damages; the complaint expressly credits the defendant with this amount, and defendant\u2019s answer claims to be entitled to the same; and the rule is settled5 by section 522 of the Code of Civil Procedure that each allegation of the complaint not controverted by the answer must, for the purposes-of the litigation, be taken as true. It seems entirely clear, therefore, that the learned court has inadvertently caused an order to issue in. respect to a matter which is already determined, while denying to the plaintiff the relief which would alone be of use, and we are of opinion-that there has been no exercise of the judicial discretion in determining the question. A long line of authorities holds that where there is a demand for special damages, such as that alleged in the counterclaim now under consideration, the party sought to be charged is-entitled to a bill of particulars, giving the names and addresses of the parties who are alleged to have made contracts, or who are alleged to have been willing to make contracts, in order to prepare for the trial.

All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
