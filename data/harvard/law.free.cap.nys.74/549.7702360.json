This attachment was obtained on the 15th of March, 1901, and a levy seems to have been made under it on the same day. The respondent, as the trustee in bankruptcy of the defendant, moved to-vacate this attachment upon his affidavit, which alleged that a petition was filed on the 29th day of March, 1901, by certain creditors of the defendant, in the district court of the United States for the Eastern district of Pennsylvania, praying that the defendant be adjudicated a bankrupt, and that subsequently, and on the 17th day of July, 1901, the defendant was duly declared a bankrupt under the act of congress relating to bankruptcy; that subsequently the respondent was duly elected trustee of the said bankrupt estate, and qualified as such; that \u201cat the time of the issue of said attachment and the levy thereof the defendant was insolvent, the 'aggregate of its property, exclusive of any property which it may have conveyed, transferred, concealed, or removed, or permitted to be concealed or removed, with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay its creditors, was not, at a fair valuation, sufficient in amount to pay its debts.\u201d It is provided by subdivision \u201cf\u201d of section 67 of the bankruptcy law that \u201call levies, judgments; attachment or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent at any time within four months prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy against him, shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, attachment or other lien shall be deemed wholly discharged and released from the same and shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt.\u201d Although, by the express provision of the statute, the attachment is to be deemed null and void, and the property affected by the attachment deemed wholly discharged and released from the same, we agree with the court below that it was the proper practice to apply to the court for an order formally discharging the attachment and releasing the goods of the bankrupt from the levy. Certainly^, the sheriff could not be required.to assume the responsibility of releasing a levy valid but for the adjudication of bankruptcy. It is the duty of the court, upon these facts being called to its attention, to vacate the attachment and remove the lien, so that the trustee in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>bankruptcy can take the proper proceedings to recover the property of the bankrupt\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">The substantial question presented is whether, upon these papers, there is sufficient proof that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time the attachment was granted. The attachment was granted on the 15th day of March, and the petition to have the defendant adjudicated a bankrupt was filed on the 29th day of March, 14 days thereafter. There is no allegation as to the ground upon which it is sought to have the defendant adjudicated a bankrupt, but the trustee in bankruptcy alleges that at the time of the issue of such attachment and the levy thereof the defendant was insolvent. This was a positive allegation, under oath, by the trustee appointed to administer the estate in bankruptcy, and there is nothing to show that he did not have knowledge of the bankrupt\u2019s condition at the time the attachment was obtained. There is no evidence in opposition to this allegation, and under the circumstances there was sufficient proof to justify the court below in finding that this attachment was within those affected by the provision of the bankrupt law to which attention has been called. I know of no loches on the part of the trustee that would make this attachment valid, which is made void by the provision of the bankrupt act. I think, therefore, the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
