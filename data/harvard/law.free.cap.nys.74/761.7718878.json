The unreliability of his testimony was thereafter emphasized, for the learned trial judge took him in hand, and, after calling his attention to the contradictions which he had made, gave him an opportunity to explain them; but he again repeated that the statement that the defendant was the guilty party was not true, and then reasserted that his father told him to tell the story which he had told. It shocks one\u2019s sense of justice that a person should be convicted, and should serve a long term in prison, upon testimony so unreliable, inconsistent, and contradictory. The weight to be given such testimony was commented upon in People v. Ledwon, 153 N. Y. 10, 46 N. E. 1046, wherein the principal witness was a weak, ignorant boy, who spoke in a foreign tongue, and who upon the trial had stated that on a former occasion he had given false testimony; and it was said, \u201cGuilt in such a case cannot be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the testimony of such a witness, who is evidently, either from moral or mental defects, irresponsibleand the judgment of conviction, for that reason, was reversed. Although in the case at bar the youth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>spoke the English language,\u2014having been born in this country,\u2014it was made evident that if not an imbecile, or, as his father said, \u201ccrazy,\u201d he was morally and mentally irresponsible, and that upon his testimonjr, uncorroborated as it was upon the question of the identity of the person who committed the crime, a conviction should not be allowed to stand. If, however, we regard him as sufficiently sound mentally to entitle his testimony to be credited at all, and as sufficiently intelligent to understand the nature of the crime, then he was an accomplice, whose uncorroborated testimony was not enough to justify a conviction. See section 399, Code Cr. Proc. The respondent contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201cThe Code contains no specific provision that a conviction under section 303, Pen. Code, cannot be obtained upon the unsupported evidence of the person upon whose body the act of sodomy has been consummated; and in view of the fact that such specific provision is made with regard to the crimes of abduction, compulsory marriage, rape, and defilement (section 283, Pen. Code), it may well be doubted whether in any case under section 303 corroboration is necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In the absence, however, of such specific provision, the court should follow the general provisions which have been enacted, and legal precedents. As pointed out by the defendant, section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u201cA conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice, unless lie be corroborated by such other evidence as tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">And it has been expressly held in Reg. v. Jellyman, 8 Car. &amp; P. 604, 34 E. C. L. 916, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">\u201cAlthough consent or nonconsent is not material to the offense, yet as the wife, if she consented, would be an accomplice, she would require confirmation; and so it would be with a party consenting to an offense of this kind, whether man or woman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">The learned trial judge was asked to charge that, under section 303 'of the Penal Code, the complaining witness is an accomplice, and that, as such, no conviction should be had upon his testimony unless it was corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime, which requests were denied, and the defendant excepted. Upon these requests, we think the dilemma was presented either that the complaining witness was so deficient in intelligence as not to understand the nature of the crime or the bearing of his testimony, in which case he was not such a competent witness that, upon his testimony alone, the conviction should stand, or else that he was mentally competent, in which event, understanding the nature of the crime, he was capable of consenting, and thus became an accomplice, which required that, to sustain a conviction, his testimony should be corroborated. There is, of course, the additional phase that, without being entirely devoid of understanding, he may have been of a mind so weak that he did not comprehend what he was doing, and therefore did not consent; but that would present a question of fact, as to whether or not the act was voluntary on his part, which would have required the submission to the jury of the question whether or not he was an accomplice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>and the further instruction that, if the jury found that he was, then corroboration of his testimony was necessary. It is true that a request in form embodying this last phase was not made; but the attention of the court was distinctly called to the point that as the youth was allowed to testify, and the prosecution rested mainly upon his uncorroborated testimony, and he was thus treated as one who had sufficient understanding to know the nature of the act when it was consummated, it was important that the defendant\u2019s rights, vitally affected as they were by the testimony of such a witness, should have been guarded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">We do not overlook certain of the other testimony in the case bearing upon the possibility or probability that the defendant was the guilty person; but upon the question of the identity of the criminal we have only the words of this half-witted youth, who in one breath says that it was the defendant, and in the next withdraws this statement and says that he had told an untruth when he said that it was the defendant, thus preventing any reliance being placed upon his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Upon the whole case we do not think that the defendant\u2019s guilt can, upon the testimony, be said to be established beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, as said in the case to which we have already referred, of People v. Ledwon, supra, the defendant was, \u201cunder the plain provisions of the statute, entitled.to have the jury directed by the court to acquit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The judgment, accordingly, should be reversed, and a new trial ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
