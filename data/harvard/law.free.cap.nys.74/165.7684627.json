J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsG\">The plaintiff was in the employ of Trecartin &amp; Turner, stevedores, who were loading a vessel at Bayonne, N. J. After the loading was completed, the men were hoisting trucks out of the vessel, when one of the trucks fell upon and injured the plaintiff. The evidence was sufficient to show that the steam power used in hoisting and the man engaged in operating it were furnished and employed by the Standard Oil Company, and that this man negligently permitted the load to descend without the usual signal of a whistle from a servant of Trecartin &amp; Turner, stationed for that purpose. There is no evidence to contradict the negligence of the person operating the power. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-20\">\u201cFirst. That the identity of the corporation sued has not been proved, or that the man they say was in the employ of the oil company was employed by this defendant. Second. That the employment was of such a character that there was risk in it, and that the risk was obvious, and incidental to-the employment. Third. That they have failed to prove any negligence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the part of anybody. There should have been more affirmative proof of negligence\u2014some affirmative proof of negligence\u2014in an action of this kind. In a suit brought under these circumstances, res ipso loquitur does not apply. The happening of the accident is not enough to charge this defendant with negligence. On the further ground that under the decisions in the state of New Jersey, where this accident happened, as appears by the evidence, the servant in handling this drum was a co-servant with the stevedore,\u2014pro hac vice, as the court says in the case against the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Company, affirmed by the court of errors and appeals. I will read the syllabus, and hand the book for your honor to read.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The court denied the motion, and Mr. Fuller, the counsel who was trying the action on .behalf of the defendant, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">\u201cI am an attorney for the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. Q. Is there a Standard Oil Company of New York? * * * A. There is. Q. Is that a separate company from the company in New Jersey? * * * A. It is.\u201d Cross-examination by Mr. Crane: \u2018\u2018The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey has its main office in Bayonne. The officers for both companies are not the same. I do not know whether or not the Standard Oil Company in Pennsylvania and all the states is operated, owned, and controlled by the same people. I do not think it is a fact that the people who compose the company\u2014the Standard Oil Company, as it is generally known\u2014are the same in all the states. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then moved for the direction of a verdict, \u201cas no action has been made out against the defendant in the case. No negligence has been proven anywhere by which a verdict against this defendant could be sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The first ground of the motion is technical in, the extreme, and is clearly untenable. The complaint alleged that the defendant was a foreign .corporation existing under the laws of New Jersey, and this allegation was expressly admitted by the answer, which is signed, \u201cS. C. T. Dodd, Defendant\u2019s Attorneyand the verification, by Mr. Clark, states \u201cthat he is an officer of the defendant corporation.\u201d The defendant named is Standard Oil Company, and not the Standard Oil Company of New York, or the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. We must assume that Standard Oil Company is a separate entity from either of the companies referred to. The judgment is against Standard Oil Company, and not against a corporation known by either of the titles referred to. We are not concerned with the question as to the liability of any corporation other than the defendant Standard Oil Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The liability of the defendant corporation under the facts proved was recognized in Sanford v. Oil Co., 118 N. Y. 571, 24 N. E. 313, 16 Am. St. Rep. 787, and the court properly submitted to the jury the questions raised by the second and third grounds of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The last ground of the motion is certainly peculiar. There was no allegation in the answer that the law of New Jersey was different from the law of this state, or that the cause of action was governed thereby. The defendant\u2019s counsel offered no evidence upon the subject of a difference in the decisions of the two states, as he might have done under section 942 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that \u201cthe unwritten or common law of another state, * * * may be proved, as a fact, by oral evidence. The books and reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>of cases, adjudged in the courts thereof, must also be admitted, as presumptive evidence of the unwritten or common law thereof.\u201d He made a statement to that effect in his motion, and cited an authority of the highest court of New Jersey; but the decision had not been and was not offered in evidence. The presumption is that the common law of New Jersey is the same as the common law of this state, and the presumption can only be rebutted by evidence of a difference. No such evidence was offered. The citation of an authority in New Jersey on the argument of the motion for a dismissal was not an offer thereof as evidence. If the decision had been offered in evidence, non constat but that the plaintiff might have produced later and different decisions upon the same question. In Monroe v. Douglass, 5 N. Y. 447, it was said (page 452):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cIt Is a well-settled rule, founded on reason and authority, that the lex fori, or, in other words, the laws of the country to whose courts a party appeals for redress, furnish in all cases prima facie the rule of decision; and, if either party wishes the benefit of a different rule or law,\u2014as, for instance, the lex domicilii, lex loci contractus, or lex loci rel sitae,\u2014he must aver and prove it The courts of a country are presumed to be acquainted only with their own laws. Those of other countries are to be averred and proved, like other facts of which courts do not take judicial notice; and the mode of proving them, whether they be written or unwritten, has long been established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">As no such defense was alleged in the answer, and no such offer made by the defendant, the contention of the latter on this point must fail. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
