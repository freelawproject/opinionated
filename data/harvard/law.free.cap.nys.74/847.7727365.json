J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkH-\">This action was brought by the plaintiff to recover the sum of $15, balance due for the rent of certain premises for the month of November, 1900. The trial judge rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant upon the following state of facts: The defendant rented a flat in the plaintiff\u2019s premises, for which he agreed to pay the sum of $35 per month in advance. He paid $20 to apply on the rent for the month of November, 1900, and had failed to pay the balance. The defendant vacated the premises about November 22, 1900, claiming upon the trial that his rooms had been made untenantable by reason of certain repairs that were being done to the hall and other rooms of the house by the landlord. The rent for the month of November fell due upon the 1st, and it is a well-known rule, that, to render an eviction of the tenant a valid defense against the landlord\u2019s claim for rent, it must occur before the rent falls due. 2 McAdam, Landl. &amp; Ten. 1336, and cases there cited. The judgment in favor of the defendant must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.
