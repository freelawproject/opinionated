Taking his allegations as true, as they must be taken in face of the demurrer, the most that can be said is that the defendants have broken their agreement to compensate him for his services. For this breach he has an adequate and complete remedy at law. The case, as made by the complaint, differs in essential particulars from Marston v. Gould, 69 N. Y. 220, upon which plaintiff seems to rely. The demurrer must be sustained, with costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend within twenty days upon payment of costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b649-14\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
