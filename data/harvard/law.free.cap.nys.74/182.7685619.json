Some time thereafter application was made for the cancellation of this certificate upon the grounds (1st) that Schepper &amp; Co. had violated clause \u201ch\u201d of section. 31 of the liquor tax law (Laws 1896, c. 112), in that they had kept, and maintained during the hours when the sale of liquors was forbidden, screens, blinds, curtains, etc., over or in front of the windows in the saloon, which prevented any one outside from obtaining a full view thereof; (2) that they had violated clause <em>\u201cg\u201d </em>of the same section, in that they had, on Sunday the 7th day of October, 1900, opened and unlocked a door and entrance from the street, alley, yard, hallway, room, and adjoining premises to the room on said premises where liquors were sold and kept for sale, \u201cwhen it was not necessary for the egress or ingress of the holder of the liquor tax certificate or members of his family or servants for purposes not forbidden by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>act, and that said holder of said liquor tax certificate at said time did admit to said room where liquors were sold and kept for sale persons other than himself, his family and servants\u201d; and (3) that they had violated clause \u201ca\u201d of the same section, in that they had on Sunday, the 7th day of October, 1900, sold intoxicating liquors to one Pierce and one Nahrwold, and to divers other persons whose names are unknown to the petitioner. Testimony of the respective parties was taken before a referee, who reported the same to the court, and the learned justice, sitting at special term, after a consideration of the same, reached the conclusion that such testimony did not establish the allegations of the petition, and thereupon an order was made denying the application, from which the petitioner has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We are of the opinion that the application should have been granted. It is true that as to the first and third grounds upon which a cancellation was asked the testimony was conflicting, and we are not prepared to say that the conclusion reached by the learned justice as to them is not correct, but as to the second ground there is substantially no dispute between any of the witnesses but what the respondent had the doors leading into the saloon open and unlocked, and admitted, at a time when the sale of liquors was prohibited, persons other than servants or members of his family. For instance, the petitioner\u2019s witness Nahrwold testified\u2014and his testimony is not disputed\u2014that, when he entered, the door leading from the street into the hallway and a second door leading from the hallway to the barroom were both standing open. This witness was corroborated by the witness Pierce. The respondent Dick testified that Nahrwold and Pierce entered the saloon, and tried to purchase some beer, which he refused to sell. He did not deny that the doors were open as testified to by them. On the contrary, he admitted that he did not lock the doors Sundays or any other time, and that any one came in there who wanted a meal, and that he left the doors unlocked so that they could come in if they wanted to; that he did not keep a hotel, but the barroom and restaurant were all one room; and all of the witnesses produced by him testified to substantially the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">We have therefore the undisputed fact that on Sunday, the 7th day of October, 1900, at a time when the sale of liquors was r ' hibited by law, the respondent had opened and unlocked the door or entrance from the street and hallway to the room in which liquors were sold and kept for sale, and that he, at that time, admitted to such room persons not servants in, or members of, his family. A clear violation of subdivision \u201cg\u201d of section 31 of the liquor tax law was thereby established, which provides, among other things, that it shall not be lawful to have \u201copen or unlocked any door or entrance from the street, alley, yard, hallway, room or adjoining room to the premises or rooms where any liquors are sold or kept for sale during the hours when the sale of liquors is forbidden, except when necessary for the egress or ingress of the persons holding liquor tax certificates and authorizing the traffic in liquors at such places, or members of his family or servants for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>not forbidden by this act, or to admit to such room or rooms any other person during the hours when the sale of liquors is forbidden\u201d: and the petitioner, having established that fact, was entitled to an order canceling the tax certificates. Subdivision 2, \u00a7 28, c. 112, Laws 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is suggested by counsel for the respondent Dick that there could not be a cancellation of the certificate so far as the same related to Schepper, inasmuch as the court never obtained jurisdiction of him. There is no force in the suggestion. The order directing Schepper &amp; Dick to show cause why the certificate should not be canceled directed that a copy of the order, and the petition and affidavit upon which the same were granted, be served personally upon Schepper &amp; Dick, or \u201cby leaving the same at the plac\u00f3 of business designated in the said liquor tax certificate, with the person in charge of the same.\u201d Service was made in the manner directed, by leaving the papers with the person in charge of the saloon at the time the service was made. In response to this service, Dick appeared. Schepper did not appear, except for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court. The certificate was held by the firm of Schepper &amp; Co. It was their property, and service upon the person in charge of the saloon was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to cancel against both members of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to cancel granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
