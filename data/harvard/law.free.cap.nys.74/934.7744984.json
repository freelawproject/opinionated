It is the contention of the defendant that, because of certain alleged defects in these proceedings, the judgment rendered therein was not res adjudicata as to this defendant, so far as to fix his liability for the unpaid rent to the time when possession was re-established in the landlord. That issue, we are obliged to say, was determined in the other tribunal in favor of the landlord; and, the defendant having had his day in court, he became bound by the judgment rendered. We think that the objection raised to the regularity of that proceeding on the ground that two written copies of the precept -were.not placed upon the door of the premises, one for each of the persons against whom possession was demanded, was unfounded in fact, because the record does not show that such was the case. The affidavit of service thereof is in the following words: \u201cFie did serve the within precept on Samuel Levy and the Henry Elias Brewing Company, the tenant herein, by affixing a true copy thereof,\u201d etc. And we may not infer that only a single copy was, therefore, affixed. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we are bound to presume that there was done in this particular all that was required. The judgment of the other tribunal was conclusive as to fixing the liability of the defendant. Grafton v. Brigham, 70 Hun, 131, 24 N. Y.
