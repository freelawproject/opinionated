SUPREME COUNCIL, CATHOLIC BENEV.

Markey payable to the brother, Edward J. Markey, it does not follow that the plaintiff can, by reason of that fact, recover the amount stated in the certificate. If the defendant\u2019s act in issuing the certificate was ultra vires, the plaintiff cannot take advantage of it, inasmuch as she has no certificate at all, and comes into court without the basis of any claim whatever. Luhrs v. Supreme Lodge (Sup.) 7 N. Y. Supp. 487. But the precise question here presented was determined adversely to the plaintiff\u2019s contention in Maguire v. Maguire, 59 App. Div. 143, 69 N. Y. Supp. 61, and therefore upon that authority this judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
