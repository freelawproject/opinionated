The complaint alleges that the defendant, after taking the chattels into his actual possession, \u201chas concealed, removed, or disposed of said chattels so that they cannot be found or taken by the sheriff under the requisition issued to him herein, and with intent that the same should not be so found or taken.\u201d The answer is a general denial. The defendant defaulted on the trial. The plaintiff proved his case as alleged, and the court made a decision containing separate findings of fact. The court found, among other things, that defendant had removed and disposed of the chattels so that they could not be found by the sheriff, and with the intent that they should not be found or taken on execution. The court found, as conclusions of law, that plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the possession of the property, and damages for the wrongful taking and detention, together with costs of the action, and, in case a delivery of the property could not be had, then for its value, as therein fixed. Judgment in the usual form was entered upon the decision. Subsequently the defendant made a motion to open his default, and an order granting the motion upon certain conditions was made on the 17th day of June, 1901. The conditions imposed on opening the default have not been complied with, and no appeal has been taken from the order. An execution in the usual form\u2014for the delivery of the property, and for the recovery of the damages and costs, and, in the event that the property was not found, for the recovery of its value\u2014was issued upon the judgment. The sheriff returned the execution in due time, with the indorsement thereon, over his signature, \u201cNo personal or real property.\u201d Thereupon the body execution sought to be vacated by the motion was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">No order of arrest has been granted in the action. The question presented is whether an execution against the person of the defendant was authorized. Where the judgment awards possession of a chattel, or is for the recovery of a sum of money, after an execution against the propertw of the judgment debtor has been returned wholly or partly unsatisfied, if the defendant be not a woman, an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ecution against his person may be issued upon the judgment, \u201cwhere the plaintiff\u2019s right to arrest the defendant depends upon the nature of the action.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1240, 1487-1489. The cases in which the plaintiff\u2019s right to arrest the defendant depends upon the nature of the action are specified in section 549 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That section provides, among other things, that a defendant may be arrested where the action is brought \u201cto recover a chattel where it is alleged in the complaint that the chattel or a part thereof has been concealed, removed or disposed of so that it cannot be found or taken by the sheriff, and with intent that it should not be so found or taken.\u201d Id. \u00a7 549, subd. 2. It is further therein expressly provided that, \u201cwhere such allegation is made, the plaintiff cannot recover unless he proves the same upon the trial of the action; and a judgment for the defendant is not a bar to a new action to recover the * * * chattel.\u201d In the case at bar the complaint contains these allegations which would have authorized an order of arrest, and the decision and judgment establish the fact that they were proved upon the trial. If they had not been proved, the plaintiff could not have recovered, but he could have maintained a new replevin action, eliminating the allegations essential to authorize the arrest of the defendant. This seems to be the plain construction of these provisions of the Code, and it is also sustained by authority. Steamship Co. v. Seager, 31 App. Div. 288, 52 N. Y. Supp. 985; Moffatt v. Pulton, 132 N. Y. 520, 30 N. E. 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">It is also contended that the description of the property in the findings, judgment, and execution was insufficient. The description is, \u201cThirty-seven cases of Connecticut seed leaf tobacco.\u201d In view of the fact, established by the decision and judgment, that the defendant has intentionally disposed of the property for the purpose of placing it beyond the reach of the sheriff, it is not apparent that he could have been prejudiced if the description were insufficient; but we deem it jurisdictionally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We have examined the other points presented by appellant, but are of opinion that they are not well taken, and do not require special consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
