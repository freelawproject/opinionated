The reported evidence amply supports this conclusion, and this is so even though the trial judge failed to make any special findings to justify the denial. In any event, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the report for failure to comply with the rules which appears to be in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The report was allowed on December 10, 1973 over three months ago. The defendant has been represented by counsel at all stages of the case, except at the hearing before us when the treasurer of the defendant company appeared <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Bule 31, District Court Buies, 1965, as amended, requires 5 copies of the report and 5 copies of the briefs to be filed within 15 days after the allowance of the report. No copies of the report and no briefs were ever filed. No request for an extension of time was ever filed and counsel did not appear to argue at the hearing before us.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b131-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Albert Auburn, Esq. for Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b131-7\">James R.
