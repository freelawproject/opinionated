The plaintiff has failed to file a sufficient bill of particulars with its declaration as required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">2. The plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against this defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"> \u201cThe function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the pleading against which it is directed and, its scope being thus limited, we cannot in considering a demurrer go beyond the allegations contained in that pleading.\u201d <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>316 Mass. 526, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Since the demurrer is by its express terms addressed to the substitute declaration as a whole, it must be overruled if either count is good. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>319 Mass. 372 and citations there collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u201cThe declaration shall state concisely and with substantial certainty the substantive facts necessary to constitute a cause of action.\u201d (G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 7, second; <em>White </em>v. <em>Shulman, </em>325 Mass. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Bach count must be read by itself and must contain within itself allegations of such facts as will make out a cause of action. <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>301 Mass. 271, 274; <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Good Bros. Inc., </em>318 Mass. 300, 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Count I of the substitute declaration reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\u201cCOUNT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">And the plaintiff says that the defendant owes it the sum of Seven Hundred ($700) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Dollars, for money had and received to the use of the plaintiff and interest, in accordance with the account hereto annexed marked \u201cA\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201cA\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">C.

Total due $735.00\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">Count I appears to be a common count for money had and received and is in the form permitted by G-.L. c. 231, 147, form 1 (a). The account marked \u201cA\u201d is nothing more than a bill of particulars required by c. 231, $ 14. <em>Flower </em>v. <em>Suburban Land Co., Inc., </em>332 Mass. 30. \u201cIt has also been said that \u2018the right to recover in an action for money had and received \u2018does not depend' upon privity of contract, but on the obligation to restore that which the law implies should be returned, where one is unjustly enriched at another\u2019s expense.\u2019 <em>Rabinowitz </em>v. <em>People\u2019s National Bank, </em>235 Mass. 102, 103. <em>Flavin </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>327 Mass. 217, 220.\u201d <em>Flower </em>v. <em>Suburban Land Co., Inc., </em>322 Mass. 30, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Further, demand for payment is alleged for which a separate count is not required, <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>114 Mass. 18, but if recovery for interest from date of demand is sought, it must be pleaded. <em>Ordway </em>v. <em>Colcord, </em>14 Allen 59; <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 344, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Count I states a good cause of action also as a count upon an account annexed under c. 231, \u00a7 7, Ninth, although additional words are used than specified in the form set forth in c. 231, \u00a7 147, form 2. A \u201cplaintiff who declares on a count on an account annexed has by legal intendment made with respect to the item stated in the account annexed all the allegations contained in all the common counts . . .\u201d <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>185 Mass. 306, 310; <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>301 Mass. 419, 421; <em>Flower </em>v. <em>Suburban Land Co., Inc., </em>322 Mass. 30, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Therefore, we hold that Count I states a good cause of action and the demurrer should not have been sustained; and there is no need to discuss Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The order sustaining the demurrer is vacated and the action is ordered restored to the trial list.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
