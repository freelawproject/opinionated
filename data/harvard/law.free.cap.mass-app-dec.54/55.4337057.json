SILVA is a holder in due course of a promissory note, dated December 20, 1963 and executed by Paul J. Stamatos payable to the order of Philip Fanger:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9g\">\u201c1. The said Paul J. Stamatos agrees that if he receives moneys from Jack\u2019s he will pay the said Harry L. Silva the balance due on the note. However, if the money is not forthcoming, the said Stamatos agrees in order to secure the note, that he will assign, or cause any other corporation which he may subsequently form to carry on the food brokerage business to assign, to Harry L. Silva all moneys coming due under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the \u201cPenobscott account\u201d, such assignment providing for direct payment from Penobscott to Harry L. Silva. To the extent that the \u201cPenobscott\u201d account does not, for two consecutive months, amount to a minimum of $350.00 per month, Stamatos agrees that he shall assign additional accounts to secure the payment of this said monthly minimum. It is agreed, however, that the accounts so additionally assigned, shall not be notified of the assignment, and that Stamatos can elect to retain the moneys coming from said accounts and make . up the difference to the said minimum personally. To the extent that the \u201cPenobscott account\u201d, and the payment pursuant to the above mentioned further assignments or the election thereunder do not amount to the said minimum of $350.00 per month, then Stamatos personally agrees to pay the difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">Executed under .seal this tenth day of April, 1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">(s) Paul J. Stamatos</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">Paul J. Stamatos</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqK\">P. J. Stamatos, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Cx\">by (s) Paul J. Stamatos\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">There was no finding of a default or date, if any, of default of the April 10, 1964 \u201cAgreement\u201d or letter by the defendant. The instant case was begun by writ dated July 21, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The court made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">\u201cUpon all the evidence I find the following facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">\u201cThe note in question contains an acceleration clause making it due and payable upon default of the maker thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">The defendant was in default on his obligation under said note on or prior to February 10, 1964, not having made all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>payments due at the time they were due by said time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in interest, Fanger, demanded payment from the defendant at a time when the defendant was in default prior to April 10, 1964;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">The plaintiff had reason to know that the defendant was in default at the time the note was transferred to him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">The within action was commenced by a writ dated July 21, 1971.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The court then ruled that the action was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">By the finding of fact, the court has ruled that there was a default and acceleration of the original note. That finding must stand unless plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">It is fundamental that a party may waive a breach of contract committed by an adverse party. <em>Taxi Service Co. </em>v. <em>Gulf Refining Co., </em>252 Mass. 314, 320. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Liverpool Ins. Co., </em>153 Mass. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">From an examination of the agreement dated April 10, 1964, and the letter of the same date, it would appear that the parties waived any existing breach and either intended to revive the note itself or the effect of the promissory note dated December 20, 1963 by modifying the terms of payment and establishment of a new contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">There is no evidence reported determining the date subsequent to April 10, 1964 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>on which the breach occurred, and upon which the present action is brought. The original breach having been waived by mutual assent of all parties, the finding by the trial justice that the action is barred by the Statute of Limitations is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Another interpretation of the uncontested documents before us is that the acts of the parties may have resulted in a novation:\u2014 the requisite for a novation being a previous valid obligation, an agreement of all parties to a new contract, the extinguishment of the old contract and the validity of the new one. <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>Jeffrey Nichols Motor, </em>279 Mass. 362. <em>Coral Gables </em>v. <em>Granara, </em>285 Mass. 565. <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Republic Foil, 42 </em>Mass. App. 10. <em>Baldwin Steel Erection Co. </em>v. <em>Champy Construction Co., </em>353 Mass. 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Whether there was a novation is a question of fact. <em>Coral Gables </em>v. <em>Granara, </em>285 Mass. 565. <em>Favei </em>v. <em>Denehy, </em>332 Mass. 691, 697.</p>\n<p id=\"A23\">If, at a retrial of this matter, it should be determined that, in fact, a novation has been formed, a question of pleadings will arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In view of our opinion, that because there is a considerable amount of unreported evidence upon which findings must be made, the matter should be sent back for a new trial on the merits. We will not, at this time, determine whether the facts justify a finding that there has been a waiver of the breach of payment of the promissory note at bar predicated upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the documents of April 10, 1964, (supra) or whether there has been in fact a novation predicated upon a new contract between the parties, and we are unable to determine the time of breach of the terms of the presumed novation and/or original promissory note.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b68-8\">Rubin E. Garber and Paul William Garber both of Boston, for the Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The finding of the trial judge is hereby vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Finding for the defendant vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">New trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
