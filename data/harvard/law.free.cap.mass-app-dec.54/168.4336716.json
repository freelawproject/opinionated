The only question between the parties at the time of the trial was whether the goods represented by the balance of the account claimed by the plaintiff to be due were in fact returned by the defendant and accepted by the plaintiff. The only evidence introduced consisted of plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories, further interrogatories and notice to admit facts, and defendant\u2019s answers thereto. Among the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>fendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\u201c9. All of the merchandise was paid for or returned to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">14. I returned all of the merchandise and have receipts for it, for which they are now claiming payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">17. I made two payments and returned all of the merchandise and have receipts for the merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">24. I returned all unsold merchandise to Bulova Watch Co., Flushing, N.Y. and have the receipts therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The judge found for the defendant and denied plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings which included requests that a finding for the defendant is not warranted and a finding for the plaintiff warranted. The judge made no findings of fact. The report puts in issue the denial of these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">There was no error. No issue of credibility was involved. The plaintiff was bound by the defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories introduced by the plaintiff in the absence of any contradictory evidence. <em>Tanguay </em>v. <em>Wood Conversion Co., </em>347 Mass. 530, 533. <em>Luoma </em>v. <em>Socony Vacuum Oil Co., Inc., </em>332 Mass. 101, 104 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">The plaintiff did not ask the defendant to produce the receipts. The defendant\u2019s testimony was not subjected to \u00abcross-examination. The plaintiff offered no evidence other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories, further interrogatories and the notice to admit facts. These answers contained no statements contradictory or inconsistent with the answers quoted above.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b176-6\">Webb, Webb and Martin for Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A7e\">Saul Gordon, Esq. for Defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">It is true, as the plaintiff contends, that the denial of the requests raised a question of law, since the denial was tantamount to a ruling that the defendant was entitled as a matter of law to a general finding. However, this is the' case of \u201cthe most conspicuous example\u201d where it would have been \u201clegal error to rule that the evidence warranted a finding\u201d for the plaintiff when the testimony \u201cby which he is bound requires a finding for\u201d the defendant. <em>Hoffman </em>v. Chelsea, 315 Mass. 54, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
