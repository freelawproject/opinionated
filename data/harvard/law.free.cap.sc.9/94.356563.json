This proceeding was instituted by my predecessor to test the validity of the election of A. J. Shaw as Circuit Judge. He was elected by the joint vote of the General Assembly, the members thereof voting <em>viva voce, </em>and claims that Section 24, Article II, of the Constitution, providing that in all elections by the General Assembly the members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>is the law of the case. If this view be correct, this proceeding should fail. The State claims that Section 13, Article IV, providing that for each circuit a Judge shall be elected by joint <em>ballot </em>of the General Assembly, is the law of the case. If this view be correct, this proceeding should succeed. Should the <em>general </em>provision in that part of the Constitution relative to the legislative department, Article II, or the <em>special </em>provision in that part of the Constitution relative to the <em>judicial </em>department, ArticleIV, prevail? The authorities seem clear that the latter and special provision must prevail. \u2014 Potter\u2019s Dwarris, 117, <em>et seq., </em>272, 273, <em>et seq., </em>and cases cited; Sedg. on Con. and Stat.

The Constitution of the State, as the fundamental law of the land, provides that in all elections by the people the electors shall vote by ballot. \u2014 Art. VIII, \u00a7 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">That in all elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof, the members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>and their votes thus given shall be entered on the Journal of the House to which they respectively belong. \u2014 Art. II, \u00a7 24.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-7\">The reason for this distinction between the mode of voting by the constituent and by his representative is obvious. The people vote by an inherent sovereign right, inseparable from their existence as citizens of a free country. The representative makes use of the right to vote solely from the grant of such right in the Constitution. He exercises but a delegated authority. He votes for and in the stead of his constituents. No one has the right to inquire how a citizen votes. He is a sovereign, and one of the safeguards by which he hedges in his sovereignty in this respect is the right to conceal his vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-8\">Every citizen has the right to know how his representative votes. One of the checks upon the representative, the safeguard of the citizens whom he represents, is that his vote in his representative character must be open, public, subject to scrutiny.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-9\">This is the plain, broad distinction made in the express words of the Constitution. If the position taken by the Attorney General be correct, this distinction is broken down and obliterated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-10\">II. The General Assembly is the creature of the Constitution. It owes all of its powers to the instrument creating it. The Constitution could as well have made one house as two. It could have dispensed with the General Assembly altogether. It could have given it powers purely legislative, with no power in the selection of officers in the other departments. It could have provided for the election of the officers in the executive or judicial departments by the people, by the Legislature or by the Executive. In searching for the powers of the General Assembly, certainly in seeking to discover the mode in which it shall exercise its powers, we must look to the Article of the Constitution which created it. That Article gives to the General Assembly legislative powers in which the Legislature is supreme, and certain other powers, not at all legislative, but representative in their character, such as the election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>of various officers, in which the General Assembly acts simply in the stead of the people. In the use of its purely legislative powers the scrutiny of the people into the action of the General Assembly is exercised only in certain cases, such as the increase of the public debt, the change of the fundamental law, the consideration of the veto of the Governor, or the demand of two members that the vote be recorded. In these cases only must the representative so act that his action is recorded for the examination and judgment of his constituents.' But in the exercise of their representative powers, the Constitution directs that in all instances the votes shall be <em>viva voee </em>and spread at large on the journal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-4\">If the position taken by the Attorney General- be correct, the result will be the engrafting into the Constitution of the grant to the General Assembly of a new and contradictory power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-5\">It is not contended that this grant is made directly. If it be given at all, it is given indirectly and only by implication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">After providing for the General Assembly, and after giving it its powers, and prescribing to it the mode in which these powers should be exercised, the Constitution passes on to the other co-ordinate departments. After devoting the third Article to the executive, it provides in the fourth Article for the judicial department. It creates in this Article Supreme, Superior or Circuit Courts and Inferior Courts.- In making provisions for the Circuit Courts it uses the expression upon which the whole argument of the Attorney General depends: \u201c The State shall be divided into convenient circuits, and for each' circuit a Judge shall be elected by joint ballot of the General Assembly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">It is contended that this Section irrevocably fixes the mode in which the General Assembly shall elect, in joint assembly, the Circuit Judges.by the secret vote ; that it is thus in direct conflict with the whole scheme of the Constitution respecting the mode in which the people shall elect and the mode in which the General Assembly can elect, and is also against the express words in which the power of election is granted to the General Assembly in Section 24, Article II. That, in fact, it is repugnant to this Section, and as it occurs in a subsequent Section of a subsequent Article of the Constitution, it repeals the prior Section <em>pro tanto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">We submit that the proper course to be pursued in construing any instrument is to give each provision its full force; to inquire if all the parts cannot stand together; to reconcile clauses which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>apparently contradictory, and only as a last resort to allow one to destroy or impair the other. That the fundamental canon of construction is that all parts of the instrument be construed together, so that every part will have effect. Repugnancy must be avoided if possible, and it is only when the parts are irreconcilable with each other that the first parts of a deed and the last parts of a will control. \u2014 See Cooley on Con. Lim., 58.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">If we say, as the Attorney General says, that this Section of the fourth Article repeals the Section of the second Article <em>pro tanto, </em>we abandon all hope of reconciling these Sections and admit and declare a repugnancy. We submit that this is not good construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">If, on the other hand, we seek to reconcile the two Sections, we can do so by holding that the words \u201cjoint ballot\u201d are <em>generic; </em>that they are used not in their most narrow and technical signification, but in their popular sense, in every day use; that they signify the act and not a particular mode of voting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">Let us examine the proceedings of the Convention which framed the Constitution and see how these words were used by the persons who drew the instrument. When this clause of the Constitution was under discussion the question was who should select the Judges, the people directly, or the General Assembly for the people. After an animated, and, we may say, an exhaustive discussion, it was finally determined that the General Assembly should select these officers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-8\">The argument was not directed to the manner of voting but solely to the question of how the voting should be done, \u2014 should the principal or the agent select. It was decided that the agent should do so, and the clause was passed in these words : \u201c The State shall be divided into convenient circuits, and for each circuit there shall be elected a Judge by the joint vote of the General Assembly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-9\">We see nothing more of this Section, or of the fourth Article of the Constitution, until it was finally ratified, and then, for the first time, we see the words joint ballot substituted for joint vote. No other change is made; nor is the change made by a vote of the Convention. If the Convention supposed that they were making a radical change in their Constitution \u2014 that they were repealing a Section of it which they had already adopted, they would, <em>ex necessitate, </em>have done so by a vote. The Section of the second Article, and the provision of the fourth article, both of which had been passed by the Convention, could not have been changed but by a vote, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the latter could not have been altered except by the reconsideration of a vote. No vote as to such change was taken, and the conclusion is inevitable that none was intended. The Convention evidently supposed that they were ratifying the same provision which they had adopted after a long discussion; that the words of the amendment and the words of the engrossed Constitution were synonyms ; that as they had already declared an invariable rule for the General Assembly, as to its manner of voting, this Section of the fourth Article simply gave to the General Assembly the power of selection of Circuit Judges in the mode prescribed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-5\">It may be said, however, that the validity of the Constitution depended upon its ratification by the people, and that when it was so ratified it had in it these words: \u201cjoint ballot,\u201d without any explanation of the sense in which they were used; that thus the words should be used technically. Without dwelling upon the position that when the people ratified the Constitution they must have done so subject to a legal construction of their inten.t, we submit that the words of the Constitution must be construed, not technically or strictly, but according to their plain, every-day, familiar, common sense meaning. There is this difference between the manner of construing deeds and statutes and the manner of construing Constitutions: The former in their use of technical words are construed technically. In the latter, the words are construed according to their popular use and signification. Constitutions are submitted to the masses, are construed by the masses, owe their existence to the approval of the masses, and the masses know nothing of technicalities. \u2014 Dwarris on Statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-6\">Now, what is the common use and understanding of the term \u201c ballot,\u201d joint ballot, when the election of officers is spoken of? It is understood to mean the act of voting, not the manner of voting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-7\">In all party conventions the mode of voting is <em>viva voce. </em>Indeed, in these United States, the rule of all representative bodies is that the manner of voting should be <em>viva voce; </em>voting by ballot, that is by a little ball or slip of paper, is a relic of the past. Yet, in speaking of the result of the voting in the party conventions, the journals of the body, the members who compose it, the newspapers, everybody, speak of the result of the first ballot, second ballot, third ballot, etc., and of the success of the candidate on the last ballot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>In the journals both of the House and of the Senate for 29th July, 1868, when the Justices of this Court were elected <em>viva voce, </em>the result of the first ballot, of the second' ballot and of the third ballot for Chief Justice are given, and each voting is so designated. So, also, with regard to the Associate Justices. \u2014 House Journal, special session, 1868, p. 132, etc.; Senate Journal, special session 1868, p. 93, etc. ' '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-5\">If we examine the contemporaneous and practical construction of this Section of the Constitution, we will come.to the same construction of these words of the Constitution. Mr. Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, speaking of contemporaneous and practical construction of Constitutions, says: \u201cAn important question which now suggests itself is this: How far the contemporaneous construction or the subsequent practical construction of any particular provision of the Constitution is to have weight with the Courts when the time arrives at which a judicial decision becomes necessary?. Contemporaneous construction may consist simply in the understanding with which the people .received it at the time or in the acts done in putting it in operation, or which necessarily assume that it is to be construed in a. .particular way. In the first case it can have very little force, because the evidences of the public understanding when nothing has been done under the provision in question must always necessarily be vague and undecisive. But when there has been a practical construction which has been acquiesced in for a considerable period, considerations in favor of adhering to this construction sometimes present themselves to the Courts with a plausibility and force which it is not easy to resist. Indeed, when a particular construction has been generally accepted as correct, and especially when this has occurred contemporaneously with the adoption of the Constitution, and by those who had opportunity to understand the intention of the instrument, it is not to be denied that a strong presumption exists that the construction rightly interprets the intention. Especially when this has been given by officers in the discharge of their duty, and rights have accrued in reliance upon it, which would be divested by a decision that the construction was erroneous, the argument <em>ab inconvenienti </em>is sometimes allowed to have great weight.\u201d \u2014 Cooley on Con. Lim., 67.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-6\">In <em>Stuart </em>vs. <em>Laird, </em>(1 Cranch, 299,) the question was made before the Supreme Court of the United States as to the right of Justices of the Supreme Court to hold the Circuit Courts of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>States. The decision was in 1803, and in these words: \u201cAnother reason for reversal is that the Judges of the Supreme Court have no right to sit as Circuit Judges, not being appointed as such, or, in other words, that they ought to have distinct commissions for that purpose. To this objection, which is of recent date, it is sufficient to observe that practice and acquiescence under it for a period of several years, commencing with the organization of the judicial system, afford an irresistible answer and have indeed fixed the construction. It is a contemporary interpretation of the most forcible nature. This practical exposition is too strong and obstinate to be shaken or controlled. Of course the question is at rest and ought not now to be disturbed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">Now, the first General Assembly formed under the present Constitution consisted mainly of persons who were members of the Convention which adopted it. This General Assembly elected eight Circuit Judges, and each one was elected in joint assembly <em>viva voce. </em>This continued to be the uniform practical construction of the Constitution until this year. Indeed, so deeply is it fixed in the minds of the Legislature that the words \u201cjoint ballot\u201d mean nothing but the act of voting, that the present General Assembly, in filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of the late Attorney General, proceeded to do so by a <em>viva voce </em>vote, notwithstanding that the Act authorizing it declared .that such vacancy should be filled by an election by joint ballot of the General Assembly, (A. D. 1875, 15 Stat., 935,) and this without question or demur on the part of any member of either house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-6\">If we examine the Constitution, we will discover that the only offices which the General Assembly is authorized by that instrument to fill are those of the Justices of the Supreme Court and of the Judges of the Circuit Courts; of course each- branch of the General Assembly elects its own officers, but the General Assembly, as a body, elects these judicial officers only. Now, can it be supposed that the general rule that all elections by the General Assembly shall be <em>viva voce </em>should be laid down so broadly as it is in Section 24, Article II, and that the provisions of Section 13, Article IV, are an exception to the rule, when, by the general rule, only three offices are filled, and, by the exception, at least eight are filled ? In such a construction, which is the rule and which the exception ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">What can be the reason and motive for such an exception?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The people have the right to elect all officers. They delegate to certain of their agents the duty of selecting judicial officers. They have the right to know how their agents execute this delegated authority. They require that in the selection of the Justices of the Supreme Court the act of each delegate should be published and recorded. The interests involved are too grave to dispense with this wise and needful precaution. Is there less interest or importance in the selection of Circuit Judges ? The Judges of these Circuit Courts are thrown directly in contact with the people. They have in their hands the dearest interests of the citizen \u2014 his life, liberty and property. It is only in exceptional cases that the litigant can come to the Supreme Court. He must go to the Circuit Court in nearly every instance, and in very many eases is depend-ant upon the discretion of the Judge. The decision of that Court is final in such cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">If, then, it be deemed necessary that the people should supervise and scrutinize the votes of their representatives, with respect to the Supreme Court, in order that the best men for this august tribunal should be selected, for a yet stronger reason they should have the same scrutiuy and supervision over the selection of the Circuit Judges, in whose purity, wisdom, discretion and ability they have so near and such important interests.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>Argument of Samuel Dibble, of counsel for Respondent:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">Proposition: The constitutional mode of electing a Circuit Judge is by voting <em>viva voce.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">I. There are two ordinary <em>modes </em>of election, viz., voting <em>viva voce, </em>which is essentially open and public, and voting by ballot, \u25a0which is essentially secret. The theory of our State Constitution is that in all elections by the people the secrecy of the vote shall be impenetrable, so as to insure the free action of the voter, but that in all elections by the Legislature the action of each member should be open to the scrutiny of his constituents, so as to preserve the full accountability of the legislator to the people, of the agent to the principal, of the representative to the sovereign. Hence it is provided in Article VIII, Section 1, that \u201cin ail elections by the people the electors shall vote by ballot;\u201d while in Article II, Section 24, it is ordained that \u201cin all elections.by the General Assembly or either house thereof the members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>their votes thus given shall be entered upon the journal of the house to which they respectively belong.\u201d The same principles prevail in the fundamental laws of other States. Take for example the Constitution of Indiana. Article II, Section 13, of her Constitution reads: \u201cAll elections by the people shall be by ballot, and all elections by 'the General Assembly or either branch thereof shall be <em>viva voce.\u201d </em>In relation to this Section the Appellate Court of Indiana well remarks: \u201cHere are two modes of election provided for and enjoined \u2014 the one applicable to the General Assembly, the other to all elections by the people. There is no trouble in determining that the <em>viva voee </em>method was intended to secure publicity; and the reason for such publicity is equally manifest. Elections by the General Assembly must be <em>viva voce. </em>And why? Because the members of that body are agents or representatives of their several constituencies, to whom they are responsible for their votes, and to that end they must vote openly and audibly, that it may be known how they are exercising their delegated authority. No such reason, if indeed there be any, exists as to the voter at a popular election. Pie represents nobody, and is responsible to nobody for the vote he may cast. He should vote honestly and intelligently, and under our system he is presumed to do so; but he has the absolute right to exercise the franchise as he pleases, uncontrolled and unquestioned by any person or <em>power.\u201d </em>\u2014 Williams vs. <em>Stein, </em>33 Ind., 89.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">It may be useful to take a cursory review of the constitutional history of South Carolina in this connection. Under the Constitutions of 1778,1790 and 1861, elections were held by ballot, whether the people voted or the General Assembly; and nearly all public officers were elected in this manner by the Legislature instead of by the people. But the Convention of 1865 made several radical changes in our political system. The election of Governor and of various State and local officers was given to the people, and it was ordained also that the General Assembly in all elections should vote openly and that each member\u2019s vote should be recorded. Hon. B. E. Perry, Provisional Governor, in his first message to the Convention, after advising that various \u201celections and appointments should be taken from the Legislature,\u201d proceeds as follows: \u201cIn all elections made by the Legislature, the voting should be <em>viva voee, </em>so that each member\u2019s constituents might know how he voted. The ballot is secret and conceals the member\u2019s vote from his constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ency. The people have a right to know how their representatives voted in elections as well as in legislation. In all elections by the people the ballot is certainly the proper mode, for it enables every man to vote independently, according to his own convictions. No one has any right to know or question his vote. He votes as a sovereign. But the representative votes for others, and they have a right to know how he votes.\u201d \u2014 Jour. Conv., S. C., 1865, p. 16. On the day when this message was read, (which was the second day of the Convention,) Mr. Orr, of Anderson, introduced a resolution, which was referred toan appropriate committee: \u201c That all elections by the Legislature shall be made <em>viva voce, </em>and the Dame of the member and of the person voted for recorded.\u201d On the following day the Governor\u2019s message was considered and the subject of \u201c voting <em>viva voce </em>in elections by the Legislature \u201d was referred to the Committee on the Legislative Department of the Constitution. Three days afterwards a report was made on Mr. Orr\u2019s resolution by the Committee on Amendments to the Constitution, and it was subsequently acted upon by the Convention in connection with the report of the Committee on the Legislative Department, the result being the adoption of the suggestions of the Provisional Governor, in the terms of our present Constitution, which are taken <em>verbatim </em>in this particular from the Constitution of 1865. On the last 'day of the session of the Convention, a congratulatory message was received from Governor Perry, in which he alludes to the fact that the Convention had \u201cdeclared the responsibility of the representative to his constituency by <em>viva voce </em>voting in the Legislature.\u201d\u2014 Jour. Conv., 1865, p. 130.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">But although, under the Constitution of 1865, the share of the masses in the administration of the State was greatly enlarged, yet a factor was introduced into our political system, three years later, which required that the scheme of the State Government should be still further popularized, to meet the demands of the advocates of universal suffrage; and accordingly we find the Constitution of 1865 was not satisfactory to the majority of the voters of 1868. One needs only to read the debates of the Convention of 1868 and the Constitution then adopted to become convinced that Mr. A. G. Mackey, the President of the Convention, correctly expresses, not simply his own views, but those of the delegates and their constituents, when, in the preface to the journal of that Convention, he characterizes the Constitution of 1865 as \u201cin some respects an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>improvement on that of 1790,\u201d yet \u201cnot such an instrument as the progressive spirit of the age demanded.\u201d And, notwithstanding this dissatisfaction with the Constitution of 1865 in general, we find that the Section of that Constitution prescribing that all elections by the Legislature shall be <em>viva voee </em>was reported <em>verbatim </em>to the Convention of 1868 as a part of the Article on the legislative department, and that it passed the Convention without question or debate. In fact, there was no room for any extension of its terms. \u201cIn <em>all </em>elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof,\u201d is so comprehensive as in its very words to admit of no exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">We have dwelt at some length on the constitutional history of South Carolina since the war, because the state of the public mind at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1868 renders us legitimate assistance in the construction and interpretation of its provisions. As is well remarked by Judge Story in <em>Prigg </em>vs. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>16 Pet., 610: \u201cPerhaps the safest rule of interpretation, after all, will be found to be to look to the nature and objects of the particular powers, duties and rights, with all the lights and aids ot contemporary history, and to give to the words of each just such operation and force, consistent with their legitimate meaning, as may fairly secure and attain the ends proposed.\u201d Mr. Smith, in his Commentaries on Statutory and Constitutional Construction, \u00a7491, says: \u201cThe reason of the statute \u2014 that is, the motives which led to the making of it, the object in contemplation at the time the Act was passed, \u2014 is another criterion by which to ascertain the true meaning of the Act.\u201d Again, he says, in the same section of his work : \u201c When we once know the reason which alone determined the will of the law-makers, we ought to interpret and apply the words used in a manner suitable and consonant to that reason and as will be best calculated to effectuate the intent.\u201d See the same in Yattel, \u00a7 287.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">Puffendorf remarks : \u201c That which helps us most in the discovery of the true meaning of the law is the reason of it or the cause which moved the legislator to enact it.\u201d Cited in Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Stat., 133.

It being evident, therefore, that the popular meaning of the words \u201cjoint ballot \u201d ought to prevail over any technical definition, we interpret them, in Article IY, Section 13, to mean that the General Assembly should vote as a joint body and not in separate houses. For, in common usage, we find the word \u201c ballot \u201d applied as a <em>generic </em>term, denoting the \u201c act of voting \u201d as frequently as it is employed as a <em>specific </em>term, confined to one particular <em>mode </em>of voting; and in one lexicographer at least this use of the word \u201cballot\u201d in a generic sense is recognized. Bouvier, in his Law Dictionary, after giving the specific meaning of \u201c a little ball or a paper, &amp;c.,\u201d adds, as a definition, <em>\u201c </em>the act of giving votes.\u201d Common usage among parliamentarians and legislative bodies sanctions this definition. For instance, nothing is more common than to read or hear, among persons of education, as well as the unlearned, and from the lips and pens of politicians, statesmen, journalists, and, if your Honors please, from parliamentarians also, that in a convention or a caucus 'such a candidate was nominated on the first ballot, or such ballot as the case may have been, without intending thereby to indicate at all the <em>mode </em>of voting. We have heard again and again that at the National Republican Convention of 1876 Rutherford B. Hayes, of Ohio, was nominated as the Republican candidate for President on the eighth ballot, and yet the vote was taken <em>viva voce. </em>It is common to remark, after a State election, that the new Legislature of the State will be composed of so many Democrats and so many Republicans, giving the Democrats (or <em>vice </em>versa) a majority on joint ballot, thus securing the election of a United States Senator, and yet every well-informed person knows that a United States Senator must be elected <em>viva voce, </em>according to the Act of Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">Again, we observe a similar use of the word \u201c ballot \u201d to denote \u201c the act of giving votes \u201d in the Journal of the Convention of 1868, which framed the Constitution.

Such criticism may not be wholly without use; it may sometimes illustrate or unfold the appropriate sense, but unless it stands well with the context and subject matter it must yield to the latter. While, then, we may well resort to the meaning of single words to assist our inquiries, we should never forget that it is an instrument of government that we are to construe; and, as has been already stated, <em>that </em>must be its truest exposition which best harmonizes with its design, its objects and its general structure.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-7\">Mr. Story, in his work on the Constitution, \u00a7 454, says: \u201c It does not follow, either logically or grammatically, that because a word is found in one connection in the Constitution with a definite sense, therefore the same sense is to be adopted in every other connection in which it occurs. This would be to suppose that the framers weighed only the force of single words, as philologists or critics, and not whole clauses and objects, as statesmen and practical reasoners. Men of ingenious and subtle minds, who seek for symmetry and harmony in language, having found in the Constitution a word used iu some sense which falls in with their favorite theory of interpreting it, have made that the standard to measure its use in every other part of the instrument. They have thus stretched it, as it were, on the bed of Procrustes,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-8\">Says Vattel: \u201c The consideration of the reason of a law or promise not only serves to explain the obscure and ambiguous expressions which occur in the piece, but also to extend or restrict its several provisions independently of the expressions, and in conformity to the intention and views of the Legislature or the contracting parties, rather than to their words.\u201d \u2014 Law of Nations, Book II, Chapter XVII, \u00a7 290.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>As to statutes, Potter\u2019s American Rules on this subject are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">\u201cStatutes must be interpreted according to the intent and meaning, and not always according to the letter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\">\u201c A thing within the intention is within the statute though not within the letter; and a thing within the letter is not within the statute unless within the intention.\u201d \u2014 Potter\u2019s Dwarris, 144, and eases there cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-7\">\u201c The intent of the Legislature is not to be collected from any particular expression, but from a general view of the whole of an Act of Parliament.\u201d \u2014 Potter\u2019s Dwarris, 193.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-8\">\u201cIn construing Acts of Parliament,\u201d says Lord Tenterden, 7 B. &amp; C., 643, \u201cJudges are to look at the language of the whole Act; and if they find in any particular clause an expression not so large and extensive in its import as those used in other parts of the Act, and upon a view of the whole Act they can collect from the more large and extensive expressions used in other parts the real intention of the Legislature, it is their duty to give effect to the larger <em>expressions.\u201d </em>\u2014 Ibid, 194.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-9\">\u201cSometimes, when the words of a statute are obscure, the intention of the Legislature is to be collected from the cause and necessity of the statute, and sometimes from other circumstances; and whenever it can be discovered it ought to be followed with reason and discretion in the interpretation, although such interpretation seem contrary to the strict letter of the <em>statute.\u201d </em>\u2014 People vs. <em>Utica Insurance Company, </em>15 Johns., 358.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-10\">Applying these rules to the Constitution as a whole, we find the \u201c more large and extensive expression \u201d to be in Article II, Section 24: \u201cIn all elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof, the members shall vote <em>vim voce; </em>and their votes, thus given, shall be entered upon the journal,\u201d &amp;c.

We have already seen that the \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d of this Section is to insure full responsibility of the representative to the people. When we construe the expression \u201cjoint ballot \u201d in Article IY, Section 13, in the light of the context, can we, in the face of all these rules, narrow its meaning down to a secret vote ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-11\">What is the \u201cdesign,\u201d what are the \u201cobjects,\u201d of thi.s Section?

But let us leave the instrument itself, and again recur to the light of its history. We have already examined into the temper and tendencies of the framers and their constituents; let us now notice the proceedings of the Convention of 1868 in reference to Article IV, Section 13: \u201cWhen the inquiry is directed to the mischief designed to be remedied, or the purpose sought to be accomplished by a particular provision, it may be proper to examine the proceedings of the Convention which framed the instrument.\u201d\u2014 Cooley Const.

Nash and others' advocating their election by the General Assembly. Mr. Mackey in his argument on the subject alludes to that principle of the Constitution which insured legislative responsibility to the people in the following terms: \u201cThe members of the Legislature are sufficiently responsible to the people for their action, and if they elect an incompetent or corrupt Judge the people will take care that those men shall never again take their seats in the General Assembly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">After the debate, the result was the adoption of Mr. Wilder\u2019s amendment by a vote of 65 to 24. \u2014 Jour.

And now we come to consider the contemporaneous and practical construction of the Constitution in this particular. The people ratified and adopted the Constitution on the 14th, 15th and 16th days of April, 1868, and at the same election, upon the same ticket, voted for members of the General Assembly. \u2014 Ordinances Conv. 1868, Gen. Stat., 55. The General Assembly thus elected was composed largely of members and attachees of the Convention. By a comparison of the rolls of the Convention and of the General Assembly, it will be seen that sixty members of the Convention were elected members of the Legislature \u2014 seventeen as Senators and forty-three as Representatives. One of the duties of that General Assembly was to elect Circuit Judges. How did they elect them? They elected them in joint assembly, the members voting viva <em>voee, </em>and the names of members and their votes being recorded in the journals. And thus has election after election of Circuit Judges proceeded, without a question or a doubt as to the propriety or legality of the <em>mode, </em>up to 1877. Judges elected <em>viva voee </em>took the oath of office and went upon the bench to construe and administer the Constitution and the laws. Astute constitutional lawyers, hostile to the new system and ready at all times to expose and take advantage of any mistakes in its practical workings, appeared before those Judges and argued important causes, involving life, liberty and property, without expressing a single doubt as to the constitutionality of their election in this particular, until the case of <em>Whipper </em>vs. <em>Reed, </em>lately before this Court.

The question was concerning the right of the Judges of the Supreme Court <em>to </em>hold Circuit Courts, and it was contended that the Supreme Court Judges, having been appointed and commissioned for that Court only, could not sit on the bench of an inferior Court. The language of Judge Patterson, in delivering the opinion of the Court, is: \u201cTo this objection, which is of recent date, it is sufficient to observe that practice and acquiescence under it for a period of several years, commencing with the organization of the judicial system, affords an irresistible answer and has indeed fixed the construction.

And now, in conclusion, let us cite a regulation from an ancient and venerable authority: \u201cIt is a rule,\u201d says Lord Bacon, in his Maxims, <em>(Reg., </em>10,) \u201c that the King\u2019s grants shall not be taken or construed to a special intent.\u201d Our sovereign is the people ; their grant is our fundamental law. By the Constitution they have confided in the Legislature important trusts, but they have coupled those trusts with a full and complete accountability of their agents to themselves. They have retained the right to know all the official acts of their representatives; and they have, for greater certainty, declared in the preamble to their grant that \u201c the enumeration of rights in this Constitution shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the people, and all powers not herein delegated remain with the people.\u201d \u2014 Article I, Section 41. Has the Legislature any right to exceed the powers thus bestowed upon them? And when they are instructed to exercise their delegated powers in a particular way, can they exercise them in another way, less favorable to the grantor, without being guilty of usurpation?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-12\">Let us, therefore, maintain the integrity of the fundamental law, construed according to the maxims of popular government venerated and upheld by our fathers in the best days of the republic. And, in reading its language, let us remember that \u201c the language of'the country,\u201d as one of our Judges has said, \u201cis the coinage of the whole people.\u201d The worijs of the Constitution were coined in the people\u2019s mint aud their authority has given them currency. The only proper device to be stamped upon them is the image of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>their sovereign. We cannot substitute for that image the profile of a Webster or of a Walker or of any other etymologist. Neither can we impress upon them any stamp of temporary expediency without rendering them counterfeit. The \u201cimage and superscription \u201d are Caesar\u2019s; let us, therefore, \u201c render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Points and Authorities by Robert Aldrich, of counsel for State:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">Article II, Section 24, Constitution of South Carolina: \u201cThat in all elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof, the members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>and their votes thus given shall be entered upon the journal of the house to which they respectively belong.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">This Article relates to the legislative department, and this provision is <em>the rule </em>by which the General Assembly are to be governed in the matter of elections <em>generally.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\">Article IY, Section 2: \u201cThey (Justices of the Supreme Court) shall be elected by a <em>joint vote </em>of the General Assembly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-9\">A joint vote <em>by ballot </em>would be a joint vote; and if this Article stood alone its requirements would be fulfilled either by a joint vote by ballot or a joint vote <em>viva voce. </em>Why, then, may not the Legislature elect Justices of the Supreme Court by ballot ? It is because the special provision in this Article must be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with the general provision contained in Article II, Section 24; and harmony being the prime object in statutory construction, this is obtained by giving such a construction to the words <em>joint vote </em>as will bring them under the general rule laid down in Article II, which requires all the elections by General Assembly to be <em>viva voce.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-10\">Article IV, Section 13: \u201cAnd for each Circuit a Judge shall be elected by <em>joint ballot </em>of the General Assembly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-11\">If this Section of this Article stood alone, no question could arise as to the construction to be given to it, and the mode of voting would be by ballot. How is it varied by construing it <em>in pari materia </em>with the provision contained in Section 24 of Article II ? They are in direct conflict. One commands <em>viva voce; </em>the other commands <em>ballot.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-12\">A rule is, in case of a conflict, a special provision will control a general.

To hold that the Judges of the Circuits shall be elected by a <em>viva voce </em>vote, in deference to the provisions of Section 24, Article II, is to <em>destroy </em>the provision of Article IV, Section 13. To hold that all elections by the General Assembly shall be <em>viva voee, except </em>elections for Circuit Judges, is to give effect to all parts of the instrument\u2014 preserving all, destroying none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-6\">The reason is asked for this difference in.the mode of voting. It is sufficient that it is commanded by the fundamental law to be obeyed. There is a great underlying reason, however, for the re<em>quirement </em>\u2014 protection to the voter; protection to those represented by the voter. <em>Protection </em>is the first aim of government; the second is purity in the public service. It\u2019is not strange that in a constitution of government, protection and purity should be guarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">If, then, by all the considerations we are at liberty to indulge, we conclude that Circuit Judges are required to be elected by joint ballot., is an election by joint,vote <em>viva voce </em>a valid election ?

Does, then, this general provision that all elections by the General Assembly shall be <em>\u201cviva voce </em>\u201d so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>overshadow the special and express provision with regard to the mode of electing Circuit Judges that we must go counter to the recognized meaning of language and do violence to the Constitution itself? Certainly not. It has been laid down as an established rule in constitutional interpretation that when a special provision conflicts with a general, the former must be treated as an exception to the latter, as much so as if the words in the general provision had been followed with \u201c <em>save as hereinafter provided,\u201d </em>so that we must read the 21st Section of Article II as if the words \u201c <em>viva voce\u201d </em>were followed by <em>\u201c save, as hereinafter provided in Article IV, Section </em>13, <em>of this Constitution.\u201d </em>\u2014 Potter\u2019s Dwarris, 117, 272, 273.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">Thus, then, is harmony restored to the Constitution, yet no violence done to its letter or to its spirit.

The second Article relates to the legislative department, and the 24th Section provides: \u201c That in all elections by the General Assembly,-or either house thereof, the members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>and their votes thus given shall be entered upon the journal of the house to which they respectively belong.\u201d From this it is clear tha.t all elections by the General Assembly, as a general rule, are to be <em>viva voce; </em>and if nothing more had been said, the <em>viva voce </em>of the Circuit Judges would unquestionably be constitutional. But, as a constitution or an Act is to be construed together, we must take all the parts of either to arrive at a correct conclusion. Coming, then, to the fourth Article, Section 2, which relates to the judicial department, separate and distinct from the legislative, and subsequent from it, we find the following provision as to the election of Justices of the Supreme Court: \u201cThey shall be elected by a <em>joint vote </em>of the General Assembly.\u201d And, further on, in the same Article, Section 18, providing for the election of Circuit Judges, we find the following provision: \u201cAnd for each circuit a Judge shall be elected by <em>joint ballot </em>of the General Assembly.\u201d Pursuing our inquiry in Article VII, Section 1, which relates to the right of suffrage, we find, further, that \u201cin all elections the electors shall vote by <em>ballot.\u201d </em>These are all the provisions in the Constitution which relate to the mode of voting. In the legislative department the members shall vote <em>viva voce </em>in all elections; in the judicial department the Justices of the Supreme Court shall be elected by a <em>joint vote, </em>and the Circuit Judges by a <em>joint ballot </em>of the General Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">In elections by the people the vote shall be by <em>ballot. </em>Thus, it will be perceived, there are four modes of election prescribed by the <em>Constitution </em>\u2014 viva <em>voee, joint vote, joint ballot </em>and <em>ballot. </em>The first is a general provision; the other three relate to particular elections-If the second Article is to control the construction, the provisions of the fourth Article are surplusage and should not have been put in. To arrive at a just construction of the Constitution, it is neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>sary to ascertain the correct meaning of the expressions <em>vote </em>and <em>ballot. </em>They are sometimes used in the same sense, but, critically speaking, the words do not mean the same thing. Walker defines <em>ballot </em>\u201ca little ball or ticket used in giving votes; the act of voting by ballot.\u201d <em>Vote, </em>he says, is \u201c suffrage <em>voice </em>given and numbered.\u201d And so Webster: <em>ballot </em>is \u201c a ball used in voting, or a piece of paper or other thing used for the same purpose; the whole amount of votes cast.\u201d <em>Vote, </em>is \u201c to express or signify the mind, will or preference, either <em>viva voee </em>or by ballot, or other authorized means, as in electing men to office.\u201d And Richardson, in one of his illustrations, quotes from \u201c Locke on the Human Understanding,\u201d b. 4, Chapter XX: \u201cHow many men have no other ground for their tenets than the supposed honesty or learning or number of those of the same profession ? as if honest or bookish men could not err, or truth were to be established by the <em>vote </em>of the multitude.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"246\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">From all this, it seems that vote is a noun of multitude, aDd the vote is ascertained by counting the ballots or the <em>viva voee </em>responses. The words are not synonymous. <em>Ballot </em>means the expression of the will of the voter by a ball or a piece of paper. <em>Vote </em>means the aggregate expression of all the voters, whether indicated by a ball, a piece of paper, or <em>viva voee; </em>and that they are not used in the fourth Article of the Constitution as correlative terms is apparent from the use of them in this Article in juxtaposition. Thus, in the second Section, it is declared the Justices of the Supreme Court shall be elected by a <em>joint vote, </em>which may be either by <em>ballot </em>or <em>viva voce; </em>and immediately after, in the thirteenth Section, on the same page, it is provided the Circuit Judges shall be elected by a <em>joint ballot, </em>which can only be by writing or printing the name of the person voted for on apiece of paper. Now, can it be contended that the framers of the Constitution used these expressions to mean the same mode of voting, or did they have a design in providing different modes ? It was not an accident, nor was it careless expression; for in Article VII, Section 1, it is provided that \u201cin all elections by the people the electors shall vote by <em>ballot.\u201d </em>This proves conclusively that the different expressions of the mode of voting were used by the Convention designedly; they intended to distinguish between the vote by <em>ballot </em>and the vote <em>viva voee. </em>Will any one contend for a <em>viva voce </em>vote- when the Constitution commands the vote to be by <em>ballot ? </em>And there was a sufficient reason for prescribing a different mode. The Justices of the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Court were to be elected for the whole State and for a longer term, while the Judges of the Circuit Court were to be elected for a circuit and shorter term. It was also ordained that they should interchange 'circuits as provided by law, yet it might happen that the Legislature would not make that provision, as they did not until the last session. So, in order to prevent any prejudice that might influence the mind of a Circuit Judge by knowing that a man of influence, a suitor in his Court, had supported or opposed his election, the Constitution designedly provided that the election of these Judges shall be by <em>ballot. </em>Can anything be more clear ? A ballot cannot be a <em>viva voce vote, </em>because the former implies secrecy, while the latter commands verbal utterance. Therefore it must have been used advisedly, and, as just stated, a sufficient reason did exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"247\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">It may be laid down as a general proposition in the construction of constitutions and statutes, that when the first and the succeeding clauses are inconsistent the latter controls the former. If this be true, (and it will hardly be disputed,) the argument is concluded ; \u25a0for although the expressions <em>viva voce </em>and <em>joint vote </em>may be considered synonymous, there can be no doubt as to the meaning of <em>ballot. </em>When an elector is directed to vote by <em>ballot, </em>there is no escaping the duty to be performed; he must express his preference either by a ball or on a piece of paper deposited in a box or other receptacle, and the majority of the <em>ballots </em>thus deposited is the vote that determines the election. And so, when the election is <em>viva voce, </em>the majority of audible expressions is the vote that determines the election. And again, when the election is by <em>joint vote, </em>the choice of the electors may be expressed by the audible announcement of their choice or the silent evidence of their will as indicated by the ball or the piece of paper.. In other words, the vote is the aggregation of the verbal announcements made or the written ballots deposited. For although, in common parlance, vote and ballot may be used as convertible terms,' yet when they are used in a Constitution or in the same Act, directing how the Justices of the Supreme Court and the Judges of the Circuit Court shall be elected, we are forced to ascertain the critical meaning of the words used, to determine what was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. If, then, the expressions <em>joint vote </em>and <em>joint ballot </em>mean different modes of election, we cannot escape the conclusion that the election of the Circuit Judges, except of the Fifth Circuit, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>unconstitutional and void, the others having been elected <em>viva voce </em>and not by <em>joint ballot </em>as required by the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"248\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">It has been suggested that the use of the word \u201c ballot \u201d instead of \u201c vote,\u201d as to the election of Circuit Judges, is a clerical error, and that the inexperience and ignorance of the members of the Convention did not enable them to detect it; also, that this is probable, as there is no mention of an amendment in the journal \u2014 the original draft being <em>vote. </em>It appears to us that the suggestion is without force. Dr. Mackey, the President of the Convention, a forcible and perspicuous writer, was accustomed to preside over deliberative assemblies, and his works show that he understands the use of words. Mr. Chamberlain, a lawyer of ability and a man of high literary culture; Mr. Corbin and Mr. Leslie, both lawyers and certainly astute men; Judge Wright, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and many others, of more or less culture and attainment, were members of the Convention. It is hardly to be supposed that so important a change in the organic law would have escaped their notice, or of the Committee whose duty it was to revise and engross the Constitution before it was adopted. But even if such an error had been made by the Engrossing Clerk and overlooked by the Engrossing Committee, as well as the professional and educated men of the Convention, it cannot be corrected either by the Supreme Court or the Legislature, for the Convention passed an ordinance <em>\u201c </em>to provide for the ratification of the Constitution,\u201d which was submitted, as it now reads, to the registered voters of the State on the 14th, 15th and 16th days of April, 1868, and by them ratified; so that if there was a clerical error, it was embodied in the Constitution adopted by the Convention, ratified by the people, and the only way to correct it is in the mode and manner prescribed by the Constitution itself in Article XV. It would be a gross usurpation, either by the Courts or the Legislature, to override and change this Article of the fundamental law.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"249\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b140-6\">January 22, 1878.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"250\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ADPp\">The Judges delivered their opinions, <em>seriatim, </em>as follows:</p>\n<author id=\"b140-7\">Haskell, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmI\">The question in this case is of the most serious character. It involves the construction of an important clause in the Constitution of the State, and upon such construction depends the title to one of the highest and most honorable offices in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>gift of the State. The Court, impressed by the gravity as well as the magnitude of the matter which it has had under consideration, while there is division of opinion, has, nevertheless, arrived at a conclusion concurred in by a majority of its members. The opinion of each Justice will be rendered separately, and I proceed to state some of the reasons by which my mind has reached that conclusion upon which the judgment of the Court is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The action is brought in the name of the State by the Attorney General, and is against A. J. Shaw as occupant of the office of Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit of the State, claiming to have been elected thereto on the 12th day of February, 1875. The second and third allegations of the complaint, and upon which the questions hinge, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201c2. That the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, ArtiIV, Section 13, provides that for each judicial circuit a Judge shall be elected by joint ballot of the General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u201c3. That said A. J. Shaw was not elected Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit by joint ballot of the General Assembly, as the Constitution of the State requires, but was elected by the <em>viva voce </em>vote of the Senators and members of the House of Representatives met in joint assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In the answer of the defendant it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u201cThat, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of this State, (Section 24, Article II, and Section 11, Article IV,) he was elected to the office of Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit on the 12th day of February, A. D. 1875, by the joint vote of the General Assembly of South Carolina, the members thereof voting <em>viva voce, </em>and their votes thus given being entered upon the journal of the house to which they respectively belonged, and that by virtue of said election he now holds and lawfully is in the exercise of the said office, and has not intruded into the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Section 11, Article IV, provides how vacancies shall be filled, and on this point there is no dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Section 24, Article II, cited in the answer, is as follows: \u201cIn all elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof, the members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>and their votes thus given shall be entered upon the journal of the house to which they respectively belong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>And upon this the defendant rests his title to the office. The facts are admitted, and the question becomes one of law solely, and, briefly stated, is thus :</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It is claimed by the State, first, that where the manner or mode of voting at an election is prescribed by the Constitution, it must be observed, and that an election by any other mode of voting than the one prescribed is null and void; second, that the Constitution, in Section 13, Article IV, does prescribe the manner of voting at the election of Circuit Judges <em>[vide </em>above]; third, that the said mode or manner of voting as prescribed by the Constitution was not observed at the election by which defendant claims the office; fourth, and that, therefore, the election is a nullity, and the defendant has no right to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On the other hand, it is contended that the second proposition above set forth is, in law, not true; but that the mode of voting at the election of Circuit Judges is prescribed and fixed by Section 24, Article II, as well as by Section 13, Article IV, of the Constitution, and that the former Section prevails as to the manner of voting, and that the latter Section applies only to the manner in which the two houses shall assemble for the purpose of voting; second, that the election of defendant was had in conformity to the requirements of both Sections of the Constitution, and -that, therefore, the election is good in law, and the defendant lawfully holds his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The general proposition, that'where the manner of voting is fixed by the Constitution it must be observed and obeyed, is not controverted. It is reduced, then, to the naked inquiry, is the manner of voting at election of Circuit Judges fixed by the Constitution? and, if so, what is that prescribed manner, and has it been complied with in this case? Both sides agree that the mode of assembly of the two houses for the purpose of voting is prescribed by Section 13, Article IV, and that the mode is joint assembly. But, in behalf of the State, it is argued that after the two houses have met the vote must be \u201cby ballot;\u201d whereas the defendant claims that the vote must be <em>\u201cviva voee,\u201d </em>in obedience to Section 24, Article II, of the Constitution. Which is the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The case was argued on both sides with ability, and did the time permit I would avail myself much more, than under the circumstances is possible, of many of the suggestions and cited authorities, by which I would be aided in elaborating an opinion upon so grave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>a subject. But it is obvious that if the Court has arrived at an unchangeable conclusion it is its duty to render a decision promptly. While it is important that the reasons should be clearly set forth, it is sometimes more important that the conclusion be announced and uncertainty be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Let us now put together the two Sections in which the law of this case lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Section 24, ArticleII, Legislative Department: \u201cIn all elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof, the. members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>and their votes thus given shall be entered upon the journal of the house to which they respectively belong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Section 13, Article IV, Judicial Department: \u201cAnd for each circuit a Judge shall be elected by joint ballot of the General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Were the last Section considered alone, there could be no doubt about its meaning. \u201cElected by the two houses of the General Assembly met in joint assembly \u2014 \u00bfvoting by ballot.\u201d The word \u201cjoint,\u201d of necessity, qualifies the \u201cGeneral Assembly,\u201d for were it made to qualify the word \u201c ballot,\u201d _ it would lead to the absurdity of saying \u201cvote by a joint ball or tipket,\u201d which is impossible. We are forced to adopt the plain meaning established by the common use of the words, by. parliamentary usage and by legislative enactments, all concurring. Indeed, the phrases quoted by counsel, \u201cby joint ballot,\u201d \u201c by ballot jointly,\u201d \u201c-jointly by ballot,\u201d and \u201cjoint ballot,\u201d in connection with elections by the two houses of the General Assembly, have interchangeably been so used, and with undisputed and undoubted signification, from the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1788 to the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">But it is said that while \u201cballot\u201d and \u201cvote\u201d are not synonymous, yet that by usage it has become common to use the word \u201cballot\u201d in the sense of \u201cvote,\u201d or the \u201cact of voting,\u201d without any reference to the manner of voting; or, in other words, that \u201cto ballot\u201d may mean \u201cto vote <em>viva voce\u201d </em>or \u201cto vote by ballot,\u201d \u2014 that the true meaning is to be derived no! so much from the word itself as from the context and the object in view. If this be so, could not Section 1, Article VIII, on the right of suffrage, which reads: \u201cIn all elections by the people the electors shall vote by ballot \u201d be construed to mean \u201cvote <em>viva voce?\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>It is argued, however, that the meaning of Section 13, Article IV, is limited by Section 24 of Article II, which it is claimed is an universal rule and controls <em>all </em>elections by the General Assembly and annuls any subsequent provisions which may not be in accord with it. The proposition, then, is that the word \u201c ballot \u201d in Section 13, Article IV, is either a nullity, because in conflict with the rule set up as universal, or must be made to harmonize therewith by construing the word, if it be possible, to mean \u201c vote.\u201d I see no difficulty in the coexistence and operation of the two provisions, even although the first be an universal rule and the second an exception thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The first occurs in the Article on the legislative department, and defines and limits the power of the General Assembly with regard to elections in that body.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In Article III, the executive department, it will be found in Section 4 that when the election of Governor devolves upon the Legislature by reason of \u201ctwo or more\u201d of the candidates being \u201c equal and highest in votes,\u201d it is provided that \u201cthe General Assembly shall, during the same session, in the House of Representatives, choose one of them Governor <em>viva voee.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In Article IV, judicial department, Section 2 provides that the Justices of the Supreme Court \u201cshall be elected by a joint vote of the General Assembly,\u201d and, Section 13, Circuit Judges \u201c by joint ballot of the General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">While it might be argued, and, perhaps, with force, that Section 24, Article II, relates only to elections of officers of the General Assembly, and to elections created by legislation, there can be but little doubt as to its having relation specially to that class of elections, for in only three cases does the Constitution order elections by the General Assembly, and in two of these it specifies the manner of voting, and leaves only the third \u2014 the election of Justices of the Supreme Court \u2014 subject probably to the provisions of Section 24, Article II. And if we were undertaking to go behind the words of the Constitution to interpret its meaning, it might be very forcibly shown why a difference is made in the mode of voting for Governor and for Circuit Judges by the General Assembly \u2014 the former having been previously voted for directly by the people, and the election of the latter having originated in the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">This, however, is irrelevant, and it is unnecessary to do more than lay down the proposition that any general or universal rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>subject to exceptions, when the exceptions emanate at the same time from an equal or the same power, and that is the present case. The 24th Section, Article II, is of force in so far as it is not varied by subsequent provisions in the same instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">It appears to me to be clear that the Convention so understood it, and adopted that Section to define the power of the legislative branch of the government, and then provided by succeeding Sections for the specific modes of conducting certain elections which confer offices of great importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The question is thus narrowed down to the last proposition, which is the strength of the case. Can the words \u201cby joint ballot\u201d be construed to mean \u201c by joint vote,\u201d that thereby the two apparently conflicting Sections may be made to- conform, and the election be conducted by voting <em>viva voce? </em>This depends solely upon the meaning of the word \u201cballot.\u201d If \u201ca,ballot\u201d or \u201cto ballot\u201d can be considered to mean \u201ca vote\u201d or \u201cto vote,\u201d that meaning should be adopted, for it would give the fullest force and effect to both Sections of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">I will say here that while the argument was able and ingenious it did not impress my mind, and subsequent reflection has strengthened the conviction that the word \u201cballot\u201d has a fixed, distinct and clearly-defined meaning, so absolute and so well understood as not to admit of a doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The learned counsel for the defendant base their construction of the word \u201cballot\u201d upon two grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">1. That the theory of the State Constitution is \u201c that in all elections by the Legislature the action of each member should be open to the scrutiny of his constituents, so as to preserve the accountability of the legislator to the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">2. That the word \u201c ballot \u201d must be taken in its \u201c popular \u201d sense, and in that sense its meaning is the \u201cact of voting,\u201d without any designation of the manner of voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">However plausible may be the policy of the principle set forth in the first ground, \u2014 and strong, had it been argued in the Convention, \u2014 it is of no avail now. When we go to say what is the law of the land, we must take the law as it is and not as it may have been. The rules of interpretation are well stated, as follows: \u201c The way to ascertain * * * our obligations as they arise from instituted laws is to collect the meaning and intention of the law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>maker from some outward signs or marks; the collecting such intention from such signs or marks is called interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u201c Words are the common signs that mankind make use of to declare their intention to one another; and when the words of a man express his meaning plainly, distinctly and perfectly, we have no occasion to have recourse to <em>any other </em>means of interpretation.\u201d\u2014 Rutherford\u2019s Rules, Potter\u2019s Dwaris, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">And it is only where the words fail to express the meaning plainly, distinctly and perfectly that we can have recourse to conjecture, whether rational or probable. The first ground, therefore, is removed, unless the second is maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">To cast any obscurity over the words \u201c by joint ballot,\u201d it must be shown that the word \u201c ballot \u201d has two meanings when used in such connection and may have been employed in either sense by the Convention. And this becomes a question of evidence and authorities. The \u201cpopular\u201d meaning of a word must be understood to be its correct meaning until the contrary is shown. Yet stronger is the presumption that in a convention which frames the constitution of a State words are used in their true signification, and they must be so accepted until the error is clearly proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">What, then, is.the true and correct meaning of this word ballot? It is of French origin, and has been adopted into the English language without any change in its meaning, so far as the authorities give us light. In the standard French dictionaries it is defined to mean \u201cthe act of voting by balls or tickets by putting the same into a box or urn;\u201d \u201csecret voting by means of ball or ticket.\u201d The examples in Richardson\u2019s English Dictionary clearly define its meaning to be the same as the French word, and I will quote one or two to show a little both of the meaning and history of the word in England:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201c The greatest of the Parliament men hated this design of rotation and balloting as being against their power.\u201d \u201cNo Magistrate was to continue above three years, and all to be chosen by ballot; than which choice nothing could be more fair or impartial, as \u2019twas then thought, though opposed by many for several reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">In Worcester\u2019s Dictionary it is defined \u201c a secret method of voting at elections; America \u2014 where the ballot is practiced.\u201d And so Walker, and so does Webster; and certainly had the word had any popular signification other than the above, it would have been given to us by Webster.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In an elaborate article on the word in the Encyclopedia Brittannica, the concluding sentence is as follows: \u201cIt is one of those matters of which it is necessary in a work like the present'to give some <em>historical account, </em>and at the same time to explain its existing position as a political question, with a fair view of the arguments adopted by either side.\u201d So, also, an able essay on the same subject in the Encyclopedia Americana presents the word \u201cballot\u201d as expressing the side of secret voting as against <em>viva voce </em>or public voting. In neither of these articles is the slightest deviation from the definition above cited, nor is there an intimation that any other meaning has ever been attached to the word. Ballot represents the one policy and <em>viva voce </em>the other.'</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">It is to-day the question between parties in England. It is the main distinction between elections in England and the United States. It has been characteristic of France in her republican government, and is to-day an open question in every constitutional and legislative body that assembles in the United States. The expression \u201cblackballing\u201d still used in secret votes in clubs and private associations is the perpetuation of the ballot by white stones and black stones, by which the Dikasts cast their votes in the judicial assembly at Athens, and signifies the same as the <em>tabula </em>or <em>tabella </em>by which the secret votes were taken in Rome. Thus history and literature and the unswerving practice in the constitutional and legislative assemblies from <em>1788 </em>to the present day show one invariable meaning and application of the word. And as it was used in the-Constitution of 1868, so it had been used from the beginning of the existence of the State in reference to judicial elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In 1865 the question was agitated, and, as is cited in the argument for the defense, a change was urged by the Provisional Governor of the State, and finally was carried in the Convention assembled that year. The Legislature was commanded to vote <em>viva voce </em>in the election of Judges, and it was openly declared that it was so done to carry into effect the theory of responsibility and subjection of legislators to the scrutiny of their constituents. Again, in 1868, the Constitution was changed a'nd the old method restored. Is it possible that it can.be argued that the meaning of the word, so recently and with so much ardor discussed, was not understood? In Section 1, Article VIII, it is said that \u201cin all elections by the people the electors shall vote by ballot.\u201d Could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the meaning of the word be more sharply defined than it is in that Section ? The supposition cannot be sanctioned that the framers of the Constitution could have so trifled with a word of such magnitude as to have used it in senses exactly contrary to each other in two such important Sections of that instrument. The authority adduced to show that \u201cby joint ballot\u201d can mean \u201cby joint vote,\u201d or that \u201cballot\u201d means \u201cvote,\u201d without regard to the manner of voting, is this: That in the journals of the Convention and of the General Assembly, and in the reports of elections by the public press, the word ballot is \u201capplied as a generic term, denoting the \u2018act of voting\u2019 as often as it is used as a specific term confined to one particular mode of voting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">There is no authority to show that it has ever been so used in any parliamentary body in debate upon the question or in legislation upon the subject. The proposition, then, is in no wise sustained, nor can I think it sustainable. The use of the word relied upon by counsel is a mere abbreviation for the convenience of journalists and the press, and can in no wise be sanctioned to establish the meaning of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The evidence in the body of the instrument shows that the Convention understood the words it used, and upon opening the journal nothing is adduced to strengthen the defense. On the contrary, almost the initiatory debate in that body was upon \u201cballot\u201d as opposed to voting by <em>viva voce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The fact that the 13th Section, Article IY, was passed at the second reading in the words \u201cby joint vote, (Journal, p. 617,) and that it was subsequently changed and ratified in the words \u201cby joint ballot,\u201d (Journal, p. 856,) compels us to conclude that the change was made for a purpose, and that purpose can be but the one indicated by the distinction between the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Finally, the ratification and adoption of the Constitution was submitted to the people of the State. The instrument was adopted as it is written, and that is what it means, and so it must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">It is with unfeigned reluctance that a majority of the Court has arrived at the conclusion reached in this case; but whatever may be the inconvenience or the individual hardships involved in the decision, it is our solemn duty to declare the law as it is written.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff have judgment of ouster against the defendant, as prayed for in the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>McIver, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQd\">While concurring fully in the opinion filed as that of the majority of the Court, it has been thought due to the dignity of the office in question, and the importance and gravity of the questions involved, that each of us should formally express our opinions. I, therefore, propose to state briefly some of the reasons which have brought my mind to such conclusion, although I cannot hope to add anything to the argument presented in the opinion of the majority of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The sole question involved in this ease is, whether an election of a Circuit Judge by the General Assembly voting <em>viva voce </em>is a valid election. To determine this question, it is necessary to consider the provisions of the Constitution of this State relating to this subject, for the purpose of ascertaining whether that instrument requires such election to be made in any particular mode, and, if so, what that mode is. For no one will deny that if, by the terms of the Constitution, the election is required to be made in any particular mode, that mode is essential to the validity of such election, and a person who has been elected in any other mode has no legal title to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">It cannot escape the attention of the most casual reader of the Constitution that there are two distinct modes of voting not only provided for, but prescribed by that instrument in express terms \u2014 \u25a0 the one by ballot and the other by the <em>viva voce </em>system. It is likewise equally certain that these modes of voting differ in one, at least, most essential particular, the one implying secrecy, the other involving publicity, and, as matter of history, we know that the respective merits of these two essentially different modes of voting have been, and are yet, the subject of discussion in every country where the right of suffrage exists. Does the Constitution then prescribe that either of these modes of voting shall be adopted in the election of a Circuit Judge? and, if so, which of them is so prescribed ? To answer this question, we naturally turn to the fourth Article of the Constitution, styled the \u201cjudicial department,\u201d and in Section 13 of that Article we find it ordained in explicit terms that \u201cfor each circuit a Judge shall be elected by <em>joint ballot </em>of the General Assembly.\u201d Now, if this Section stood alone, I presume it could not be doubted that the only constitutional mode of electing a Circuit Judge would be by ballot. But it is said that in Section 24 of Article II it is ordained that \u201cin <em>all </em>elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof, the members shall vote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>viva voce, </em>and their votes thus given shall be entered upon the journals of the house to which they respectively belong,\u201d and that it is necessary to put a construction upon the word ballot as used in Section 13 of Article IV different from its primary and well-recognized signification in order that the two Sections may be brought into harmony, upon the well-recognized principle that in construing an instrument like a constitution we must look at it as a whole and so construe its several parts as will prevent conflict and bring about harmony; and that for this purpose, <em>if it should become necessary, </em>words and phrases may be read in a sense different from their usual and primary signification. It is, therefore, contended that the word ballot, as there used, signifies simply the <em>act </em>of voting, and ia not designed to prescribe the <em>mode </em>of voting, and hence that the two Sections, thus read together, prescribe that the Circuit Judge shall be elected by the General Assembly, the two branches voting in joint assembly, but that the <em>mode </em>in which the voting is to be done must be by the <em>viva voce </em>system and not by ballot. It is very obvious that the word ballot is not used in this secondary sense anywhere else in the Constitution, for the only other place in which we have been able to find it is in the first Section of the eighth Article, \u2014 \u201c in all elections by the people the electors shall vote by ballot,\u201d \u2014 and there it is undoubtedly used in its proper and legitimate sense, as no one will for a moment contend that in any election by the people the electors would be at liberty to adopt the <em>viva voce </em>system. Now, while it may be admitted that, in \u00e1 proper case, it is allowable, in construing a constitution, to attribute secondary significations to words and phrases differing materially from their usual and proper meaning in order to prevent a conflict between the different parts of such an instrument, yet this should not be done when such conflict can be avoided in a more natural and proper way, especially when, as we have seen, the rule contended for involves the <em>necessity </em>of giving a word of well-defined meaning not only different significations in different parts of the same instrument but a signification practically the very opposite of its original and usual meaning. Let us inquire, then, whether this apparent conflict between these two Sections of the Constitution cannot be reconciled in a more natural and proper way than by distorting the meaning of a well-defined term and attributing to the framers of the Constitution such gross carelessness and inattention to their duties as using the word ballot in one Section in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>proper and legitimate sense and in another Section in an opposite sense; for certainly voting by ballot and by the <em>viva voce </em>system are, for all practical purposes, precisely the opposite of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">There is no doubt of the correctness of the rule that where general terms, no matter how comprehensive they may be, used in a will, a statute or a constitution, are apparently in conflict with subsequent special provisions, such conflict may be avoided by regarding the latter as exceptions to the former, and that for this purpose Courts will read the two clauses as if words of exception were inserted. Applying this principle, then, to the two clauses under consideration, there is no real conflict, and they may be read together as providing that in all elections by the General Assembly the members shall vote <em>viva voce, </em>&amp;c., except in the election of a Circuit Judge, in which case they shall vote by ballot. The fact that this is not the only instance in the Constitution in which this mode of reconciling an apparent conflict between different Sections becomes necessary indicates the propriety of adopting it rather than the one contended for by defendant\u2019s counsel. In at least one other instance there is an apparent conflict between other Sections df the Constitution, which can only be reconciled upon the principle which we have adopted in this case. In Section 10 of Article XIV it is ordained that the election for <em>all </em>State officers shall be held at the same time as is provided for that of members of the General Assembly. It is very manifest that in order to avoid a conflict with other Sections of the Constitution this Section must be read in connection with such other Sections by incorporating words of exception, <em>e. g., </em>except such as are required to be elected by the General Assembly. It does seem, therefore, that the correct view to take of the two Sections of the Constitution which give rise to the controversy in this case (Section 24 of Article II and Section 13 of Article IV) is to regard the former as simply declaring a general rule for the guidance of the General Assembly, to which the latter furnishes an exception, and that while, as a rule, the <em>viva voce </em>system was to be the mode of voting in elections by the General Assembly, yet that, in case of the election of a Circuit Judge, an exception was established requiring that such election should b\u00e9 by ballot. This view is sustained by reference to the journal of theConvention which framed the Constitution, to which we are at liberty to refer in eases of doubt, in order to ascertain, if practicable, what intention was in the minds of those who used the words in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tion. This journal shows: 1. That the distinction between the different modes of <em>voting </em>\u2014 viva <em>voee </em>and by ballot \u2014 was fully understood and appreciated in that body; 2. That the 13th Section of Article IV, as originally adopted, contained the words \u201cjoint vote\u201d instead of \u201cjoint ballot;\u201d 3. That it was finally adopted in its present form. Why, then, was the change made from \u201cjoint vote\u201d to \u201cjoint ballot,\u201d if these words are now to be construed as meaning the same thing? The conclusion is irresistible that the framers of the Constitution, appreciating, as we have seen that they did, the distinctive feature of the system of voting by ballot, in making the change from \u201cjoint vote\u201d to \u201cjoint ballot,\u201d intended to make a substantial and not a mere verbal alteration. For in substituting for the word \u201c vote,\u201d which was equally applicable to <em>either mode </em>of voting, the word \u201c ballot,\u201d appropriate only to <em>one o\u00ed </em>such modes, they unmistakably indicated their purpose that such mode only should be adopted, so far as that particular election was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It is said, however, that the words \u201cjoint ballot\u201d must be construed as meaning merely the <em>aet </em>of voting rather than the <em>mode </em>of voting, in order to avoid an absurdity, inasmuch as there can be no such thing as a <em>joint </em>ballot in the primary sense of the term ballot \u2014 a small ball or ticket, \u2014 and therefore, as here used, it must be given its secondary meaning. Without stopping to consider whether the word ballot has ever acquired such secondary meaning except in the loose and careless language of the public press or in the journals of deliberative assemblies, where abbreviated forms of expression are quite common, no instance of such meaning having been found in any work of authority emanating either from lexicographers or legal writers, or to show that the phrase \u201cjoint vote,\u201d as found in Section 2 of Article IV, is open to the same criticism, as it is quite as absurd to speak of <em>joint </em>vote as of <em>joint </em>ballot, it being just as impossible for two persons to give a <em>joint viva voee vote </em>as it is for them to put in the ballot box a <em>joint </em>ballot, as they can no more vote with a <em>joint voice </em>than they can with a <em>joint ball or tielcet, </em>it is quite obvious that the phrase \u201cjoint ballot\u201d means jointly by ballot, just as the phrase \u201cjoint vote\u201d means jointly by <em>viva voee </em>vote. In other words, that the word joint was inserted in each instance merely for the purpose of showing that the two branches of the body which was to elect should act together, and not separately, as they do in performing their usual and ordinary duties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Accordingly we find, by reference to the constitutional and legislative history of this State, as cited in the argument, that the phrases \u201cjointly by ballot,\u201d \u201cby ballot jointly\u201d and by \u201cjoint ballot\u201d have been indsicriminately used as interchangeable terms, signifying always the same thing as that above attributed to the words \u201cby joint ballot\u201d in the clause of .the present Constitution now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">I am, therefore, most reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the defendant in this case, not having been elected in the mode prescribed by the Constitution, has no valid title to the office in question, and that upon the demand of the State, through its Attorney General, judgment of ouster must go against the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-6\">Willard, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">(dissenting.) The Constitution (Article II, Section 24,) provides that in all elections by the General Assembly, or either house thereof, the members shall vote \u201c <em>viva voee,\u201d </em>and their votes thus given shall be entered upon the journals of the house to which they respectively belong.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Again, it provides (Article IV, Section 13,) \u201cthe State shall be divided into convenient circuits, and for each circuit a Judge shall be elected by joint ballot of the General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">It is contended by the State that the provision as to electing by joint ballot is equivalent to a declaration that the Circuit Judges shall be elected by ballot, and thus creates an exception to the generality of the words declaring that all elections by the General Assembly shall be by <em>\u201cviva vooe\u201d </em>voting. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that the sole object of the declaration as to electing by joint ballot was to designate the body that should elect the Circuit Judges, namely, the united bodies constituting the General Assembly, joined together for that purpose in one body.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The rule of construction applicable to the case recognizes the fact that words expressing the universal application of a statutory requirement to all cases of this class to which it relates may be restricted not only by the use of technical words, importing exception or limitation, and by more general expressions having an equivalent effect and directly disclosing an intention to create exceptions or limitations, but also by implication inferring such intent as a necessary means of reconciling provisions otherwise inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>It is only as a necessary implication that such a conclusion can be drawn inferentially. It is only the impulsive force of necessity that can justify an encroachment upon the direct terms of a rule of universal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">It follows that when the law-making authority has established a rule in terms extending to all cases of the class embraced in it, and has not subjected it to express limitation or exception, an exception or limitation can only be implied where the provisions from which this implication is sought admit of no reasonable interpretation consistent with the direct sense of the terms of the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">It would also follow that where the sense and intention of the words claimed to operate as a limitation are of doubtful import, admitting of different constructions, some consistent with the general rule and others inconsistent with it, an exception or limitation cannot be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">I am satisfied that at the least the intention of the Constitution involved in the present case is doubtful. This might be inferred from the fact that the Legislature for eight years immediately succeeding the adoption of the Constitution adopted the sense claimed for it by the respondent, and that the entire circuit judiciary was organized during that time upon that understanding of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">It is not an unreasonable construction that the framers of the Constitution may have intended by the language of Section 13, Article IV, to merely designate the body by which the Circuit Judges should be elected, leaving the mode of election to be determined by that Article and Section that dealt directly with that subject. Whether such was their actual intention, it is not important, under the view I take of the case, to inquire, it being sufficient for the purposes of the present case to ascertain that such is not in itself an unreasonable construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">If this be the case, we are bound to adopt that construction which is in harmony with the antecedent provision prescribing the mode of voting in all cases of election by the General Assembly. In order to warrant an encroachment upon the terms of the general rule, we must find a construction inconsistent with that general rule, for it is only by the fact of such inconsistency that we can compel the terms of the general rule to give way before external force. We are not at liberty to raise up a force to antagonize a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>great fundamental provision of the Constitution on speculative grounds or verbal refinements, especially where that fundamental \u00a1irovision is intended to apply to a principle inherent in the nature of the exercise of representative powers in government.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">It is easy to see that the provision as to <em>viva voce </em>voting by the representatives of the people was based upon the general idea that the voting of representatives should be open and responsible, as they act, not in their own interest, but in the interest of the public. This principle is put in opposition to that of secret voting, which is clearly appropriate when the voter acts from his individual choice, arising solely from his sense of personal duty or interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">It has been said that this is a speculative opinion merely, about which there have been differences of opinion, but it is clear that the Constitution of 1868 took this question out of the forum of speculative opinion and placed it among the cardinal principles on which the government should be administered, and we are bound to consider it in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">I regret that I am compelled to differ from the majority of the Court, but it seems to be the inevitable consequence of my understanding of the rules and spirit of constitutional construction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
