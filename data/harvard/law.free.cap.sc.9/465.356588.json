Singleton against Charles T. Lowndes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-19\">The case was referred to Charles H. Simonton, Esq., as Referee, and will be fully understood from his two reports therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-20\">The first report is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-21\">The case, as made out in the pleadings and by the evidence, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-22\">The plaintiff is the niece of the defendant, being the only child of his sister, Mrs. Mary Pon Kinloch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>On 21st of March, 1816, a marriage settlement was made between Frederick Kinloch and Mary I\u2019on Kinloch, to which Cleland Kinloch and Jacob Bond I\u2019on were trustees, whereby certain property was settled to the joint use of the husband and wife during their joint lives, then to the survivor for life, and at the death of the survivor to the issue of the marriage then living, in fee. Cleland Kinloch, one of the trustees, departed this life, and in 1837 proceedings were had in the Court of Equity whereby the surviving trustee was discharged, and the defendant, Charles T. Lowndes, was substituted as trustee under the settlement in his stead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">It further appears that Thomas Lowndes, the father of Mrs. Kinloch, departed this life in July, 1843, leaving in force his last will and testament, whereby he gave and bequeathed certain property to his sons, Rawlins Lowndes and Charles T. Lowndes, and his son-in-law, William Aiken, in trust for the sole and separate use of his daughter, Mary I\u2019on Kinloch, for life, with power of appointment thereof by an instrument under her hand and seal, to take effect during her life, or by an instrument in the nature of a last will and testament, to take effect after her death, and in default of such appointment to her issue living at her death in fee. Rawlins Lowndes and William Aiken declined to accept the trusts, which, however, were assumed by the defendant, Charles T. Lowndes. He took charge of the trust estate and has administered it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">Frederick Kinloch died in August, 1856, and Mrs. Mary Fon Kinloch on 29th of September, 1865. The plaintiff is the sole surviving issue of the marriage. She has been a widow for many years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">Upon the death of her mother she was not aware of the existence of the trusts, and being under the impression that the property from which her mother had derived her income was her absolute estate, she, with the advice and assistance of the defendant, applied for and obtained letters of administration on the estate of her mother and took charge of the assets. She soon found that the dioses in action stood in the name of the defendant, and that his assignment of them was necessary. Being thus put on the inquiry, she examined more carefully among the papers left by her mother, and, with the aid of counsel, for the first time became aware of the existence of the trusts and of the fiduciary character which the defendant bore to her. She has filed her complaint calling him to an account for his actings and doings as trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The answer of the defendant admits that he was trustee both under the marriage settlement and the will, and asserts that he managed the estate with care and advantage. It avers that in 1855, at the request of Mrs. Kinloch, the life tenant, he transferred to her agent, Mr. Petigru, assets of the trust estate to the value of nineteen thousand three hundred and forty-seven 78-100 dollars, and that on the 3d July, 1855, he transferred the remaining assets of the trust estate, under the direction of Mrs. Kinloch, to Adams &amp; Frost, the factors and agents of the plaintiff, and that these gentlemen received them for Mrs. Kinloch. It insists that this transfer divested him of his office as trustee. The answer does not assert positively that this was effected with the consent and concurrence of the plaintiff, but it claims that the transfer of the assets w7as made to Adams &amp; Frost with her sanction. He admits that after-wards, at the request of Mrs. Kinloch, he did receive the assets from Adams &amp; Frost, but he insists that this was in the character of her agent, and only from motives of kindness and affection for her. The answer further states that on 30th January, 1865, the defendant fully accounted with Mrs. Kinloch for these assets so held by him as her agent; that she received them and ratified and confirmed his acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">While, however, denying his liability to.account, the answer proceeds to detail the investments made by him so far as he is able to do so without his books, which were destroyed during the war, and he justifies these investments in every instance. He maintains that, even if his position was that of a trustee, he has \u201c administered the trust, not only faithfully and honestly, not only with prudence and care, but with zeal and skill, and that the losses which have befallen the estate are the result of extraordinary events which no trustee could be held to anticipate or to provide against.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">He files this account:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">Funds in his hands in 1853, which constituted the value of the only assets he ever had as trustee, and exceeded the sum originally received, the excess growing out of his administration of the estate...........................$42,434 78</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">Less amount transferred to Mr. Petigru in 1855.......... 19,347 78</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">Balance................................................$28,087 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Transferred to Mrs. Singleton, the plaintiff:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">Bond of Mr. Thomas Milliken, secured by mortgages of realty and of slaves.......................................$10,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">Bond of J.

No claim whatsoever is made for the sum of $19,347.78 transferred to Mr. Petigru. The plaintiff ratifies this, because the transfer was made to pay the debts of her husband. She, however, positively denies that the assets were transferred to Adams &amp; Frost with any intent or agreement to release the defendant from his duties as trustee. She denies that she had knowledge of the trust, and denies that the transfer was in any sense her act. I am of the opinion, from the evidence, that the plaintiff was not aware of the existence of her interest under the trusts of the settlement and of the will, and that she cannot be held as sanctioning the act of the life tenant. In any event, I am satisfied that some more formal and solemn act is necessary to discharge a trustee than that stated by the defendant; and it is also clear that the action of the life tenant could not divest the rights of the remainderman under the provisions of the instruments creating the trusts, such remainderman taking under these instruments independently of the life tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-12\">The plaintiff objects to the account as erroneous and attacks some of the investments as irregular, insecure and improper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-13\">As to the account:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-14\">A letter of the defendant, dated 29th October, 1853, addressed, it is said, to the late Thomas L.

The testimony of several witnesses shows that these valuations were not excessive. The defendant also says, in his answer, that at the date of the loan Earle \u201cwas a person enjoying excellent credit in Charleston with the mercantile community, and particularly with the banks, and so impressed was the defendant with this that he would not have felt any uneasiness in lending that sum of money to Earle from his own means.\u201d In corroboration of his testimony respecting Earle\u2019s credit the defendant has called witnesses to speak to it, and also introduces in evidence a statement from the books of the Bank of Charleston, of which the defendant was at the time a leading director, showing that at that period the bank had discounted paper, on which Earle was maker or endorser, for nearly $100,000, and, beside this, had accepted him as surety on the bond of one or more of its agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">Upon examining the bond, it appears that it was intended to serve a double purpose, not only as an investment but also the protection of the defendant himself against sundry endorsements for Earle. There can be no doubt that the defendant thought the investment a good one. I apprehend, however, that although we may be satisfied that the trustee had perfect confidence in the safety of the investment, we are not thereby precluded from examining into the grounds of his confidence or from inquiring into the steps which he took in order to satisfy himself. The investment must not only be such as a prudent man would make; it much be such as a prudent man, exercising prudence, had made. As Chief Justice Moses says, in <em>Mayer </em>vs. <em>Mordecai, </em>(1 S. C., 394,) \u201c what will constitute the\u2019care and diligence\u201d exacted from a trustee \u201cwill depend on the attendant circumstances. If the act itself was an incautious and imprudent one, it will not be sustained, and no aid derived from the fact that the trustee was countenanced in it by the participation of prudent men will give it sanction or support.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-7\">There can be no question as to the ability, sagacity and prudence of the defendant in the management of his own affairs. Upon ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>amining into the mortgage, we find that the real estate was a lot on Calhoun street in this city. On this lot it appears from the evidence that there was a row of small houses, rented principally to colored persons, a class of houses commanding a rent much disproportioned to their selling price. The property cost Earle on its purchase $6,000. At the date of the mortgage there was an existing valid lien on all the property of Earle in the shape of a judgment in favor of Thomas O\u2019Brien, on which was due $11,445.83. This judgment had been obtained on a bond given by Earle for the purchase of the Mills House stables in Chalmers street, a valuable property, which cost Earle eighteen thousand dollars, and was then owned by him, and bore date April 19, 1856. Earle owned other parcels of real estate, more or less under mortgage. The testimony shows that he owned real estate, at cost prices.$73,460 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">Amount of mortgages, including those to O. T. Lowndes, trustee. 40,280 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\">Surplus. $32,180 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">When this mortgage was given there was on record, not marked satisfied, another mortgage of the same property for five thousand dollars, which, however, was in fact paid; it does not appear that the defendant was aware of the- existence of this mortgage. It appears from the evidence that when the defendant accepted the security he was under the impression that he was receiving a mortgage of a lot on Calhoun street more valuable than this on which was Mr. Earle\u2019s residence. The slaves mortgaged were all males\u2014 mechanics \u2014 and would, if sold, have commanded high prices, as much as two thousand dollars each. The mortgage was dated 22d May, 1860, and, as far as appears from the evidence, was executed on that day. It was recorded in the office of Register of Mesne Conveyance and in. that of the Secretary of State, on 28th July, 1860, more than sixty days after the execution. At that time Earle was in full business, owed debts, and contracted debts afterward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-10\">Earle died soon after the end of the war.

The plaintiff succeeded in collecting from Earle in his lifetime, on this bond, the sum of five hundred dollars on 4th May, 1867, and a further sum of five hundred dollars on 9th September, 1867.

Before stating the conclusion of law which I have reached upon the facts connected with the Confederate investment, I ask leave to state some of the difficulties which I encountered in coming to that conclusion. It appears to me that the cases which have been decided upon questions made as to such investments, especially those discussed before our Supreme Court, have all been attended by circumstances which do not exist in this case. In these cases the <em>cestui que trust </em>was either under age, or under disability, or absent from the limits of the Confederacy, and so were free from the taint of rebellion. In the present case the plaintiff was <em>sui juris, </em>resided within the Confederacy, and shared to the fullest extent in the hopes and purposes of her own people in the war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">After careful consideration, however, I am of the opinion that the broad principle laid down in our cases binds the Referee, and that a modification of this principle, if any will apply to this case, can only be made by the Court which will review his report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\"><em>Mayer </em>vs. <em>Mordeaai </em>(1 S. C., 383,) held it a breach of trust for a trustee to receive Confederate money upon a bond made before the war, and past due, secured by a mortgage of real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-8\">In <em>Creighton </em>vs. <em>Pringle, </em>(3 S. C., 96,) a trustee was held liable to account for a bond, secured by a mortgage of slaves, made before the war, which he had permitted the obligor to pay in Confederate money and then invested the proceeds in Confederate bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-9\">In both cases it was ruled that, inasmuch as the trustee was not bound to receive the Confederate money, he had no right to receive it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-10\">In <em>Pickens </em>vs. <em>Dwight, </em>(4 S. C., 366,) Moses, C. J., uses this language, speaking of a breach of trust by a trustee in the change of an investment: \u201cMore especially would the breach be without excuse if the new security was of the class least favored by the Courts for investment, and it would be without the shadow of extenuation if the change was made for Confederate notes, which, when compared with gold and silver coin or national bank notes, had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>only a depreciated value, but one daily fluctuating with the probable success or failure of the government'which had issued them, and, to any ordinary understanding, ultimately entirely worthless, unless the civil war which it was waging could resist the arms and powers of the United States which were brought into requisition for its suppression.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">It may be said, however, that, inasmuch as the obligors were made insolvent by the results of the war, the trustee parted with a security which was valueless and the trust estate has lost nothing. But this itself arose from a breach of trust. A trustee has no right to invest the funds of a trust estate without security. The trustee should not have placed the money of his trust estate in this bond without requiring other security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">In <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance, </em>(1 S. C., 209,) Mr. Justice Willard made an exhaustive examination into this subject, and sums up the conclusion as follows: \u201c The trustee will be held responsible for losses of trust funds through loans to private persons, unless securities are taken collateral to such loans. Such securities should primarily consist of mortgages of unencumbered real estate of a value sufficient to guarantee the debt against all contingencies liable to occur or capable of being foreseen. Bonds of individuals should not be taken in lieu of real securities, unless unobjectionable investments cannot, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, be procured. When personal securities are taken in lieu of real, it will devolve upon the trustee to make the necessity and propriety of such investment appear upon an accounting with the <em>cestui que trust.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\">As a conclusion of law, I respectfully report that the defendant must account to the plaintiff for this sum invested in the Huger bond, to wit, two thousand three hundred and eighty-three dollars, ($2,383,)'with interest from the death of Mrs. Kinloeh, 29th September, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\">The testimony upon the Milliken bond has not yet been concluded.

In the year 1853 the United States, being desirous of calling in this loan, which was not yet due, offered to the holders a large premium as an inducement, amounting nearly to twenty-five per cent, of the principal. The defendant accepted the offer for the amount held by him. Of the sum received by him from the United States he invested ten thousand dollars in the bond of Thomas Milliken, with the personal security of E. P. Milliken, and secured his bond by a mortgage of North Mulberry, a rice plantation on Cooper River, and also by a mortgage of sixty-five slaves iu families, working and residing on the said plantation. The bond was originally made by Mr. Thomas Milliken, in the year 1847, and the mortgages had been executed by him at that time. The defendant purchased the security in 1853, and he required the guaranty of Mr. E. P. Milliken. The latter was a merchant, doing business in Charleston, and, as the maker resided in the country, his guaranty was required in order to secure the prompt payment of the interest. The plantation mortgaged had been purchased by Mr. Milliken in 1836 for eighteen thousand ($18,000) dollars. There was due on the purchase money two bonds, one of twelve thousand dollars and one of six thousand dollars, both secured by a mortgage of the land. When the defendant purchased his securities, the first named bond, that of twelve thousand dollars, was unpaid as to the principal, certainly to the sum of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars. The evidence does not show distinctly when the other bond, that of six thousand dollars, was paid. It came into the possession of Alexander Mazyck, as trustee of Mrs. Elizabeth Broughton, and on the death of Mrs. Broughton, in 1857, was transferred by him to her children. T. Alexander Broughton, one of these children, took an affidavit, dated 22d July, 1863, stating that this bond had been paid. He does not fix the date of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">The interest on the bond in question had all been paid when the defendant purchased it, and was paid regularly afterward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">The defendant, in his answer and in his own testimony, says that the plantation was worth from twenty to thirty thousand dollars, and a witness of great accuracy, who has known the plantation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>many years before and after the war, concurs in this estimate of its value. Shortly after the end of the war the holder of the first mortgage foreclosed it, and the plantation sold for about seven thousand dollars. The slaves mortgaged to secure this debt, sixty-five (65) in number, were worth from five hundred to six hundred and fifty dollars each on the average. At the date of the loan and of the purchase of the security by the defendant, no apprehension whatever was felt in the community at large that the institution of slavery would be abolished at any early period. The emancipation of slaves, consequent upon the war, rendered the security valueless and made the estate of Thomas Milliken insolvent. I have no evidence as to the solvency of Mr. E. P. Milliken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">No testimony has been introduced as to the special circumstances under which the investment was made by the trustee. No evidence as to the necessity of this particular investment has been offered, and none as to its propriety, other than the value of the securities, has been adduced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">I have had no evidence that the trustee, either before or after the redemption of the loan by the United States, sought for the investment of the fund a mortgage of unencumbered real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">The only reason given for the sale of the public funds was the premium offered by the government, and the only motive given for the investment in the Milliken bond by the trustee himself is his conviction that it was an investment of the first class.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">Upon these facts I respectfully submit my conclusion of law and the reasons which have led me to this conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">The plaintiff makes two objections to this investment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-10\">1. She contends that the trustee changed an investment already made in the public debt of the United States- \u2014 -the highest class of investments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\">2. That he invested the money thus received in a bond, secured by an insufficient mortgage of real estate, and further secured by a mortgage of personal property, without any proof of the necessity or propriety of such investment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-12\">As our conclusions upon the first objection will depend very much upon the result of our examination of the second objection, I will discuss the latter before addressing myself to the former.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-13\">The plaintiff relies upon the cases of <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance </em>(1 S. C., 220,) and <em>Cureton </em>vs. <em>Wilson, </em>(3 S. C., 456).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>There can be no doubt that if in these cases the learned Judges who delivered the opinions of the Court meant to include in the term \u201cpersonal securities\u201d all investments secured by a mortgage or pledge of personal property, and if they did not confine the expression to personal obligations, that is, to security on the names of persons, without any pledge or mortgage of property, the position of the plaintiff is sustained by very high authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">Let us examine the cases. In <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance </em>the suit was brought against the executors of a guardian seeking an account of the estate of the wards in the hands of their testator. It appeared that the estate, consisting originally of money and of choses in action, had been invested in the joint and several obligations of individuals, without further security, except in one instance in which a mortgage of realty was taken, which realty, however, was covered by liens prior to the mortgage. The Chancellor who heard the case on circuit sustained these investments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">The strict rule respecting the investments of trust estates prevailing in England had been greatly modified in South Carolina so as to suit the circumstances of this country, and the impression had grown up in the profession that want of good faith and gross negligence on the part of the trustee were the only grounds on which he could be held responsible in the event of the loss of trust funds. This impression had been deepened and intensified by the misfortunes which beset our people after the war and had extended itself to the bench. The Court, in <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance, </em>demonstrated in an unanswerable argument that this impression was a false one, not sustained by any of the cases from which it was supposed to be derived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-7\">On the contrary, the Court rule that it is the primary duty of the trustee to obtain a secure investment of the trust fund, secure against all contingencies liable to occur or capable of being foreseen. \u201cThe more difficult question,\u201d says Judge Willard in this able opinion, delivered by him as the organ of the Court, \u201cthe more difficult question is as to the degree of security requisite. This is to be determined in part by settled rules of law and in part through the discretion of the trustee. The Courts have gone no further in limiting the discretion of the trustee than to indicate certain classes of investments as admissible and to reject others as unsuitable. Within the limits of this imperfectly-defined jurisdiction, the trustee has been entrusted with a large discretion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>treated with great liberality, while acting in good faith and chargeable with no culpability or gross imprudence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">In the eases cited by him he indicates the objectionable modes of investment \u2014 the loan of trust funds by a trustee to himself; the purchase of real estate with trust funds; the employment of trust funds in trade or in any speculative undertaking without an express authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">In <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance </em>the trust funds had been invested in the obligations of individuals without' further security. The Court held such investments improper unless the trustee could show that unobjectionable investments could not be procured in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and could prove the necessity and propriety of these investments. This is the full scope of the decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">After a very elaborate and able examination of our cases on the subject of the investment of trust funds by a trustee, the learned Judge sums up his conclusion in these words: \u201cThe trustee will be held responsible for losses of trust funds through loans to private persons unless securities are taken collateral to such loans. Such securities should consist <em>primarily </em>of mortgages of unencumbered real estate of a value sufficient to guarantee the debt against all contingencies liable to occur or capable of being foreseen. <em>Bonds of individuals </em>should not be taken <em>in lieu of real securities </em>unless unobjectionable investments cannot, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, be procured. When <em>personal securities </em>are taken <em>in lieu. of real, </em>it will devolve on the trustee to make the necessity and propriety of such investments to appear upon an accounting with the <em>cestui que trust.\u201d </em>He contrasts <em>\u201cbonds of individuals\u201d </em>with <em>real securities, </em>and says that the former must not be taken unless the latter cannot be had. He says that when personal securities are taken in lieu of real, that is when the bonds of individuals are taken in lieu of real securities, the trustee must show the necessity and propriety of such investment. So, in the beginning of his discussion of this question, he quotes Hill on Trustees, p. 380, that if a trustee \u201cfinds the estate in his hands to consist wholly or in part of personal obligations, it is his duty to call them in and properly invest the fund.\u201d It seems to me that the decision in <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance </em>goes to this extent and no further. The investment by Nance, the guardian of the funds of his wards, was not in that class of securities which would at once be recognized as proper; nor were they of such a character as would, under our decisions, be at once consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ered inadmissible. They were within the limits \u201cof that imperfectly-defined jurisdiction in which trustees have been entrusted with large discretion,\u201d and would therefore be examined by the Court in order to discover whether this discretion was well exercised. When the guardian could show no necessity for the investment of the trust funds in personal obligations without other security, he was held liable for such investment. But when, as in the case of the Butler note, it appeared that a mortgage of real estate was taken, beside the personal obligations of individuals, the charge of negligence against the trustee was dismissed, although the security was imperfect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">In <em>Cureton </em>vs. <em>Wilson, </em>(3 S. C., 457,) the Court approved and reaffirm <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance. </em>In both cases the question arose upon investments in personal obligations, and such investments were contrasted with real estate securities. It would seem, therefore, that neither of these cases decide that an investment of trust funds upon bond or other obligation, secured by the pledge or mortgage of personal property, is a breach of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">We will examine the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\">\u201cThe duty of trustees,\u201d says Judge Willard, in <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance, </em>(1 S. C., 220,) \u201cin relation to investments is defined by the objects prompting the creation of the trust, namely, to place the fund in a state of security and in a condition to yield increase. The resulting duty is to seek, with reasonable diligence and prudence, investments affording both security and increase.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\">The defendant, in order to invest $10,000 of trust funds in his hands, purchased the bond of Mr. Thomas Milliken, secured by a second mortgage of a plantation worth between $20,000 and $30,000. And this bond was also secured by a mortgage of sixty five slaves in families, worth from $32,500 to $39,000. There was a prior lien on the plantation of $18,000. The personalty was unencumbered. I am of the opinion that the mortgage of the realty alone would have been an improper <em>security. </em>\u2014 Morris <em>vs. Wright, </em>14 Beav., 291. Was the mortgage of the personalty such an investment as would place the fund in a state of security against all contingencies liable to occur, or which could be foreseen, and would it be in a condition to yield increase ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-9\">The bond and mortgages were dated in 1847. At the date of the purchase of the defendant, in 1853, the interest had been paid in full to that time. To secure the prompt payment of the interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the future he required and procured the additional security of the name of Mr. E. P. Milliken, and the interest continued to be paid to 1865. The security was thus in a condition to yield increase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">Was the fund in a state of security against all contingencies liable to occur or capable of being foreseen ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">The value of the security was over three times the amount of the debt. The security consisted of families of slaves residing on the plantation, increasing steadily in number, and as steadily increasing in value. At the date of the purchase of this security, no one&gt; however opposed to the institution of slavery, dreamed that there \u25a0 was any hope of its speedy extinction or of its abolition, except after conflicts through a long series of years, and then by legislative enactment providing for the compensation of the owner. The war, in fact so near, was anticipated by none but the wisest of the nation, and not even the most wise could foresee or confidently predict its results.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">The mortgage held by the defendant vested the legal title of the mortgaged property in him, and his remedy against the mortgagee for a breach of the condition of his bond was short and speedy, easy, inexpensive and safe. Against third persons he had his action of trover, and all the remedies and security afforded him by this form of action. To every appearance, the trust fund was as safe as if it was a first lien on the plantation itself; as safe, because every one supposed that the value of this rice plantation depended altogether on the right to use slave labor; and more desirable, because the delay and expense of a foreclosure through the Courts was not incident to it. When it is considered that the mortgage of real estate was \u201c added thereto for what it might prove to be worth,\u201d it seems impossible to avoid reaching the same conclusion at which the Court, in <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance, </em>arrived respecting the Butler bond: \u201c The charge of negligence against the trustee on this investment is not sufficiently made out.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\">We are now prepared to consider the first objection\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\">That the trustee changed an investment in the loan of the United States, the highest class of securities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-10\">This loan was in the six per cent, stock of the government, was not yet due, and the government offered and paid a premium of nearly twenty-five per cent, upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-11\">The rule as stated in <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance </em>is this:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-12\">Trustees are not called upon to obtain for the funds in their hands a greater rate of increase than that which is afforded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>most secure investments of the country.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR8p\">The report of the Referee fully explains the nature of the present case and the facts and circumstances out of which it has arisen. The findings of fact of the Referee will be first considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The proposition advanced by the defendant, that the plaintiff had lost her right to call him to account as trustee, and also to dispute the character of certain investments on the ground of acquiescence and laches, is met by a finding of the fact that the plaintiff was not, during the time to which such allegation relates, sufficiently informed of the nature of the trust and of her interest under it to be subject to the charge of acquiescence or of laches. To disturb that finding of fact, we must conclude that it is unsupported by the evidence, either as a fact not proved or as an improper inference from facts proved, or we must conclude that the clear weight of undisputed evidence is against it. We find no ground for such a conclusion. It was incumbent on the defendant to establish facts of that character by clear proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The interest of the plaintiff during the lifetime of her mother was that of one in remainder, having no present right to control the fund, directly or indirectly, or to enjoy the income of the trust estate. She had a right to hold her hands off from the estate until her right became vested in interest by the happening of the contingencies on which her right of possession depended. She had no duty to discharge in compelling the trustee to a proper discharge of his duty and keeping him within the strict line of that duty. The duty of keeping the trust estate in a safe condition, so that it might come in due time to the hands of the plaintiff, devolved upon the defendant and not upon the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, very clear evidence of an intention on her part to authorize a clear departure from the terms of the trust would have to be produced to warrant the conclusion contended for by the defendant. It is equally clear that the absence of a defined duty of watchfulness and objection on the part of the plaintiff during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>period of time referred to prevents the application of the principles upon which laches is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The conclusion of the Referee as to this part of the case must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The findings of the Referee were objected to on the ground that he had included in his statement of the assets of the trust estate in the hands of the trustee to be accounted for a bond of A. &amp; A. Huger for 82,283, while it is alleged that no part of the assets went into that bond. The statement of the account made by the Referee is largely derived from memoranda coming from the defendant\u2019s custody. These memoranda appear to be necessary in order to state the account of the trustee, as it appears that his books and papers were destroyed through casualties of the late war, and no more direct proof of the accounts being offered by defendants. The character of these memoranda justifies their employment as means of stating the account. Indeed, no objection is made as to their sufficiency as proof of the accounts, but the objection is as it regards the conclusions to be derived from them. We do not find any evidence that the Referee has misinterpreted these proofs or given them undue weight. Certainly the conclusion he has drawn is a fair and reasonable one to derive from the face of the memoranda. The circumstance that the defendant, although a witness in the case on his own behalf, did not give any testimony as to any such objection to the memoranda, affords strong reason to assume that there was no substantial ground of objection to their statements. The fact stated, that length of time had rendered the memory of the defendant indistinct as it regards the state of accounts, cannot help the defendant, for the burden of disputing the representations that appear on the face of the memoranda was upon him. The finding of the Referee as it regards the Huger bond, holding it to have been part of the trust estate to be accounted for, must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">We find no ground for disturbing the remaining findings of the Referee. We can neither say that they are unsupported by evidence nor that they deny the due force of evidence. It remains to consider the questions of law raised in the findings of the Referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">We think that the reasoning and conclusion of the Referee as it regards the Earle bond were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">It is certainly a breach of trust for a trustee to place trust funds in encumbered property, where it is probable that the trust estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>may be called upon to redeem from such encumbrance and may be seriously embarrassed, if not unable, to effect such redemption. This manifest inconvenience lies at the foundation of the rule stated in <em>Nance </em>vs. <em>Nance, </em>(1 S. C., 209,) as it regards investing in encumbered property. In the present case the real property mortgaged was affected by the lien of a large judgment. Whether the negroes that constituted part of the mortgage security were subject to the lien of execution on the judgment does not appear. It is said that property sufficient existed, bound by such judgment, without resort to the property mortgaged; but there was no legal means of compelling the judgment creditor to look to any particular fund, bound by his judgment, and, if there was, still the trust estate would be in the position of having purchased a law suit. It is hardly conceivable that circumstances could exist justifying investment by a trustee in property bound by a judgment. It is not enough to justify an investment that the property bound by a security is amply sufficient to meet its obligation. The nature of the security, and the circumstances affecting its availability, must be such as to afford means, consistent with the nature of trust estates, as well as with the circumstances of the particular estate, of obtaining security for the trust fund and reasonable productiveness. As was said in <em>Nanee </em>vs. <em>Nanee, </em>the highest rate of productiveness is not required, because ordinarily inconsistent with the requisite security. As to what is a sound investment, in point of availability, is not a question to be determined wholly by the judgment of the trustees as to the degree of risks attending a particular investment, but is determined, in part at least, in accordance with the rules that are the results of general business experience, to some extent recognized as fixed rules of legal administration. Nothing is of greater public importance than that that portion of the stored-up wealth of the community which usually falls into fiduciary custody should be wisely and prudently guarded and employed, not only as securing economic results, but in order to discharge a responsible duty to those who have claims upon the guardianship and protection of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">To hold that the investment as to the Earle bond was justifiable would tend to destroy the safeguards surrounding the discharge of fiduciary duties and leave the security of trust estates to the uncertainty of irregular business transactions and to the inaccuracy of speculative authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Other circumstances affecting the value of the investment are stated by the Referee that need not be considered. His conclusion as to the insufficiency of that part of the property not bound by the judgment, and which we find no reason to question, is fatal to the support of the investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The Huger bond appears to have been a personal security merely. Such securities are not in themselves admissible, and can only be made so by evidence of the necessity and prudence of such <em>investment. </em>\u2014 Nance vs. <em>Nance </em>and <em>Allen </em>vs. <em>Gaillard, </em>1 S. C., 279. No attempt was made by the trustee to explain such unsecured investment. It was no doubt the duty of the trustee to call in such improper investment at the earliest practicable moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">It is not necessary to consider whether he had the right to convert that bond into Confederate currency, considering that it was inadequately secured, and, on the other hand, that the only medium of effecting such change of securities at the time was Confederate currency. \u2014 See <em>Mayer </em>vs. <em>Mordecai, </em>1 S. C., 383. Confederate currency was uot money, in a legal sense, and, therefore, receiving Confederate 'currency at a nominal value was not payment in a legal sense. In legal contemplation, Confederate currency was a mere commodity, used by the community as a matter of necessity or convenience as a medium of exchange. In converting a security into Confederate currency the same rules were required to be observed as in case of barter or exchange of one kind of property into another not having the legal character of money \u2014 that is to say, regard must be had to its actual value and not to its nominal value. It appears that the Confederate currency was not at the time worth its nominal value, and, therefore, could not properly be taken at such value.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">It was, therefore, a clear breach of trust for the trustee to convert the Huger bond into depreciated Confederate currency at its nominal <em>value. </em>\u2014 Mayer vs. <em>Mordecai, 1 S. </em>C., 383; <em>Sanders </em>vs. <em>Rodgers, 1 </em>S. C., 452; <em>Womack vs. Austin, 1 </em>S. C., 421; <em>Cureton vs. Wilson, </em>3 S. C., 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Inasmuch as the trustee both invested in and converted the Huger bond improperly, he is properly chargeable with the value of the assets represented by the security converted at the time of such conversion. It does not appear that any actual value has been derived from the conversion ; accordingly the trustee should stand charged with the amount of that bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>We are equally satisfied with the conclusion of the Referee as to matters of law as it regards the Milliken bond. His conclusion of fact that the security afforded by that investment was sufficient in point of fact, independent of that portion of the property mortgaged that was subject to prior liens, we are constrained to adopt as subject to none of the objections that are allowed as sufficient to disturb findings of fact. The question of law arises, from this state of facts, whether a mortgage security taken upon slaves is admissible under any circumstances and whether authorized in the case in hand. Slaves at the time constituted an important element of landed securities, at least so far as they were permanently connected with agricultural pursuits. No other kind of personal property stood in like relation to land. While land possessed the value due to the highest indestructibility, slaves had the advantage of increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The plantation and its slaves were usually considered together as it regarded the value of agricultural lands. It would be stating the rule with too much attention to technical considerations to lose sight of this fact. The habits and customs of the country must be allowed weight, and it is clear that investments in land and slaves engaged in their culture was regarded as the highest security of a private nature and appropriate and safe for the purposes of security. We are thus constrained to treat the land and the slaves as constituting a single subject of investment in the present case, for in their union lay the element of landed value to which security should look and as substantially a real security.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">It appears that one part of the property mortgaged was subject to prior liens, but another part was free from .such prior liens, and, by the finding of the Referee, that part not affected by prior liens was sufficient in itself to put the money loaned in a reasonable state of security. The objection of a prior lien in such case does not go to the sufficiency of the security but presents merely a question of technical compliance with the formal requirements of such investments, and as such it must yield to the evidence of substantial compliance with the requisites of good investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">As it regards the claim for commissions by the trustee, we need not consider the abstract question raised. The defendant came before the Court, in his answer, denying the existence of the trust, and contending that, contrary to the intent of the trust, he had turned over all the assets of the trust estate, many years ago, into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the hands and exclusive control of the life tenant, without regarding the claims of those entitled to take by way of remainder after termination of the life estate. He claims that the trust itself was terminated by that act. This was a clear breach of trust. The defendant claims to have acted since that time as the agent of the life tenant merely \u2014 in other words, that he has not acted from the responsibility imposed by the duty of a trustee for that time. It is not a case for the allowance of commissions, assuming that they could be allowed. Such a claim must rest upon the due performance of the duties imposed by the trust, and when these duties are unperformed it is not demandable either at law or in equity. The answer only demands commissions in case the defendant \u201c is held liable for the mischances of the fund.\u201d The defendant has not been held liable for \u201c mischances,\u201d but for a departure from a clear line of legal duty. No equity exists to extend the demand of the answer beyond its direct sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The report of the Referee and the decree of the Court upon it must be affirmed and the cause remanded for further'proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-6\"><em>McIver, </em>A.
