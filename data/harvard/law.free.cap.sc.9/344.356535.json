The sum of $2,553.53, the aggregate of the debts of Vance, Moseley &amp; Co. and of Vance &amp; Moseley, was to bear interest from the 22d day of March, 1876 ; the sums of the cash advanced were to bear interest from the dates at which they were severally advanced, and the sums of the bills of groceries were to bear interest sixty days after the date at which they were severally advanced, all at the rate of 12 per centum per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">And the said Vance &amp; Moseley, on their part, agreed in the said covenant to pay to the said Geo.

W. Williams &amp; Co., with interest on the said sums as aforesaid ; to consign and ship to them five hundred bales of cotton, to be sold by them as cotton factors upon commissions of 2&amp; per centum, and to pay as liquidated damages two dollars for each and every bale of cotton less than five hundred bales which they might fail to consign and ship to them as stipulated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">Geo.

There was no proof that Vance &amp; Moseley gave direction as to the application of the payments made, or that the plaintiffs made any application otherwise than to the general account. Instead of shipping five hundred bales of cotton, as covenanted, Vance &amp; Moseley shipped only fifty bales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">The complaint alleged that Geo.

He reported as his opinion that the two dollars per bale of cotton mentioned in the covenant were liquidated damages, and he accordingly charged Vance &amp; Moseley with $900 as the amount of such damages. He also reported it as his opinion \u201c that the payments should have been applied to the mortgage debt and not to excess of the advancements not secured by the mortgage,\u201d and in stating the account he so applied them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">The defendants excepted to the report, and His Honor filed the following decree on the exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">On hearing the report of the Referee in this case and the observations of counsel for the plaintiffs and defendants, on motion of the counsel for the defendants, it is ordered and adjudged as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">1.

That the excess of advances by the plaintiffs to the defendants, Vance &amp; Moseley, on the money item in the account exhibited be not allowed, as charged by the Referee, on the item of merchandise advanced, and that each of those items stand as stipulated in the covenant; that is to say, that the excess of advances on the items of moneys to be advanced be not charged over on the item for merchandise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">3. That the sum stipulated in the covenant to be paid by Vance- &amp; Moseley in the event of failing to forward to plaintiffs five hundred bales of cotton is., to the extent of such failure on their part, adjudged to be in the nature of a penalty to be ascertained and fixed and not as liquidated damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">4.

If the debtor pays the money without directing any application, the money becomes absolutely the property of the creditor, and he may do with it what he will, subject only to the condition that he must apply it to some part of the debtor\u2019s liability. The right of the debtor to apply a payment passes absolutely to the creditor along with the ownership of the money and is not limited as to time; the creditor may make the application at the time of trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-6\">In <em>Schnell vs. Schroder, </em>(Bail. Eq., 342,) the Court say: \u201cA party paying money has at the time he pays it the right to direct how it shall be applied; but if he does not direct the application, then the party receiving it may apply it to such debt of his ' debtor as he may choose. On what account money paid or articles delivered were paid or delivered and received is always a question of fact, and the proper answer to the inquiry is often to be collected from the circumstances attending the transaction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">In the case of <em>Stewart </em>vs. <em>Cochran, </em>(Bail. Eq., 380,) Cochran owed his factors two debts, \u2014 the one amounting to $3,367.77, secured by judgment, the other to $2,000, secured by a mortgage of slaves. In March and May, 1827, the factors sold a part of Cochran\u2019s rice crop for sums amounting in the aggregate to $2,235.40. In June of the same year Cochran executed an assignment for the benefit of all his creditors. In March, 1828, the factors sold the slaves under their mortgage, but the proceeds of the sale were insufficient to pay the mortgage debt, leaving a balance of $455.35. On a bill being filed by Stewart, the assignee, the factors contended that they were entitled to apply the proceeds of the crop of rice sold by them in the first place to the extinguishing of the mortgage debt and the residue to the judgment, and then to come in for the balance due them as judgment creditors. Stewart insisted that the factors were bound to make an application of the fund within a reasonable time, and, not having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>done so previous to the assignment, they could not d\u00f3 it afterwards; and that, at all events, they had made their election by selling the mortgaged slaves under their mortgage, \u2014 inasmuch as the proceeds of the crop would have extinguished the mortgage debt, and, therefore, the enforcing of the mortgage was an abandonment of the right to apply the proceeds of the crop to the payment of that debt: <em>Held, </em>That as Cochran had given no direction as to the application of the proceeds of his crops, his factors had the right to apply them to whichever of their demands they deemed most advantageous to themselves; that their right could not be affected by Cochran\u2019s assignment; that the sale of the mortgaged slaves was neither a forfeiture nor an abandonment by the factors of their right to apply the proceeds of the crops as they thought proper; and that they had a right to retain the funds in their hands until they could ascertain by a sale of the mortgaged property what application would be most beneficial to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-5\">In the case of <em>Heilbron </em>vs. <em>Bissell and Warner, </em>(Bail. Eq., 430,) the debtor owed the creditor a judgment debt and a debt on open account, and made sundry payments without making any appropriation of them at the time he made them, nor did the creditor make any appropriation of them at that time. Upon the hearing, there was no evidence that the creditor had made any appropriation at any time of the payments; but he claimed by his answer the right to appropriate the payments to the running account; and the question before the Court was whether he could thus make the application; whether the creditor can apply payments at any time when the debtor has failed to make the appropriation at the time of payment. After a careful review of the cases, and a particular examination of the case of <em>JDevaynes </em>vs. <em>Noble, </em>(1 Meriv., 570,) the Court, per Harper, Ch., decided that he had such a right, saying: \u201cThe Master of the Rolls, in the opinion I have quoted, comes to no conclusion of his own; but it seems to me that his leaning is in favor of adherence to the rule of the civil law. With the respect due to so great an authority, I have examined the cases referred to and some others on the same subject, and my conclusion is, on the preponderance of authority, that the creditor <em>has </em>that unlimited right to appropriate when the debtor has made no appropriation at the time of payment.\u201d \u2014 p. 433. After commenting further on sundry eases, the Court go on to say: \u201cApart from these cases, and that of <em>Heyward </em>vs. <em>Lomax, (supra,) </em>I have found no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>authority for the Court\u2019s applying payments on a presumed intention of the debtor, nor any <em>dictum </em>recognizing the civil law rule. <em>Heyward </em>vs. <em>Lomax </em>has been often overruled, and the other cases are regarded as exceptions; and I must\u00a1 therefore, conclude in favor of the defendant Joseph Warner\u2019s right to appropriate the payments in question.\u201d \u2014 p. 435. \u201cIt is, therefore, ordered and decreed * * * * that the amount of the several drafts before mentioned be credited to the running account between the defendant, Joseph Warner, and the said William P.

Executions were levied and the land sold in 1799. The other three defendants, Melton, Tigner and Smith, purchased the lands at Sheriff\u2019s sale. It appeared that at a time subsequent to the two judgments Holland made large advances to Cox and took his obligations. Cox made sundry payments, but gave no direction as to their application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\">The complainants claimed that the judgments were satisfied, and that, on principles of equity, the Court should apply the payments made by Cox to the extinguishment of the judgments. Marshall, C. J., delivering the opinion of the Court, says, after disposing of some preliminary questions: \u201cThere is, then, no question on the merits but this: Were the payments properly applied by the Court, or were they applicable to the judgments? The principle that a debtor may control at will the application of his payments is not controverted. Neither is it denied that on his omitting to make the application the power devolves on the creditor. If this power be exercised by neither, it becomes the duty of the Court, and in its performance a sound discretion is to be exercised. It is contended by the plaintiffs that if the payments had been applied by neither the creditor nor the debtor, they ought to be applied in the manner most advantageous to the debtor, because it must be presumed that such was his intention. The correctness of this conclusion cannot be conceded. When a debtor fails to avail himself of the power which he possesses, in consequence of which that power devolves on the creditor, it does not appear unreasonable to suppose that he is content with the manner in which the creditor will exercise it. If neither party avails himself of his power, in consequence of which it devolves on the Court, it would seem that an equitable application should be made. It being equitable that the whole debt should be paid, it cannot be inequitable to extinguish those debts for which the security is most precarious. That course has been pursued in the present case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">\u201cThe application of a payment by a creditor is an act of the mind and a matter of intention ; the entry or declaration of it by word or act is but the manifestation and evidence of it. If, after the payment, up to the moment when the appropriation passes to the law, the creditor has the exclusive right to apply, 'which is agreed by all, the presumption that he did appropriate it accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ingly is a plain conclusion of sense. The relative equities of the parties cannot vary with the different distances of time after the payment, no act to alter their rights or equities having been done by either. If it be just to delegate the application to the creditor during the period which elapses before the appropriation vests in the law, it cannot be just after that to prefer the interest of the debtor. To give the creditor the right to apply at discretion for a certain time is to adopt the principle of consulting his interests. It would be contradictory for a judicial tribunal,, after the payment, first to explore and obey the creditor\u2019s intention as a matter of fact, and then to seek and follow a presumption of the debtor\u2019s intention as a matter of law. The civil law, consistently, required the creditor, in exercising his right of application, to consult the interest of the debtor. The decisions which eliminate that rule from our law seem by inevitable force of common sense to extinguish the other which requires the Court to follow the debtor\u2019s interests. In fact the rules of the civil and common law are distinct and opposed : the former empowers the debtor, in effect, to control the application of his payment indefinitely; the latter vests the appropriation of a general payment in the creditor absolutely. The true principle is believed to be that adopted in <em>Field </em>vs. Holland, that when the determination of the application devolves on the Court it shall be referred to that debt which is the least secured, to a simple contract debt or open account, for example, rather than to a mortgage, judgment, bond, or bond with sureties.\u201d * * * * \u201c But the case where one debt is secured by mortgage or judgment and the other is unsecured is that in which the equity of the creditor is least questionable.\u201d \u2014 1 H. &amp; W.

Judge Cowen, the author of the reports which bear his name, in the case of <em>Spenaer </em>vs. <em>Tilden, </em>(5 Cowen, 150,) in a note to that case, says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">\u201cThis doctrine, which converts damages apparently stipulated or fixed by the parties into a penalty came from the civil law, through the Court of Chancery, and has at length obtained a firm hold in the Courts of common law. It is obvious that, in order to enforce it, Courts must disregard the particular expressions of the parties ; for the moment we agree that a party may, by calling a real penalty liquidated damages, or throwing it in the form of an alternative in a contract, or substituting its payment for some specified default, secure the whole to himself, without regard to the real damages, we bring back the oppressive rule of the common law. The griping creditor will always use the particular form or phraseology of contract which will secure him his pound of flesh, unless the Courts interfere in all cases and tell him that, from the very nature and essence of his bond, whatever he claims, and in whatever shape or upon whatever footing, if it be in truth plainly beyond the legal amount of damages, so far it shall be no more than nominal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">Hence he concludes that the rule laid down by Mr. Holt, in his note to <em>Barton </em>vs. <em>Glover, </em>(Holt\u2019s N. P. Rep., 43,) is the true one, viz.: \u201c Where a sum of money, whether in the name of a penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>or otherwise, is introduced in a covenant or agreement merely to secure the enjoyment of a collateral object, the enjoyment of the object is considered as the principal intent of the deed or contract, and the penalty only as accessory, and, therefore, only to secure the damages really incurred.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">The true and only consideration of the stipulation touching the 500 bales of cotton is the amount of damages which the plaintiffs have sustained by the failure of the defendants to ship the cotton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">The misfortunes of the debtors, who have failed, are not to be regarded as crimes deserving of punishment as in the Court of Sessions. They failed to comply with their contract from causes which were beyond their control. The extent of that failure and its causes are well known, and the damages actually sustained by these plaintiffs are susceptible of easy and exact ascertainment, and to that amount the recovery on the breach of the covenant should be limited.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-7\"><em>McGowan &amp; Parker, </em>same side:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\">1.

The defendants, Vance <em>&amp; </em>Moseley, appear as merchants in the interior of the State, purchasing goods in Charleston for resale, and shipping cotton for sale through that city, taking cash advances on consignments of cotton for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The leading objects of the contract on the part of the plaintiffs appear to be, first, to obtain security, by way of mortgage, for a <em>past </em>debt due by Y. &amp; M. individually and another assumed by Y. &amp; M., but originally due from Yance, Moseley &amp; Co., upon an extension of time for the payment of such debts ; second, to obtain security, by way of mortgage, for future sales of merchandise to V. &amp; M., on time, to a limited amount; third, to procure consignments of cotton from V. &amp; M., to be sold on commission, they making cash advances, secured in part by mortgage. The last named object was secured by stipulations on the part of V. &amp; M. to ship a certain quantity of cotton, the plaintiffs agreeing as to the amount of the commissions to be charged for its sale, and also Y. <em>&amp; </em>M. agreeing, in the event of their failure to ship the required amount of cotton, to pay for such default a stipulated sum per bale as liquidated damages for such failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The objects of the contract on the part of Y. <em>&amp; </em>M. appear to have been to get time on account of their debt and that due on account of V., M. &amp; Co.; second, to get a credit for merchandise to a limited amount; third, to obtain cash advances for a fixed amount and fixed time; and, further, to secure reduced commissions on sale of their cotton consigned to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We have only to consider those features of the contract that provide a mortgage security for goods sold and cash advanced and those that relate to the mode of dealing with consignments of cotton, including the liquidated damages for failure of shipment, there being no question before us as affecting that part of the contract that provides for the payment of past debts. The contract, then, as it stands before us for construction, relates to future mercantile transactions between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Plaintiffs were bound to sell merchandise to a limited amount and upon certain conditions as to length of credit and interest on sales. They were also bound to make cash advances to a certain limited amount, for which they would hold the mortgage security. These secured cash advances would not be sufficient to cover the whole of the cotton agreed to be shipped, but it is to be presumed that both parties anticipated that, as the consignments of cotton went forward, the plaintiffs would make the customary advances on consignments, independently of the limit of the contract, holding, as the plaintiffs would in that case, the mortgage as security to the extent of the contract and the cotton as to any excess. The natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>results of this course of dealing would be that the plaintiffs would not be at liberty to retain the proceeds of cotton sold for the account of V. &amp; M. to any greater extent than would be necessary to keep the indebtedness of V. &amp; M. within the limit agreed for cash advanced; the balance in their hands derived from consigned cotton, less commissions and expenses, the defendants, V. &amp; M., would be entitled to receive in the ordinary course of business. In other words, the plaintiffs\u2019 situation, as it regards the proceeds of cotton sold for the account of V. &amp; M., would differ from that of ordinary consignments or commissions only in the respect that they would not be able to retain such proceeds to the full amount of current advances on the cotton, but only to the extent necessary to keep their cash advances within the limit of the contract. Thus plaintiffs would hold the mortgage as agreed security for advances up to the limit agreed upon and until that limit should be passed; as they realized proceeds of the sale of consigned cotton they would be required to hold such proceeds, less commissions and expenses, subject to the draft of the defendants, V. <em>&amp; </em>M. This is the conclusion that would arise from considering the general objects of the contract; and the question arises whether it consists with the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Before looking to the specific terms of contract, it will be convenient to refer to the views of the defendants as to its true construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">They say, in the first place, that the plaintiffs agreed to advance cash to a prescribed amount, and to sell merchandise to a fixed amount; that, in point of fact, they advanced more money and sold less goods than the contract called for, and that the mortgage only stands for the security for cash advanced to the fixed amount, the excess of cash advances being unsecured, and that the plaintiffs cannot gain an advantage in this respect from the fact that the amount of goods sold was less than the contract called for, and that the difference should not be added to the amount of cash agreed to be advanced, giving security beyond the limited amount. The next point made by the defendants is that all moneys of the defendants, V. <em>&amp; </em>M., that came into plaintiffs\u2019 hands should have at once been credited as against the cash advances called for by the contract, so as to extinguish such cash advances and discharge the mortgage as it regarded them, \u2014 the result of which view would be that V. &amp; M., instead of having a standing credit for a year, in addition to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>arising from tbe value of the merchandise consigned, thus securing them valuable facilities for the transaction of their business, would be in the position to have that cash credit wiped out by the first receipts on sales of cotton, and after that would have no means of credit beyond the value of the cotton consigned. It is hardly to be supposed that Y. <em>&amp; </em>M. would have advanced this proposition while the contract giving them a cash credit was outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The next point of objection is that the provisions stipulating as to liquidated damages import a penalty merely, and that recovery can only be measured by damage proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We will examine these propositions in the order stated. It is clear that the covenant of V. &amp; M. covered by the mortgage security looks solely to the aggregate of cash advanced and merchandise sold, as it regards the amount agreed to be paid, and not to the relative amount of cash. Plaintiffs covenanted \u201c to advance to said Vance &amp; Moseley, on their demand, the sum of $1,446.47 in cash, and to sell and deliver to them, upon their orders, groceries at the customary prices and terms, to the amount of $1,500.\u201d Y. &amp; M., on their part, agreed to pay plaintiffs the \u201csum of $2,946.57, the aggregate of the sums of cash to be advanced and groceries, to be sold and delivered to them\u201d by the plaintiffs. The covenant of Y. &amp; M., standing by itself, imports an obligation based on such advances of cash and sales of merchandise as should thereafter be made, not to exceed the prescribed amount. It would seem thus to support the conclusion that if V. &amp; M. saw fit to diminish the quantity of goods purchased and to increase the amount of cash borrowed, they would be liable for the aggregate sum, provided it did not exceed the prescribed amount. This covenant must be read with those of the plaintiffs most nearly related as consideration <em>to </em>it and the proper sense derived from both taken together. Plaintiffs\u2019 agreement imposed a limit to cash transaction separately. The benefit of this limit was intended for the plaintiffs. The defendants, V. &amp; M., wanted credit, and accordingly that construction of their covenant which afforded the largest and the most flexible credit would be the object they would naturally pursue. It was evidently most favorable for Y. &amp; M. that in case they did not need groceries to the amount stipulated their cash credit might receive a corresponding benefit. It may be assumed that the interest of the plaintiffs was to sell goods and not to lend money. The event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>showed that V. &amp; M. were more concerned to borrow money than buy goods. There was nothing in the contract to prevent the plaintiffs at any time from waiving the limit of cash advanced in favor of a request from V. &amp; M., and such a concession to V. &amp; M. could not with propriety operate to defeat their covenant when clearly covered by its language.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">There is no ground to narrow the terms of the covenant of V. <em>&amp; </em>M., as it stands expressed, by any inference drawn from the terms of the covenant on the part of plaintiffs, and it must be enforced as it stands. The result of this conclusion is that the amount of cash advanced and groceries sold, not exceeding the sum of $2,946.57, with interest added, as prescribed by the contract, is properly chargeable as secured by the mortgage. The judgment below is, therefore, erroneous in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The next proposition relates to the mode in which cash advances and net proceeds on the sales of consigned cotton should be charged. The covenant of V. <em>&amp; </em>M. was to pay the sums of cash advanced and groceries sold on the first day of April, 1877. It follows that payment of such amounts could not be demanded until that time, and it follows, also, that sums of money coming into the hands of the plaintiffs for the account of V. &amp; M. over and above any amount in which V. &amp; M. might be indebted on other account than that to which the contract related are to be considered as held subject to the draft of V. &amp; M., the plaintiffs having no right to make any other appropriation of them whatever. It is not to be assumed that the parties intended that the whole yearly transactions of V. &amp; M. with plaintiffs as it regards cotton should be tied up in the hands of the plaintiffs as security for debts due, groceries sold and cash advanced when otherwise fully secured. On the contrary, the very object of the mortgage must have been to render V. &amp; M. free to transact their business in the most favorable method during the life of the credit given by the contract. Such is the clear reason and sense of the contract, and, while the transaction was current between the parties, they seem to have acted upon it. Now that V. &amp; M. have reaped the benefit of the contract, they cannot properly deny such construction, patent on the face of the contract and carried out in the practical operation under it. It follows that the report of the Referee and the decree upon it are erroneous in charging the sums of cash advanced and amounts realized from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>consigned cotton against the amount secured by way of mortgage. On the contrary, the account should be made up by striking a balance between current debits and credits for cash and groceries and charging such balance, if it does not exceed the amount stipulated by the contract, namely, $2,946.57, with accumulations of interest, computed according to the contract, and that sum, added to the aggregate debts of V. &amp; M. and V., M. &amp; Co., with interest according to the contract, must be decreed as due under the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The next question arises on the language of the contract immediately following the agreement to consign 500 bales of cotton, which is as follows: \u201cAnd to pay as liquidated damages two dollars for each and every bale of cotton less than 500 bales which they might fail to consign and ship to them as stipulated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The right of parties to a contract to fix the amount of damages, in their nature unliquidated, by an agreed sum or rate of damages is fully recognized by all the authorities. This does not apply to cases where the damage is fixed by law, as in case of damages in failure to* pay money stipulated, because in these cases the damage is not in its nature unliquidated, but the rule of damages is fixed with regard to considerations of public policy. It will not be necessary to consider the various exceptions depending on the same general principle above stated, as they do not affect the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In cases where the parties are at liberty to fix the measure of damages by an agreed sura or rate, the question is one of intent merely. When the parties declare that the sum or rate fixed shall be deemed liquidated damages, and the case is one in which they are at liberty so to declare, such declaration must stand unless inconsistent with other parts of the same instrument or unreasonable in itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In inquiring whether it is reasonable it is not necessary to ask whether it is wise or considerate, but whether it is in conflict with the principles and practices that govern transactions of a like nature. This certainly cannot be affirmed of the present stipulation. It does not fix a round sum incapable of adapting itself to the degree of failure to perform, but a rate by which a greater or less failure might be measured. We cannot say from anything before us that that rate is either more or less than the actual damage that could be proved. We have a measure of damage in part in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>agreed rate of commissions, but we cannot say from the record that there was no other measurable element of value to the plaintiffs in the consignments of cotton than the commissions to be earned. General experience, if we could resort to it, would lead to an opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">It was perfectly reasonable, in providing for further mercantile transactions that might be interrupted by unforeseen circumstances, that the parties should fix a rule of liability by means of which, in case of failure to perform, their accounts might be adjusted without the necessity of a law suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">When the contract, according to its intention, is one of liquidated damages, it becomes necessary, before applying such rule of damage, to inquire whether the breach and the damage in any particular case is of the kind in the contemplation of the parties in fixing the measure of liability. While many cases have arisen where the resulting damage has been found so essentially different from that contemplated by the parties as to defeat the apparent intent of the contract in that respect, <em>[Higginson </em>vs. <em>Meld, </em>14 Gray, 156,] the present case is free from any such aspect. The case that has arisen is obviously the very case contemplated by the parties in fixing the measure of liability imposed. We find nothing to prevent the express declaration of the parties in this respect from having its full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The plaintiffs are entitled to the sum stipulated in respect of each bale which the defendants V. &amp; M. failed to ship in accordance with their contract in addition to the sum already referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The decree and the report of the Referee must be set aside so far as they conflict with the foregoing determinations and the cause remanded for further proceedings conformable herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-9\"><em>Malver, </em>A.
