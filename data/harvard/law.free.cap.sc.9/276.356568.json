Lebeschultz against Thomas P. Magrath to recover the amount of a sealed note given by defendant to the plaintiff. - The defendant, by his answer, alleged that he was a resident of Charleston County, but he made no demand in writing before the time for answering expired, as directed by Section 149 of the Code, that the place of trial be changed from Edgefield County to Charleston. The jury, under the instructions of the Circuit Judge, found for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed on the grounds that the Circuit Court for Edgefield had no jurisdiction in the action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-10\"><em>Abney, </em>with whom was <em>Youmans, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-11\"><em>Bonham &amp; Sheppard, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b284-12\">March 8, 1878.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AnO\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b284-13\">Haskell, A.

It is an entire mistake to make this a question of jurisdiction. Section 149 specifically sustains the jurisdiction in this case \u2014 \u201cunless the defendant, before the time for answering expire, demand in writing that the trial be had \u201d in the County in which he claimed to reside. On the contrary, it is a question of practice, and when the defendant waived the remedy which Section 149 provides he waived any objection to the place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">The motion for a new trial is refused.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-15\"><em>Willard, </em>C.
