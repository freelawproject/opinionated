Smith'was the County Treasurer of Newberry County and had in his hands a sufficient amount of the funds mentioned in the Act of March 3d, 1874, to pay said certificates, but declined paying them, though required so to do, on the ground that he was prohibited from paying them by the Act of 17th March, 1874, and by the provisions of Article IN, Sections 2 and 3, and Article N, Section 5, of the State Constitution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-12\"><em>Jones &amp; Mower, </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-13\"><em>S\u00faber &amp; Caldwell, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>September 22, 1877.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Ae\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b53-5\">Willard, C.

C., 123-127,) and <em>Coleman </em>vs. <em>Smith, </em>(8 S. C., 128-129). It appears that the relator in the present case holds claims entitled to be paid by the respondent as County Treasurer of Newberry County under the Act of March 3, 1874, and that there are funds sufficient in the hands of the respondent as Treasurer, applicable by law to the payment of such claims, for their payment. A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should therefore issue commanding payment thereof as prayed by the relator.</p>\n<judges id=\"b53-6\"><em>McIver, </em>A.
