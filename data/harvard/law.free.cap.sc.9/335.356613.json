McKellar, and brought this action to recover possession of them against Peter McKellar, the uncle of William P. McKellar, who claimed the lands under a deed from the judgment debtor, William P.

His deed to Peter expressed the consideration of one thousand dollars, but Peter McKellar swore that the consideration was not money but a payment on a debt of eighteen hundred dollars which William P. owed him. When William P. made the deed to Peter there was in the office against him a judgment of L. D. Merriman for $219, which had been entered up January 26, 1874, and execution issued same date returnable by its terms \u201cin sixty days after its receipt.\u201d The only return of this execution was to May Term of the Court, 1875. No summons to make it a lien was served on William P. McKellar by judgment creditor L. D. Merriman, as he claimed that the judgment was rendered after the amendment to the Code and had a lien. When William P. McKellar left the State, Francis Arnold had a suit pending against him, which went into judgment 18th October, 1875, for $227.05.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\">The attorney of Francis Arnold gave to the Sheriff written instructions to levy and sell the lands in dispute as the property of William P. McKellar. The Sheriff levied on the land on the 8th of November, 1875, endorsing a levy as of same date on both the execution of L. D. Merriman and Francis Arnold, and advertised the lands for sale \u201c at the suit of Francis Arnold,\u201d and sold them sale day in December, 1875. At the sale the attorney of Peter McKellar forbid the sale, and the Sheriff, by direction of both the attorney of Merriman and Arnold, announced that the lands were sold under the judgment of \u201c Arnold and others for the benefit of creditors,\u201d giving an opinion that the purchaser would take good title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">Francis Arnold became the purchaser for fifty dollars and received Sheriff\u2019s titles conveying the lands \u201c at the suit of Francis Arnold and others.\u201d Peter McKellar refused to deliver possession to the purchaser, who brought this action. He claimed a recovery on two grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\"><em>First </em>That the Sheriff\u2019s deed conveyed good title as against Peter McKellar, even if the conveyance to him (August 27) was <em>bona fide, </em>because the Sheriff sold under both judgments, and that of Merriman was older than said conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\"><em>Second. </em>But, if that was not so, the deed of William P. McKellar to his uncle Peter was voluntary, pretensive and fraudulent, to enable William P. to leave the State and defraud his creditors, and therefore void as against creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Without going to the jury upon the second ground, His Honor the presiding Judge charged the jury, as matter of law, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover upon the first ground. He held that the judgment of Merriman had a lien from its entry; that the objection to the execution, which by its terms was returnable \u201c within sixty days after its receipt,\u201d was technical and did not affect the judgment; that the Sheriff\u2019s sale was referable to both judgments, and the purchaser\u2019s title good as against Peter McKeller, and directed the jury to find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">The defendant moved for a new trial on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">I. That the judgment of the plaintiff, Francis Arnold, against William P. McKellar, being subsequent to the conveyance of the land by William P. McKellar to the defendant, Peter McKellar, gave to the plaintiff, Francis Arnold, no lien on the said land as against the defendant, Peter McKellar, and the sale thereof under said judgment was null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">II.

That if publication had been made of the levy and sale under the execution of L. D.

That the Act of 25th of November, 1873, amending the Code of Procedure, is null and void, and, therefore, the judgment of L. D. Merriman created no lien on the land at the date of the conveyance to the defendant, Peter McKellar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\">V. That, under the Act of 1875, the judgment of L. D. Merriman did not create a lien on said land, because there was no \u201csummons served on the judgment debtor, William P. McKellar, as provided by said Act, and the conveyance to the defendant, Peter McKellar, was, therefore, good as against said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-11\">The Circuit Judge refused a new trial, and the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Lee &amp; Blake, </em>for appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">The appellant claims title under a <em>bona fide </em>deed from W.

But if he had not done so \u2014 if that execution were irregular or under \u201c wait orders \u201d \u2014 yet the execution of Arnold was enough to make the levy and sale for all, and, the sale being made, Merriman\u2019s judgment is \u201c entitled to the proceeds of sale and not to a right to resell the <em>laud.\u201d </em>\u2014 Gist vs. <em>MeJun-Icin, </em>1 McM., 342; <em>The State </em>vs. <em>Laval, </em>4 McC., 336.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">2.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIe\">The principal question in this case is the validity of \u201cAn Act to alter and amend the Code of Procedure, being Title V, Part III, of the General Statutes,\u201d approved November 25, 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The Bill was ratified 26th February, 1873, but it could not become a law until it had been presented to the Governor. \u2014 Section 22, Article III, of the Constitution. If he approve it in the time, or if it be passed over his veto in the manner therein prescribed, it becomes a law. But, says this Section: \u201cIf a Bill or Joint Resolution shall not be returned by the Governor within three days after it shall have been presented to him, Sundays excepted, it shall have the same force and effect as if he had signed it, unless the General Assembly, by their adjournment, prevent its return, in which case it shall not have such force and effect unless returned within two days after their next meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The General Assembly adjourned the next day, 27th February, 1873, and the Bill had not been returned by the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Under Section 16, Article III, of the Constitution, the Governor did \u201c in extraordinary occasion convene the General Assembly to meet on 21st October, 1873.\u201d That body assembled and continued to sit until 24th November, 1873, on which day it adjourned <em>sine die, </em>and the Governor had not returned the Bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">On the 25th November, 1873, \u201c the session of the General Assembly,\u201d in obedience to Section 12 of Article II of the Constitution, was convened at the seat of government at the annual period desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>nated in the Constitution, and on that day the Bill was returned by the Governor approved. Such are the facts as submitted. If the regular annual meeting be that which is intended by the words \u201c next meeting \u201d in Section 22, Article III, of the Constitution, then the Bill became law and is of force. If, on the other hand, the special or extra session called by the Governor, beginning in October, 1873, be the \u201c next meeting,\u201d according to the meaning and intent of the Constitution, then the Bill was not duly returned within the two days prescribed, failed to become a law, and acquired no force from the subsequent approval and return.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Court is of opinion that the next regular annual session is the \u201c next meeting,\u201d in the sense in which those words are used in Section 22, Article III, of the Constitution, and will endeavor briefly to state its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Article II of the Constitution frames the legislative department of the government and prescribes the steps to be taken for the enactment of laws. Article III relates to the executive department. Section 22 of Article III confers and regulates the qualified negative power of the Governor and makes it a portion of the legislating branch of the government. In the exercise of this function the Governor acts purely in a legislative capacity, and, therefore, Section 22 of Article III belongs properly to Article II, which is devoted to the legislative department, and should be considered and construed as if it bad occurred therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">This view is strengthened by the fact that the analogous or veto Section in the Constitution of the United States is made part of the legislative department, Article I, and does not occupy a place in Article II, which declares and defines the executive powers. This Section will, for this reason, be regarded, for purposes of construction, as if it were Section 22 of Article II, instead of Article III, and, as may be observed, it naturally follows Section 21 of Article II. The consequence is that the words \u201c next meeting \u201d mean the same as they would have signified had they occurred in Article II and preceding any provision for extra session. The time at which the session of the General Assembly is to be held is a period fixed by the Constitution and is the annual commencement of a political period in the life of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u201cThe meeting of the General Assembly\u201d is the generic term which distinguishes this recurring event in the existence of the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>eminent, and, when used, is construed to mean the regular assemblage of that body as fixed by the Constitution, unless the contrary is plainly indicated by the context. It does not appear to be so in the present instance. The extra session of the Legislature is meant to occur only on \u201cextraordinary occasions,\u201d and, obviously, the attention of that body, and of the Governor who convened it, should be devoted to the unexpected causes which had necessitated such, a measure. The extra session is, by its nature, a rare contingency, is unforeseen, has no connection with the ordinary course of legislation, and its interference therewith is in conflict with that scheme of the Constitution which provides that the interval between the annual sessions shall elapse before the enactment of new or the repeal of old laws. And so important is this consideration that in several of the States the sessions have been made biennial for the better prevention of hasty legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The validity of the Act of 1873-74 (15 Stat., 495,) being sustained, the Merriman judgment had a lien upon the land of McKellar at the time it was sold. An execution issued upon that judgment was in the hands of the Sheriff at the time he levied and sold by virtue of the Arnold or junior execution, and the levy was entered upon both at the same date. The failure on the part of the Sheriff to make the returns as provided by law, if so, might subject him to rule, (15 Gen. Stat., \u00a7 16, p. 500,) but could not affect the active energy of the execution, which had r.un but a short portion of the period of five years from the time of its lodgment.\u2014 <em>Ibid, </em>p. 499, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Sheriff could unquestionably have made the sale under Merriman\u2019s execution. This meets the very points made in the dissenting opinion of Evans, J., and concurred in by Wardlaw, J., in the case of <em>Vance &amp; Davis </em>vs. <em>Red &amp; Young, </em>(2 Speer, 90,) for in that case the dissenting Judges stood upon the point that the Sheriff did not have in his office a senior execution which empowered him to sell. But in the opinion the Court settled the whole question, saying: \u201cIt is of no consequence under what named execution or judgment the Sheriff sells a defendant\u2019s property, the sale is in virtue of all existing liens of the kind, and every execution gives the practical authority to sell until all are satisfied, and the liens are satisfied successively in the order of priority of time; and thus each execution amounts to a <em>venditione exponas </em>for all the preceding <em>judgments.\u201d </em>\u2014 Ibid, p. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The Court sees no error in the charge of the Judge in the Court below, nor any reason why a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The motion is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-6\"><em>Willard, </em>C.
