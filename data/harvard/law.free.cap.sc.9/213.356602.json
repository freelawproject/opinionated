That on May 31st, 1854, a notice signed R. W. Ratchford, for Margaret A. Ratchford ,(now the plaintiff Mrs. Latimer) and William Haeket Snider, per J. J. Snider, parents of the plaintiffs, was served, through the Sheriff of York District, on Colonel Robert G. McCaw, the trustee under the will of William Haeket, Sr., notifying him that trespasses were being committed on and damage done to the Chambers tract of land by persons having no title thereto, and that in behalf of said children they would hold him responsible therefor whenever their titles became vested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-10\">Having thus recited the admitted facts in the premises, I now proceed to determine the issues of law involved in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-11\">The testator, William ' Haeket, Sr., by the second clause of his will, devises certain real estate, including property sued for in this action, to Robert G. McCaw, as trustee, which said devise is in the following terms, to wit: \u201c In trust and upon condition for the said Robert G. McCaw to have and to hold the said tracts of land and house and lot for the use and benefit of my brother, Hugh Haeket, if alive at my death, now residing in the North of Ireland, at Drumahagles, near Balleymaney, County of. Antrim, the legal title to remain and be vested in the said Robert G. McCaw until such time as the said Hugh Haeket, now an alien, shall become duly qualified, according to Acts of Congress of the United States of America, to take and hold the said real estate. When the said Hugh Haeket becomes so qualified the said Robert G. McCaw is hereby directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>to execute to the said Hugh Haeket a valid conveyance in fee to said tracts of lands and house and lot, the rents and profits of said Turkey Creek tract and house and lot in Yorkville to go to the said Hugh Haeket from the time of my decease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">As Hugh Haeket was alive at the date of the testator\u2019s death I deem it (to use the language of the Court in <em>MeCa/w </em>vs. <em>Galbraith, </em>7 Rich., 80,) \u201cunnecessary to notice the provisions made by the will of William Haeket in favor of the sons of Hugh upon the contingency of his death in th\u00e9 lifetime of the testator.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">The intention of the testator must be gathered from the plain language of the will, and must be the <em>legal intention, </em>to be ascertained by settled rules of construction. \u2014 See <em>Parker </em>vs. <em>Marehant, 1 </em>Phil. Ch., 360; 6 Cruise\u2019s Dig., 148, 3d edition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">A will of real estate, wherever it be made, must be construed according to the laws of the country where the property upon which it is intended-to operate is situated, and the testator is presumed to have executed his will in contemplation of the force and effect of such <em>laws. </em>\u2014 Bovey vs. <em>Smith, </em>1 Vern., 147.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">The testator in this case expressly provides that Hugh Haeket \u201c shall become duly qualified, according to Acts of Congress of the United States of America, to take and hold said real estate,\u201d and when he \u201cbecomes so qualified\u201d the trustee is directed to execute a valid conveyance in fee to him. The beneficial interest is given absolutely to Hugh Haeket, during his life, and that interest was capable of being expanded into a fee simple upon his becoming \u201c duly qualified to take and hold said real estate.\u201d The due qualification, clearly contemplated by the testator, was the becoming a citizen of the United States, by naturalization, pursuant to Acts of Congress. Hugh Haeket himself asserted this interpretation of the will, and acted upon it to the extent of filing his declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States, \u2014 -an intention, however, which he never executed. Hugh Haeket having died without having \u201cbecome duly qualified to take and hold said real estate,\u201d it reverted, and, not being disposed of by the will, is in the heirs of the testator, and this reversion, undevised, descended to the next of kin capable of taking. This intestacy of William Haeket, Sr., is caused by the failure of Hugh Haeket to comply with the express requirement of the will, a contingency which the testator does not appear to have contemplated, or, if regarded as possible, he has left to be provided for under the laws of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>It would appear that Hugh Hacket, in the first instance, actually declined complying with the condition precedent annexed to the devise in question, for on the 25th of February, 1851, within four months after the decease of the testator\u2019, he released by deed all his interest in the estate in favor of his son William Hacket. Hugh Hacket subsequently came to this country on November 6th, 1854, but returned to Ireland in 1855 and there remained without again visiting the United States, and died in Ireland on the 25th day of March, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">No stronger evidence than this could possibly be adduced to show the deliberate purpose to abandon his previously declared \u201c intention \u201d to become a citizen of the United States. His becoming a denizen of this State in December, 1854, was not a compliance with the condition of the devise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">In the United States there is no such condition as denizenship.\u2014 1 Bouvier L. Die., 404 ; Walker\u2019s American Law, 138.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">It is solely the creation of State law, and the rights and privileges of denizens as to property are determined entirely by the <em>lex rei sitae, </em>and it only confers the specific rights mentioned in the statutes creating it. The Act of the Legislature of South Carolina of 1799, under which Hugh Hacket filed his oath of denizenship, (Statutes at Large, Vol. V, p. 355J only gives the right \u201c to purchase and hold real property.\u201d The terms of the devise required that he \u201c shall become duly qualified, according to the Acts of Congress of -the United States of America, to take and hold said real estate\u201d before the trustee could convey the estate to him. \u2014 2 Nott &amp; McCord, 352-355.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">The \u201cNaturalization Acts of Congress\u201d required five years\u2019 residence immediately preceding the time of admission to citizenship. Three years after the declaration of intention to become a citizen the applicant is required to take the oath of allegiance and abjuration. In the language of the Supreme Court of the United States, \u201cthe oath of allegiance and abjuration is the <em>sine qua non </em>of admission to citizenship.\u201d \u2014 2 U. S. Stat., 811; Act March 3,1813.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">It is contended, however, that Hugh Hacket actually became qualified to take, in accordance with the <em>intention </em>of the testator. But how are we to ascertain the intention of the testator better than by taking his very words that he designed to express that intention, and which are free from any obscurity or ambiguity ? Are we to resort to inference as to the meaning when there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>doubt as to the plain import of the words of the will ? The testator did not say that Hugh Haeket <em>\u201c </em>shall become qualified according to the laws of South Carolina,\u201d or \u201c qualified according to law,\u201d or simply \u201c qualified,\u201d but he prescribes the mode in which he shall become qualified, namely, by his becoming a citizen of the United States, that is, \u201c qualified according to Acts of Congress.\u201d It seems to be perfectly clear from the will that this mode and degree of qualification formed a part of testator\u2019s mind and purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">Did testator simply intend that Hugh Haeket should have the benefit of so much in value of his estate ? If so, why did . he not devise the land to Colonel McCaw to sell and give the proceeds to Hugh Haeket? This he could have done.\u2014 <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Leslie, </em>3 Wheat., 563.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">The testator imposed a condition upon this devise, and the Court has no right to aid the proposed devisee in his manifest effort to evade that condition. A perusal of the will shows that the testator, in designating Hugh Haeket as the principal beneficiary of his bounty, entertained the two-fold purpose of having his brother, the said Hugh, become a <em>resident </em>of York County, and that he should without delay remove his alienage by becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States, to the end that he might be vested with the real estate in fee. The former purpose is made manifest by his constituting the said Hugh Haeket the trustee of a considerable fund, with a special charge that he should invest the same for the use and benefit of certain slaves, the objects of testator\u2019s peculiar solicitude. Hugh Haeket was virtually constituted by the testator, as to <em>those </em>slaves, both their trustee and <em>guardian.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">Words cannot mirror human thought more clearly than this purpose is reflected in the fourth clause of testator\u2019s will, for the trust and guardianship which that clause imposes could only be effectually executed by Hugh Hacket\u2019s actual residence in York County and through his personal care and supervision. This is made evident by a mere recital of the fourth clause of the will, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq6u\"><em>\u201cFourth. </em>I will, bequeath and devise unto my said brother, Hugh Haeket, if alive at my death, my negroes, Alcey, Mary and her daughter Louisa and Dick, in <em>special charge and confidence </em>that as soon as may be practicable after my decease he do erect a comfortable house for them to live in upon the Chambers tract of land, devised in the second clause of this my will, and that the said Hugh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>permit Alcey, Mary and her daughter Louisa and.

If testator had not himself prescribed the mode of qualification, there could be no doubt but that Hugh Hacket, becoming thus qualified and then abandoning the State, would have been a fraud upon testator\u2019s bounty and clearly the defeat of his intention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">If Hugh Hacket had become naturalized according to Acts of Congress and then abandoned the country, deserting his charge of the slaves mentioned, and thus violating the \u201cspecial confidence\u201d reposed in him by testator, this would have been a fraud upon testator\u2019s bounty; but still Hugh would have been entitled to the land, for the will so says, and while the <em>intention </em>of testator as to residence is plain he has not expressed that intention in a legal way, and Courts ought not to construct codicils to wills. If necessary to decide the point, I would hold that the denizenship of Hugh Hacket did not qualify him to take by <em>devise. </em>Denizenship only gives the specific rights enumerated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">In England denizens can take by purchase and devise, but not by <em>inheritance. </em>Our Act of 1799 gives the right \u201cto purchase and hold.\u201d This right was intended to be conferred only on persons residing or intending to reside within the limits of this State. The Act, by its terms, (see Section 1, Act 1799,) grants the rights and privileges of denizenship only to those <em>\u201cwho now are, or hereafter shall become, residents in this State.\u201d </em>Hugh Hacket was never a resident in South Carolina. All of his acts stamped him as a mere transient person in the State, who had no intention of taking up his permanent abode within its limits. But, even granting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>legal denizenship, the Act of 1799 cannot avail to accomplish the end for which it is invoked by those who claim through him the real estate in question. The word \u201c purchase,\u201d as used in the Act, clearly means to <em>buy </em>for a consideration, and does not refer to one who takes by devise \u201cas purchaser,\u201d as distinguished from one who takes by \u201climitation.\u201d In construing the denizen Act it may well be held that there is a difference between the active power to \u201c purchase \u201d and the passive power of taking \u201c by purchase \u201d or \u201c as purchaser\u201d under a will. The statute was manifestly intended to encourage aliens to \u201c become residents in this State \u201d and to bring their <em>capital here </em>and invest it by the \u201c purchase\u201d of \u201c real property.\u201d If Hugh Hacket could take as devisee, by his mere taking and subscribing the oath of allegiance to this State, then his immediate resumption of his allegiance to the British Crown and his instant and final abandonment of his pretended residence in this State would operate as a successful fraud, both on the intention of the framers of the Act of 1799 and upon the will of William Hacket, Sr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">Hugh Hacket never having had any legal estate in the real property now in suit, it follows that those who claim under him have no legal right thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">The defendants cannot derive title through William K. Hacket, for he was an alien at the date of testator\u2019s decease, and his subsequent naturalization, in 1855, several years after testator\u2019s death, could not have a retroactive effect. In 1 Sp., 533, (case of <em>Wight-man </em>vs. LaBorde,) the Court says: \u201c The effect of naturalization is to invest the alien with all the rights of native-born citizens, but it has no such retroactive operation as to make an alien capable of taking as heir of one who died before his naturalization. He who takes as heir must take at the instant.

The Court there held that the descent was cast upon the plaintiffs, the only relatives who were citizens <em>at the death of the intestate. </em>In the case of <em>Keenan </em>vs. <em>Keenan </em>(7 Rich., 345,) the defendant was the widow of the intestate and an alien when he died, in 1847.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Ia November, 1847, after intestate\u2019s death, she announced her intention of becoming a citizen, and was naturalized in November, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">The Court held that she could not take; that naturalization is not retrospective, and that \u201can alien becoming a citizen in'the most regular manner does not acquire a right to inherit or to take and hold land which belonged to his ancestor who died before he became a citizen, so as to divest the right of a remoter heir who was a citizen at the time of the death of the ancestor.\u201d The native or naturalized children of aliens, if native or naturalized at the time of descent east, take, notwithstanding the alienage of parents, for they take by our statutes and not at common <em>law. </em>\u2014 North <em>et al. </em>vs. <em>Valh, </em>Dud.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A55\">This was an action to recover possession of certain real estate in the County of York. Both parties claim under William Hacket, Sr., as a common source of title \u2014 the plaintiffs as his next of kin and heirs-at-law, and the defendants as the alienees of his devisee. The plaintiffs contend that though William Hacket, Sr., did leave a will duly executed, yet as to the real estate in controversy he died intestate, and that they, as his only next of kin capable of inheriting, are entitled to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The defendants deny both of these propositions, and contend that the land was well devised by the will, and has come to them from the devisee; but, <em>failing </em>in establishing this proposition, they insist that, even if William Hacket, Sr., did die intestate as to this land, the plaintiffs are not entitled to claim it as next of kin and heirs-at-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The facts upon which these questions are to be determined are all conceded and are fully stated in the decision of the Circuit Judge. It is contended on the part of the plaintiffs that inasmuch as Hugh Hacket, the devisee named in the second clause of the will, who was an alien, died before he became qualified, \u201c according to Acts of Congress of the United States of America, to take and to hold said real estate,\u201d the devise to him failed, because it was only upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>becoming so qualified \u201cto take and to hold said real estate that the devise could become absolute, and that, therefore, as to such real estate, William Haeket, Sr., died intestate. It becomes necessary, therefore, to determine what is the proper construction of the will. In doing this our first effort should be, if possible, to ascertain what was the real intention of the testator, and this must be done, not by resorting to conjecture as to what was likely to be such intention, but by an attentive and careful consideration of the words of the will in each and every part of it, guided by such rules of law as experience has shown to be useful in seeking such intention. We are to read the will <em>as a whole, </em>and <em>from its terms </em>ascertain, if practicable, what was in the mind of the testator at the time he executed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Looking, then, to the terms of this will in this spirit, we cannot fail to see that the testator had in his mind certain prominent intentions :</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">1st. An intention to dispose of his <em>whole </em>estate; for besides the legal presumption arising from the mere making of the will, we find him saying in the preamble that he is \u201c desirous of disposing of my worldly estate,\u201d by which phrase persons are universally understood to express an intention of disposing of all their property or \u201c worldly goods.\u201d We next find him, after making various specific dispositions of portions of his property, providing in the fourteenth clause \u2014 which must be regarded, as the late Court of Appeals, in <em>Mallet </em>vs. <em>Smith, </em>(6 Rich. Eq., 12,) did regard it, as the residuary clause of tbe will \u2014 not only for the disposition \u201c of anything not included in the above and not hereinbefore disposed of,\u201d but also for the disposition of \u201c any legacies that may fall back.\u201d These last quoted words conclusively show that the intention of the testator was to provide in this, the residuary clause of the will, not only for the disposition of such property as he may have overlooked in the previous clauses of his will, but also for the disposition of such as might from <em>any </em>cause, whether from lapsed or void legacies or devises or otherwise, fall back into his estate. Nothing can be clearer than that the testator intended that in no contingency should he be regarded as intestate as to any portion of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">2d. The next prominent intention which appears from the terms of the will is an intention to make his brother Hugh the principal, object of his bounty, and after him, in succession, the two sons of Hugh \u2014 William and James. This is so manifest that it is alto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>gether unnecessary to consume time or space in pointing out the various provisions of the will indicating such intention. It furthermore appears, from a general review of all the terms of the will&gt; that it was not drawn with technical accuracy. This is manifest from the indiscriminate use of the terms \u201c bequeath \u201d and \u201cdevise\u201d\u2014 the former being sometimes applied to real estate and the latter to personal estate; from the insertion of the sixteenth clause of the will, which, as said by Dunkin, Ch., in <em>Mallet </em>vs. <em>Smith, </em>(6 Rich. Eq., 16,) an expert would have known was not necessary; and from the fact that the draughtsman of the will seemed to suppose that an alien could neither <em>take </em>nor hold real estate under a will, and that the right so to <em>take </em>and hold real estate could be derived solely under an Act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Finally, it appears that the testator did,-by the second clause of his will, devise the land in question to R. G. McCaw, in trust for the use and benefit of Hugh Hacket, in which clause he uses the following words: \u201cThe legal title to remain and be vested in the said Robert G. McCaw until such time as the said Hugh Hacket, now an alien, shall become duly qualified, according to Acts of Congress of the United States of America, to take and to hold said real estate. When the said.Hugh Hacket becomes so qualified, the said Robert G. McCaw is hereby directed to execute to the said Hugh Hacket a valid conveyance, in fee, to said tracts of land and house and lots, the rents and profits of said Turkey Creek tract and house and lot in Yorkville to go to the said Hugh Hackett from the time of my decease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The question then to be considered is, what is the true construction of the words of the will above quoted ? Are they to be construed literally, so as to require, as a condition precedent to the vesting of any estate in Hugh, that he should become a naturalized citizen of the United States, or are they to be construed as meaning simply this: that the testator desired to give this property to Hugh, but was only prevented from so doing in absolute terms, vesting a then present estate, by the fact that the alienage of Hugh prevented Him from holding real estate, and that so soon as such obstacle was removed he was then to be invested with the full benefit of the bounty clearly intended for him ?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Considering this question in the light of the prominent intentions hereinbefore alluded to, which, upon reading the will as a whole, stand out in bold relief) we are irresistibly led to the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>that the testator only postponed the vesting of Hugh\u2019s estate because of the disability arising from his alienage, and that when such disability should be removed, <em>in any way, </em>the intention of the testator was to vest the absolute estate in his brother Hugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We cannot suppose that this proposed bounty was intended as an inducement to his brother to abandon his native land and become a citizen of this country. Such a view is contradicted by the whole tenor of the will. Everything that an alien was capable of taking and holding, even the slaves, for some of whom the testator manifested special care, were given to Hugh without any condition whatever as to naturalization. In addition to this the testator gives to his brother Hugh the rents and profits of the real estate from the time of his decease, showing clearly that his intention was that Hugh should have every benefit from the property possible for an alien to have. This leads to the irresistible inference that but for such disability he would take the absolute estate in the land too. If the property was intended to be offered to him merely as a bribe to become a citizen of this country, it is scarcely probable that he would have been given every benefit to be derived from the property without requiring him to renounce his allegiance to the British Crown and become a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The language of the clause under consideration, especially when read in connection with the sixth clause of the will, as it is not only allowable but proper to do, certainly admits of the construction which we have placed upon it. In that (the sixth) clause, the testator, in the event of the death of his brother Hugh and his nephew William before his own death, gives the real estate in qnestion to McCaw in trust to hold the same and convey it to his nephew James, who was an alien, \u201cwhen the said James becomes <em>legally qualified </em>to take and hold said real estate.\u201d Now, it cannot be doubted that this language must be construed to mean that James was to have the legal estate whenever he should <em>in any manner </em>become qualified to hold it, whether by naturalization or otherwise. Hence, to give the language of the second clause a strictly literal construction, as contended for by the plaintiffs, would involve us in the absurdity of supposing that the testator intended to place more stringent restrictions upon the capacity of his brother to take \u2014 manifestly the primary object of his bounty \u2014 than he did upon a more distant relation, one who was not only not the primary object of his bounty but two degrees removed beyond it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The whole force of the argument in favor of the construction contended for by the plaintiffs rests upon the idea that the essential part of the condition upon which Hugh was to be invested with the legal estate consisted in the <em>manner </em>in which he was to acquire the capacity \u201cto take and to hold.\u201d This, we think, to say the least of it, is an unnatural construction, and that the more reasonable and natural construction is that the testator only intended that the capacity \u201c to take and to hold \u201d should be acquired, and that the <em>manner </em>in which it should be acquired was wholly unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It will be observed that the language of the second clause is, not when Hugh Hacket shall become a <em>citizen </em>or become <em>naturalized, </em>according to Acts of Congress, which would carry with it something more than the mere right to take and hold real estate, but the language is \u201c shall become duly qualified, according to the Acts of Congress of the United States of America, <em>to take and to hold said real estate, </em>not to acquire the right to vote or any other political right, which is the real object of such Acts of Congress. In fact, speaking with strict technical accuracy, it is not correct to say that an alien acquires any more capacity to hold property by virtue of these Acts of Congress, as such rights have their origin solely in the laws of the States. We regard, therefore, the language used in the second clause of the will as a loose and inaccurate form of expressing the same idea which in the sixth clause is embodied in more comprehensive and correct terms, viz.: That as the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty were, by reason of their alienage, incapable of holding real estate, provision was made whereby the legal estate should be held by a trustee until such incapacity was removed. And when we find a testator applying the terms \u201cdevise\u201d and \u201cbequeath\u201d indiscriminately to real and personal property, we are prepared to expect to find similar inaccuracies of expression in other portions of the will and in relation to other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">This being the proper construction of the terms of the second clause of the will, it follows necessarily that there was no intestacy as to the real estate in question, and hence that the plaintiffs failed to establish their right to recover; for even if, as was argued, Hugh Hacket failed to acquire the capacity to hold real estate by the proceedings taken by him for the purpose of becoming a denizen, he certainly became legally qualified to hold such real estate by virtue of the provisions of the Act of 1872, (15 Stat., 73,) placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>aliens upon the same footing as natural-born citizens so far as the capacity to acquire and hold real estate was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">It is not true, as has been supposed, that the decision of the late Court of Appeals in the case of <em>McCaw </em>vs. <em>Galbraith </em>(7 Rich., 74,) precludes us from taking the view hereinbefore advanced. That case, though not relied upon as having the effect of <em>res adjud\u00edcala, </em>as it could not be for lack of the necessary identities, it is contended, authoritatively determines certain principles which are inconsistent with the construction which we have placed upon this will. We do not so understand it. In that case not more than two Judges out of the six composing the Court agreed upon any proposition except the point actually decided in the case ; and that point was that the inquisition of escheat should be quashed, because the case as made by the proceedings did not show that the escheator was entitled to possession of the real estate of which William Hacket died seized and possessed. Anything else to be found in the case must be regarded as merely an <em>obiter dictum; </em>and though entitled to the highest respect on account of the source from which it comes, certainly does not carry with it the weight of authority. And in estimating the weight to be allowed to the <em>dictum </em>relied upon by the plaintiffs, we must remember that at the time that case was heard Plugh Hacket had taken no step whatever <em>towards becoming a denizen, </em>he not having come to this country until the 6th of November, 1854, while that case was decided at November Term, 1853. Hence the Court did not and could not have had before it the question which we have been considering, <em>because no event had then occurred </em>which could give rise to such a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">From the view which we have taken of this case, it becomes unnecessary to enter upon the inquiry, which would be a purely speculative one, whether the plaintiffs would be the only next of kin of William Hacket, Sr., capable of inheriting his real estate if he had died intestate as to such real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The motion is granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-8\"><em>Willard, </em>C.
