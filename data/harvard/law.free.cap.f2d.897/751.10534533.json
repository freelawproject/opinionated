We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Although the facts generally were vigorously disputed in this case, some facts are not disputed. There is no dispute that in the early morning hours of June 14, 1988 shots were fired from Perez\u2019s pickup truck during the course of an encounter between one or more persons in Perez\u2019s vehicle and one or more persons in another vehicle. There is no dispute that the police officers, responding to a report of a shooting, shortly thereafter apprehended Perez and two juvenile passengers and found a sawed-off shotgun, ammunition, and a .22 calibre rifle in Perez\u2019s pickup truck. Perez maintains that his girlfriend\u2019s former boyfriend started the incident by shooting at Perez as he spoke with two young friends of his son. According to Perez one of the boys was carrying a shotgun and, after jumping into Perez\u2019s truck, returned the fire in order to scare off the assailant. The government maintains that the shotgun belonged to Perez and that he fired the shots. As to the .22 caliber rifle, Perez maintains that he merely held it as security for the payment of an auto battery that Perez had sold on credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">Perez has at least four prior felony convictions. He was indicted for possession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a); possession of an unregistered firearm, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871; and possession of a firearm without a serial number, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(i), 5871. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all three counts. Perez was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment on the first count and 105 months imprisonment on each of the remaining counts with the sentences to run concurrently. Perez timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">1. Application of Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">The district court calculated Perez\u2019s sentence for the 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861 violations from Guideline \u00a7 2K2.2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Sentencing Guidelines. Subsection (c)(1) of that guideline provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-20\">If the defendant used the firearm in committing or attempting another offense, apply the guideline for such other offense or \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy), if the resulting offense level is higher than that determined above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arx\">Applying this guideline, the court adjusted the base offense level upwards for the use of a firearm during the commission of an aggravated assault. Guideline \u00a7 2A2.2. Perez maintains that there was not sufficient evidence of the intent required to support this upward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-21\">On appellate review we will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s factual findings, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>clearly erroneous, and typically accord deference to its application of the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>867 F.2d 216 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 3257, 106 L.Ed.2d 602 (1989). Applying this standard, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The assault offense which caused the court to enhance Perez\u2019s sentence is akin to the federal offense of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c). In <em>Shaffer v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 654 (5th Cir.1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 U.S. 939, 83 S.Ct. 1544, 10 L.Ed.2d 694 (1963), we established a test for the \u201cintent to do bodily harm\u201d element of that offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">This is not to be measured by the secret motive of the actor or some undisclosed purpose merely to frighten, not to hurt. This is to be judged objectively from the visible conduct of the actor and what one in the position of the victim might reasonably conclude.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">308 F.2d at 655.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this objective test, the jury\u2019s necessary finding that Perez possessed the shotgun, and Perez's admission at trial that shots were fired from the cab of his pickup during the encounter, are sufficient to establish that Perez had the requisite intent to do bodily harm. Taken together the circumstances were sufficient to support the district court\u2019s determination that Perez fired the weapon. It is not critical in which direction the gunman aimed; any shot would lead the persons in the other vehicle reasonably to conclude that the person shooting was threatening imminent bodily harm. <em>Cf. United States v. Skinners, </em>892 F.2d 742 (8th Cir.1989) (aggravated assault enhancement of sentence for firearms possession affirmed where gun fired into air during a scuffle). Finally, the government need not produce direct evidence that Perez intended to do more than frighten the occupants of the other vehicle. The court\u2019s factual finding that Perez used the shotgun to commit aggravated assault was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Perez next contends that the trial court did not adequately explain its adjustment decision. We disagree. In rejecting the presentence investigation report recommendation to enhance the sentence for use of the firearm in attempted murder, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">Well, I do recall the testimony from the trial_ I feel that the cross-reference should be to aggravated assault rather than attempted murder. Attempted murder is an offense which requires an intent, and I don\u2019t think that was present in this case, although ... it can be inferred with more definite evidence concerning the discharge of the firearm. So, in that regard, the guideline range will be changed in accordance with Section 2A2.2, \u201cAssault\u201d_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">Contrary to Perez\u2019s contention, the court did not depart from the Guidelines; thus, the requirement that the court explain the reasons for imposing a sentence different from that indicated by the Guidelines does not apply. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). Although the court must resolve reasonable factual disputes \u201cconcerning a factor important to the sentencing determination,\u201d Guideline \u00a7 6A1.3, the court\u2019s decision to apply the aggravated assault enhancement rather than the enhancement for attempted murder constituted an adequate resolution of the matter. We note that the defendant did not further object or request additional explanation. Although a more specific fact-finding would have been preferable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the court\u2019s application of the Guidelines passes muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">2. Jury Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Perez challenges his conviction because the district court refused to give two instructions he requested. A conviction will not be overturned for refusal to give a requested jury charge unless \u201cthat instruction is legally correct, represents a theory of defense with basis in the record which would lead to acquittal, and ... that theory is not effectively presented elsewhere in the charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Mollier, </em>853 F.2d 1169, 1174 (5th Cir.1988), <em>quoting, United States v. Rubio, </em>834 F.2d 442, 447 (5th Cir.1987). Because Perez\u2019s proffered jury instructions fail to meet this standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">The first proposed instruction was that the jury should find Perez not guilty of violating sections 922(g)(1) and 924(a) if it found that he reasonably believed that the .22 caliber rifle was inoperable. Conviction under these statutes does not require that a defendant know his conduct violates the law; rather the defendant need only know that he possessed a firearm to have the requisite scienter. <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77 (5th Cir.1988). An inoperable firearm is nonetheless a firearm. <em>United States v. Cobum, </em>876 F.2d 372 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. York, </em>830 F.2d 885 (8th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1074, 108 S.Ct. 1047, 98 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">The second proposed instruction was that the jury should find Perez not guilty of violating section 5861 if it found that the shotgun had been placed in his truck by another. This requested instruction misconstrues the law of possession. Possession may be actual or constructive. Constructive possession is the knowing exercise of, or the power or right to exercise dominion or control over the item at issue, and may be shown by dominion over the vehicle in which the item is located. <em>United States v. Williams-Hendricks, </em>805 F.2d 496 (5th Cir.1986). That one or both of the juveniles may have \u201cabandoned\u201d the shotgun in Perez\u2019s truck when the police drew near is irrelevant. Perez had possession, either actual or constructive. The court did not err in refusing to give the requested instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-14\">. Guideline \u00a7 2K2.2 was amended, effective November 1, 1989. The amendment is inapplicable to this case because Perez was sentenced prior to its effective date. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\">. Our selection of a federal standard to determine whether Perez committed aggravated assault is informed by the Background Commentary to Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), which is identical to Guideline \u00a7 2K2.2(c)(l). The Commentary states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">The firearm statutes often are used as a device to enable the federal court to exercise jurisdiction over offenses that otherwise could be prosecuted only under state law. For example, a convicted felon may be prosecuted for possessing a firearm if he used the firearm to rob a gasoline station. Such prosecutions result in high sentences because of the true nature of the underlying conduct. The cross reference at \u00a7 2K2.1(c) deals with such cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK7\">Enhancement of the federal sentence should not depend on the elements of the state offense, which may vary from state to state, but should be uniformly applied nationwide in accordance with the defendant\u2019s actual conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
