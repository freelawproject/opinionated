He has sought relief in seven <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings, the seventh being dealt with in <em>Ellis v. Warden, </em>218 Md. 631, where his application for leave to appeal was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The applicant\u2019s present contentions, with one exception, were all found by Judge Sodaro, correctly we think, to have been without merit. The one contention that was not dealt with below was that the sentence was excessive and unconstitutional. There is no merit in the contention as the sentence for robbery with a deadly weapon is within the maximum prescribed by the statute applicable at the time of the sentencing, now Code (1957), Art. 27, sec. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
