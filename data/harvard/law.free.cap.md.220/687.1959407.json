Warden, </em>218 Md. 639, 145 A. 2d 226 (1958). However, on this application for leave to appeal he abandoned all of his prior contentions except three, but asserted a fourth one\u2014plea of guilty was entered without consent of petitioner\u2014which was not raised below and cannot be considered here. One of the contentions \u2014the incompetence of counsel\u2014as the lower court properly observed was disposed of in <em>Culley v. Warden, 217 </em>Md. 660, 143 A. 2d 61 (1958). With respect to the other two contentions\u2014failure of the trial court to warn petitioner of the consequences of a plea of guilty <em>[Tillett v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 677, 154 A. 2d 808] and that the prosecuting attorney had knowingly told an untruth in the presence of the petitioner while stating the facts to the court after entry of the plea of guilty\u2014the lower court found nothing in either to entitle the petitioner to any relief. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
