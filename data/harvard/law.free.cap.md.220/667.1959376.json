His contention that his hearing on his application was invalid because he was not present is untenable. His presence was not necessary. Code (1959 Supp.), Art. 27, Section 645G; <em>Plump v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 662, 153 A. 2d 269, 270. Other contentions not presented in the trial court are not properly before this Court and will not be considered by this Court. <em>Young v.
