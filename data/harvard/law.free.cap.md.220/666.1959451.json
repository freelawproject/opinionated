When his petition was denied, he applied to this Court for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Below, the applicant claimed that his constitutional rights had been violated and assigned three reasons why he was entitled to set aside the several sentences: (i) deprivation of his right to call witnesses; (ii) misconduct of his trial counsel; and (iii) insufficiency of the evidence. In his application for leave to appeal, he abandoned the second ground but raised another\u2014refusal of the trial court to postpone his case on request. Of course, since the last mentioned question was not raised below, it cannot be considered here. The first question was previously litigated in <em>McClain v. Warden, </em>215 Md. 648, 137 A. 2d 711 (1958), a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, and cannot be raised again in a post conviction proceeding. See Code (1958 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (a). The third question\u2014the insufficiency of the evidence\u2014was reviewable only on appeal from the original convictions. Moreover, the remedy afforded by the post conviction procedure is not a substitute for a direct review. Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
