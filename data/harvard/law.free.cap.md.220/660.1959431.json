It, therefore, calls for no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Any additional claims not made before the Criminal Court of Baltimore which the applicant has included in his brief in support of this application are not properly before us. <em>Davis v. </em>Warden, 217 Md. 662, 143 A. 2d 77 (an application for leave to appeal in a <em>habeas corpus </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
