The two brothers have a sister, but she failed to join in the suit. The suit is based upon the theory that a confidential relationship existed between the appellee brother and his mother, which placed the burden upon him to show the complete fairness of the transaction with his mother. The appellant has no chance of success. As found by the chancellor below, the evidence simply does not establish a confidential relationship between the appellee brother and his mother. On the contrary, it shows that the mother was in complete control of her faculties, made gifts to her children as she desired, remarried after the transaction complained of and generally attended to her own property and business affairs. Moreover, if we should assume, without deciding, that there were a confidential relationship existing between the mother and son, as was said by Judge Horney, for the Court in <em>Piraino v. Betka, </em>218 Md. 548, 557, \u201cwe find nothing to show that the gift [in this case a sale] was improvident or the result of coercion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
