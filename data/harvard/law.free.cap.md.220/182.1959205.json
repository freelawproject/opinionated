State, </em>201 Md. 164, when he was physically using an automobile belonging to another. The question of his intention, of course, involved a question of fact. We recently quoted from a celebrated statement of Lord Bowen in an action of deceit to the effect that the state o\u00ed a man\u2019s mind is as much a question of fact as the state of his digestion. <em>Tufts v. Poore, </em>219 Md. 1, 11. We have carefully examined the record; the evidence, and permissible inferences therefrom, fully support the finding of the trial judge that the appellant possessed criminal intent when using the automobile. <em>Anello v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
