The defendant below (appellant here) ran his truck into the rear of a stationary motor vehicle, in which the plaintiff was seated. At the trial, the defendant admitted liability; thereby conceding that the collision occurred, his negligence caused it and the plaintiff had suffered some damage as a result thereof. Cf. <em>Smith v. Dolan, </em>170 Md. 654, 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">The appellant claims that the trial court did not adequately instruct the jury on the burden of proof upon the plaintiff as to his injuries, damages and losses; and, although conceding that the plaintiff was entitled to an appropriate instruction on the law as to the aggravation of a pre-existing condition as an element of damage, contends the court gave an improper instruction concerning the aggravation of the plaintiff\u2019s preexisting neck condition under the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">The appellant cannot prevail in either of his contentions. His principal complaint on the first point is that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>refused to grant his prayer on the question of burden of proof as to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and losses. In <em>Ager v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>213 Md. 414, 425, a personal injury case, we stated: \u201cWhile there is no objection to the trial court\u2019s pointing out any and all of the reciprocal duties and obligations of the respective parties in minute detail, there is no obligation that it do so, provided the subject is fully and comprehensively covered in the charge to the jury.\u201d See also <em>West v. Belle Isle Cab Co., </em>203 Md. 244, 250, and Maryland Rule 554 b 1. We think a careful reading of the trial court\u2019s instructions concerning the burden of proof, under the authority of such cases as <em>Riley v. Naylor, 179 </em>Md. 1, 7, 8, <em>American Stores Co. v. Herman, </em>166 Md. 312, 321, <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Works v. Catron, </em>186 Md. 156, 162-164, and <em>Adams v. Benson, </em>208 Md. 261, 271, shows that the question as to the burden of proof upon the plaintiff concerning his injuries, damages and losses was fairly and adequately covered and the instructions were not misleading to the jury. Likewise, under the authority of such cases as <em>Baltimore City Pass. Ry. Co. v. Kemp, </em>61 Md. 74, 80-82, <em>Abend v. Sieber, </em>161 Md. 645, 648, and <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Works v. Catron, supra, </em>we hold that the jury was fairly and adequately, under the circumstances of this case, instructed concerning the alleged aggravation of the plaintiff\u2019s pre-existing neck condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
