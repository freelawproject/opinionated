State, </em>219 Md. 67. Even in a serious case of this nature\u2014the petitioner having been sentenced to death in each of two separate convictions of rape\u2014it would serve no useful purpose to set out the claims and contentions again as they were fully set forth, considered and determined in the above noted appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">It is not one of the purposes of the Post Conviction Procedure Act to grant an additional and fully repetitious appeal.
