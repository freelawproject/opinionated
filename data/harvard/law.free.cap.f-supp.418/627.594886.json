Employers within the Act\u2019s <em>coverage</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are required to provide employees a work environment \u201cfree from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1). In addition, covered employers must comply with health and safety standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2). Civil and criminal penalties may be incurred for violation of these statutorily imposed duties. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666. As part of its enforcement scheme, OSHA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-16\">\u201c. . . the Secretary, upon presenting appropriate credentials to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, is authorized\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ais-dedup-1\">(1) to enter without delay and at reasonable times any factory, plant, establishment, construction site, or other area, workplace or environment where work is performed by an employee of an employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-19\">(2) to inspect and investigate during regular working hours and at other reasonable times, and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, any such place of employment and all pertinent conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, equipment, and materials therein, and to question privately any such employer, owner, operator, agent or employee.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-20\">The facts in this case are stipulated and undisputed. On February 12, 1975, during normal working hours, two authorized representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Administration), United States Department of Labor, appeared at Hertzler Enterprises, Inc. (Hertz-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ler)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, doing business as Sandia Die and Cartridge Company, to conduct an inspection of the premises pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a). These representatives' presented their credentials to Donna Walker Hertzler, President of Hertzler, who denied them entry and refused to permit an inspection. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The inspection attempted apparently was undertaken as a matter of routine for the purpose of determining whether Hertzler was in compliance with OSHA. There is no evidence that it arose out of any emergency, employee complaint, or belief that Hertzler was in violation of OSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On April 16,1975, a representative of the Administration made application to a United States Magistrate for an inspection warrant. The magistrate promptly issued a warrant ordering the entry, inspection and investigation of Hertzler. However, no showing of probable cause was made as a basis for issuance of this inspection warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 16, 1975, and again on April 18, 1975, OSHA compliance officers attempted to serve the inspection warrant and to inspect Hertzler, but they were denied entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">On June 5, 1975, the Secretary of Labor instituted this suit by petitioning the court for an order compelling Hertzler to submit to an inspection under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a). Jurisdiction was invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1337, 1345. A show cause order issued on June 6, 1975, and, thereafter, Hertzler filed an application for a permanent injunction to restrain enforcement of the OSHA inspection provisions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for repugnance to the United States Constitution. Accordingly, a three-judge court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Plaintiff Secretary claims that the petition for entry, inspection, and investigation should be granted for the reason that, consistent with the dictates of the fourth amendment, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a) permits OSHA compliance officers to conduct a nonconsensual inspection of a business covered by the Act without first making any showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Hertzler recognizes that the government has a valid interest in effectuating the Act\u2019s purpose of protecting employees through control of hazardous working conditions. Further, it concedes that inspections may be necessary to accomplish this purpose. Yet, Hertzler insists that the fourth amendment protects it from being inspected against its will by the Administration unless a warrant is first obtained upon a judicial officer\u2019s determination of probable cause. To the extent that \u00a7 657(a) authorizes OSHA compliance officers to conduct an objected-to inspection without prior resort to a search warrant based on\u2019 probable cause, Hertzler claims it violates the fourth amendment, and therefore, that its enforcement must be enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">In support of the Secretary\u2019s position, reliance is placed on the case of <em>Brennan v. Buckeye Industries, Inc., </em>374 F.Supp. 1350 (S.D.Ga.1974). The <em>Buckeye </em>case arose when the Secretary of Labor petitioned a Georgia federal district court for an order requiring Buckeye Industries to submit to an OSHA inspection after access to the facility had been denied to a compliance officer attempting a general inspection. No search warrant had been sought by the Administration because of an apparent lack of any requisite probable cause. Nevertheless, the inspection order requested by the Secretary was granted over the company\u2019s objection that a nonconsensual OSHA inspection is unconstitutional under the fourth amendment unless conducted pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ant to a warrant obtained upon a showing of probable cause. The Georgia court thus held that warrantless, nonconsensual OSHA inspections performed pursuant to \u00a7 657(a) are valid under the fourth amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Hertzler bases its position on the case of <em>Brennan v. Gibson\u2019s Products, Inc., </em>407 F.Supp. 154 (E.D.Tex.1976), which is squarely in conflict with <em>Buckeye. </em>In <em>Gibson\u2019s Products, </em>on facts nearly identical to those presently before the court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, it was held that the fourth amendment prohibits warrantless, nonconsensual OSHA inspections. <em>Id. </em>at 156. However, the Texas court refrained from invalidating the OSHA inspection provisions; instead, it construed \u00a7 657(a) to authorize an OSHA inspection over an objection only when conducted pursuant to \u201ca search warrant issued by a United States Magistrate or other judicial officer of the third branch under probable cause standards appropriate to administrative searches \u2014 that is, in a constitutional manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">It is concluded that in this case the fourth amendment protects Hertzler from being required to submit to the inspection proposed by the Administration unless a search warrant is first obtained on a showing of probable cause. Enforcement of the OSHA inspection provisions need not be enjoined, however, since \u00a7 657(a) is here construed, as it was in <em>Gibson\u2019s Products, </em>to empower the Administration to conduct a nonconsensual inspection only pursuant to a search warrant issued by a judicial officer upon a showing of probable cause sufficient to justify an administrative search.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Controlling in the resolution of this case are two relatively recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court to the effect that administrative searches are subject to the fourth amendment requirement of a warrant. <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967); <em>See v. City of Seattle, </em>387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In <em>Camara, </em>the Supreme Court held that officers seeking to conduct a routine code-enforcement \u201carea\u201d inspection of a private dwelling, as authorized by the municipal housing code, were required under the fourth amendment to obtain a warrant upon being denied entry by the resident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 387 U.S. at 534, 87 S.Ct. 1727. According to <em>Camara, </em>issuance of an inspection warrant is to be based on satisfaction of a flexible probable cause standard. That is, the need to search is to be weighed against the invasion which the search entails, and the resulting balance may vary from inspection to inspection, depending on, for example, the public need for effective enforcement in a particular area, the nature of the search proposed, the legislative and administrative standards under which particular regulatory inspections are to be conducted, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>agency\u2019s experience with particular facilities, and the length of time which has passed without inspection. <em>Id. </em>at 535-39, 87 S.Ct. 1727.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The subject of the <em>See </em>case was an attempted routine inspection authorized by a municipal fire code to obtain compliance with its provisions. In <em>See </em>it was held that the warrant requirement and probable cause standards articulated in <em>Camara </em>were applicable to unconsented administrative inspections of commercial premises. 387 U.S. at 543-545, 87 S.Ct. 1737. However, any question as to the validity of regulatory inspections conducted as part of licensing programs was expressly reserved for decision on a case by case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 87 S.Ct. 1737.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">A result contrary to that reached by the Court in this ease is not called for by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Colonade Catering Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 72, 90 S.Ct. 774, 25 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972), or their progeny in the lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The <em>Buckeye </em>court, in upholding warrant-less nonconsensual OSHA inspections, reasoned that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Colonade </em>and <em>Biswell </em>signified a general retreat from the warrant requirements imposed by <em>Camara </em>and <em>See </em>in the area of administrative inspections. It construed the <em>Colonade-Biswell </em>line to permit war-rantless administrative inspections if conducted in accord with legislative authorization reasonable in time and scope and if a strong governmental interest and administrative efficiency would be served thereby. <em>See Brennan v. Buckeye Industries, Inc., supra </em>at 1354-1356; <em>Brennan v. Gibson\u2019s Products, Inc., supra </em>at 160-161.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\"><em>Colonade Catering Corp. v. United States </em>approved a warrantless nonconsensual inspection of a liquor licensee conducted pursuant to a federal inspection law for the purpose of investigating a possible violation of federal excise tax law. 397 U.S. at 76-77, 90 S.Ct. 774. In <em>United States v. Biswell, </em>the Supreme Court upheld warrantless inspections of licensed firearms dealers conducted pursuant to provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968. 406 U.S. at 315, 92 S.Ct. 1593.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">This Court finds, as did the court in <em>Gibson\u2019s Products, </em>that a more restrictive reading of the <em>Colonade </em>and <em>Biswell </em>cases is required, especially in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncements in <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <em>Air Pollution Variance Board v. Western Alfalfa Corp., </em>416 U.S. 861, 864, 94 S.Ct. 2114, 40 L.Ed.2d 607 (1974).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, it is concluded that <em>Colonade </em>and <em>Biswell </em>create a narrow exception to the general <em>Camara-See </em>rule requiring that objected-to administrative inspections be conducted only within the framework of a warrant procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The <em>Colonade-Biswell </em>exception is applicable only if certain factors identified by the Supreme Court are present in a particular case. These factors may be broadly grouped and summarized as follows. First, the enterprise sought to be inspected must be engaged in a pervasively regulated business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The presence of this factor insures that warrantless inspection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>will pose only a minimal threat to justifiable expectations of privacy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, war-rantless inspection must be a crucial part of a regulatory scheme designed to further an urgent federal interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And third, the inspection must be conducted in accord with a statutorily authorized procedure, itself carefully limited as to time, place, and scope.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The presence of this factor guards against the possibility that any inspection right will be abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Hertzler\u2019s subjection to the OSHA inspection scheme is based solely on its status as an employer. <em>See </em>n. 1 <em>supra. </em>As a manufacturer of ammunition and paper boxes, it is not engaged in a pervasively regulated business and thus cannot be deemed to have impliedly consented to regulatory inspection. <em>See </em>n. 11 <em>supra. </em>This circumstance renders the <em>Colonade-Biswell </em>rationale inapplicable here and requires that Hertzler\u2019s justifiable expectations of privacy be protected under the fourth amendment. Thus, the <em>Camara -See </em>rule is properly invoked in this case, and the Administration must obtain a search warrant based on an appropriate showing of probable cause before Hertz-ler can be required to submit to the OSHA inspection previously resisted. This conclusion is not inconsistent with the progeny of <em>Colonade </em>and <em>Biswell </em>in the lower courts; the warrantless regulatory inspections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>there upheld have been within the context of pervasively regulated enterprises.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The <em>Colonade -Biswell </em>line of cases is distinguishable from the case presently before the Court in one additional significant particular. Where inroads on the warrant requirement have been upheld, it has been within the context of a regulatory inspection scheme relatively narrow in scope, that is, one focused on a particular industry or item which historically has been an object of pervasive governmental concern or which involves some inherent danger. The scope of OSHA is far from narrow. As observed by the court in <em>Gibson\u2019s Products:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cOSHA\u2019s sweep is broad, and Congress\u2019 findings supporting it are slender. Made subject to its warrantless inspection is every private concern engaged in a business affecting commerce which has employees and all \u2018environments\u2019 where these employees work. It thus embraces indiscriminately steel mills, automobile plants, fishing boats, farms and private schools, commercial art studios, accounting offices, and barber shops \u2014 indeed, the whole spectrum of unrelated and disparate activities which compose private enterprise in the United States.\u201d 407 F.Supp. at 161 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Because of the narrower scope of the regulatory schemes pursuant to which inspections were undertaken in <em>Colonade </em>and <em>Biswell, </em>there was certainty \u201cthat the concerns [there] searched had on the premises and dealt in the sensitive commodities\u2014 guns and liquors \u2014 which occasioned official scrutiny.\u201d <em>Brennan v. Gibson\u2019s Products, supra </em>at 162. <em>See Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, supra </em>413 U.S. at 271-272, 93 S.Ct. 2535. By contrast there is no evidence that \u201cthe thing sought to be controlled\u2014 hazardous working conditions \u2014 exists in the area to be searched\u201d in this case. <em>Brennan v. Gibson\u2019s Products, supra </em>at 162. <em>See Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, supra </em>413 U.S. at 271-272, 93 S.Ct. 2535. Thus, it is not certain that inspection of Hertzler will advance the urgent federal interest upon which the OSHA regulatory scheme is premised.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Section 657(a) could not constitutionally authorize a warrantless inspection of Hertz-ler for the reasons previously outlined.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Nevertheless it is unnecessary to invalidate this inspection provision. A construction of \u00a7 657(a) as permissive of warrantless inspections is not required either by the section\u2019s language <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or by its legislative history.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, it is presumed that Congress intended to empower the Administration to conduct nonconsensual inspections only pursuant to the authority of a warrant issued upon satisfaction of standards of probable cause which have been articulated in the area of administrative searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Since no showing of probable cause was made for the issuance for the warrant to inspect Hertzler, an injunction will be issued permanently restraining the plaintiff from making a nonconsensual entry, inspection and investigation of the Hertzler premises on the basis of the warrant issued by the Magistrate on April 16, 1975. Since the statute as construed in this opinion is constitutional, the three-judge court will be dissolved and the matters referred to the single judge to whom the case was originally assigned.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-21\">.

The warrant application included only a recitation of the OSHA inspection provisions as authority for the proposed inspection plus statements to the effect that inspection of Hertzler was necessary to determine its compliance with OSHA and that OSHA inspectors previously had been denied entry at Hertzler. The warrant itself contained a conclusory assertion that reasonable legislative and administrative standards had been proposed for the inspection pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-16\">. Of the Act\u2019s various provisions initially challenged, only the inspection provisions remain in issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">. A Montana federal district court, citing the <em>Buckeye </em>case as authority, granted the Secretary\u2019s petition for an order allowing entry, inspection and investigation of an unwilling employer without requiring the Administration to first obtain a warrant based on a showing of probable cause. <em>Dunlop v. Able Contractors, </em>Civ.No. 75-57 (D.Mont., Dec. 15, 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">. <em>Gibson's Products </em>grew out of an employer\u2019s refusal to permit an OSHA inspection of the nonpublic portions of his store. The procedural sequence in the Texas case is indistinguishable from that in the instant case except as to one particular. No search warrant was sought by the Secretary in <em>Gibson\u2019s Products </em>although the Administration\u2019s Compliance Operations Manual advised that an inspection warrant be pursued upon an employer\u2019s attempt to limit or interfere with an OSHA inspection. 407 F.Supp. at 156 &amp; n. 4. However, it was apparent from the stipulated facts in <em>Gibson\u2019s Products, </em>as it is in this case, that no probable cause was shown which would justify issuance of a warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">It should be noted that, at present, the Administration does not recommend pursuit of a warrant where an employer refuses to allow his premises to be inspected. Rather, where such refusal to permit inspection is encountered, resort to \u201clegal process\u201d or \u201ccompulsory process\u201d is advised. <em>See </em>OSHA Field Operations Manual, P.P.
