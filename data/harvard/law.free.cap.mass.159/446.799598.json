The judge found that the defendant did not have property above the amount of twenty dollars which could be taken on execution, and administered the oath for the relief of poor debtors, found him guilty of the charge of fraud, sentenced him to imprisonment, and attached his certificate thereof under the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-14\">The defendant appealed from the finding and sentence on the charge of fraud, and recognized according to law to enter his appearance in the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-15\">When the case was first called for trial, neither the creditor nor his attorney was present, and the creditor was nonsuited. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Against the objection of the defendant, the nonsuit was removed at the same term; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule as follows: \u201c The administering the oath for the relief of poor debtors in the Municipal Court to the debtor was a legal discharge of the defendant from the charge of fraud, and is a bar to the proceedings here.\u201d The judge refused so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">The case was argued at the bar in March, 1893, and after-wards was submitted on the briefs to all the judges.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-8\"><em>P.

A majority of the court is of opinion that, under Pub. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 89, 52, the judge of the Municipal Court had no authority to administer the oath concurrently with his finding the debtor guilty upon the charge of fraud, and that his act of administering the oath under such circumstances was a mere nullity; -the case being distinguishable from <em>Lockhead </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>137 Mass. 25, where the oath was not administered until an appeal had been taken from the conviction upon the charge of fraud, and a new application had been made by the debtor after the entry of the appeal. A minority of the court think, that under the decision of <em>Lockhead </em>v. <em>Jones </em>the oath was lawfully administered, but that it nevertheless did not have the effect to discharge the debtor upon the charge of fraud. In either view, the debtor was properly convicted upon the charge of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">It was within the discretionary power of the Superior Court to remove the nonsuit. Both in civil and criminal cases an order of court may be revised at the same term or sitting of the court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weymouth, </em>2 Allen, 144. <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>3 Allen, 429, 430. <em>Keith </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>145 Mass. 18. The charge of fraud was in the nature of a suit at law; the defendant\u2019s recognizance bound him to abide the final judgment; and there is no statute which entitled him to an absolute discharge on the mere entry of a nonsuit. Pub. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 49-52. <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>150 Mass. 411, 418. No judgment had been entered upon the nonsuit. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
