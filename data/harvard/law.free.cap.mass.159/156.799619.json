The evidence showed that the plaintiff, a servant in the defendant\u2019s employ, had wheeled a heavy piece of machinery upon an elevator, without orders so to do, and had thereupon been ordered to remove it by another of the defendant\u2019s <em>servants; </em>and that while he was endeavoring to remove it from the elevator, the wheels of the truck upon which the machinery had been moved struck the curbing of the elevator well on a level with the floor, and the machinery fell upon the plaintiff and injured him. There was nothing to show that the injury was due to a defect in the elevator. <em>Held, </em>that evidence as to the condition of- the elevator at a time before the day of the accident, and as to the condition of the elevator belt, and as to whether there was anything to prevent the elevator from going below the floor, was rightly excluded. <em>Held, also, </em>that a ruling that the action could not be maintained was correct.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\">Tort, for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff while in the defendant\u2019s employ as a general helper. The declaration in the case, after narrating the manner in which the accident through which the plaintiff was injured occurred, alleged that at the time of said injury and prior thereto \u201c the defendant corporation by its servants and agents was negligent, and was guilty of a breach of duty toward the plaintiff.\u201d The evidence offered by the plaintiff tended to show that the defendant\u2019s superintendent, Cooney, told the plaintiff and a fellow workman, Butterman, to move a heavy piece of machinery over to the elevator, and that he, the superintendent, would follow and help them as soon as he got another man. The machinery was loaded on a truck, of which no complaint was made, and pushed upon the elevator by the plaintiff and Butterman, without waiting for the superintendent to return. The weight of the machinery caused the elevator to tip a little to one side and to drop about an inch, whereupon another servant of the defendant, McAleer, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>had charge of the elevator and was then engaged in oiling the gearing of the same, the belt being off, ordered them to take the machinery off. As the plaintiff and Butterman were endeavoring to wheel the truck off the elevator, the wheels struck the stone curbing surrounding the elevator well and level with the floor, and the machinery fell upon the plaintiff and injured him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-3\">The plaintiff offered to show that there had been trouble with the elevator at some time before the day of the accident; that it had been out of order, so much so as to stop work upon it, and occasioned quite extensive repairs. But at the defendant\u2019s request, Hopkins, J. excluded the evidence, and the plaintiff excepted. In excluding the evidence the court stated that the plaintiff might show its condition at the time of the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">The plaintiff asked one of his witnesses the following questions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">\u201c First. Whether or not there was oil on the belts which ran the elevator?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">\u201c Second. If the belt was not saturated with oil?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">\u201c Third. How long the belt on the running gear had. been in use when the accident happened ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">\u201c Fourth. Before the accident occurred, had there been any trouble with the working or operating of the elevator?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-9\">\u201cFifth.

The plaintiff and Butterman loaded the machinery on to a truck, of which no complaint is made, and took it to the elevator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and then, without waiting for the superintendent to arrive, put it on the elevator. It caused the elevator to drop about an inch, and McAleer, the man who had charge of the elevator, and who was oiling it, the belt being off, shouted to them to take it off; and while they were doing so the wheels of the truck struck the curbing which surrounded the elevator well, and which was level with the floor, and caused the machinery to slip and injure the plaintiff. We do not see how, on this state of facts, it can be s\u00e1id that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was due to any negligence on the part of the defendant, or to anything except his own act and the act of Butterman, in trying, in consequence of what McAleer had said to them, to get the machinery off of the elevator after they had put it on without any direction from anybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">There was nothing to show that the injury was due to any defect in the elevator, and the testimony that was offered was therefore rightly excluded. It may be added, also, that the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, fairly construed, does not allege that the injury was caused by any defect in the elevator, or in the ways, works, or machinery of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
