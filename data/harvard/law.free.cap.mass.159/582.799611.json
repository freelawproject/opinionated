There was also evidence that before the bank caved in it appeared to be shaky and cracked; and that the plaintiff\u2019s attention was called to this, and he said he would look out, that he would keep his eye on it, <em>\u201c </em>and jump quick enough.\u201d This was denied by the plaintiff in his testimony. On this branch of the case, the jury were instructed that, if the plaintiff knew the risk and voluntarily assumed it, he could not recover; that, if he did not know it, he might recover, if the jury were satisfied on the other parts of the case. At the close of the charge, the plaintiff requested the judge to instruct the jury as follows : \u201c Any extraordinary danger at the particular place where he was injured, the plaintiff, if he did not know and appreciate it, cannot he held to have assumed.\u201d The judge refused to give this instruction. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b606-9\">No exception lies to the refusal to give an instruction in the language requested, if it has been given in substance and in another form.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-10\">Tort, against the selectmen of the town of Greenfield, for personal injuries occasioned to the plaintiff by the negligence of the defendants in failing to provide suitable means of support for the sides of a trench, in which they had employed the plaintiff to lay pipes for the purpose of building a public sewer in one of the streets of the town. After the former decision, reported in 157 Mass. 277, the case was tried in the Superior Court, before Fessenden, J.

It had already been given in substance, and the court was not bound to repeat it in another form. If a person knows the risk he runs, he may be said to know the danger and appreciate the risk.
