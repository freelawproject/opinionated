In an action by A. against B. for goods sold and delivered in pursuance of the contract, which was introduced in evidence, B. offered to prove that, before the contract was drawn up, B.\u2019s president and A.\u2019s agent had a conversation upon the latter\u2019s attempt to sell the former some of the articles, in which the former said that, if the articles would answer a certain purpose, he could use them, but that otherwise he did not want them; that A.\u2019s agent replied that they would be found fit for B.\u2019s use; that tile written contract was then signed ; that the articles were sent, and found upon experiment to be unfit for B.\u2019s use; and that A. was notified of the fact, and the articles were returned to A., who refused to receive them. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence offered was rightly excluded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-7\">Contract, upon an account annexed, for goods sold and delivered in pursuance of a written contract.

Kinnard Company, Manufacturers of Kinnard\u2019s Patent Arm Rests and Ready Levellers for Blank Books, Dayton, Ohio. Order No. . Boston, Mass., Dec. 14, 1889. Sold Messrs.

Terms: five months less ten per cent, and two per cent- additional if paid in ten days, note the Will M. Kinnard Company for and in consideration of five cents to me in hand paid do hereby agree not to sell the Kinnard Patent Arm Rest and Level Boards to any one in the city of Boston, Mass., excepting Messrs.

Kinnard Company not less than fifty pairs of said arm rests and levels each year thereafter. The right is given Messrs. Cutter Tower Company to make such prices and terms on said arm rests and levels as they may deem, proper when bound in books. Will M. Kinnard Company, per H. I. Shenkle, Manager. Accepted. Cutter Tower Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-3\">The execution of the contract was admitted by the defendant, and, it being further admitted by the defendant that goods such as were mentioned in the contract had been delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant, the plaintiff rested its case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\">The defendant then offered to prove that, before the contract was drawn up, the plaintiff\u2019s agent called at the defendant\u2019s place of business, had an interview with the president of the defendant company, and asked him to purchase some of the goods, exhibiting at the same time one of the articles referred to, attached to a large account-book, that being the use to which the articles were designed to be put; that he replied that his company had a patented account-book binding which it was manufacturing and selling, and if the article referred to would go with his binding he thought he could use it, but otherwise it would be of no use to him and he did not want it; that the plaintiff\u2019s agent then said that it would go with that binding and would be found fit for the defendant\u2019s use; that thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s agent produced a printed blank, which he filled out, signed himself, and handed it to the president, who wrote under the word \u201c Accepted,\u201d at the foot of the paper, his company\u2019s name, and delivered it to the agent, this paper being the above contract introduced in evidence; that whether the article was fit for its use the defendant\u2019s president could not ascertain by inspection of the sample shown by the agent, but only by actual experiment by a practical binder, which the president was not; that as soon as possible after the articles arrived it was attempted to adapt them to the. defendant\u2019s use by a practical binder of long experience employed by the defendant for that purpose, but were found by the binder unfit for the defendant\u2019s use; that thereupon the defendant notified the plaintiff of that fact, and that the goods were held subject to its order; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>they were subsequently, and before the bringing of this action, shipped to the plaintiff, but that the plaintiff refused to receive them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-3\">The judge ruled that the testimony offered could not be admitted, because it tended to vary the terms of a written contract, and found for the plaintiff.. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-4\"><em>C. H. Drew, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-5\"><em>W. I. </em>Monroe, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-6\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0o\">We are unable fairly to construe, as a condition precedent to the taking effect of the contract, the talk between the plaintiff\u2019s agent and the defendant\u2019s president. The contract purports on its face to contain the entire agreement between the parties, and to be an absolute one. The evidence offered tended in effect to show that, if the defendant\u2019s president found, on trying the article, that it would not go with their account-book, then the defendant was not to be liable on the contract. Assuming that the talk was not seller\u2019s talk, such an arrangement was executory in its character, and constituted a part of the agreement as made, and should have been embraced in the written contract. To admit evidence of it now would be to vary essentially by oral testimony the written contract. <em>Fitz </em>v. <em>Comey, </em>118 Mass. 100. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Bachelder, </em>120 Mass. 171. <em>Lilienthal </em>v. <em>Suffolk Brewing Co. </em>154 Mass. 185, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
