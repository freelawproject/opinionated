Sts. c. 12, \u00a7 49, real estate which has been sold for taxes may be redeemed, when the person offering to redeem is a mortgagee of record, at any time within two years after he has actual notice of the sale. There are two principal questions in the case: 1st, whether the demandant is to be deemed to be a mortgagee of record; 2dly, whether he offered to redeem within two years after he had actual notice of the tax sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">1. At the time of the tax sales the demandant was mortgagee of record, but the tenant contends that he lost that character by reason of the release to him from the owner of the equity of redemption several months after the last tax sale. Such release did not have the effect to work a merger, and to extinguish his title as mortgagee, he having a clear interest to maintain the same, in view of the intervening tax titles. <em>Loud </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>8 Met. 517. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>1 Allen, 240, 242. <em>New England Jewelry Co. </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>2 Allen, 390. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>127 Mass. 400, 402. <em>Factors &amp; Traders' Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>111 U. S. 738, 744. 2 Washb. Real Prop. (5th ed.) 203-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\"><em>2. </em>The words \u201c actual notice of the sale,\u201d as used in the statute, mean something more than knowledge of such facts as might be sufficient to put one on inquiry. Assuming that actual notice to the demandant\u2019s agent is the same thing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>actual notice to the demandant, the principal fact relied on to show actual knowledge on the part of the agent is the language of the two releases. The first one says, \u201c subject to any unpaid taxes \u201d; the second one says, \u201c subject to any and all unpaid taxes.\u201d These words might be sufficient to put him on inquiry, but they are not equivalent to actual notice of the sales, for taxes. See <em>Lamb </em>v. Pierce, 113 Mass. 72, <em>Parker </em>v. Osgood, 3 Allen, 487, Crocker\u2019s Notes on Pub. Sts. c. 120, \u00a7 4, and cases there cited, for illustrations of the meaning given to the words \u201c actual notice \u201d when referring to unrecorded deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Knowledge that in 1888 the taxes were assessed to Welsh is not equivalent to actual notice that Welsh held under a sale for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">3. The words in the release from the owner of the equity to the demandant, \u201c subject to any and all unpaid taxes, and to a mortgage given to said Keith by one Geo. W. Gay,\u201d do not estop the demandant to deny that he knew of the sales for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
