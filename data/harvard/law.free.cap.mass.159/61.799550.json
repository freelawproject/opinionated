Dill and Lucinda L. Higgins, both of Wellfleet in the county of Barnstable, at Wellfleet in the county of Barnstable on the first day of October in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-six, and on divers other days and times between that day and the day of the finding of this indictment, not being then and on said other days and times there lawfully married to each other, the said Lucinda L. Higgins having then and on said other days and times there a lawful husband alive other than the said Sylvanus S. Dill, did lewdly and lasciviously abide and cohabit each with the other; against the peace of said Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>and contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The case was previously reported in 156 Mass. 226.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">The Superior Court overruled the motion, and the defendants excepted and appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-7\"><em>P. 3. </em>Hutchinson, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-8\"><em>O.

Such a motion for a cause existing before verdict cannot be allowed unless the cause affects the jurisdiction of the court. Pub. Sts. c. 214, \u00a7 27. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brown, 150 Mass. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The only cause alleged in this case is a defect in the indictment. But it is clear that the indictment states a case which is within the jurisdiction of the court. It charges lewd and lascivious cohabitation, and although the word \u201cabide\u201d is used where the statute uses the word \u201c associated,\u201d it contains all the substantive allegations which make up the offence. See Pub. Sts. c. 207, \u00a7 6. Without intimating that there is any such formal defect as could have been availed of if the defendants had taken their objection seasonably by a motion to quash, it is enough to say that the cause stated does not affect the jurisdiction of the court. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
