Because the complaint is defective and bad in its caption and jurat, which are erroneous, and do not contain an averment of the name of the justice of said court, or that the sitting justice presided and sat at the request of said justice in his absence. 2. Because said first count does not allege that said business was unlawful, and does not describe the kind of business, or that it is not a business connected with or a part of the exceptions contained in the St. of 1887, c. 391. 3. Because said first count does not sufficiently describe the business, or where the land was, or what the so called negotiating was. 4. Because said first count is generally insufficient and bad. 5. Because said second count contains no affirmative allegation and averment of the existence of any diversion or entertainment, and no description of the diversion and entertainment, or a reason why the same is not more particularly described and set out. 6. Because it does not appear that said entertainment and diversion was not a concert of sacred music. 7. Because there is no sufficient, or any allegation whatever, that such diversion and entertainment was not duly and legally licensed. 8. Because said complaint does not bear the seal of any court'or authority whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\"><em>Richardson, </em>J. overruled the <em>motion; </em>and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">At the trial, the evidence tended to show that the defendant, on Sunday, July 10, 1892, went from Boston to Lexington, where there was a large tract of land, which he, as agent of the owners, had for sale, in lots; that tickets for rides on the railroad were distributed on that day by the defendant to those who wished to go to Lexington to see the lots; and that there were about seventy-five people on the grounds at Lexington on the day in question, walking about and upon the lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The government introduced evidence tending to show that the defendant had a conversation with one of the witnesses relating to the value, price, size, and location of certain lots; that the defendant exhibited a plan or map of the lots; and that four lots were seen by the witness, and the prices named by the defendant, who told the witness where he could transact the sale, namely, at his office in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">There was no other evidence of any sale or other transactions relating to the sale of land on the day in question, except that the defendant was seen talking with other persons on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">\u201c 1. The negotiating for the sale of certain land, the sale to take place on some other day than the day alleged, to wit, the Lord\u2019s day, is not a violation of the statute. 2. Evidence of conversations in which the parties discussed the sale of certain land and postponing such sale until the Lord\u2019s day was past, is not performing labor, business, or work, in violation of the statute. 3. Showing or displaying property, real or personal, on the Lord\u2019s day, is not in violation of the statute. 4. It is not sufficient to support an allegation of doing business in violation of the statute to prove that the defendant showed and talked about land which he had for sale, but which he refused to sell on the day in question, it being the Lord\u2019s day. 5. Proof of conversations on the Lord\u2019s day about a proposed sale of land at some future time does not support the allegation that the defendant did then and there (to wit, on the Lord\u2019s day) do certain business, to wit, the negotiating of the sale of certain lands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">The judge refused to give the instructions1 requested, and, among other things, instructed the jury as follows: \u201c If the defendant on said Sunday did this negotiating, talking, offering, making terms, showing the property, inducing people to come there, inducing them to buy, and doing those things which you well understand (but all which it might be difficult to state precisely and exactly) to be negotiating a sale, then you could find him guilty. If not, you should acquit him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">Upon the subject matter of the fifth request the judge instructed the jury as follows: \u201cWell,that depends upon what the conversation was. If it was a casual statement, as I have1 said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>before, about the piece of land, its situation, or its price, and that was a mere incident to something else, as a walk or visit there, that is one thing, and possibly, probably, an innocent thing; but if he was out there on this land as a matter of business, showing this land to people who were prospecting, going out for the purpose of meeting them and seeing if they would buy, talking with them about the terms, and the price, and the size of the lots, etc., and had a plan and showed that, \u2014 I do not say that he did any of these things, \u2014but if he did these things as a business, then it is within your power to convict him of the offence of negotiating for the sale of land on the Lord\u2019s day, as charged in this complaint.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-6\"><em>B. Hall B. W. Boding, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-7\"><em>O. N. </em>Harris, Second Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b128-8\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANF\">It was not necessary that the caption or jurat should state the reason for the sitting of the special justice, or that the complaint should bear the seal of the court. The reason was set out in the record, and that was sufficient. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>14 Gray, 14. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>14 Gray, 18. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>151 Mass. 380. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carney, </em>153 Mass. 444. The statute requires that the complainant shall be examined on oath, and that the complaint shall be reduced to writing by the magistrate receiving the same, but does not require that it shall be under seal. Pub. Sts. c. 212, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">It was not necessary to negative, in either count in the complaint, the exceptions contained in the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shannihan, </em>145 Mass. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The offence in the first count was sufficiently set out by describing it as the negotiating for the sale of certain land. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>12 Allen, 187. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shannihan, </em>145 Mass. 99. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>145 Mass. 430. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marzynski, </em>149 Mass. 68. It was unnecessary to describe the situation of the land. The gist of the offence was the business done in negotiating for the sale of the land, wherever situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The fifth, sixth and seventh objections to the sufficiency of the complaint relate to the second count, on which the defendant was acquitted in the district court, and are therefore now immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The instructions requested were properly refused. While they might have been correct if the testimony had tended to show that only the things to which they related had been done, and that those had been done as assumed in the instructions requested, they were inadequate taking the case as a whole, and the testimony as it actually stood, and would have tended to mislead the jury if given as requested. The instructions actually given were correct. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dextra, </em>143 Mass. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
