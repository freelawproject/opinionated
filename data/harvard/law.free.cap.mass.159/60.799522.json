The lien claimed under the statute was for labor and materials furnished in repairing the vessel by the petitioners at her home port. The respondents asked the judge to rule that, inasmuch as this was an action <em>in rem </em>against the tug Glide, the Superior Court had no jurisdiction, the said statute being contrary to the Constitution of the United States, inasmuch as under the Constitution of the United States full admiralty jurisdiction was given to the United States courts; but the judge ruled that the Superior Court had jurisdiction, to which ruling the respondents excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-16\">The judge found for the petitioner, and directed a sale of the tug under the provisions of the statutes; and the respondents alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-17\"><em>R.
