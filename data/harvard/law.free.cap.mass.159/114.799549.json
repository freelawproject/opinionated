He then directed the trustees to sell certain real estate in another State and in B., and also his mill property and manufactories in D.; and authorized them to let for ninety-nine years \u201c all or any of my lands and real estate \u201d in D. The will provided further that, after the payment or security of all legacies and annuities, <em>\u201c </em>and after all the purposes of said trusts,\u201d so far as respected the testator\u2019s family and all annuitants, should have been secured and accomplished, all the residue of his property should be conveyed by the trustees to II. College; that the trustees might convey to the College any surplus of property not needed to pay annuities and to accomplish the other purposes of the trusts; that if, after the death of the testator\u2019s wife, the college should assume and give security, to be approved by the trustees, for the payment of the annuities and legacies, and for the performance of all the other trusts, the trustees were directed to convey in fee simple to the College all the trust property for the uses declared in the will; and that all the property so conveyed to the College should be held for the purposes designated, upon the trust and confidence that it would \u201c manage and invest the same to the best advantage,\u201d and retain the estate on which the testator then lived for certain reasons therein expressed. By a codicil to his will, the testator empowered the trustees to sell some of the real estate in B. which was included in that ordered in the will to be \u201c reserved for the purposes of this will.\u201d All the property which, by the terms of the will, was to come to the College was conveyed to it, and all the trusts for the benefit of individuals were performed or satisfied. The College executed an agreement to sell to a third person a tract of land in D., which was a part of the real estate there owned by the testator at the date of his will and at his death. <em>Held, </em>that the College could maintain an action for a breach of the agreement.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">Contract for the breach of a written agreement, executed on November 12, 1892, by the terms of which the plaintiff agreed to sell and convey to the defendant, \u201c by a good and sufficient title,\u201d a certain tract of land in Dedham, \u201cformerly belonging to Benjamin Bussey,\u201d and the defendant agreed \u201c to take the same, and to pay therefor \u201d a certain sum, \u201c provided a good title can be conveyed.\u201d The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court, on appeal, upon agreed facts, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">A deed of the land was duly tendered by the plaintiff to the defendant, who refused to accept it, on the ground of an alleged want of power in the plaintiff to convey a title free of the trusts created by the will of Benjamin Bussey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">By his will, Bussey devised to trustees all his property, \u201c excepting what is herein specifically devised and appropriated.\u201d He also gave various annuities to relatives, and then, after expressing the opinion that real estate in Boston and its vicinity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>was the safest property from which \u201c to raise a permanent fund for the accomplishment of the purpose of my will,\u201d he directed that certain real estate, including \u201c all my real estate in Dedham,\u201d excepting certain property used for mills and manufaetories, \u201c be not sold or alienated, but reserved for the purposes of this will \u201d; and certain provisions for his family followed. He then directed the trustees to sell certain real estate in the State of Maine and in Boston, and also his mill property and manufactories in Dedham; and authorized them to let, but not for a longer term than ninety-nine years, \u201call or any of my lands and real estate situate in said Dedham.\u201d The will provided further, that, after the payment or security of all legacies and annuities, \u201c and after all the purposes of said trusts,\u201d so far as respected the testator\u2019s family and all annuitants, should have been secured and accomplished, all the residue of his property, with the proceeds and accumulations thereof, should be conveyed by the trustees to the President and Fellows of Harvard College; that the trustees might pay and convey any surplus of property not needed to pay annuities and to accomplish the other purposes of the trusts to the President and Fellows of Harvard College ; that if that corporation should, after the death of the testator\u2019s wife, assume and give security, to be approved by the trustees, for the payment of the annuities and legacies, and for the performance of all the other trusts, the trustees were \u201c directed to pay over, transfer, and convey in fee simple to said President and Fellows of Harvard College, by good and sufficient conveyances, all the trust estates, real and personal, hereby conveyed to them, or remaining in their hands, to and for the uses and purposes hereinafter declared\u201d; that \u201call the real and personal property and estate so conveyed, transferred, and delivered to the President and Fellows of Harvard College shall stand charged and chargeable with the said annuities and payments, if not paid or provided for, and shall be taken and held by said President and Fellows of Harvard College as a permanent public corporate body specially charged with the care and superintendence of the higher branches of education, upon the trust and confidence that they will manage and invest the same to the best advantage; that they will retain the estate on which I now live, in said Roxbury,\u201d for certain reasons therein ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>pressed; and that the trustees should purchase two certain tracts of land, which should \u201c be subject to the same trust, limitations, and provisions \u201d as were expressed in the will concerning his estate in Roxbury, above mentioned. By a third codicil to his will, the testator empowered the trustees to sell some of the real estate in Boston, which was included in that ordered in the will to be \u201c reserved for the purposes of this will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">The land in question was a part of the real estate in Dedham of which Bussey died seised, and was seised at the date of his will, and which he directed should not be sold or alienated, but reserved for the purposes of his will. All the property which, by the terms of the will, was ultimately to come to the plaintiff, has been duly conveyed to the plaintiff, in pursuance of the directions of the will, and is now held by the plaintiff upon the charitable trusts upon which it was ultimately to be held, as set forth in the will, all the trusts for the benefits of individuals having been performed or otherwise satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">If, by the true construction of the will, the land in question cannot be sold or alienated by the plaintiff, judgment was to be entered for the defendant; otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-7\"><em>Gr. </em>Putnam, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-8\">No counsel appeared for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-9\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATR\">The direction in Mr. Bussey\u2019s will that certain real estate, including that in question, \u201c be not sold or alienated, but reserved for the purposes of this will,\u201d is inserted in the midst of the provisions for his family and for annuitants, which are to be made or secured before the final transfer to Harvard College. It is surrounded by other directions addressed in terms to the trustees who hold only until that transfer. The reason expressed for the direction is the testator\u2019s opinion that such real estate is the safest property from which <em>\u201c </em>to raise a permanent fund for the accomplishment of the purposes of my will.\u201d The trustees are authorized to let the land in question for a term not longer than ninety-nine years, but no similar power is given to Haaward College when the land comes to its hands. In the third codicil the trustees are empowered to sell some of the land ordered by the will to be reserved ; but no similar power is given to the College. In the gift to the College certain land is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>given upon the trust that the College will retain the same, for reasons expressed in the will, but no such trust is expressed with regard to the land in question. The foregoing considerations seem to us sufficient to show that the testator did not intend or attempt to make the land in question inalienable when it reached Harvard College; and that the first words of the trust imposed upon it, \u201c to manage and invest the same to the best advantage,\u201d carry a power to sell. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v.
