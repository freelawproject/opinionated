Sts. c. 57, \u00a7 5, charging the defendant with having in his possession, with intent to sell, milk to which a foreign substance had been added, was heard on an \u201c agreed statement of facts,\u201d which was not a case stated in writing and filed, but an admission of facts from which the jury were at liberty to draw inferences. <em>Held, </em>that the jury might infer the offence charged from a sale by the defendant from his restaurant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-10\">Complaint, under Pub. Sts. c. 57, \u00a7 5, charging the defendant with having in his possession, with intent to sell the same, milk to which boracic acid had been added.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-11\">The case was submitted to the jury on an \u201c agreed statement of facts,\u201d which admitted that the defendant sold a half-pint of adulterated cream. The defendant contended that the admitted sale was not evidence of possession with intent to sell, and that the complaint charging possession of milk was not sustained by proof of possession of cream. <em>Thompson, </em>J., instructed the jury that upon the agreed facts they would be warranted in finding the defendant guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-12\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-13\"><em>F. 6r. Holcombe, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-14\"><em>O. H. Harris, </em>Second Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b32-15\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV3\">The word \u201c milk,\u201d in Pub. Sts. c. 57, \u201c Of the inspection and sale of milk,\u201d is shown by \u00a7 7 to include milk from which no part of the cream has been removed, and we are of opinion that it is used as a general name and in a sense broad enough to include cream. The offence under \u00a7 5, of having in one\u2019s possession, with intent to sell, milk to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>a foreign substance has been added, is committed by having, with that intent, cream to which boracic acid has been added. This was the only point argued for the defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">We understand that the so called agreed statement of facts was not a case stated in writing and filed, but simply an admission of facts from which the jury were at liberty to draw inferences without encountering <em>Old Colony Railroad </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>137 Mass. 536, 538. This being so, they might infer the offence charged from the sale by the defendant from his restaurant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Tobias, 141 Mass. 129, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
