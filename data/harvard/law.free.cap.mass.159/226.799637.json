J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8RW\">A bequest for the use and benefit of disabled soldiers and seamen who served in the Union army in the late war of the Rebellion in the United States, their widows and orphans, is a good public charitable bequest. Maimed soldiers and .mariners, as well as orphans, are expressly mentioned in St. 43 Eliz. c. 4; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>14 Allen, 539; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>3 Mer. 48; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Corby, </em>27 Beav. 649; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Comber, </em>2 Sim. <em>&amp; </em>Stu. 93; 2 Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">The persons described in the bequest are in most, if not all respects the same as those entitled to receive pensions under the laws of the United States at the time when the will was executed and at the time when the testator died. U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7\u00a7 4692, 4693, 4702-4706. It is contended that the bequest is void, because it is dependent upon the contents of books of account of the testator, which were not in existence when the will was made. The direction is, that, \u201c in ease at my decease my books of account shall not show that I have given said sum of five hundred dollars annually for said purpose,\u201d then the executors shall pay over \u201c such sums of money as will make up in full to the time of my decease said annual amount of five hundred dollars per annum,\u201d etc. See <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>9 Allen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>283, 292; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Seaman's Friend Society, </em>130 Mass. 91; <em>Olliffe v. Wells, </em>130 Mass. 221. We think that the construction of this article of the will is, that the executors are to pay the amount specified unless it appears by his books of account that the testator has paid it in his lifetime. As thus construed, it is a valid disposition of property by a will duly executed. See <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Cordis, </em>5 Gray, 341; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Bramhall, </em>120 Mass. 552; <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>16 N. Y. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">All the parties who have argued the case agree that for the last year the amount should be apportioned, as the testator lived eight months of that year. Either this is true, or nothing should be paid for that year. As the payments are to be made \u201c in full to the time of my decease,\u201d a proportional payment for that year is perhaps what the testator intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">It must be left for a single justice to determine to whom the money shall be paid, and in what way the gift can be made effectual. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
