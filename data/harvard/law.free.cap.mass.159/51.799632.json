The following is a copy of the agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-13\">\u201c Boston, May 16, 1889. Received of Alfred A. Marcus <em>&amp; </em>Son a note of H. S. Shepard amounting to $1,750, payable six months from May 1, 1889; when the note is paid, I agree to convey to Alfred A. Marcus <em>&amp; </em>Son a certain lot of land on Strawberry Hill, about sixty thousand feet, the same as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>conveyed, to me by the trustee of the Nantasket Land Company, for what I paid six thousand dollars. Land to be conveyed to said Marcus subject to first mortgage, $3,750 ; when note is paid, credit to be given of $1,075. J. W. Skillings. Alfred A. Marcus &amp; Son.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">The defendants introduced evidence tending to show that one of the defendants went to the office of the plaintiff with the note in suit, and borrowed from the plaintiff on the note the sum of $675; that he did not sell the note to the plaintiff; that the $675 was a loan to the defendant; that the agreement annexed was made contemporaneously with the loaning of the $675 and as part of the same transaction; and that Skillings afterwards proved the note in composition proceedings against Shepard, and assented to the same and to his discharge, and Shepard received his discharge, May 7,1890. The defendants on the above evidence requested the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">\u201c 1. Upon the evidence, it was a question for the jury to say whether the plaintiff purchased the note outright for $675, or whether he simply loaned and the defendants borrowed $675 on the note, and that if the plaintiff did not purchase outright the note, but only loaned $675 on the note (if he was entitled to recover at all), then he could recover only the $675 and interest, less the amount received from Shepard. 2. The plaintiff having proved his claim against the maker of the note in suit in the composition proceedings of the maker, and assented to his discharge, he (the plaintiff) thereby released the maker of the note, and the indorsers on the note were discharged. 3. The plaintiff having assented to the discharge of the maker of the note in composition insolvency, the indorsers are released. 4. If a creditor holding a note like the one in suit proves' the note against the maker, and assents to the composition offer and discharge of the maker in composition insolvency under our statutes, the indorsers are thereby released by the act of the plaintiff or creditor, and the plaintiff or creditor cannot recover against the indorser. 5. The release of the maker of the note in suit by the plaintiff would discharge the indorsers (the defendants here). 6. The signing of the assent to the composition offer and discharge of the maker of the note in suit, by the plaintiff, is such an act as discharges the defendants in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>action. 7. The Pub. Sts. c. 157, \u00a7 85, do not apply in composition proceedings under the statutes of 1884 and 1885, and therefore do not apply to the case at bar. 8. Upon all the evidence, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">The chief justice refused so to rule, and ruled that there was no evidence for the jury, and that the only question for the jury was to find the difference between the face of the note and interest, and the amount received from Shepard, and that for that difference the plaintiff was entitled to recover; and thereupon directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the face of said note and interest, less the amount received from Shepard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-7\">The case was submitted on briefs to all the judges.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-8\"><em>O.

So far as the oral evidence was concerned, it was clearly a question for the jury. The ruling, therefore, must have been on the ground that the written agreement showed conclusively that the plaintiff took the note by purchase. We are unable to see that it has this conclusive effect. The plaintiff paid to the defendants $675, and took from them Shepard\u2019s note for $1,750. Upon this note Shepard was primarily responsible, and the defendants were indorsers and responsible secondarily. It was for the interest of the defendants that the money should be collected from Shepard. If the note should be paid by Shepard, the plaintiff would have in his hands $1,075 more than his payment to the defendants. Under this state of things the written agreement was executed. It may be assumed to have been so nearly contemporaneous with the transfer of the note as to be part of the transaction. Now we have to consider whether this agreement necessarily implies that the plaintiff took the note by purchase, so as to be absolute owner, rather than as collateral. The words near the beginning of the agreement, \u201c when the note is paid, I agree to convey to Alfred A. Marcus <em>&amp; </em>Son,\u201d etc., may naturally refer to a payment by Shepard, the maker, and do not necessarily imply a duty on the part of the indorsers to pay it in full. So the words at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>end of the agreement, \u201c when note is paid, credit to be given of $1,075,\u201d may reasonably be held to mean \u201c when note is paid by Shepard, credit to be given to Marcus &amp; Son of $1,075.\u201d Payment by Shepard is consistent with the words and meaning. Since the plaintiff held the note, if Shepard wished to pay it in full he would make the payment to the plaintiff. Moreover, there are no words showing that the defendants agree to purchase the land on the terms specified. The agreement is solely on the part of the plaintiff. The signature of the defendants does not bind them to make a purchase any more than if it were a bond for a deed to which the obligee should add his signature. The court cannot put words into the agreement which are not there, for the purpose of binding the defendants to make the purchase, unless it is certain from the context that such words were omitted by mistake. It might well be that the plaintiff intended merely to give to the defendants an option. There is nothing to show that the defendants had ever seen or heard of the land before, or that they had any intention of binding themselves to purchase it. In order to bind them, not only is their signature necessary, but also apt words are necessary to show the obligation into which they entered. But even if their signature could be construed so as to import a contract to make the purchase, certainly it can bind them to no more than to make such purchase under the condition expressed in the writing. That condition is, \u201c when the note is paid.\u201d The defendants might be willing to agree to take a conveyance of the land provided the note should be paid by Shepard, but not willing to. do so if they would have to raise the money themselves to pay for it. The- note was not paid by Shepard. On the contrary, he went into insolvency, and the plaintiff received only fifteen per cent thereon. The defendants are not bound to raise money from their own means to pay $1,075 for the equity of redemption of the land. The plaintiff cannot compel the defendants to pa)r the note, in order to put himself in a position where he will be bound to. make the conveyance, and the defendants bound to accept it. In any view which can be taken of the written agreement, in the opinion of a majority of the court, it is not inconsistent with the defendants\u2019 contention that the note was taken by the plaintiff as collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>If so taken as collateral, the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover upon it is limited to the balance due to him upon his loan of $675 to them. <em>Third National Bank </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, </em>122 Mass. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The discharge of Shepard under the composition proceedings, though assented to by the plaintiff, does not cut off the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendants as indorsers.
