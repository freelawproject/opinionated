Sts. c. 209, \u00a7 1. While the indictment follows the language of the statute, yet, as it charges a specific act, this is not enough. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The defendant is entitled to have the offence set out with the usual precision and certainty. The name of the person to whom the suit of clothing was disposed of should be alleged, or, if he is unknown, this fact should be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">This has been held to be the rule in regard to an illegal sale of liquor. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurlow, </em>24 Pick. 374, 379. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Kimball, 7 Met. 304, 308. And in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>11 Cush. 600, it was held that an indictment for letting a tenement to be used for purposes of prostitution must state the name of the person to whom the tenement was let, or that such person was to the jurors unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>2 Gray, 69, on which the government relies, the offence charged was the setting up of a lottery. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>13 Allen, 534; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>146 Mass. 142. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brockway, </em>150 Mass. 322, no objection was made to the form of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">For the reasons above stated, we are of opinion that the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
