We are of opinion that he has no such right. The ownership of the land under a party wall remains in the several owners, subject to the easement of supporting the building upon each lot by means of the common wall. This easement is limited to what is necessary for that purpose. The maintenance of windows by one owner against the objection of the other is inconsistent with the title and rights of the latter. By usage the words \u201c party wall \u201d and \u201cpartition wall\u201d have come to mean a solid wall. Various reasons of inconvenience or peril have been assigned for the doe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>trine, but they are all referable, we think, to the general doctrine that the easement is only a limited one, and it is not to be extended so as to include rights and privileges not belonging to the character of a wall which is to be owned in common, and in which the rights of each owner are equal. This question has not heretofore been determined in this State, though other questions relating to party walls have arisen. <em>Vinton </em>v. Greene, 158 Mass. 426. <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>149 Mass. 588. <em>Matthews </em>v. Dixey, 149 Mass. 595. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>130 Mass. 317. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Bordman, </em>4 Allen, 147. The decisions in these cases are not directly applicable; but in other States the almost uniform current of decision has been against the right to leave such openings in party walls. <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>15 N. Y. 601, 614. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>50 N. Y. 639. <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>59 How.
