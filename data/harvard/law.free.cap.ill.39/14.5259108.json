In a suit by parties against the sureties of their guardian, who has died, for a discovery and an account of moneys which came to the hands of the guardian, belonging to the wards, where the charge is of maladministration of the estate of the complainants while infants, a court of equity has jurisdiction to inquire into it, and correct the errors, the more especially, when it is alleged the proceedings by the guardian were in fraud of the rights of his wards.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ae\" pgmap=\"14\">2.

But where the rights of parties not before the court, are intimately connected with the matter in dispute, so that a final decree cannot be made without materially affecting their interests, as would be the case with the personal representatives of the deceased sureties of a guardian in a suit against the surviving sureties for an account, the objection may be taken at the hearing, or on appeal, or on error.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b15-7\" pgmap=\"15\">6.

Rotan, Byron Rotan, Susan Jane and Haney Rotan, his children. The widow, Cynthia, married Willis Smith, and he was afterward appointed guardian of these children, who were all in their minority, executing bond, with several sureties, two of whom subsequently died.

The bill pretends to seek discovery of the sureties, but expressly waives their oaths. A bill of discovery must ask an answer under oath. Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., \u00a7 311. If discovery is asked and fails, the bill ought to be dismissed. 1 Gilm. 210.

Relief is asked in equity in this case on the ground that the guardian committed fraud in making settlement with the Probate Court, bio evidence of fraud is shown by appellee, and if it be held that the guardian committed fraud there is none proven against these defendants. Fraud must be proven. The court cannot infer it. Wright v. Grover, 27 Ill. 430. To constitute fraud there must be an intention to deceive. 1 Scam. 500.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\" pgmap=\"17\">4. Bill does not allege fraud against defendants. To give the court jurisdiction over them on the ground of fraud they must be alleged to have participated in it.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-7\" pgmap=\"17\">5. The court erred in rendering decree for complainants for Susan Jane Rotan\u2019s interest in the fund, of which she died seized. Her administrator should have been a party to the bill. Personal assets do not vest immediately in the heir, but they do vest in the executor or administrator. 2 Blackstone, p. 420 and note 38 ; Williams on Executors, note 527.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\" pgmap=\"17\">The administrator of Susan Rotan was a necessary party to the bill.

Jur. chap. 9; Williams on Exrs. pp. 1239, 1240; 2 Story Eq. p. 35; Cowls v. Cowls, 3 Gilm. 435; Grattan v. Grattan, 18 Ill. 171.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-6\" pgmap=\"18\">In cases of fraud, courts of chancery have always jurisdiction (Truett v. Wainwright, 4 Gilm. 418), and from the settlement of the guardian as it was made by him, it is plain it was a legal fraud, whether we insisted upon it or not in the final decree.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-7\" pgmap=\"18\">The law does not favor a multiplicity of suits, and if it is the object of a bill in chancery to prevent this by having the rights of the party at once adjusted and determined by a court of equity, instead of suffering the parties to be harassed by a number of separate suits, chancery would assume jurisdiction. Mitford\u2019s Eq. Pl. 145, marg. p.</p> <opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b18-8\" pgmap=\"18\">Mr. Justice Bbeese</author> <p id=\"Am\" pgmap=\"18\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b18-9\" pgmap=\"18(171) 19(66)\">John M. Rotan died in 1837, leaving a widow, Cynthia, and four children, namely: John M. Rotan, Byron Rotan, Susan Jane and Nancy Rotan, all under age at that time. Their mother, Cynthia, married Willis Smith, and in 1847 he was appointed guardian of these children, and executed a bond with John Lynch, Charles M. Smith, Samuel Craig, Solomon Smith and John Hammers, securities, in the sum of twelve hundred dollars. Money belonging to these children came to the hands of Willis Smith as their guardian, amounting to four hundred and fifty-eight dollars and thirty cents. The guardian removed to Missouri with the children, and died there in 1850. In January, 1848, he made a settlement with the Probate Court of Marion county, in which he had allowances made him, and a balance appeared against him as guardian of about.three hundred and forty-four dollars. He left no property in this State, and made no other settlement. Susan Jane Rotan died in 1854, before she arrived at full age, unmarried and without descendants. Of the sureties in the bond, Samuel Craig and John Hammers were dead. The bill was filed against the surviving sureties for a discovery and an account, and to relieve against the settlement made by Willis Smith with the Probate Court, on the allegation that fraudulent claims were allowed thereat, and the prayer is for a decree for the amounts respectively due complainants.</p> <p id=\"b19-6\" pgmap=\"19\">The court, on the hearing, decreed in favor of the complainants, the sum of five hundred and ninety-seven dollars. From this decree the sureties prosecute this writ of error. \u2022</p> <p id=\"b19-7\" pgmap=\"19\">Two principal errors are relied on, one going to the jurisdiction of the court and the other as to the parties.</p> <p id=\"b19-8\" pgmap=\"19\">Upon the first point, we are satisfied the bill will he for the purposes sought by it. It was said by this court, in the case of Grattan v. Grattan, 18 Ill. 171, that courts of equity have a. paramount jurisdiction in cases of administration and the settlement of estates, and may control courts of law in their action in the settlement and distribution of estates, and refer to 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. chap. 9, and Williams on Exrs. 1239, 1240. And it was also held that they had a similar and plenary jurisdiction over the persons and estates of infants, and would, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, cause to be done whatever might be necessary to preserve their estates, referring to 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. chap. 35, and Cowls v. Cowls, 3 Gilm. 435.</p> <p id=\"b19-9\" pgmap=\"19\">When the charge is, as in this bill, of a maladministration of the estate of these complainants when infants, a court of equity ought to have jurisdiction to inquire into it, and correct the errors, the more especially when it is alleged the proceedings by the guardian were in fraud of the rights of his wards.</p> <p id=\"b19-10\" pgmap=\"19\">The objection as to the parties, the omission to make the personal representatives of the deceased sureties, Craig and Hammers, parties defendant to the bill, is well taken.</p> <p id=\"b19-11\" pgmap=\"19(58) 20(125)\">In the case of the People for the use, etc. v. Lott and others, 27 Ill. 223, which was a bill filed by the distributees of the estate of P. Jarboe deceased, against the surviving administrator of the estate, the objection was made that the biE was defective for the want of proper parties. The representatives of the deceased sureties, having been omitted, as in this case, it was held that it was defective for that reason. We said the representatives of the deceased sureties have a direct interest in being heard in the adjustment of the administrator\u2019s accounts, as they would be liable to contribute in their representative character, for their proportion of any sum found remaining in the hands of the administrators, or misapplied or wasted by them. With only a portion of the parties to the bond or their representatives before the court, a decree doing foil and complete justice to the several parties could not be rendered. The same rule must apply to the sureties on a guardian\u2019s bond and their representatives, and for the same reasons.</p> <p id=\"b20-6\" pgmap=\"20\">This objection is in time, under the authority of the case of Prentice v. Kimball, 19 Ill. 322. There it was held, that it was the usual and better practice, where the want of proper-parties is apparent on the face of the bill, to take advantage of it by demurrer or motion to dismiss, or, if not patent, by plea or answer. Where the parties omitted are mere formal parties and not indispensable to a decision of the case upon its merits, it will be too late to make the objection at the hearing, but where the rights of parties not before the court are intimately connected with the matter in dispute, so that a final decree cannot be made without materially affecting their interests, the objection may be taken at the hearing, or on appeal or on error.</p> <p id=\"b20-7\" pgmap=\"20\">On the other point, we do not consider it was-necessary to take out letters of administration on the estate of Susan Jane Rotan, as she died in her minority at an age incapable in law of contracting debts, and her share, on her death, vested immediately in her next of kin entitled thereto. Cross v. Carey, 25 Ill. 564; Riley v. Loughrey, 22 id. 97.</p> <p id=\"b20-8\" pgmap=\"20(66) 21(88)\">As to the fraud charged in the settlement by Willis Smith with the court of probate, we see nothing in the record justifying the charge. There is nothing apparent there to destroy its credit. The sum of one hundred and five dollars alleged to have been chargeable against one of the heirs only, may have been chargeable against the entire fund. This was a question for that court. If the settlement with that court was fair, and we see nothing to impeach it, it cannot be overhauled here in the absence of any proof of fraud. The court had competent jurisdiction of the subject, and of the person, and however erroneous its decisions may be, they must stand until reversed by a superior court. We do not find in the record any data, by which we can adjust the accounts and claims set up, but must leave the adjustment to the parties themselves.</p> <p id=\"b21-6\" pgmap=\"21\">For the want of proper parties the decree is reversed, and the cause remanded with leave so to amend the bill as to make the representatives of the deceased sureties parties.</p> <p id=\"b21-7\" pgmap=\"21\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
