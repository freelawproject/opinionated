C. P., the affiant to the complaint must state, in addition to his having good reason to believe, that he does believe that the alleged offense has been committed. Bell v. State, 240 S.W. (2d) 302; Cook v. State, 137 Tex. Crim. Rep. 492, 132 S.W. 2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The complaint being fatally defective, the judgment is reversed and prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b286-11\">on state\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b286-12\">BEAUCHAMP, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">Since the original opinion in this case was announced supplemental transcript has been filed curing the defect pointed out as ground for dismissing the prosecution. In view of this, the state\u2019s motion for rehearing is granted and the case will now be considered on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">The evidence shows that three representatives of the Texas Liquor Control Board, together with officers of the city of Lubbock and Lubbock County, went to the home of appellant on the 10th day of October, 1950, armed with a search warrant, As the fruits of their search they recovered fourteen pints of intoxicating liquor. Appellant was present, admitted that it was his residence and declared that he had other whisky which they had not found. This summarizes the material evidence in the case and supports the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The record contains two lengthy bills of exception. The first one complains of Section 2 of the court\u2019s charge, as being on the burden of proof. Objection is made that this was on the weight of the evidence. In addition, the bill shows that appellant presented a special requested charge on this subject which the court refused to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">We find no fault with the charge as given by the court, and it, thereby, became unnecessary to give the requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Apparently Bill of Exception No. 2 is directed to the sufficiency of the evidence. It is contended that there was present other than the appellant, one lady; that the closet where the whisky was found is not sufficiently described in that there is no showing as to whether or not there were any clothes in the closet or the suitcase, nor whether such clothes, if any, were men\u2019s clothes or women\u2019s clothes; no showing as to who owned the house, who paid the utility bills or the phone bills, if any; no showing as to who had placed the whisky in the closet or when it was placed there; and no showing as to who owned or possessed the whisky, \u201c* * * except as herein shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The bill seems to complain, further, that the court refused to give requested charge on circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">If this bill should be considered in compliance with law, the court destroys the effect of it by his qualification. The record of the case substantiates that qualification and the bill does not show error.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Finding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b287-10\">MORRISON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Appellant complains of our disposition of his Bill of Exception No. 2 in which he sought to have this court review the failure of the trial court to charge on circumstantial evidence. Upon re-examination of the bill and appellant\u2019s objections to the court\u2019s charge, it is apparent that appellant did not bring himself within the rule in misdemeanor cases. In such cases it is obligatory that appellant do three things:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">(1) Object to the court\u2019s charge,</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>(2) Except to the overruling of his objection, and</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">(3) Submit a requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We find no objection to the court\u2019s charge on such grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In his Bill of Exception No. 1 appellant complains of the use of the phrase \u201csuch facts\u201d in the court\u2019s charge on the burden of proof. He forcefully contends that such charge is on the weight of the evidence. The complained of portion thereof is set forth in our opinion in Booker v. State, #25,327, (page 325 of this volume), 242 S.W. 2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We do not encourage trial courts to vary from time-honored charges, but the fact that they sometimes do, does not necessarily constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We have heretofore commended counsel for appellant on the form of their bills of exception. We now applaud the fearless and logical manner in which they prepare their briefs. This court is always ready to re-examine its decisions and appreciates our attention being called to any oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Finding no reversible error, appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
