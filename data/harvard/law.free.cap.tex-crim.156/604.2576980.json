As to what then happened, we quote from the direct testimony of Agent Backues as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">\u201cWhen I went up to the door of John Earl Huskey\u2019s residence in Sweetwater, Nolan County, Texas, his brother, Len Huskey, was there. I told Len Huskey, \u2018Len, I don\u2019t have a search warrant.\u2019 He told us that we didn\u2019t have to have a search warrant, to come on in and search the premises. Mrs. Huskey was in the front room after going through a little hall intrance way, she was there. We went on in the house and saw the whiskey and beer but we didn\u2019t carry anything out and then John Earl Hus-key drove up and came in. I told John Earl we didn\u2019t have a search warrant but Len said we could search it. John Earl said you didn\u2019t have to have a search warrant any time to search his place. We picked up three pints of whiskey, nine pints of gin mixed up, and 268 twelve ounce cans of beer. I was going to file on Len but John said, \u2018No, it\u2019s my stuff and my place. Just file on me and I will take the consequences of it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">It is insisted that the testimony as to the finding of the liquor was inadmissible because of an illegal search, and that Len Huskey was without authority to waive warrant for the search of appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">It was not necessary to determine this question, because appellant\u2019s admission of the ownership and possession of the liquor rendered untenable any objection to the search which did nothing -more than establish possession of the liquor in appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Other bills of exception appearing have been examined and are overruled without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
