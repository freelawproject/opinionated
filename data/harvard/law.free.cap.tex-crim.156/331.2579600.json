The state then introduced a statement made by her to the grand jury wherein she swore to an adulterous relationship with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The statement made to the grand jury was hearsay and was not competent evidence to establish the facts therein stated. See Branch\u2019s Crim. Law, Sec. 866, p. 548; Rice v. State, 135 Tex. Cr. R. 390, 120 S.W.
