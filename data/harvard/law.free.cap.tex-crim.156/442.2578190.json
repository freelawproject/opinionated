Correction has now been made and the appeal is considered on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">It will be necessary to discuss only one of the errors pointed out by the appeal. The indictment alleges the injured party to be the \u201cFarmers and Merchants Bank of Shamrock, Texas.\u201d There is no allegation that it is a corporation. The proof shows that the injured party is an incorporated bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">There is a further variance between the allegation and the proof in that the evidence introduced by the state shows the name of the bank to be \u201cFarmers and Merchants State Bank of Shamrock. Texas.\u201d Williams v. State, 118 Texas Cr. R. 386 39 S.W. 2d 79: Reese v. State, 119 Tex. Cr. R. 582. 44 S.W. 2d 679; and Nichols v. State, 136 Tex. Cr.
