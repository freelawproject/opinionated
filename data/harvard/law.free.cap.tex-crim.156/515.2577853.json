T. Dulaney, the injured party, was ransacked and some $300 in money, a watch, and some jewelry were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Appellant was a former police officer of the city of San Antonio, and his fingerprints were on file there. Prints taken from the burglarized premises were found to be the prints of appellant, and, following his arrest, he confessed to the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">' Appellant urges that the evidence is insufficient to show that the offense was committed in the nighttime as alleged in the count of the indictment submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">The injured party testified, without objection, \u201cthis place was broken into in the nighttime.\u201d Appellant, in his confession, said that he and his companion committed the offense at about 1 o\u2019clock A.M. We therefore overrule appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">We also overrule appellant\u2019s Bill of Exception No. 3 wherein he questions the admissibility of the confession because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>arrested without warrant and was not taken before a magistrate. The question here raised was decided adversely to appellant\u2019s contention in Dimery v. State, (Page 197 of this volume), 240 S.W. (2d) 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The remaining bill complains that the indictment should have alleged the manner in which the burglary was committed in the disjunctive, that is, \u201cby force, threats or fraud\u201d rather than the allegations made in the indictment that the entry was made \u201cby force, threats and fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Such allegations were properly made in the conjunctive. See Branch\u2019s Ann. P.C. page 258, Sec. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">No error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"b535-9\">MORRISON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Appellant complains because in our original opinion we referred to appellant\u2019s confession as evidence that the burglary had been committed at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Appellant\u2019s contention seems to be that, since another trial court in another case had held the confession of appellant inadmissible, it became thereafter inadmissible in all courts. It is rudimentary that courts are not bound by the decisions of other courts of equal jurisdiction. The power to establish precedent is lodged in courts of superior jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">In the case at bar, the jury evidently found appellant\u2019s confession to have been voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Appellant further complains because our original opinion was predicated upon Dimery v. State (Page 197 of this volume), 240 S. W. (2d) 293, which case, he says, is not based upon sound principles of law. Since the opinion of this court in the Dimery case, the rule there announced has been approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in Gallegos vs. Nebraska. (72 S. Ct. 141.) Therein, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a confesison is not vitiated alone because of the failure to take the accused before a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
