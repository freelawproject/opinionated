No doubt exists as to the correctness of the proposition. An appeal does not lie from a judgment of contempt. Crow v. State, 24 Texas 12; Ex Parte Kilgore, 3 Tex App. 249; Carter v. State, 4 Texas App. 165; Borrer v. State, (Texas Crim. App.), 63 S.W. 630; Borrer v. State, (Texas Crim. App.), 63 S.W. 1133; Long v. State, 82 Texas Crim.
