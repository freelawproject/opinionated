He contends that it is within the discretion of this court, under such facts, to reverse the case on the theory that appellant has been deprived of a statement of facts without fault or negligence on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">If we should agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the delay in filing the statement of facts and bill of exception was not due to fault or laches of himself or his attorney, but was the result of causes beyond his control, this court would be authorized to consider the statement of facts as though filed in time. See Bailey v. State, 149 Tex. Cr. R. 429, 195 S.W. 2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The bill of exception is directed to a remark of the county attorney in his closing argument and is insufficient in that it fails to show that the argument, if in fact erroneous, was not made in reply to argument of appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">There are no objections or exceptions to the court\u2019s charge, and the requested charges were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The evidence shows the sale of whiskey to the complaining witness in the county shown by the proof to be dry.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">If the statement of facts and bill of exception are entitled to consideration, they show no error and the judgment must be affirmed. If not considered, the same result must follow. In neither case would we be justified in reversing the judgment upon the theory advanced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
