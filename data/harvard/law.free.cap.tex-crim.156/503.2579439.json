Appellant has filed a reply to the state\u2019s motion, in which he explains his delay by saying that he thought the rule for filing briefs in bond forfeiture cases was the same as in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Article 864, Code of Criminal Procedure, provides for appeals in bond forfeiture cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Article 866, Code of Criminal Procedure, provides that in such cases the proceedings shall be regulated by the same rules that govern civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">In compliance with the above rules and our holdings in Taylor v. State, 152 Tex. Cr. R. 625, 216 S. W. (2d) 206, the state\u2019s motion is granted, and the appeals are dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
