It was then refused as incorrect and the court filed his own bill. The court\u2019s bill was likewise filed on April 23, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The bill of exception, not having been filed within the time allowed by the court\u2019s order, cannot be considered. See Huber v. State, 151 Tex.Cr.R. 306, 207 S.W. 2d 383; Muniz v. State, 145 Tex.Cr.R. 565, 170 S.W. 2d 767; and Wilson v. State, 98 Tex.Cr.R. 319, 265 S.W. 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">However, we have examined the court\u2019s bill and it shows no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"b406-11\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Appellant insists that the bill of exception prepared by the trial court reflects error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">From this bill of exception it appears that the appellant sought, upon cross-examination of the injured party, to show 'that he had at one time been charged in a justice court with felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">The trial court certifies that the complaint was dismissed for the want of sufficient evidence, and the charge was never presented to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">The charge, having been dismissed in the justice court and not having resulted in an indictment, was not the subject of proof, even for impeachment purposes. 45 Tex. Jur., Witnesses, Sec. 246, p. 108; Norton v. State, 120 Tex. Cr. R. 557, 47 S. W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>2d 610; Brown v. State, 105 Tex. Cr.

W. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The action of the trial court in sustaining the state\u2019s objection to proof of such fact was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
