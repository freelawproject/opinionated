See Art. 137, C.C.P.; Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>v. State, 40 Tex. Cr. R. 562; Ex Parte Tittle, 37 Tex. Cr. R. 597; 40 S.W. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The facts further support the trial court\u2019s finding that the treatment prescribed by relator\u2019s private physician, both medicines and diet, could be received by relator while confined in jail. Under such circumstances, relator is not entitled to release. See Ex Parte Lynch, 150 Tex. Cr. R. 239, 200 S.W. 2d 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
