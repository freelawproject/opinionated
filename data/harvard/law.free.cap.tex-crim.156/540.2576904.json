They need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">Bill of Exception No. 1 complains that the child, who was under 14 years of age, was not a competent witness, both because of her immaturity and because of her alleged mental deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The bill reveals that the question of the competency of the witness was first raised after she had given her testimony, when appellant objected \u201cto any of said testimony going to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">It is noted that appellant, in his motion for new trial, suggested that the court should hear evidence on the issue of the competency of the witness. But from the bill, it appears that no evidence was heard and appellant relies alone on the testimony of the witness given on cross-examination to show her incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We are unable to agree that an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in permitting the child witness to testify is shown. She testified in answer to the district attorney\u2019s question : \u201cThat did happen, I am telling the truth. I know what will happen to me if I don\u2019t tell the truth. If I am telling a lie God will punish me and the judge will punish me if I am telling a lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Appellant\u2019s remaining bill is directed to the refusal of the following requested charge: \u201cYou are further charged as a part of the law in this case that if you believe from the evidence, or have a reasonable doubt thereof, that the prosecutrix was told by her mother to testify to the offense of assault with intent to rape or rape as its defenses have been defined to you herein, for the reason of a family dispute between the Defendant and Defendant\u2019s wife, you will find the Defendant \u2018not guilty\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The trial judge properly refused to give such charge, it being on the weight of the evidence and being an incorrect statement of the law. If the testimony of this child be true, it is immaterial that she may have been told to relate it by reason of a family quarrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The weight to be given the testimony was for the jury. Appellant did not testify. He did not call his wife to the stand, and the state could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">We would not be authorized to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict, the evidence being sufficient to sustain their findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">No error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
