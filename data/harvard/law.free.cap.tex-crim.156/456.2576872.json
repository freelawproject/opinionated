R. Wood v. State of Texas discussed in the opinion by this court dated October 31, 1951, (Page 419 of this volume). We there held that the language naming the person in charge and possession of the premises was uncertain because of the disjunctive language. The affidavit and search warrant in the instant case are, for the same reason, fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
