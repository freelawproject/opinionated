This burden the state failed to discharge. The officer attending the jury was not called, and only four members of the jury testified on the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Without a complete showing of noninterference with the jury by anyone outside its number, we cannot say that a separation \u2014 as the same is denounced by statute \u2014 did not occur. See Arts 623 and 668, C.C.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">For the errors pointed out, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
