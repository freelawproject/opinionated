He proceeded on his way to the post office but again looked back and noticed the hood or trunk of a car raised. He again walked on but remembering he had two recapped tires in the trunk of his car, again looked, and saw a man loading two tires into the rear seat of the car parked immediately behind his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">He then started back and saw the car that was parked behind his pull out into the street and recognized appellant, known to him only as \u201cCharlie,\u201d as the driver of such car. He called out, \u201cCharlie, wait a minute, I want to talk to you.\u201d Appellant waved but did not stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Upon reporting the loss of the tires to the police headquarters, it was found that appellant had left the missing tires at the police station saying he had found them in the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Appellant testified that he did find the tires in the street and took them to the police. He denied that he removed them from the trunk of the car and was corroborated by a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">It was shown that appellant\u2019s car was similar to that in which the owner left the tires, and that the tires in question would fit appellant\u2019s car. If the owner\u2019s testimony be accepted, there was no time during which the tires could have been removed before appellant arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The jury accepted the state\u2019s version, and the evidence sustains their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
