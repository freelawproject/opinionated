There they found 5 pints of whiskey in a chest of drawers. The appellant was not present at the time of the search. The apartment in question was rented by appellant\u2019s mother and occupied by her, appellant, appellant\u2019s uncle, and two of appellant\u2019s sisters. There was no showing that the whiskey was found in a room under the appellant\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">In Peters v. State, 142 Tex. Cr. R. 146, 151 S.W. 2d 592, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">\u201c* * * where the evidence shows an opportunity or equal opportunity of another or others to possess the liquors charged to have been possessed by the accused, the State\u2019s case, to be sufficient to convict upon circumstantial evidence must disprove such outstanding hypothesis. Such rule is complied with, however, when the facts show that such other person or persons exercised no control over, or possession of, the liquors, and had no opportunity to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">We feel that such rule has not been complied with in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Because the evidence is not sufficient to support the conviction, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
