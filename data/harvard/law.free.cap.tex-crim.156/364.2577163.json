As will be seen, a disposition of this case hinges upon the definition of the word \u201cautomobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary with Pronunciations defines an automobile as \u201ca wheeled vehicle, propelled by steam, electricity or gasoline, and used for the transportation of <em>persons </em>or <em>merchandise.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Rawle\u2019s 3rd Edition, says that an automobile is \u201ca vehicle for the carriage of <em>passengers </em>or <em>freight, </em>propelled by its own motor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 3rd Edition, defines automobile as \u201ca vehicle for the transportation of <em>persons </em>or <em>property </em>on the highway, carrying its own motive power and not operated upon fixed tracks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Edition, Unabridged, gives us the following definition: \u201cAn automobile vehicle or mechanism; esp., a self-propelled vehicle suitable for use on a street or roadway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Other jurisdictions have given the term \u201cautomobile\u201d a broad interpretation. In Stanley v. Tomlin, 129 S.E. 379, it was held that \u201c \u2018Automobile\u2019 is a general name adopted by proper approval for <em>all </em>forms of self-propelling vehicles for use on highways and streets for general <em>freight </em>and <em>passenger </em>service; a wheeled vehicle propelled by gasoline, steam or electricity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The term \u201cautomobile\u201d has been held to include a \u201ctruck\u201d in the following cases: Kellaher v. City of Portland, 112 Pac. 1076, 57 Ore. 575; Wiese v. Polzer, 248 N.W. 113, 212 Wis. 337; Bethlehem Motors Corporation v. Flynt, 100 S.E. 693, 178 N.C. 399; L. &amp; C. Ins. Co. of Tennessee v. Roland, 165 S.E. 293, 45 Ga. App. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The Kansas City Court of Appeals in Hoover v. National Casualty Company, 162 S.W. 2d 363, approved the Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary definition set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">In the light of the foregoing definitions and decisions, it is the holding of this court that the term \u201cautomobile,\u201d as used by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the legislature in defining the offense of driving while intoxicated, is a generic term which includes the motor vehicle commonly known as a \u201ctruck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Finding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
