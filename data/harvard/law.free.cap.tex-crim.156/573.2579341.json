See Adams v. State, 113 Tex. Cr. R. 501, 21 SW(2) 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Appellant, in his brief, urges that error is shown in the admission of certain testimony of C. E. Hahn regarding the number of the telephone and car license of appellant. We find no bill of exception addressed to the testimony of this witness which is in narrative form in the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Other exceptions to the court\u2019s charge have been examined and no reversible error is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
