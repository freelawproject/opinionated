With this contention we do not agree. The assault was inflicted with a deadly weapon, per se, resulting in serious bodily injury. It would be a strange doctrine, indeed, to say that one shooting at another at close range with a .38 caliber pistol did not, as a matter of law, intend to kill. This we are unwilling to hold. The facts abundantly support the jury\u2019s conclusion of guilt. Honey v. State, 132 Tex. Cr. R. 98, 102 S. W. 2d 224; Rios v. State, 147 Tex. Cr. R. 326, 180 S. W. 2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Several bills of exception appear in the transcript; notwithstanding appellant did not discuss these in his brief, we have examined them and fail to find that reversible error is reflected therein. These bills are overruled without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
