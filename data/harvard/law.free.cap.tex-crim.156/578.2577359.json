It would be only natural for a jury to conclude that an officer who arrested only one out of fifty suspects in driving-while-intoxicated cases was a fair and careful officer who resolved all doubt in favor of those he suspected of violating the law and should, therefore, be afforded the highest degree of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">We say, in passing, that the record reflects that the officer in question, together with his partner, observed appellant in what they contended was a state of intoxication in a public place but made no effort to arrest him, as it was their duty to do; let him go to his automobile and drive away; and then followed and arrested him for driving while intoxicated. Such a practice on the part of peace officers should not be condoned. To do so would endanger the safety of those upon the highway in order that an officer might establish a more serious case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
