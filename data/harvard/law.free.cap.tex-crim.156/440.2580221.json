State, 135 Tex. Cr. R. 445, 120 S. W. (2d) 1074; in Craig v. State, 145 Tex. Cr. R. 186, 167 S. W. (2d) 523; in Jones v. State, 154 Tex. Cr. R. 88, 225 S. W. (2d) 190; and in numerous other cases over a period of many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The reason for this rule lies in the fact that the local option election does not in itself, standing alone, make illegal that which had been legal. Notice to the public of the result of such election is a prerequisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">For the errors shown, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
