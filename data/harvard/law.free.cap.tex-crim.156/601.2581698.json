We arrive at this conclusion because the complaint and information were drawn in compliance with Willson\u2019s Criminal Forms, Section 575, and appellant\u2019s brief discusses said article.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Article 1388b-l, which became effective in 1939 (Acts 1939, 46th Legislature, page 242, as amended by Acts 1947, 50th Legislature, page 947, chapter 404, paragraph 1) superseded Article 1321; and prosecution herein, on August 29, 1951, should have been under said amended article and not under Article 1321, which had been repealed by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The information herein would not support a conviction under the terms of Article 1388b-1 in that it fails to charge that the woods in question were \u201con land of which he is not in possession or control at the time of the setting of such fire\u201d. Powell v. State, (Page 451 of this volume) 243 S. W. (2d) 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">Further, this conviction cannot be supported under Article 1388-1 because the fine assessed herein is in the sum of $50.00, and the minimum fine provided by such article is $100.00. In Rutherford v. State, 79 Tex. Cr. R. 605, 187 S. W. 481, in reversing a case where the punishment was less than the mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>mum, we held that \u201cno court in this state could assess a punishment that the law does not authorize.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">For the information of the bar, we call attention to two recent enactments of the legislature, Article 1321a and 1321b, which became effective on September 6, 1951 (8 days after the proceedings herein were had), and which, in our judgment, insofar as a charge of willful or negligent setting fire to woods, forest, grass or brush lands, repealed Article 1388b-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Because of the defect in the information, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
