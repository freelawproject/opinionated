He fixed the time and place of the purchase at about 4:30 o\u2019clock on the afternoon of June 2, 1951, at appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">Appellant, testifying as a witness in his own behalf, denied the sale of the whisky to the prosecuting witness and testified that at the time fixed by the witness for the sale he was in the State of New Mexico. Other circumstances tended to corroborate this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">It is apparent that the defense of alibi was raised by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">Over proper objection and requested charge, the trial court refused to submit the defense of alibi to the jury. In doing so, he fell into error which requires a reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-18\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-19\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
