Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, admitted having fired a shot under circumstances which the trial court deemed sufficient to require a charge on self-defense. He denied having purposely fired the shot at deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">Deceased was killed by a bullet from appellant\u2019s pistol, which entered the head at the corner of the left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the testimony fails to establish the corpus delicti \u2014 that is, that deceased came to his death as the criminal act or agency of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">As to this contention, it is necessary only to call attention to the fact that appellant admitted soon after the killing that he \u201chad shot a negro,\u201d deceased being a Negro. This admission, together with the wounds inflicted and the facts above mentioned, amply establish the corpus delicti.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Bills of exception appear complaining of argument of state\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The arguments complained of violated no mandatory statute, nor was any new fact thereby injected into the case.
