The appellant is a \u201croute driver\u201d for the company and, as such driver and representative, did, on the 25th day of July, 1950, sell to H. A. Barnett, a retail merchant at Gilmer, in Upshur County, Texas, six quarts of buttermilk in containers having four sides. The printing upon each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>side of the containers represented the contents thereof to be, among other things, \u201cchurned buttermilk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The state contends that the content of the containers was not \u201cchurned buttermilk,\u201d as represented, but was \u201ccultured buttermilk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Appellant was by information charged with selling a misbranded article of food, by reason of the facts stated and, upon trial to the court, was convicted and his punishment assessed at a fine of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The two terms, articles of food, \u201cbuttermilk\u201d and \u201ccultured buttermilk,\u201d are defined by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Buttermilk is the product which remains when fat is removed from milk or cream in the process of churning. It contains not less than eight per cent (8%) of milk solids-not-fat. Art 165-3, Section 1, Subdivision (G), Vernon\u2019s Revised Civil Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Cultured buttermilk is the product resulting from the souring or treatment, by a lactic acid culture, of milk or milk products. It contains not less than eight per cent (8%) of milk-solids-not-fat, and shall be pasteurized before adding the culture. Art. 165-3, Section 1, Subdivision (H), Vernon\u2019s Revised Civil Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The distinction between the two articles of foo&lt;I is apparent. One is obtained by a process of churning, while the other is the result of treatment by a lactic acid culture. So long, therefore, as a lactic acid culture treatment is used, the product could not be buttermilk produced by a process of churning nor churned buttermilk.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The undisputed evidence shows that the product here sold was produced by the following process:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\u201cGrade \u2018A\u2019 skim milk, raw or pasteurized and/or Grade \u2018A\u2019 Condensed skim milk, are pasteurized at a temperature of 190 degrees F. and held there for one hour in a specially constructed, approved, stainless steel pasteurized cooler-container. After pacteurization, the milk is cooled while still in the equipment aforementioned, to what is known as incubating temperature, or approximately 72 degrees. At this temperature, a certain amount of \u2018starter\u2019 is added in order to start and accelerate the process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of souring or clabbering. At intervals of approximately 30 days, a batch of starter is made by introducing a lactic acid culture into skim milk. This starter is used to start the souring of the first batch of milk to be sold. A portion of this batch is then used in the succeeding batch and so on throughout said period.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u201cThis clabbering process takes approximately twelve hours, and when completed the milk is. thoroughly agitated. This agitation, still within the original vat, is accomplished by a high speed agitator, and a system of baffles made into the vat so beating up this curd or clabber that a smooth product is obtained. When this agitation process has been completed, cold water is pumped through the jacket surrounding the vat until the temperature of the contents is cooled sufficiently for bottling.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u201cIt is then conveyed by means of stainless steel approved pipe lines to the bottle and carton fillers where bottles and cartons of varying sizes and types are filled and sealed for delivery to the ultimate consumer. All of the raw materials used are from approved sources, and of approved quality, and all of the equipment used is approved by the various Health Departments, as well as the U. S. Public Health Service. The equipment so used is not the type1 that would be used in the commercial churning of cream for the butter market, but is designed for the production of a type or form of buttermilk processed as above stated as a major product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Counsel for appellant, in open court, agreed that the type or form of buttermilk sold by the appellant was of \u201ccomparatively light, or thin body, and of a low lactic acid content.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The undisputed evidence, showing that the product here sold was produced by a starter which was made \u201cby introducing a lactic acid culture into skim milk\u201d and was of \u201cthe type or form of buttermilk sold by the defendant\u201d and of \u201ccomparatively light, or thin body, and of a low; lactic acid content,\u201d authorized the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the article of food so sold was cultured buttermilk and could not, therefore, be churned buttermilk.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>WOODLEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Appellant has presented us with a most able brief in which he contends that a variance exists between the definitions of buttermilk and cultured buttermilk as made by the legislature in Sec. 1 of Art. 165-3, Vernon\u2019s R.C.S., and the definition promulgated by the State Health Officer on March 1, 1942, under and by virtue of Sec. 2 of said Art. 165-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Such variance is not to us apparent. It appears that the statute differentiates between the product which remains when fat is removed from milk or cream in the process of churning and that resulting from the souring or treatment by a lactic acid culture of milk or milk products. This distinction was recognized by the State Health Officer in defining buttermilk.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We remain convinced that appellant labeled his product as one type of buttermilk when in fact it was the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
