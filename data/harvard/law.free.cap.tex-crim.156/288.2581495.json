The court permitted the county attorney to amend both the complaint and information by changing the name of the accused and making it charge Willie Blackman.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">When this was done the complaint was vitiated. The instrument signed by the affiant, Roy E. Hillin, ceased to be a complaint. See Patillo v. State, 3 Texas Court of Appeals, page 442; Phariss vs. State, 136 Tex. Cr. R. 504, 126 S.W. 2d 981; Hedspeth v. State, 143 Tex. Cr.
