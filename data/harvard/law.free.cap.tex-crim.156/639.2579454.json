Wherefore defendant excepts to the charge of the Court and prays judgment of the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The punishment assessed by the jury is not in excess of that provided for the offense charged, and it is not shown that the punishment assessed was enhanced by reason of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Under these facts, the bill complaining of the court\u2019s charge shows no error requiring reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
