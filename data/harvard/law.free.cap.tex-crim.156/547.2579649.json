Ragsdale. Upon trial he was convicted of the offense of aggravated assault, and his punishment was assessed by the jury at \u201c$500.00 and 9 months in the county jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">He appeals from the judgment rendered on such verdict ordering that he be confined in jail for 9 months and that the State recover from him a fine of $500 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">The court\u2019s charge authorized a conviction for maiming or for aggravated assault or for simple assault and directed the jury to acquit if they had a reasonable doubt as to whether appellant acted wilfully and maliciously or in self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-20\">Appellant now urges that the trial court erred in defining aggravated assault as one where serious bodily injury is inflicted, and omitting to definte \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>We find no objection to the charge calling this <em>omission </em>to the attention of the court before the charge was read to the jury. In the absence of such objection, appellant cannot now complain of the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The verdict of the jury, viewed in the light of the court\u2019s charge, is sufficient to show that the jury intended to assess the punishment at a fine of $500 and 9 months in jail. The trial court properly so construed the verdict in pronouncing judgment. See Lee v. State, 144 Tex. Cr. R. 306, 162 S.W.(2) 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The evidence shows that the injured party lost his ear while engaged in a fight with appellant, and is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the assault by appellant was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The entire ear being removed from the head of the injured party, there appears to be no question that the injury was in fact a \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
