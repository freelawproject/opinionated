As it appears in the transcript, the judgment does not show to have been entered in the minutes of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Accompanying the motion for rehearing is the certificate of the county clerk certifying that the judgment had not been entered in the minutes of the court but, by inadvertence, had been omitted from such record.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">It is apparent, therefore, that a judgment has not been entered of record in the minutes of the court in this case. \u201cEntered of record,\u201d as applied to a judgment in a criminal case, means \u201centered in the minutes of the court.\u201d The case of Ellis v. State, 140 Tex. Cr. R. 339, 145 S. W. 2d 176, appears to be here controlling; it was there held that a docket entry in a misdemeanor case did not constitute a judgment entered of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is granted; the opinion heretofore rendered in this case is withdrawn; and the appeal is now dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
