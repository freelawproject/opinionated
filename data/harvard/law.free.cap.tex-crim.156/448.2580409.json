Appellant excepted to the overruling of his objection and to the refusal of his requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The requested charge is confined to an application of the law to the facts. The court\u2019s charge applied the law in paragraph 4 of his charge and not in paragraph 1. The requested charge was therefore on another and different subject, and the trial court correctly declined to substitute the requested charge for his paragraph 1. Had he done so, the charge would have twice instructed the jury on the application of the law to the facts, and would have omitted any reference to the nature of the charge, the defendant\u2019s plea or the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">No error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
