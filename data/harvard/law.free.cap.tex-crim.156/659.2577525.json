The penalty assessed is a fine of $300.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-18\">The record is before us without a statement of facts and bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-19\">Appellant has vigorously attacked the complaint and information, taking the position that no offense is charged. The matter complained of appears to be this: That part of the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tion which alleges that an election had been held by reason of which the area became dry, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">\u201c* * * after an election had been held * * * to determine whether or not the \u25a0 sale of intoxicating liquor, to-wit, beer, should be prohibited ****.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention is that \u201cliquor\u201d having been defined in the statute as meaning an alcoholic beverage containing alcohol in excess of four per cent by weight, and the term \u201cbeer\u201d having been defined in the statute as a malt beverage containing one-half of one per cent or more of alcohol by volume and not more than four per cent of alcohol by weight, that the terms used in the information, namely, \u201cintoxicating liquor, to-wit, beer,\u201d is meaningless and charges no offense. Appellant seems to take the position that the use of the word \u201cliquor\u201d in the information is a use of it in the sense of the statutory definition above mentioned as set forth in Article 666-3a, Vernon\u2019s Ann. P.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">It is amply evident from the reading of the information and is frankly conceded by appellant\u2019s able counsel himself that the state was attempting to charge the appellant with the offense of possessing beer for the purpose of sale in a dry area. It is our opinion that the phrase \u201cintoxicating liquor\u201d was using the word \u201cliquor\u201d as a generic term and not in the restricted sense or definition given to the word \u201cliquor\u201d by Art. 666-3a, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">We think the decision in Bell v. State, 142 Tex.Cr.R. 390, 154 S.W. (2d) 650, is in point. In that case the court held in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">\u201cHe moves to quash the complaint and information because, as he alleges, the same is repugnant in that they charge him with the unlawful possession for the purpose of sale of \u2018beer containing alcohol in excess of one-half of one per centum by volume, same being an intoxicating liquor,\u2019 etc;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">\u201c \u2018The term \u201cbeer\u201d means a malt beverage containing one-half of one per cent or more of alcohol by volume and not more than four (4) per cent of alcohol by weight, and shall not be inclusive of any beverage designated by label or otherwise by any other name than beer.\u2019 (Art. 667-1,(b) Vernon's Ann. P.C.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201cWhile \u2018liquor\u2019 is defined by Art. 666-3a, P.C., idem, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">\u201c \u2018Liquor shall mean any alcoholic beverage containing alcohol in excess of four (4) per centum by weight, unless otherwise indicated.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">\u201cIt is our opinion that the use of the words \u2018same being an intoxicating liquor\u2019 did not mean to charge that such beer was \u2018liquor,\u2019 as above set forth and defined by the statute. That such phrase was but a generic term, and could as well have read \u2018same being an intoxicant,\u2019 or an intoxicating beverage, and would thus have conveyed the meaning intended by the pleader. Of course if such beer was not an intoxicant it would not have come under the denunciation of this statute, which is denominated the \u2018Texas Liquor Control Act,\u2019 nor would same have been unlawful to possess. The word \u2018liquor\u2019 does not in every instance used bear the restricted meaning set forth in the statute. If such were true, then the <em>Liquor </em>Control Board would be limited in its jurisdiction to beverages containing more than four per cent of alcohol by weight; and in many places in such Liquor Control Act where the word \u2018liquor\u2019 or \u2018intoxicating liquor\u2019 is used in conjunction with the regulation of the sale of \u2018beer,\u2019 such would be restricted only to the heavier alcohol percentage of more than four per cent. To thus hold the phrase \u2018intoxicating liquor\u2019 to this narrow meaning would leave unattended to many matters that the law-making body legislated upon in the realm of lesser percentages of alcohol than four per cent by volume.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">If appellant is seeking to attack that part of the information which alleges the holding of an election, then as to such matter, we have this to say:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The information alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201c* * * after an election has been held by the qualified voters of said county in accordance with law to determine whether or not the sale of intoxicating liquor, to-wit, beer, should be prohibited in said county,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In Weeks v. State, 140 Tex.Cr.R. 246, 143 S.W. (2d) 956; we held the complaint and information to be sufficient. These instruments alleged that the accused, on or about the fourth day of October, 1939, possessed for the purpose of sale an intoxicating beverage, to-wit, beer; and it was further charged that the beer was possessed in Johnson County after an elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tion had been held in and for said county for the purpose of determining whether the sale of intoxicating liquor should be prohibited; that such election resulted in favor of prohibition. In that case the instruments seemed to be sufficient to charge the offense of which the conviction was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Relative to the state\u2019s position that the word \u201cliquor,\u201d as used in the information in the present case, is used in the generic sense rather than in the sense given it by statutory definition, we cite the case of Griffin v. State, 137 Tex.Cr.R. 231, 128 S.W. (2d) 1197. This was a case where the prosecution was for the sale of beer in a dry area. It was shown that an election was held for the purpose of determining whether the sale of intoxicating liquor should be prohibited. The opinion affirmed the conviction, and on the motion for rehearing, J udge Hawkins, in paragraph 8, referred to beer as \u201cliquor,\u201d using the word in its generic sense. In part he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201cOur present statute specifically makes it an offense to sell \u2018beer\u2019 \u2014 naming it among other liquors \u2014 in dry area. Art. 666-4, Sec. (b), Vernon\u2019s Texas P.C., Vol. 1, Acts 1937, 45th Leg., p. 1053, ch. 448. Under the present law it was sufficient to describe the liquor sold as \u2018beer\u2019 only. The pleader here amplified the description in saying it was an alcoholic beverage containing in excess of one-half of 1 per cent of alcohol by volume.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In the absence of a statement of facts, we find no other point presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
