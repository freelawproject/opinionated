A son of the same name acquired skill under him in the same manufacture, and since 1864 had had a valuable independent reputation in the market as a manufacturer of the same goods. In 1878 the second William Rogers made a contract with the defendant corporation by which it was agreed that he should exercise his skill in superintending their manufacture of silver-plated ware, and direct as to its quality and style, and allow his name to be stamped thereon and defend its use; in consideration of which he was to receive a commission upon sales. The plaintiff corporation had since 1872 been engaged in the manufacture of silver-plated ware, and used sundry trade-marks, of which the name \u201cWilliam Rogers\u201d was the principal part, claiming to own the exclusive right to such stamps by the agreement of the first William Rogers and by long-cont; ued use. In a suit brought by the last-mentioned company against the other for an injunction against the use of the name \u201c William Rogers \u201d as a trade-mark, it was held:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>1. That the second William Rogers had the right to use his name as the important part of his trade-mark so long as it was accompanied with devices to distinguish it from the trade-marks of the plaintiffs, and was not used for the purpose of misleading purchasers, although purchasers who took note only of the words \u201c William Rogers,\u201d or were not familiar with the stamps of the plaintiffs, were liable to be misled.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b538-6\">2. That under the arrangement by which the goods were manufactured by the defendant corporation under the superintendence of the second William Rogers, and with an interest on his part in the manufacture and sale, they had a right to use the name of William Rogers in their trade-mark in the same manner that he could have done if he had been the direct manufacturer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b538-8\">When the second bearer of a name which has become the distinguishing part of a trade-mark used by another manufacturer, uses the same name as a part of his own trade-mark, with proper distinguishing devices, it is not a sufficient reason for enjoining the latter against the use of the name, that the goods of both manufacturers become known in the market by the same name. He is not to be injuriously affected by any use the public may make of a mark which the law allows him to use.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b538-9\">If purchasers who will take note of nothing but the name upon the trademark are misled, and there is consequent loss to either of the parties entitled to use the name, it must be borne as a consequence of the act of taking the name as a trade-mark.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b538-10\">[Argued November 10th, 1886,</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Apq\">decided February 25th, 1887.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-11\">Shit for an injunction against the use of a certain name in a trade-mark, and for an account and damages; brought to the Superior Court in Hartford County.

It succeeded to the business of a partnership of the same name which had been formed in 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-13\">For one or two years after its organization as a corporation its sales were considerable, amounting to nearly $140,000 in 1873, which was its best year. After that its sales gradually decreased, until, in 1877, they amounted to less than $40,000. From that time forward until the spring of 1879 the business was still smaller, and the goods which purported to be of its manufacture were made, plated, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>stamped for it at Waterbury, by Rogers &amp; Brother, a corporation by that name, engaged in the same business and located in the latter city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">The plaintiff at all times had goods in the market bearing its stamp, and had a travelling salesman out, and its goods were, to a limited extent, on sale in the markets of the country, and Avere sold to and by dealers in Hartford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">In the year 1879 the management of the William Rogers Manufacturing Company was consolidated with that of the Rogers Cutlery Company, another corporation located in Hartford, and was officered by the managers of the latter company, and from that time the business of the plaintiff has considerably increased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">The goods manufactured by the plaintiff have had a good reputation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-8\">About the year 1847 three brothers, all now deceased, William, Asa H., and Simeon S. Rogers, engaged in the manufacture of electro-silver-plated spoons, forks and knives at Hartford, under the partnership name of Rogers Brothers. Prior to that time William and Simeon had been engaged in the general jewelry and plated-ware business in State street at Hartford, under the firm name of William Rogers &amp; Co. Asa had learned the art of electro-silverplating, and was the only practical plater of the three.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-9\">The spoons, forks and knives manufactured by the co-partnership were stamped \u201c [Star] Rogers Brothers A 1,\u201d or \u201c [Star] Rogers Bros. A 1,\u201d and sucli stamps became Avell known in the trade as indicating goods manufactured by the firm. In the copartnership thus formed William traveled, selling goods, and when at home exercised a general superintendence over the whole business. Simeon managed the store. Asa did the plating. William Rogers, Jr., was employed as a general assistant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-10\">Electro-silver-plating was then a novel manufacture, and because principally of their integrity in the manufacture, the goods of the Rogers Brothers being found to answer their recommendation as honest goods, the goods of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>manufacture acquired a valuable reputation in the market, and as early as 1853 became known as \u201c Rogers goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">[Facts are then found in much detail with regard to various partnerships or corporations with which some or all the Rogers brothers were connected, and which were authorized to use the name of \u201c Rogers \u201d as a part of their trade-marks, and especially the name of William Rogers, for the purpose of showing how far thd plaintiff corporation was entitled to the trade-marks which it was seeking to protect; but as the court does not consider this question in deciding the case, the facts that relate to it are omitted.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">Before the bringing of this suit the following stamps had at various times been put upon goods sent into the market by the copartnership of William Rogers Manufacturing Company, the plaintiff corporation of the same name, and the Rogers Cutlery Company:\u2014\u201c 1847, Wm.

Rogers &amp; Son,\u201d and \u201c1776 Wm. Rogers &amp; Son,\u201d and then adopted \u201c (Anchor) Wm. Rogers &amp; Son AA,\u201d and \u201c1865 Wm.

R. &amp; Son AA.\u201d was used only on small articles from lack of room. \u201cRogers Cutlery Co.\u201d was used by that company and not by the plaintiff, and \u201cRogers Silver Plate Co.\u201d was used only on some job lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">Wm. Rogers died in 1873; Simeon S. Rogers in 1874; and Asa H. Rogers in 1876,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-8\">During the respective lives of these brothers .they uniformly claimed that the original stamp of \u201c Rogers Broth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ers \u201d and the other so-called Rogers stamps used by them, or either of them, or by the companies with which they or either of them were connected, were their personal trademarks, and denoted that the goods to which they were applied were manufactured under their personal superintendence and guaranty of quality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">While the brothers, together or separately, were engaged in such manufacture, either for themselves or for the companies with which they were connected, the stamps so used by them or either of them did represent, and were understood by the public to represent, such superintendence and guaranty; but the stamps continued to be used by the companies after such connection had ceased, under a claim of right so to do, and have come to represent not the personal superintendence and guaranty of the brothers or either of them, but that the goods bearing such stamps are of the same good quality as the goods which were manufactured under the personal superintendence of the brothers, and that the companies using them are the legitimate successors to the brothers in the use of the marks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">The marks are valuable to the parties using them. There was nothing peculiar or mysterious in the art of electrosilver-plating, known to the Rogerses and not known to any skillful silver-plater, and it was their diligence, integrity and skill, and their persistent and undeviating requirement that their trade-marks or names should be placed only upon goods of their standard by the various companies with which they were connected in business, that marks used by them, of which the name \u201c Rogers \u201d formed a part, gave to such goods a valuable reputation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">By reason of the numerous stamps on spoons, forks and knives, containing the word \u201c Rogers,\u201d as before stated, and of the efforts of the various concerns who had used such stamps since 1847 to promote the sales of their goods as \u201c Rogers goods,\u201d the word \u201c Rogers \u201d had, before the bringing of this suit, become the conspicuous and familiar part of such stamps to a large class of the retail buyers; but jobbers and those retail buyers who are informed in rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>tion to the trade-marks, and the several manufacturers represented by them, readily distinguish'between the stamps of the different manufacturers by the words or symbols which such stamps do not possess in common. Many of those retail buyers who buy only by the stamp, look only to the word \u201c Rogers,\u201d and are for this reason liable to confound the various stamps, but generally the retail buyers who desire any information on the subject of the maker of the goods rely upon the dealer for such information.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">A large proportion of the ultimate purchasers are not familiar with the various marks and their signification, as indicating a particular make, but look merely to see if they are Rogers goods, and usually rely upon the statements of the seller, and are satisfied if they are stamped with the name \u201c Rogers \u201d in some form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">A limited portion of such purchasers are familiar with the various stamps, and such have no difficulty in distinguishing one stamp from another, and are not liable to be deceived if they desire a particular stamp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-7\">In the year 1864 William Rogers, Jr., and William J. Pierce formed a business connection, under which silver-plated spoons and forks were furnished to the trade, bearing the stamp of William Rogers, Jr., the arrangement being that Rogers should receive a commission for the right to stamp such goods with his name; Rogers to sell the goods as the manufacturer, and Pierce not to be personally known in the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\">William Rogers, Jr., is the son of William Rogers, Sr. He had been brought up by his father in the jewelry and plated-ware business of William Rogers &amp; Co., at State street in Hartford, and became associated with his father in 1856, under the firm name of Wm. Rogers &amp; Son, which firm continued until the year 1861. He had also assisted his father generally in th\u00e9 original business of Rogers Brothers, and had always been in familiar association with Ms father in the latter\u2019s business affairs. His name originally was William H. Rogers, but, somewhere about 1856, he changed his name to William Rogers, Jr., for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>of being more closely identified with his father, and had become known by that name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">The goods sold under this arrangement with Pierce were plated by him according to the Rogers standard, as agreed by the parties, and were advertised and sold as \u201cGenuine Rogers goods,\u201d and equal to the goods of the original Rogers Brothers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">This arrangement continued about a year, and until the formation of the copartnership of the Wm. Rogers Manufacturing Company in 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">The Wm. Rogers Manufacturing Company co-partnership continued the use of the trade-marks after William Rogers and William Rogers Jr., who had been members of it, left the firm in March, 1868, and within a- short time after obtained a temporary injunction against the Rogerses, father and son, restraining them from using the trade-marks or either of them; from representing that any person other than the Wm. Rogers Manufacturing Company had the right to use them; from interfering with the free use of the trade-marks by the Wm. Rogers Manufacturing Company, and from stating that that company had no right to use them. Wm. Rogers, Jr., was afterwards found in contempt for a violation of this injunction, and fined by the court therefor. The injunction continued in force until after the organization of the plaintiff corporation, when it was withdrawn by consent, without costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">The Wm. Rogers Manufacturing Company continued its business as a copartnership and the use of the trade-marks until a transfer was made in January, 1872, to the plaintiff corporation. This corporation continued the business at Hartford, at the same place and in the same building, making goods of a good quality, and stamping them with the trade-marks (\u201cAnchor) Wm. Rogers &amp; Son, AA.,\u201d and \u201c1865, Wm. Rogers Mfg. Co., AA.,\u201d and other stamps to a limited extent, and has claimed the right to use these stamps.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-9\">The goods manufactured by them or for them bearing these stamps have been up to the standard of quality known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>as the Rogers standard. The standard has in fact been raised by the plaintiff and by the other companies making the so-called \u201c Rogers goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">The goods made and sold by the copartnership and the plaintiff corporation became familiarly known in the market as \u201c William Rogers goods \u201d and \u201c Hartford goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">The plaintiff has on signs, circulars, blotters\u2019and in advertisements used the name \u201c Wm. Rogers &amp; Son \u201d as a business name, from which it might be naturally inferred by the public that William Rogers or his son William Rogers, Jr., was connected with the manufacture or business, or was the firm conducting the business. The managers of the plaintiff corporation have also stamped job lots of goods with the stamp \u201c Rogers Silver Plate Co.,\u201d and registered this stamp as a trade-mark, there being no such company in existence. Such use and register was for the purpose of attempting to control the name and prevent other parties from using it. The managers of the corporation have also sent into the market since its consolidation with the Rogers Cutlery Company, spoons and forks stamped \u201c Rogers Cutlery Co.,\u201d as one of its stamps, the stamp being used on goods on hand at the time of the consolidation of the two companies, which had been manufactured by the Rogers Cutlery Co. It has maintained to the public that its stamps are those of the original, genuine Rogers Brothers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">The defendant is a joint-stock corporation located at Wallingford, in this state, and for some years prior to 1878 had been engaged in the business of making and selling plated ware, both flat and hollow, stamping its flat-ware \u201cSimpson, H. M. &amp; Co.,\u201d or with the initials \u201cS. H. M. &amp; Co.,\u201d accompanied with devices denoting the quality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-8\">The hollow-ware, stamped with the name of the corporation, sold well and had a high reputation in the market, but its flat-ware, although of good quality and finish, did not find a ready market, and its sales were quite limited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-9\">Prior to 1878 the defendant, through its officers and agents, had made several attempts to connect with itself in some way some man by the name of Rogers, with a view to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>stamping such name upon its goods. It had a contract in \u25a0 1867 with William Rogers and William Rogers, Jr., with reference to the use of the stamp \u201c Wm. Rogers &amp; Son \u201d upon its hollow-ware, and such was so used to some extent. The persons who composed its management had negotiations in 1876 with F. Willson Rogers, a younger son of William Rogers, at that time without practical experience in the business, looking to the formation of a company to be called the Rogers Silver Plate Company, under which name an organization was made and published, and that name was stamped upon a small lot of goods, but the negotiations fell through and nothing came of it. In 1872 some negotiations were had with one William W. Rogers, a machinist, with no practical knowledge of the plated ware business, and who was not connected in any way with the William Rogers before referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\">In 1878 a contract between William Rogers and William Rogers, Jr., and the Meriden Britannia Company having expired, William Rogers having died, and William Rogers, Jr., being then out of business, the latter applied to the defendant for the purpose of making an arrangement with the corporation for the manufacture by it of silver-plated forks, spoons and knives, under his supervision and control, and with his stamp as a trade-mark. Some of the officers of the defendant had endeavored, in 1868, to make some arrangement of the kind with him and his father, but they then entered into the contract with the Meriden Britannia Company .before referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\">The officers of the defendant were at first suspicious that his application was made for the purpose of obtaining better terms in a new contract with the Meriden Britannia Company, but on becoming convinced that his proposition was in good faith, and that his relations with the latter company were fully terminated, they requested him to make a definite proposition, which was done, and the result was the making of a contract between himself and the defendant, of which the following are the parts important to the present case. The defendants are designated in the contract as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>party of the first part and William Rogers as the party of the second part. The contract is dated May 6th, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-5\">\u201c 1.

Said party of the second part further agrees faithfully to give his attention and supervision to the burnishing, buffing and assorting for the market, of all goods plated in accordance with the foregoing article, * * * and no commission, as is hereinafter provided, shall be paid by the party of the first part on the sales of any goods so prepared for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the market not of the first quality, or such as are known as imperfects or seconds.

The effect of the use of the Rogers name was soon manifest in the increased and increasing sale of their goods so manufactured and stamped. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">The defendant was well equipped for the manufacture of such goods of good style, quality and finish, before the contract with William Rogers was entered into, and no change has been made merely on account of his employment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">The goods made under the contract have been stamped \u201c (Eagle) Wm.

Since 1864 down to the time of his connection with the defendant, his name had, by reason of his relation to the business as hereinbefore stated, and the efforts to that end of those with whom he had been associated, been known to the trade as that of the son of William Rogers, Sr., with whom he had been associated in the manufacture of electrosilver-plated goods, and had in consequence thereof obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>a valuable reputation, so that goods stamped with his name, as indicating his supervision and guaranty of their manufacture, had by reason thereof a better selling value in the market.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">From 1865 to 1878 he had been almost constantly employed in connection with such manufacture with the Wm.

The value of his name consisted in his knowledge of the business, his skill and judgment in relation to the style and finish of the goods and the requirements of the trade, acquired by his long association with his father in the business, and in the fact that he as well as his father had always insisted that his name should only be used on goods of a certain high standard of quality.

Rogers \u201d only, or who are not familiar with the stamps of the plaintiff, might readily confound them. As before stated, a large class of dealers is familiar with the various stamps used by the different makers of the so-called \u201c Rogers goods,\u201d and would readily distinguish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>stamp of the defendant from all others, while many small dealers, and a large portion of the ultimate purchasers, are not familiar with the different stamps and their signification, and such dealers and purchasers usually rely upon the representations of the seller, and are satisfied with any stamp bearing the name Rogers, if they are represented to be genuine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-5\">But a dealer or ultimate purchaser who desired goods made by the plaintiff, and was not familiar with its stamp, would readily take goods with the defendant\u2019s stamp, from the word \u201c Wm.

Rogers Mfg. Co. AA\u201d are the plaintiff\u2019s trade-marts. (1) They were adopted, with the assent of the Rogerses, by the partnership which preceded the plaintiff. (2) They were conveyed by the copartnership, together with its property, business and good will, to the plaintiff corporation. (3) The transfer to the plaintiff corporation was made with the assent of William Rogers, Jr., Wm. Rogers, Sr., being then imbecile and incompetent. (4) And the trade-marks have been in actual use by the plaintiff upon its goods continuously since its organization in 1872 and prior thereto by the partnership from their adoption in 1865. The record is explicit on all these points. Thus it appears that these stamps, adopted in 1866, have been continuously used by the partnership and corporation to the present time\u2014openly, adversely, and under claim of right as their trade-marks. \u201c The trade-mark recognized by the common law is generally the growth of a considerable period of use rather than a sudden invention. * * * At common law the exclusive right to it grows out of its use, not its mere adoption.\u201d <em>Trade-Mark </em>Cases, 100 U. S. R., 94. \u201c It is the actual use of the trade-mark, affixed to the merchandise of the manufacturer, and this alone, which can impart to it the element of property. The mere declaration of a person, however long and however extensively published, that he claims property in a word as his trade-mark, cannot even tend to make it his property.\u201d <em>Candee </em>v. Deere, 54 111., 439. \u201c The right to use a trade-mark is above all other rights one which depends upon use.\u201d Lowell, J., in <em>William Rogers Mfg.

An exact imitation or similarity is not necessary. In <em>Meriden Britannia Co. y. Parker </em>it was found that the defendant\u2019s trade-mark resembled the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c to that degree that it was calculated to deceive unwary purchasers and those who buy such goods hastily and with but little examination of the trade-mark; but purchasers who read the entire trade-mark on the defendant\u2019s goods, and who know the petitioner\u2019s trade-mark, cannot be deceived, nor can they mistake the respondent\u2019s goods for those of the petitioner.\u201d Upon this finding the court by Carpenter, J., remarked:\u2014\u201cThe fact that careful buyers, who scrutinize trade-marks closely, are not deceived, does not materially affect the question. It only shows that the injury is less; not that there is no injury. Another class of purchasers, to whom large quantities are sold, are deceived. Such purchasers, perhaps, will have no reason to complain, as they, if they are injured by the deception, must attribute the injury to their own want of diligence. But the petitioners stand on entirely different ground. No amount of diligence on their part will guard against the injury; an injunction is their only adequate remedy, and to that we think they are entitled.\u201d <em>Meriden Britannia Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>39 Conn., 460. \u201c The criterion is not the certainty of success in misleading the public, but its probability\u2014or even its possibility.\u201d Duer, J., in <em>Amoskeag Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>2 Sandf., 549, approved by Mr. Upton in his work on trademarks, p. 136, and by Judge Carpenter in <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Meriden Britannia Co., </em>35 Conn., 415.

R., 65; <em>Landreth </em>v. <em>Landreth, </em>22 Fed. Rep., 41. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>50 Conn., 280, the finding was of resemblance \u201c to such a degree that they are liable to deceive careless and unwary purchasers who buy such goods hastily and with little examination; but purchasers who read the entire trademark and label on the defendants\u2019 goods cannot be deceived nor mistake the defendants\u2019 goods for the plaintiff\u2019s.\u201d It was not found that the defendants\u2019 goods were sold for the plaintiff\u2019s, and the defendants were found to have acted in good faith; but the defendants were enjoined. The findings in this case, in respect to similarity of marks, are as follows: \u201cThe stamp of the defendant is put upon the goods in the manner customary with other manufacturers; \u201d that is, in the same place and manner as the plaintiff\u2019s. \u201c Those who examine the whole stamp and are familiar with the stamps used by the p\u00edaintiff, have no difficulty in distinguishing;\u201d which only means that there are differences which close examination and comparison reveal; but \u201c those who regard the word Rogers or William Rogers only or who are not familiar with the stamp of the plaintiff, might readily confound them. A dealer or ultimate purchaser who desired goods made by the plaintiff, and was not familiar with its stamp, would readily take goods with the defendant\u2019s stamp, from the word \u2018 William Rogers \u2019 being on the goods. The plaintiff\u2019s goods had been, for ten years or more, distinguished by the general appellation of \u2018 William Rogers goods.\u2019 Since the defendant\u2019s goods, stamped as aforesaid, have been put upon the market, they have become generally known as \u2018William Rogers goods.\u201d \u201cA purchaser ordering from a dealer simply \u2018William Rogers goods \u2019 would be as likely to get goods made by the defendant as those made by the plaintiff, unless he should designate the make, as Hartford or Wallingford goods, by which they are usually distinguished in the trade; and if the order were thus specific it might be filled by the goods of either, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>was not familiar with, the respective stamps, or, being familiar, neglected to observe them.\u201d We submit that the finding, upon the point of similarity of marks, is quite beyond that to be found in any of the cases in which the court has granted an injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">2. It is not necessary to show that the defendants have acted fraudulently. The law is the same both as to trademarks and trade-names. <em>Singer Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Loog, </em>L. R., 8 App. Cas., 15; Sebastian on Trade-marks, 226. This being a suit in equity the law which applies is that stated by Lord Cottenham, in <em>Millington </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>3 Mylne &amp; Craig, 338, where he says, \u201c I see no reason to believe that there has in this case been a fraudulent use of the plaintiffs\u2019 marks. It is positively denied by the answer, and there is no evidence to show that the defendants were even aware of the existence of the plaintiffs as a company manufacturing steel. In short it does not appear to me that there was any fraudulent intention in the use of the marks. That circumstance, however, does not deprive the plaintiffs of then right to the exclusive use of those names.\u201d Sebastian in his last edition (1884) says, referring to this case, (p. 9,) \u201c In equity the protection to the manufacturer was carried a stage farther in 1838 by the decision of Lord Cottemham in <em>Millington </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>since which time it has not been necessary to prove an actual fraudulent intention, the remedy being obtainable if the defendants\u2019 conduct has been such as to produce the effects of fraud, though he may, in fact, have acted in perfect innocence.\u201d Again, at page 11, he says: \u201c It is not necessary that there should be fraud in the sense that the infringer knowingly and willfully makes a fraudulent attempt to appropriate to himself the fruits of another\u2019s reputation; if he acts so that custom intended for another is diverted to himself, and that the public buy and pay for one thing while intending to buy and pay for another, so that both vendor and purchaser are injured, there is fraud and the animus of the infringer is unimportant.\u201d And again, on page 156, he says:\u2014\u201cBut the fraud does not consist in an intention to deceive on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>of the defendant, but in an actual deception, or in the creation of a probability of deception, independently of any fraudulent intention.\u201d In reply to' a similar objection raised by the defendant in the case of this plaintiff against Rogers &amp; Spurr Mfg. Co., 11 Fed. R., 495, Judge Lowell says: \u201c I believe it to be true that the Greenfield Rogers did not inquire, nor did the defendants care, whose reputation they were making available; but I am of opinion that any one of those who rightfully use the name may enjoin its interfering use by others.\u201d See also <em>Singer Manf. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R., 3 App. Cas., 391; <em>Filley </em>v. <em>Fassett, </em>44 Misso., 173. But we need not rest upon this claim. It is found that \u201c the defendants knew that the goods which had been made and sold by the plaintiff had become known as \u2018 Wm. Rogers goods,\u2019 and when said advertisement was published, that their goods were in the market and that they were continuing business,\u201d and also that \u201c the defendant knew that the use of said trade-mark and said advertisement would cause their goods to become known in the market as the \u2018 Wm. Rogers goods.\u2019 \u201d \u201c All that courts of justice can do is to say that no trader can adopt a trademark so resembling that of a rival as that ordinary purchasers, purchasing with ordinary caution, are likely to be misled. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the resemblance must be such as would deceive persons who should see the two marks placed side by side. The rule so restricted would be of no' practical use. If a purchaser, looking at the article offered him, would naturally be led, from the mark impressed on it, to suppose it to be the production of the rival manufacturer, and would purchase it in that belief, the court considers the use of such a mark to be fraudulent. But I go further. I do not consider the actual physical resemblance of the two marks to be the sole question for consideration. If the goods of a manufacturer have, from the mark or device he has used, become known in the market by a particular name, I think that the adoption by a rival trader of any mark which will cause his goods to bear the same name in the market, may be as much a viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tion of the rights of that rival as the actual copy of his device.\u201d <em>Seixo </em>v. <em>Provezende, </em>L. R., 1 Ch., 192. See also <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>L. R., 5 Ch., 155; <em>Singer Manf. Co. </em>v. Loog, L. R., 8 App. Cas., 15; <em>S. </em>C., L. R., 18 Ch. Div., 417; <em>Hendriks </em>v. Montagu, L. R., 17 Ch. Div., 638; <em>Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>13 Wall., 323; <em>Holmes, Booth &amp; Haydens </em>v. <em>Holmes, Booth &amp; Atwood Mfg. Co., </em>37 Conn., 278; <em>Meriden Britannia Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>39 id., 450. The defendants will claim that at the time of making the contract with William Rogers their conduct was not actuated by any motive towards the plaintiff; and that they had no knowledge that the plaintiff\u2019s goods were in the market, and will ask this court to believe that they were actuated by no improper motive, but solely by the desire to secure, in the manufacture of their goods, the superintendence and alleged skill of this \u201c Rogers.\u201d If the defendants could establish ignorance on their part, we submit that such ignorance would not excuse them. But the finding shows both knowledge and fraudulent action as to the material parts of the case. 16 Prior to 1878 the defendant, through its officers and agents, had made several attempts to connect with itself in some way some man by the name of \u2018Rogers,\u2019 with a view to stamping such name upon its goods.\u201d This language is peculiar and suggestive, and clearly defines the animus of the defendants. The defendants had tried their own name; and while so stamped \u201c their flat-ware, though of good quality and finish, did not find a ready market and its sales were quite limited.\u201d They were well aware of the large sale of flat-ware of similar quality bearing a so-called Rogers stamp. They wanted some Rogers, they cared not who, provided the name could be used upon their goods. Having negotiated, without success, in three other directions, they secured the present association. Their motive in making this contract is found to have been \u201c to enable them to compete more successfully in the market with the makers of such goods, that is, \u2018 genuine Rogers goods.\u2019 \u201d Their first purpose was to secure the <em>name </em>\u201c <em>William </em>Rogers,\u201d as a stamp, and it was the use of his name that is found to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>effected the increased and increasing sale of their goods so manufactured and stamped. If in the making of the contract the defendant was not actuated by any motive toward the plaintiff as distinguished from other manufacturers of Rogers goods, yet as one of such manufacturers, of whom there were but three, its injury, though less perhaps in amount, was none the less real. And the motive found to have actuated the defendant as against such manufacturers in general may be relied upon by the plaintiff in this action. But further, the wrong complained of is not the making of the contract with Rogers, but the advertising, stamping and selling of goods which followed. At the time of these acts it is distinctly found that \u201c they knew the plaintiff\u2019s goods were in the market, and that they were continuing business.\u201d These later acts at least were done with full knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. We quote the finding on this point: \u201c The defendant knew that the goods which had been made and sold by the plaintiff had become known as \u2018Wm. Rogers goods,\u2019 and when the advertisement was published that, their goods were in the market and that they were continuing business.\u201d \u201c The defendant knew that the use of said trademark and said advertisement would cause their goods to bebeeome known in the market as \u2018 Wm. Rogers goods.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless they continued the use of the stamp and published and circulated the advertisement in its aid, until they had created such confusion that careless and unwary buyers, and those not familiar with the plaintiff\u2019s stamps, or who did not examine the whole stamp, would confound them and buy their goods for those made by the plaintiff. The result followed as they knew it would and as they must be held to have intended that it should.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-5\">Third.\u2014The defendant\u2019s stamp has given to their goods the exact name by which the plaintiff\u2019s goods had previously been known, and this fact alone is sufficient reason for the injunction sought. The finding upon this point is full and explicit. \u201c The plaintiff\u2019s goods, from the time of the partnership, had been familiarly known as \u2018 Wm. Rogers goods,\u2019 and no other goods by that name had ever been in the market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>until the time that goods made by the defendant were put upon the market, since which time said goods have generally been known in the trade as 4 Wm. Rogers goods.\u2019 \u201d This case is in this respect like that of Orr, <em>Ewing &amp; Co. </em>v. Johnson, L. R., 13 Ch. Div., 434, in which the plaintiffs, dealers in yarn which they exported to India, had a ticket containing, among other things, two elephants, which ticket had given the yarn several names by which it was sold and familiarly known, one being the \u201c two elephant goods.\u201d The defendants, who had for some years sold yarns bearing a ticket containing, among other things, one elephant, began to export similar yarn to the same market, and placed upon it a ticket containing two elephants, but in several other respects different from the ticket of the plaintiffs, and the defendant\u2019s elephants themselves were in several particulars unlike those used by the plaintiffs. In an action by the plaintiffs for an injunction to restrain the defendants from infringing their rights it was held\u2014(1) That if the goods of a trader have acquired in the market a name derived from a part of the trade-mark which he affixes to them, a rival trader is not entitled to use a ticket which, is likely to lead to the application of the same name to his goods, even though that name is not the only name by which the goods of the first trader have been known, or though it has always been used in conjunction with some other word. (2) That though it was not probable that English purchasers or Indian dealers would be deceived, it was not improbable that the ultimate purchasers in India would be, in consequence of defendant\u2019s ticket being calculated to obtain the same name of <em>\u00ed\u00edBhe </em>Eothe,\u201d or \u201ctwo elephant,\u201d as the plaintiffs\u2019. (3) That it was not necessary to prove any fraudulent intention on the part of the defendants. (4) That the two elephants forming a material and substantial part of the plaintiffs\u2019 trade-mark having been taken by the defendants, the burden was upon them to disprove the probability of deception, and not upon the plaintiffs to prove it.\u201d Justice Fey said:\u2014\u201c It appears to me that there is a great deal of evidence, to which I attach weight, to show that these goods are sold largely by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>name, and that although the first dealers no doubt look at the tickets, yet that the ultimate purchasers and the purchasers from the dealers in Bombay, probably do not look at the tickets, and at any rate are liable to be deceived by the name by which the goods are sold.\u201d In another part of his judgment the same justice quotes from the case of <em>Edelsten </em>v. Edelsten, 1 DeG., J. &amp; S., 202, in which Lord Wbstbijev observed upon the fact that the goods derived their trade-name from that particular part of the ticket, and says\u2014 \u201c I think therefore that when the defendants did take these two elephants they took that which was a material and substantial part of the plaintiffs\u2019 ticket. Row what is the result of that ? It appears to me that the result of this is, it throws upon the defendants the burden of proving that their ticket did not deceive the purchaser so that they would believe that the defendants\u2019 goods were the plaintiffs\u2019 goods,\u201d and continues, quoting James, L. J., in <em>Ford </em>v. Foster, L. R., 7 Ch., 623, to the same effect, and O\u2019Hagan, L. J , in <em>Singer Machine Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R., 3 App. Cas., 395, \u201cIf one man will use a name, the use of which has been validly appropriated by another, he ought to use it under such circumstances and with such sufficient precaution that the reasonable probability of error should be avoided, notwithstanding the want of care and caution which is so commonly exhibited in the course of human affairs.\u201d This language of O\u2019Hagan, L. J., has been quoted with approval by the courts of highest authority both in England and America, and has been lately adopted by this court in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra. </em>The defendants appealed, and in the Court of Appeal Cotton, L. J., said (13 Ch. Div., 457), \u201c Then we come to the question, is the use of this ticket, on goods exported by the defendants, calculated to lead to their goods being mistaken for those of the plaintiffs, or I may add to lead to their goods being sold under the name under which the plaintiffs\u2019 goods had frequently been sold, because that is really the same thimg ? * * * The conclusion at which I have arrived is this, that the defendants either originally adopted that ticket with knowledge of the'facts, from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the intention to mislead must be imputed to them, or at all, events, if that is not so, that they persisted in the desire to continue to use that ticket when they did know the facts from which it was probable that the ticket, if used, would deceive. Therefore, in my opinion, the judgment of Mr. Justice Fry is right, and must be affirmed.\u201d On subsequent appeal to the House of Lords, Watson,L. J.,said: \u201cApart from all questions as to <em>bonafides </em>or <em>mala fides </em>of the appellants, I am disposed to hold that the circumstances to which I adverted afford sufficient ground for an injunction against the appellants. When a prominent and substantial part of a long and well-known trade-mark, denoting the manufacture of a particular firm, appears as the prominent and substantial part of the new trade-mark of a rival, it seems reasonable to anticipate that the goods of the latter may be mistaken for and sold as the manufacture of the firm to which the other trade-mark belongs.\u201d L. R., 7 App. Gas., 231. In the case of <em>Seixo </em>v. Provezende, L. R., 1 Ch., 192, the plaintiff and defendant used marks the similarity of winch consisted solely in the use of the word Seixo, which was the name of the plaintiff\u2019s vineyard, and by which the defendants claimed that their vineyard was also called. But Lord Chancellor Oranworth said that, even assuming that to be true, it did not justify the defendants in adopting a device or brand, the probable effect of which was to mislead the public, and added: \u201cI do not consider actual physical resemblance to be the sole question for consideration. If the goods of a manufacturer have, from the mark or device he has used, become known in the market by a particular name, I think that the adoption by a rival trader of any mark which will cause his goods to bear the same name in the market may be as much a violation of the rights of that rival as the actual copy of his device.\u201d Here the defendants, knowing the plaintiff\u2019s goods to have been distinguished for years as \u201c Wm. Rogers goods,\u201d and knowing that the stamp proposed to be used would cause their goods to be known in the market by the same name, contracted with a Wm. Rogers, for the purpose of availing themselves of the name Wm. Rogers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>.as a pretended trade-mark upon a portion of their flat ware. Their goods have become known as \u201c Wm. Rogers goods,\u201d and \u201c the effect of the use of his name was soon manifest in the increased and increasing sale of their goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-5\"><em>Fourth. </em>The defendant\u2019s infringement is not to be justified or excused by reason of the contract between the defendant and William Rogers. Let us state the defendant\u2019s claim under this head as it really is when stripped of its dress and viewed in its nakedness. It is this: The plaintiff alleges and proves that the defendant has so imitated the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark that goods bearing the defendant\u2019s simulated stamp will be readily taken by some purchasers who wish to buy the plaintiff\u2019s goods. The defendant replies that he has a right to so imitate the plaintiff\u2019s trademark because he has hired William Rogers, the son of his father, who possesses in a greater or less degree the skill of his father, to supervise his, the defendant\u2019s, manufacture, and he produces the deceptive imitation only by putting on his, the defendant\u2019s, goods the name of the man he has employed to supervise. Or the proposition may be concisely stated thus : If one has a trade-mark of which a personal name forms a part, his rival in business may pirate that trade-mark, provided he employs in his factory a superintendent who happens to possess the same name. The statement of the claim is its sufficient answer. No attendant circumstances can help out its inherent absurdity. It is the goods, of Simpson, Hall, Miller &amp; Co. that bear this deceptive imitation. They are in no sense the goods of William Rogers. He has no interest in them, direct or contingent. He neither makes nor sells them; he is an overseer, a supervisor; that and nothing more. .If a man uses his own name as a stamp upon his own goods in a legitimate business way with no extrinsic deception it may be the doctrine of this court in <em>Rogers &amp; Bro. </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>that he cannot be enjoined, though his goods are thereby passed as the goods of another; but it does not follow that a manufacturer may put the name of another on his goods and thus pass them as the goods of some one else in the market. Under no imagina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ble circumstances will a defendant be permitted thus to use another name as a stamp. The limit in this direction is, certainly reached in the doctrine that a man may use his own name in Ms own business, whatever the result may be, so long as he intends no fraud. There is a shoreless and bottomless pit between that statement and the claim that a man may use another\u2019s name in Ms own business, or that a man may use his own name in another\u2019s business, no matter what the results may be. It has sometimes been argued that <em>Meriden Britannia Co. </em>v. Parker, 39 Conn., 450, justifies the theory that there can be a trade-mark the title to which depends upon supervision. No such doctrine is to be found in that or any other case. The reference to supervision is only to answer the defendant\u2019s claim that when the Meriden Britannia Company said to the public that the goods stamped \u201c 1847 Rogers Bros. Al \u201d were manufactured by Rogers Bros., it was not such a material misrepresentation as disentitled the plaintiff to relief, because in fact and M truth the Rogers Bros., or some of them, supervised the manufacture of the goods. To assume that supervision may be the foundation of title to a trade-mark, and to attempt to jump from that to the assumption that supervision may be a justification of infrmgement, requires a wonderful amount of confidence. Trade-marks do not pass by inheritance. If they did, they would not pass to the eldest son alone. William Rogers inherited no trade-mark from his father. He cannot sell, for he does not own, his father\u2019s reputation; for the same reason, if for no other, he can not use or sell his father\u2019s name. If he has skill in the business which his father pursued, that skill may justly be the ground of compensation by Ms employer, but cannot be used by Ms employer or by himself to deceive others. The question is not whether, there being no other and prior trade-mark contaiMng the words \u201c Wm. Rogers \u201d in the field, Simpson, Hall, Miller &amp; Co. might under its contract with William Rogers put his name on its goods and thus acquire a good trade-mark as against new comers. Probably under the authority of <em>Meriden Britannia Co. </em>v. <em>Parker </em>it could, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the question is whether, there being such prior trade-mark in the field, it can under its contract with William Rogers infringe such prior trade-mark, and that ease is authority in point that it cannot. According to that case, though Parker was enjoined at the instance of the Meriden Britannia Company, the latter corporation could have been enjoined at the instance of Rogers &amp; Bro. of Waterbury, prior occupants of the field.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-5\"><em>Fifth. </em>The right of the plaintiff, as against this defendant, is perfect as to both of its trade-marks; but if William Rogers, Jr., were himself defendant, he would, upon the facts found, be estopped to deny the exclusive right of the plaintiff to the trade-mark \u201c Wm. Rogers Mfg. Co.\u201d This was the name of the original copartnership, taken by contract with Wm. Rogers, Sr., and has been used by the co-partnership and the plaintiff, without question or objection from either father or son, ever since its adoption in 1867. It is found that Rogers has several times complained of the use by the plaintiff of the stamp Wm. Rogers &amp; Son, claiming it to be his personal mark, but no complaint is found because of the use of \u201c Wm. Rogers Mfg. Co.\u201d This is the trade-mark which gave name to the goods as \u201c Wm. Rogers goods.\u201d Had they been called after the other they would have been \u201cWm. Rogers &amp; Son\u201d goods. Can there be upon the facts any doubt that William Rogers himself would, if personally defendant, be estopped to deny the exclusive right of the plaintiffs to the use of this mark ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-6\">C. <em>R. Ingersoll </em>and C. <em>E. </em>Mitchell, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-7\">1. William Rogers, as a manufacturer of plated-ware, would have the right to use his own name as his trade-mark, or as a part of Ms trade-mark, whatever use had been made of the same name by any other manufacturer, and it is not necessary for us to deny the right of the plaintiff to the use of the trade-mark which it claims. The fact that two men bearing the same name may each have a high and valuable reputation in the same art, and may each give Ms name to the goods of his production, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>more or less inconvenience may result from the identity of such names, is no reason for requiring one of them to withdraw from the business of such art or trade, or to give up the valuable reputation to which he is entitled, by adopting some other name by which he will lose his personal significance. And this where both the men are in full life and active business. With much less reason can this plaintiff avail itself of the reputation of the William Rogers, the father, who died in 1878, to prevent William Rogers, the son, enjoying the reputation which he has largely made for himself since the death of Ms father. In any case, the inconvenience resulting from the mere identity of business names, if it be proved (which in the present case we deny), is <em>damnum, absque </em>injuria. And tMs, too, has been settled by tMs court in <em>Rogers &amp; Brother </em>v. <em>Rogers, 5</em>3 Conn., 121. It also necessarily resulted from the decision of tMs court in <em>Meriden Britannia Co. </em>v. Parker, 39 Conn., 450, where the stamps of William, Asa and Simeon. Rogers, individually and collectively, were held to be rightfully used, although concurrently, and under circumstances causing them easily to be confounded one with another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-5\">2. William Rogers is to be regarded as standing in the position of a manufacturer of the goods under Ms contract with the defendant. The case of <em>Meriden Britannia Co. </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>above referred to, indicates the rule which distinguishes between using a name as a decoy, and forming a legitimate business alliance with a man who is celebrated in Ms art, wMch gives Mm the supervision and control of the business, and makes Mm the manufacturer in the only sense that is vitally related to the stamp. In this case the court, after referring to the contract relations between the Meriden Britannia Company and the brothers Rogers, says; \u201cWe have thus referred to the details sufficiently perhaps to show conclusively that the public were in no sense defrauded by whatever representation the trade-mark contained, and that such representation, so far as it indicated that the Rogers brothers were the manufacturers of the goods in question, was in an important sense true. All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>that the public or the trade cared to know was, that the goods were the production of their skill and experience. This fact, as it seems to us, clearly appears. The further fact that the petitioners furnished capital and machinery, employed and paid laborers, and sold the goods, is entitled to but little weight so far as this question is concerned, although it shows that, in another sense, the petitioners were the manufacturers of the goods.\u201d All that the public cares to know of the goods marked \u201c(Eagle) Win. Rogers (Star)\u201d is that they are the production of the skill and experience of the William Rogers whose name they bear. The stamp is right in saying that they are made by him in the only vital and important sense. They are his goods in respect of origin and quality, and his right to stamp them with his own name is incontrovertible unless capital is the only factor in business enterprises. What is there in the standing or conduct of the defendant which prevents it from co-operating with William Rogers in business, in the same way in which the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and the Meriden Britannia Company co-operated with him and his father, and in so doing found themselves sanctioned by established usage and protected by the courts ? But suppose we forget that this is a Rogers mark, and treat it as if it had no special genius and no distinguishing history, and suppose William Rogers is to be treated as if he had no more to do with the business than a salesman. In <em>Williams </em>v. Brooks, 50 Conn., 278, the goods of the plaintiffs, D. F. Taylor &amp; Co., had a good reputation and ready sale as \u201c Taylor\u2019s Hair-pins.\u201d The plaintiffs claimed to derive their right from a previous D. F. Taylor &amp; Co., originator of the make, just as in this case. The defendants used the mark, \u201cL. B. Taylor &amp; Co.,\u201d claiming a right to do so because Levi B. Taylor (who had been employed with his fath\u00e9r as early as 1869 in the hair-pin business) was associated with the defendant as his travelling salesman, with a remuneration depending upon the amount of sales effected by him. But there was no injunction against using the word \u201cTaylor,\u201d although the plaintiffs\u2019 goods were sold as \u201c Taylor\u2019s Hair-pins,\u201d among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>other names, and in neither opinion filed in the case is there a suggestion that L. B. Taylor might not make a contract for the use of his name for a continuing commission when he was so far connected with the business as to be its salesman, and have his rights protected under the rule that a man may do business in his own name and another may aid him in so doing. In <em>Hallett </em>v. Cumston, 110 Mass., 29, the defendant Gumston had marked pianos \u201c Hallett &amp; Cums-ton,\u201d having made an arrangement with a man by the name of Hallett, under which he claimed the right to do so. The plaintiff\u2019s name was Hallett, and he had formerly been in partnership with the defendant Cumston, making pianos marked \u201c Hallett <em>&amp; </em>Cumston.\u201d The defendant filed a demurrer, which was sustained by the court in an opinion by Judge Gray, saying: \u201cBut they had a right, acting in good faith, to use the name of any other person with his consent, whether it was or was not the same as the plaintiff\u2019s. <em>Emerson </em>v. Badger, 101 Mass., 82. This bill cannot be maintained for an unlawful use of the plaintiff\u2019s name, for want of any distinct and sufficient allegation that the defendant used the name of Hallett with intent to represent it to be the name of the plaintiff, and thereby to defraud and injure him.\u201d This case related to the use of a personal name as a trade-mark on pianos. That which it was essential to allege in the Massachusetts case is essential to be proved in the pending case; but such proof is wholly wanting. Of course we distinguish our case from cases in which the name of an unknown person is used simply to carry out a scheme of fraudulent personation. Such a case was <em>Wm. Rogers Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers &amp; Spurr Mfg. Co., </em>11 Fed. Rep., 495. There the corporation defendant had hired the use of the pretended trade-mark of two Rogerses, in whose hands the mark had never had any vitality. In that case Judge Lowell says: \u201c The history of this trade-mark is that D. 0. Rogers and George E. Rogers applied in February, 1879, to the patent office to register under the act of Congress a trade-mark consisting of the words 6 Rogers &amp; Son,\u2019 with an arrow. In the sworn application or 6 state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ment and declaration\u2019 required by law, they represented themselves as doing business at Greenfield, Massachusetts, under the firm name of Rogers &amp; Son, and declared that they intended to use the trade-mark upon table cutlery, knives, forks, etc. Mr. Grinnell of Greenfield, whom D. C. Rogers consulted upon the subject, asked him the pertinent question whether he intended .to use his trade-mark himself, or merely to trade upon, and he answered that he intended to use it in the manufacture of goods himself; and the application to the patent office conforms to tin's answer. But what the father and son did was to trade upon it; they let it out to George W. Spurr &amp; Co. for a royalty, and afterwards to the defendants for a royalty. This royalty is paid for a falsehood. The names of these Rogerses is not of the slightest value in the silver-plating business, which they never learned or practiced; nor were they ever partners, as I read the evidence, except in hiring out this trade-mark. It is impossible for this royalty to be paid for anything but the chance of purchasers supposing it to represent some other Rogerses. A court of equity cannot be expected to look with much favor upon a trade-mark thus acquired and used.\u201d A similar case is <em>Meriden Britannia Co. </em>v. Parker, 39 Conn., 450. In that case the defendant borrowed the name of C. Rogers &amp;. Bros. C. Rogers &amp; Bros, had not been spoon and fork makers at all, and did not and could not control and guarantee the quality of the defendant\u2019s goods. They had no standing in the market as spoon and fork makers; they had no connection with the business of the defendant. The purpose of the defendant was clearly to borrow a name unknown in the business to personate a name that was celebrated in the business. Of course the court took no notice of such a subterfuge, and disposed of the case as if C. Rogers &amp; Bros, had no existence. These two cases are the leading cases to sustain the proposition that the defendant may not say that he does not infringe because some person unknown in the art has lent the infringer a name which is like the name of the plaintiff; but it is needless to add that such cases throw no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>light upon the case in hand, excepting as they present facts which in their general scope and significance are the exact opposite of those which are found by the distinguished committee. And so we say that by long established usage in connection with the Rogers name, and by the decisions of the courts, William Rogers is authorized to do business in his own name, under his own stamp, and no injunction will lie against him, either directly or indirectly through the defendant. For an injunction against the defendant would be an injunction against William Rogers, and deprive the business world of the services and stamp of the only man who is to-day a skilled and recognized representative of the ancient name, and the only man whom the business world relies upon to see that the name shall remain untarnished for another generation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-5\">3. The defendant has not exceeded its right in employing circulars and advertisements. A trade-mark is addressed to the ultimate purchaser, and goes with the goods for that purpose. An advertisement or circular is addressed to those who buy direct from the manufacturers, and expends its force either in guiding or misguiding sharp and intelligent men. A somewhat different rule is therefore applicable, arising out of the fact that what would mislead an uninformed consumer would have no tendency in that direction in the mind of the intelligent trader. But nothing could exceed the painstaking care with which the defendant and William Rogers have sought to direct attention to the fact that their goods are separate from all other goods in the market, because they are the only goods manufactured under the supervision of the only living, genuine Rogers. The finding disposes entirely of the claim that the defendant made any false representation by its advertisements or circulars.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b571-6\">Pardee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ads\">This is a complaint for an infringement of a trade-mark, asking for an injunction and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Between the years 1847 and 1850 William Rogers, Sr., acquired and preserved to his death in 1873 a valuable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>reputation in the market as a skillful and honest manufacturer of silver-plated ware.

The consideration for this agreement is a commission upon sales. William Rogers, Jr., has performed his contract in every particular. The ware has been sent into the market bearing the stamp \u201c (Eagle) Wm.

Rogers \u201d are the distinctive and characteristic part.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The following are among the additional facts of the case: The defendant was well aware of the value of the name \u201c Rogers \u201d on spoons, if it represented a person who had belonged to the family of William Rogers, Sr., had been connected with him in the manufacture of silver-plated goods, and had acquired a valuable reputation in the market for skill in that art. It entered into the contract with William Rogers, Jr., for the purpose of using his name upon such goods as should be the result of his skill, and of availing itself of his taste, skill and judgment, and from the belief that consumers would regard spoons manufactured under his supervision as being the goods of a genuine Rogers, because his skill had been acquired under the instruction of William Rogers, Sr., his father. It stamped its goods \u201c (Eagle) Wm. Rogers (Star) \u201d for the purpose of informing the public that they were the product of the skill of Wm. Rogers, Jr., for the purpose of taking advantage of his reputation in the <em>market; </em>a reputation acquired because of the knowledge of the public that he had been associated with, and had acquired skill in the art from, his father and others. He had been known to the trade during many years and had acquired and retained a valuable independent reputation in the market; and goods known to have been the product of Ms skill alone had for that reason a better selling value. For the preceding thirteen years he had been almost constantly employed in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>such manufacture with the plaintiff and the Meriden Britannia Company; and both of those companies had extensively circulated his portrait in connection with that of his father and had thus brought him prominently to the notice of the trade in connection with his father. He had always insisted that his name should be used only .on goods of a certain high standard of value. He does in fact superintend the manufacture of all articles upon which his name is placed. His stamp has a high and independent value. By the terms of the contract between the defendant and \"William Rogers, Jr., the latter has the right to authenticate the goods made under his superintendence by stamping thereon his name, with such accompanying devices as he may adopt. The finding is that the stamp \u201c (Eagle) Wm. Rogers (Star) \u201d was not adopted by the defendant for the purpose of imitating the trade-mark of the plaintiff, but as a new and distinctive trade-mark indicating the personal supervision and control of William Rogers, Jr. It is also found that the arrangement is valuable to him and that it is only through the medium of this or some similar contract that he is able to make his special training in the business available to himself; also that the name of William Rogers, Jr., is not used by himself or the defendant in such association with place or marks, or symbols or signs, of forms of packages, or style or color of labels, as thereby to mislead consumers; and that the word \u201cRogers,\u201d used with or without differing symbols, is the misleading word. As a fact it does mislead many consumers who are not familiar with the marks both of the plaintiff and the defendant, and many who take no note of anything in the marks beyond the word \u201c Rogers.\u201d This the plaintiff seeks to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Passing over the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right to the exclusive use of the trade-mark which it has adopted, and assuming for the purposes of the case that the plaintiff is a person who, bearing the name William Rogers, has adopted and used his name as a trade-mark, yet the prayer for injunction \u2019must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">By the rule prevailing in this jurisdiction the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>case have been conclusively settled by the court below, acting through the instrumentality of its committee. By the finding fraud in intent or deed has been eliminated from the case. The misleading has resulted simply from the fact that the plaintiff and William Rogers, Jr., bear the same name, and that such consumers only have been confused as would not take note of the distinguishing symbols accompanying the use of the name of William Rogers, Jr., by the defendant. When the second bearer of a name uses it with due distinguishing precautions and without actual fraudulent intent or representation that his wares are those of the first, he is not responsible for such confusion as results solely from the fact of similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The law permits a manufacturer to use his name as a trade-mark. If he has the confidence of the public in his integrity and skill his name will doubtless be for some reasons the most advantageous trade-mark which he can adopt. It will be the most forcible and permanent presentation of the fact that his skill and integrity have gone into the article upon which his name is stamped. But such selection exposes him to this danger:\u2014some other person bearing the same name may be the manufacturer of similar articles and may impress it upon them, thereby creating a possibility of mistake on the part of consumers as to the origin and ownership of the article they are about to buy. The law also gives to a manufacturer the right to use his own name as a mark upon his goods although it be the same as that of another manufacturer of similar goods who has previously made his name a part of his own trade-mark, if in such use by the former there is no false representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Because of confusion resulting from the use of identical names with distinguishing symbols there is not necessarily as a matter of law a fraudulent misrepresentation; actual fraudulent intent remains to be proven as a fact. If the first appropriator of his name as a mark adopts the name simply, without any accompanying word or symbol by way of prefix or suffix, another manufacturer of similar goods having the same name may lawfully impress it upon his goods, if, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>in the ease at bar, he accompanies it by such distinguishing devices by way of prefix and suffix as that a consumer who will take note of the whole will not be misled. And if consumers who will take note of nothing but the name are misled, and there is consequent loss to either, it must be borne as the result of the act of taking a name as a trade-mark. If the first appropriator affixes such distinguishing marks, figures, symbols or words as he may lawfully subject to his exclusive use, the second may not use his name in connection with like marks, figures, symbols or words; nor with such as so closely resemble those of the first as that the association will probably mislead; nor make such use with intent to mislead. <em>Rogers &amp; Brother </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>53 Conn., 121; Brown on Trade-Marks, (2d ed.) sec. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In <em>Burgesss </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>3 D., M. &amp; G., 896, Lord Justice Turner said as follows: \u201c I concur in the opinion that this motion should be refused with costs. No man can have any right to represent his goods as the goods of another person, but in applications of this kind it must be made out that the defendant is selling his goods as the goods of another. \"When a person is selling goods under a particular name, and another person, not having that name, is using it, it may be presumed that he so uses it to represent the goods sold by himself as the goods of the person whose name he uses; but when the defendant sells goods under his own name, and it happens that the plaintiff has the same name, it does not follow that the defendant is selling his goods as the goods of the plaintiff. It is a question of evidence in each case whether there is a false representation or not.\u201d Of this, in <em>Massam </em>v. <em>Thorley\u2019s Cattle Food Co., </em>L. R., 14 Ch. Div., 748, James, L. J., said as follows: \u201c That I take to be an accurate statement of the law, and to have been adopted by the House of Lords in <em>Wotherspoon </em>v. <em>Currie, </em>L. R., 5 H. L., 508, in which the House of Lords differed from the view that I had taken in that case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In Sebastian upon the Law of Trade-Marks, p. 25 et seq., it is said as follows: \u201c The impossibility of a single manufacturer being allowed to arrogate to himself the exclusive use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>of a name which, he shares in common with many other persons is apparent; and from this circumstance the rule was deduced that while, as against persons bearing a different name, a manufacturer\u2019s right in his name trade-mark is absolute and exclusive, as against persons bearing the same name no such exclusive right can be set up. Thus in <em>Dence </em>v. Mason, Sebastian\u2019s Digest, 584, Maliks, Y. C., held that during the continuance of the partnership between two persons named Mason and Brand, they could not be prevented from using the latter\u2019s name in their business, notwithstanding that it was well known in connection with a similar old established business; and the Court of Appeal held that the same would be the case if a new <em>bond fide </em>partnership should be formed. This rule must, however, be qualified by the statement that where a person uses his own name for the purpose of fraud, and satisfactory evidence of fraudulent intention can be produced, such unfair conduct will be restrained, even though the free use of the man\u2019s own name may be thereby hindered, and the criminal law also admits of the punishment of such fraudulent uses of a man\u2019s own name. A valuable statement of the law was made by Lord Craighill in the Scottish Court of Session, in <em>Dunnachil </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Sons, </em>in which he said: \u2018 The name of a person may be a trade-mark; there may be other manufacturers of goods of the same description, and the latter are not precluded from placing their own names on their goods by reason of the fact that this name has already become the trademark of another ma2iufacturer. The only condition they must fulfil is, that the name as used by tliem shall be accompanied with something which shall be a distinction, if the bare name would lead to the deception of the public and the injury of the trader on whose goods the name first appeared as a trade mark.\u2019 And in the Uew York case of <em>England </em>v. <em>The New York Publishing Co., </em>8 Daly, 375, Daly, C. J., said:\u2014 The fact that a man has used his own name to designate the article he produces, and that the name has become valuable to him through the article becoming extensively known, gives hirh no right to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>any other man of the same name from affixing his name upon the same kind of article, if he manufactures it. The test is, whether he uses the name honestly and fairly in the ordinary prosecution of his business, or dishonestly, to palm off his own commodity as the production of another.\u2019 \u201d And on pp. 226 et seq. as follows:\u2014\u201c It was formerly sometimes supposed, and was held by the late Master of the Rolls and the Court of Appeal in <em>Singer Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R., 2 Ch. Div., 234, that for an action to restrain the use of a trade-name to be successful fraud must be proved; on the ground that when a trade-mark was once affixed to the goods it passed with the goods from hand to hand, thus silently repeating to each successive purchaser the original misrepresentation of the original infringer, while the improper use of a name not affixed to the goods was not the necessary consequence of being in possession of marked goods, but was the individual act of each person who used it in respect of the goods ; so that there might be held to be an infringement of a trade-mark when, in analogous circumstances, there would be no infringement of a trade-name. And when the case of <em>Singer Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R., 3 App. Cas., 376, was remitted by the House of Lords to the Court of First Instance, on the ground of insufficiency of evidence, some of the law peers seem to have thought that different principles of law might possibly be applicable to trade-marks and trade-names. But Lord Cairns, Chancellor, said, \u201c It may well be that if an imitated trade-mark is attached to the article manufactured, there will from that circumstance be the certainty that- it will pass into every hand into which the article passes, and be thus a continuing and ever present representation with regard to it; but a representation made by advertisements that the articles sold at a particular shop are articles manufactured by A. B., (if that is the legitimate effect of the advertisements, which is a separate question,) must, in my opinion, be as injurious in principle, and may possibly be quite as injurious in operation, as the same representation made upon the articles themselves; and in <em>Singer Manufac</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>taring Co. </em>v. <em>Loog, </em>L. R., 8 App. Cases, 15, Lord Blackburn took the view that the law of trade-marks and trade-names, when not affected by legislation, was the same. Whether there is or is not property in a trade-name, as Lord Blackburn suggested, it is a fraud on the part of one person to attract to himself the custom intended for another, by a false representation, direct or indirect, that the business carried on by himself is identical with that of the other person by whose ability and exertions the name has acquired the reputation it possesses. The question is not whether the defendant\u2019s business is represented as being similar to the plaintiff\u2019s, but whether it is represented as being that very identical business. If such a false representation has been made, whatever may have been the motive of the persons making it, when proceedings are taken in consequence of it, all the court requires is to be satisfied that the names are so similar as to be calculated to produce confusion between the two\u2014so calculated to do it that, when it is drawn to the attention of those adopting the name complained of that that would be the result, it is not honest for them to persevere in their intention, though originally the intention might not have been otherwise than honest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The cited remark of Lord Blackburn was made by him in determining a case in which the defendant neither bore nor had acquired any right to use the name of \u201c Singer,\u201d the distinctive and conspicuous portion of the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark. <em>Singer Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Loog, </em>L. R., 8 App. Cases, 15; and such is the fact in <em>Singer Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R., 2 Ch. Div., 434; and we think we are correct when we say that the same fact pertains to all of the cases cited by Mr. Sebastian, and that neither the citations nor his comments concern cases where the question is between parties bearing the same name.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">By the law applicable to the facts established by the finding, William Rogers, Jr., as a manufacturer of silver-plated ware, had the right to impress thereon the stamp complained of; had the right to contract with the defendant that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>should make the ware for him under his supervision, he to receive, stamp and sell it for himself; the defendant to receive a percentage of the profits for its labor and its capital; he a percentage for his skill, supervising labor and valuable reputation in the market\u2014his capital. By the present contract the defendant furnishes machinery and materials; William Rogers, Jr., the supervising labor and skill, the valuable reputation and stamp, and defends the use of the latter; the defendant sells the ware, and receives payment therefor; the profits are divided. Under one mode he would sell, and take the risk of payment; under the other the defendant would sell and take that risk; the same rule for division of profits presumably would obtain under either mode. The law regarding substance more than form will not withhold from him in one of these modes what it would concede to him in the other. The law does not find in the mode in which he makes his skill, integrity and valuable reputation available as his capital, any sufficient reason for barring him from access to the public and from the resulting profits. Hiss kill and supervising labor have gone into the ware bearing the stamp complained of; it is equal in quality to that of the plaintiff; as between him and the plaintiff, the question being as to his right to go into the market with his own name, the putting of his supervising skill and labor into the work, with the reception of a share of resulting profits, constitutes him a manufacturer thereof in the eye of the law. It is not a legal prerequisite that all of the capital and all of the profits shall belong to him; consumers have the result of his skill and integrity; and to them that is all there is in the word \u201cmanufacturer\u201d; he determines the kind, form, quality and value of the ware; it is his creation; the defendant simply executes his commands. Indee\u00b0d, it must be a matter of indifference to the plaintiff as to which of these modes of reaching the market he shall adopt. Therefore, passing by the form, and going directly to the substance, we take the case as if of record William Rogers, Jr., were defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>In no other way can the real question be reached and disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">If any person or corporation shall hereafter place upon the market silver-plated ware bearing a stamp the conspicuous and valuable part of which shall be the word \u201c Rogers,\u201d and therefore hable to mislead consumers as to the origin and ownership of the same, the right to do so can be subjected to the test of judicial investigation and determination. If the judgment is that a person having the same name as that which this plaintiff has rightfully adopted and used, and a valuable name and reputation in the market for skill \u25a0 and integrity in the manufacture of silver-plated ware, has made an arrangement with a person or corporation having capital, by means of which, upon a division of profits, he can gain access to the market and make his skill and name available to himself and beneficial to the public; that there is no intent upon the part of either to mislead consumers; that there has been no use of the name in association with misleading signs, words, figures or symbols; and that in fact consumers are not misled by anything except the presence of the word \u201c Rogers,\u201d and the omission to note distinguishing symbols, the law does not condemn the arrangement. The injurious result is one of the disadvantages assumed by the person on whom it falls when he selected a personal name as his mark. The objection on the part of the plaintiff at this point rests not upon any legal principle, but upon its distrust as to the ability of the court to detect and prevent fraud. But it is to be remembered that contests between persons bearing the same name as to their right respectively to stamp it upon goods, turn largely upon the intent; that it is a question of fact; and that courts have been and presumably will continue to be equal to the determination of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">It is the argument of the plaintiff that its goods became known in the market as \u201c Rogers goods j \u201d that the defendant\u2019s goods are also known by the same designation; and, therefore, that the latter should be enjoined. But the disadvantages attending the choice of the name of a person as a mark affect every result flowing from such choice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>speech, of the market, calling the plaintiff\u2019s goods \u201c Rogers goods,\u201d is only the spoken trade-mark of consumers in repetition of the one stamped upon the ware, induced by that. If William Rogers, Jr., has a right to put the name \u201c Rogers \u201d on similar ware, that right cannot be affected by the fact that consumers apply the same spoken trade-mark to it; he is not to be injuriously affected by any use the public may make of a mark which the law allows him to use. The plaintiff has no greater right to prevent the misleading of consumers in the matter of calling the goods of both \u201c Rogers goods \u201d than it has to prevent the same result in the matter of using identical names accompanied by differing symbols as stamps. The mischief is the same in origin, kind and degree. If the plaintiff had impressed the form of two elephants upon its ware as its trade-mark, neither the defendant nor William Rogers, Jr., would have the right to so impress two elephants upon ware as to mislead consumers as to the origin and ownership of the goods. If byreasonof the plaintiff\u2019s mark its goods had come to be known in the market as \u201c two elephant goods,\u201d neither the defendant nor William Rogers, Jr., would have the right to so mark goods as that they should come to be similarly known. William Rogers, Jr., has a right to the use of his own name; but he has no right whatever to the use of the form of two elephants in such manner as to interfere with the right of the first appropriator of that device. He would be a trespasser from the beginning in a forbidden field; and without necessity or excuse, for every other form in nature is at his service; and this regardless of his intent; and even if he had done it in ignorance that the device had been appropriated by another.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The first count in the complaint charges the defendant with the publication of an advertisement to the effect that it is a manufacturer of the celebrated William Rogers, Sr., spoons, forks and knives. The finding is that the defendant knew that the use of the mark and the publication of the advertisement would cause its goods to be known in the market as \u201c Wm. Rogers goods; \u201d but the advertisement was not intended or calculated to induce the public to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>believe that the goods so designated were manufactured by the plaintiff. The purpose of the publication was to direct public attention to the fact that the manufacture of its goods was controlled by William Rogers, Jr., whose name they bear, and to the celebrity of its goods because of his supervising still and reputation. Upon the facte, the defendant by permission from William Rogers, Jr., for its own advantage and for his as well, has availed itself of whatever right he had to use his own name, with cautionary accompanying devices, for the honest purpose and intent of informing consumers that his labor and supervising still have gone into the manufacture of spoons at the manufactory of the defendant at Wallingford. The word \u201cRogers,\u201d regardless of the devices, is the sole source of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The portion of the defendant\u2019s circular complained of in the second count is as follows: \u201c Sectional Plated Spoons and Forks\u2014(Eagle) Wm. Rogers X 12. Triple plated upon all points exposed to wear. Plated by the method invented by Wm. Rogers in 1855, who was the original inventor of Sectional Plate. Wm. Rogers, (since 1878,) Wallingford, Conn., formerly of Hartford and West Meriden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The finding is that it \u201cis not misleading to a person familiar with the facts stated therein and with the fact that William Rogers, Sr., died in 1873 5 but persons not so familiar might be led by it to suppose that the William Rogers who was the inventor of sectional plate in 1856, was in the employ of the defendant at the time the circular was printed \u201d in 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Upon the finding these statements are true <em>1 </em>and there is no finding that they were made with the fraudulent intent to mislead the public into the belief that the goods so advertised were those of the plaintiff, and, as in all of the other parts of the ease, upon the last analysis the confusion is found to reside in the fact that two manufacturers bearing the same name, having equal skill and reputation in the same art, have each stamped his name upon his goods with distinctive symbols. As has been said, having equal rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>under such circumstances they must share both the advantages and disadvantages of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The Superior Court is advised to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In this opinion Carpenter and Granger, Js., concurred. Park, C. J., and Loomis, J., concurred fully in the legal principles laid down in the opinion, but thought that, under the arrangement made by William Rogers, Jr., with the defendant company for the manufacture and sale of the ware stamped in the manner in question, he could not be regarded as standing in the position of a manufacturer of the ware.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
