INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">By an order dated March 7, 2011, the court consolidated a series , of securities fraud class action lawsuits filed against the Wilmington Trust Corporation (\u201cWTC\u201d) and related defendants. (D.I. 26) A consolidated class action complaint was filed on May 16, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (D.I. 39) On March 29, 2012, the court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss without prejudice. (D.I. 86, D.I. 86) Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on May 10, 2012. (D.I. 88) Before briefing was completed on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, by stipulation and order, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint adding information into their pleading obtained from unsealed FBI affidavits in connection with a criminal investigation into Michael Zimmerman (\u201cZimmerman\u201d), a prominent Delaware real estate developer. (D.I. 115; D.I. 116; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>D.I. 120) Again before briefing was completed on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the third amended complaint, by stipulation and order, plaintiffs supplemented their pleading and filed the fourth amended complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d), incorporating information obtained from an unsealed Criminal Information (\u201cC.I.\u201d) and Plea against Joseph Terranova (\u201cTerranova\u201d), a former Vice President/Division Manager of the Delaware Commercial Real Estate Division and a senior Relationship Manager at the WTC. (D.I. 143; D.I. 144; D.I. 149) The FAC contains seven counts, four under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a (\u201cthe Exchange Act\u201d), and three under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a (\u201cthe Securities Act\u201d). (D.I. 149) Presently before the court are defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the FAC. (D.I. 158; D.I. 160; D.I. 162; D.I. 164; D.I. 166) The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77v and 78aa and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Avb\">A. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Lead plaintiffs in this suit are institutional investors (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) that purchased WTC common stock between January 18, 2008 and November 1, 2010 (\u201cthe class period\u201d). (D.I. 149 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-30) Plaintiffs brought Exchange Act claims against WTC, a bank headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware during the class period <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 31-34), and defendant KPMG, WTC\u2019s outside auditor since 2003 <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 51). Plaintiffs also brought suit against the \u201cofficer defendants\u201d who signed WTC\u2019s registration statement and documents incorporated into the offering documents,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as the \u201caudit committee defendants\u201d who signed WTC\u2019s registration statement and documents incorporated into the offering documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Plaintiffs brought Securities Act claims against WTC, KPMG, certain officer defendants (Cecala, Foley, Harra, and Gibson) and the audit committee defendants. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 392^02) Also named as defendants were non-audit committee board members. Rakowski served as senior vice president and the controller of WTC from 2006 through the class period. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 395) Rakowski signed the WTC\u2019s registration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> statement, as well as the 2007, 2008, and 2009 10-Ks, which were then incorporated into the offering documents. <em>(Id.) </em>Mears served as a director of WTC since 1992 and was a member of the board at the time of the filing of the offering documents. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 397) Mears also signed the WTC\u2019s registration statement and its two amendments, as well as the 2007, 2008, and 2009 10-Ks, which were then incorporated into the offering documents. <em>(Id.) </em>DuPont served as a director from 2006 through October 2009 and signed WTC\u2019s registration statement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 2007 and 2008 \u00cd0-Ks, which were incorporated into the offering documents. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 398) Freeh served as a director beginning in 2009 and signed the 2009 10-K which was incorporated into the offering documents. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 399) J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (\u201cJP Morgan\u201d) and Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc. (\u201cKBW\u201d), joint underwriters for the offering, were also named as defendants. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 401-402)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">1. Officer defendants</p>\n<p id=\"AZ9\">The officer defendants include Cecala, Foley, Gibson, Harra, and North. <em>(Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u00b6\u00b6 35-40) Cecala served as WTC\u2019s chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) from July 1996 until June 3, 2010; he was also the chairman of the board from 1996 until July 19, 2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 35) Eoley replaced Cecala as CEO and chairman of the board. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 36) Gibson served as WTC\u2019s chief financial officer from 1997 until November of 2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 37) Harra served as the executive vice president of WTC from 1992 until 1996 and as president from 1996 through the class period; he also served as the chief operating officer from 1996 until 2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 38) North served as the chief credit officer at WTC from 2004 until July 2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 39)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">2. Audit committee defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The audit committee defendants include Burger, Elliott, Krug, Mobley, Rollins, Ro-selle, Sockwell, Tunnell, and Whiting. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 41-50) Burger served as a director on WTC\u2019s board from 1991 through the class period. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 42) Burger served on the audit committee from 2001 to 2004 and 2008 through the class period (chair from 2001 to 2004 and 2010). <em>{Id.) </em>Elliott was a director from 1997 until 2010 and he served on the audit committee during 2007 and 2008 (2007 chair). <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 43) Krug was a director from 2004 through the class period and served on the audit committee from 2007 until 2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 44) Mobley served as a director from 1991 until 2010 and was on the audit committee in 2009. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 45) Rollins served as a director from 2007 until May of 2010; she was a member of the audit committee from 2007 to 2009. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 46) Roselle was a director from 1991 until 2009 and worked on the audit committee from 2007-2009. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 47) Sockwell was a director from 2007 to 2010 and served on the audit committee from 2008-2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 48) Tunnell was a director from 1992 through the class period and was a member of the audit committee from 2007 until 2008 and in 2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 49) Whiting was a director from 2005 through the class period and a member of the audit committee in 2010. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 50)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">3. WTC background</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">WTC had four primary business segments: regional banking; corporate client services; wealth advisory services; and affiliate money managers. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 32) WTC\u2019s regional banking segment, whose predominant business was the origination of commercial loans, is the focus of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. <em>{Id.) </em>WTC\u2019s commercial loans fell into three categories: commercial real estate construction; commercial, financial and agricultural loans; and commercial mortgages. <em>{Id.) </em>As of December 31, 2008, the commercial loan balance was 70% of WTC\u2019s total loan portfolio and as of December 31,2009, it was 74%. <em>{Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, \u201csince its founding in 1903,\u201d WTC distinguished itself from other financial institutions as a \u201cconservative\u201d regional lender. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 52) With the emergence of the financial crisis in 2008, WTC continued to highlight its conservatism, claiming in its 2008 annual report that \u201cit had \u2018succeeded across 105 years of economic cycles\u2019 because it \u2018manage[d] risk conservatively.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id.) </em>WTC did this by using \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201cconsistent\u201d underwriting procedures and asset review, leading investors to describe it as risk adverse. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 57) While this may have been the public persona WTC created and attempted to maintain, plaintiffs claim that WTC\u2019s lending practices were actually part of a \u201cmassive criminal conspiracy that \u2018fraudulently concealed] the Bank\u2019s true financial condition\u2019 and \u2018deceivefd] regulators and the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 1) .</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">On November, 1, 2010, WTC announced that it was being acquired by M &amp; T for approximately $3.84 per share, only half its trading price of the previous day, $7.11 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>share. WTC released its third quarter 2010 results, reporting a quarterly net loss of $365.3 million (more than a 200% increase from the loss reported in the second quarter of 2010). <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 198-200) The market reaction was swift, with WTC stock prices dropping to $4.21 on November 1, 2010, causing losses to investors. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 205-209)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">B. The Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">As to the Exchange Act, plaintiffs allege violations of Section 10(b) against WTC, Cecala, Foley, Gibson, Harra, and North; violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against KPMG; violations of Section 20(a) against Cecala, Foley, Gibson, Harra, and North; and violations of Section 20(a) against the audit committee defendants. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 341-86) As to the Securities Act, plaintiffs allege violations of Section 11 against WTC, Cecala, Foley, Gibson, Har-ra, Rakowski, Burger, Elliott, Krug, Mob-ley, Rollins, Sockwell, Tunnell, Whiting, Mears, duPont, Roselle, Freeh, KPMG, J.P. Morgan and KBW; violations of Section 12(a)(2) against WTC, J.P. Morgan and KBW; and violations of Section 15 against Foley, Cecala, Gibson, Harra, Ra-kowski, Burger, duPont, Elliott, Freeh, Krug, Mears, Mobley, Rollins, Roselle, Sockwell, Tunnell, and Whiting. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 387-477)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">C. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Plaintiffs allege that the Cl evidences that WTC\u2019s most senior officers engaged in an \u201coverarching bank fraud conspiracy\u201d that was designed to \u201cfraudulently conceal the [WTC]\u2019s true financial condition in many ways,\u201d including by \u201ccausing [WTC] to misrepresent its reporting of past due and nonperforming loans.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 54) WTC misstated its past due and nonperforming loans by $105 million, or 35% of its total past due and nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2008.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 70-72, 220-27) WTC \u201cwaived\u201d matured, past due loans by falsely claiming that it was \u201cin the process of\u2019 extending the loans. However, WTC did not obtain updated appraisals for the loans, as required by federal law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and its own policies. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64-66) WTC knew that it could not extend the loans without these updated appraisals, which its officers knew would have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for WTC. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 74-75) WTC thus reported low amounts of past due loans in its quarterly and annual SEC filings, a key credit metric that indicated to inventors that the credit quality of the portfolio was strong. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 53, 59) The amount of reported past due loans directly impacted WTC\u2019s reported reserve, i.e., the amount of money it set aside each quarter to cover probable losses in its loan portfolio, and its income. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63) Therefore, as past due loans increased, the reserve increased, and WTC\u2019s income decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 58, 62-63) '</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">Many of the .extensions occurred in the final days of 2009, so that WTC would not have to report its true past due loan figures in its year-end financial statements. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 82) For example, on December 30, 2009, Terranova requested that the loan committee (which included Cecala, <em>Harra, </em>and North) extend multiple loans, with an outstanding balance of $94 million, from a single borrower, until April 2010. <em>(Id.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Many of these loans had been delinquent and \u201cin the process of extension\u201d for months. <em>(Id.) </em>Cecala, Harra, and North approved the requested extension on the same day, without requiring updated appraisals and despite the fact that the borrower had never executed the extension documents that formed the basis of the request. <em>(Id.) </em>When the loans were not repaid, Terranova requested on March 31, 2010 that the loan committee \u201creaffirm\u201d this extension until December 31, 2010. <em>(Id.) </em>Terranova offered no reason for the \u201creaffirmed\u201d extension other than to state, \u201c[d]ue to timing issues, the extension documents were never executed by the ... borrower.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Again, the loan committee approved the extension, without requesting updated appraisals for these loans or any other required information. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In 2009, WTC \u201cmass extended\u201d $1,744 billion of past due and soon-to-be-past due loans, without obtaining the necessary appraisals. This mass extension, approved by WTC\u2019s loan committee (chaired by North), served to eliminate the loans from WTC\u2019s financial statements. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 80-83) The failure to report the past due loans rendered WTC\u2019s publicly reported financial statements to be materially false. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 162-67) For example, WTC\u2019s \u201c2009 Form 10-K, [filed with the SEC in February 2010], which was incorporated into the Proxy Statement for [WTC\u2019s] Offering did not include [WTC\u2019s] true past due number and was therefore false....\u201d <em>(Id.' </em>at \u00b6 403) Specifically, this false reporting led the market to believe WTC\u2019s loan portfolio was in good condition and that WTC had adequate reserves. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 162-67)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Plaintiffs allege certain emails evidence that senior officers (including Cecala, Har-ra, Gibson, and North) knew that WTC was misstating its past due loans through the class period. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 73-79) Further, officer defendants were well aware of the underreporting, as internal delinquency reports were compiled on a monthly basis, provided to North, and circulated to Cecala, Harra, and Gibson. Under Gibson\u2019s direction, the \u201cwaived\u201d loans were removed from the delinquency reports and then the past due list (used for WTC\u2019s publicly reported past due loan figures) was prepared. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 64-67)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">WTC emphasized in SEC filings its \u201crigorous\u201d underwriting standards and its \u201cregular[ ] review of all past due loans\u201d to \u201cmitigate credit risk.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 91, 135, 161) In the SEC filings, WTC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">One of our primary risks is credit risk (the risk that borrowers will be unable to repay their loans). To mitigate this risk, we:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u2022 Employ rigorous loan underwriting standards and apply them consistently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u2022 Monitor the portfolio to identify potential problems and to avoid disproportionately high concentrations in any single industry sector or to any one borrower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">\u2022 Regularly review all past-due loans, loans not being repaid according to contractual terms, and loans we doubt will be paid on a timely basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">(D.I. 150, ex. 1 at 44-45 (2008 10-K) (emphasis omitted); D.I. 150, ex. 5 at 49-50 (2009 10-K) Contrary to this portrayal, WTC extended loans to borrowers without any consideration of borrower\u2019s ability to repay loans. (D.I. 149 at \u00b6\u00b6 92-110) The 10% rule, a WTC policy, allowed loan officers to extend additional credit to certain borrowers in an amount up to 10% of their existing credit, which policy Terranoya and his eoconspirators fraudulently violated by \u201cextending new credit to clients to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>existing loan interest payments current.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 54, 92)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">As of March 2010, Zimmerman, a prominent Delaware real estate developer and one of WTC\u2019s largest and most important borrowers, had 75 loans outstanding, totaling nearly $100 million \u2014 an amount that constituted almost 6% of the WTC\u2019s total construction loan portfolio. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 111) Terranova managed Zimmerman\u2019s relationship with WTC. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 54) Many of WTC\u2019s loans to Zimmerman were made \u201con Zimmerman\u2019s informal requests\u201d without \u201csupporting documentation to confirm that Zimmerman had met the- terms of the loan agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 112) The loan committee \u201capproved a $10 million loan to Zimmerman to purchase and construct a development ...

First, the complaint must \u201cspecify each allegedly misleading statement, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation is made on information and belief, all facts supporting that belief with particularity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l)).

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">a. Material misrepresentation or omission</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Plaintiffs allege the following material misstatements or omissions. WTC fraudulently understated the true amount of its past due loans in its SEC filings, which emphasized that \u201cone of [WTC]\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>primary risks is credit risk (the risk that borrowers will be unable to repay their loans).\u201d <em>(See, e.g., </em>D.I. 150, ex. 1 at 44 (2008 10-K); ex. 5 at 50 (2009 10-K)) The amount of past due loans is a key financial metric, reflecting whether loans are being repaid and impacting the credit quality of WTC\u2019s loan portfolio and its financial condition. Further, the reported amount of past due loans directly impacted WTC\u2019s reported reserve, i.e., if past due loans increased, the reserve increased, and WTC\u2019s income decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis. WTC also improperly \u201cwaived\u201d a substantial amount of past due loans by falsely claiming that the loans were being extended, without obtaining updated loan appraisals. These misstatements are material. <em>See e.g., Shapiro v. UJB Fin. Corp., </em>964 F.2d 272, 281 (3d Cir.1992) (stating that \u201c[i]n our view a reasonable investor would be influenced significantly by knowledge that a bank has knowingly or recklessly hidden its true financial status by deliberately misstating its level of non-performing loans, failing to provide adequate reserves, and indulging its problem loan customers\u201d); <em>Lewis v. Straka, </em>535 F.Supp.2d 926, 930 (E.D.Wis.2008) (citing material facts including misstating \u201cthe volume of nonperforming loans, the inadequacy of loan loss reserves, the inefficiency of internal lending controls and safeguards, [and] that [the bank] often extended rather than wrote off large nonperforming loans\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">WTC misrepresented in its financial statements that its reserve was set in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). (D.I. 149 at \u00b6 164) The FAC identifies the Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, \u201cAccounting for Contingencies\u201d (\u201cFAS 5\u201d) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, \u201cSelected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and Documentation Issues\u201d (\u201cSAB 102\u201d), explaining how defendants violated these by, for example, not taking \u201cinto account \u2018all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectability,\u2019 including \"trends in loan losses, economic conditions, and [WTC]\u2019s underwriting standards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 163-72) Defendants\u2019 argument that they complied with GAAP because WTC used a different loan classification system to set the reserve than the one used to report WTC\u2019s past due loans does not pass muster, when the Cl evidences that WTC concealed the past due loans to avoid a negative impact on the reserve. Further, \u201cafter performing extensive due diligence and analysis of [WTC]\u2019s loan portfolio as of January 2008, M &amp; T determined that [WTC] had understated its Loan Loss Reserve by nearly $800 million.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 162, 164, 166, 232-33, 413)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Defendants argue that WTC adequately disclosed credit quality throughout the class period and \u201cno reasonable investor would have relied on loan classifications in this context.\u201d However, the examples of these disclosures provided by plaintiffs are immediately followed by reassurances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">Due to the economic environment, non[ ]accruing loans, past-due loans, ... increased significantly from their 2007 levels.... The 2007 levels were moderately higher than the 2006 levels, as the regional economy began to soften.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">On a percentage basis, the composition of the loan portfolio remained well diversified and relatively unchanged. There are discussions of our commercial real estate ... elsewhere in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">We maintain an internal risk rating system that classifies all loans ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">We apply these classifications consistently .and we analyze migrations within the classifications quarterly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>This system has helped us develop adequate reserves for loan losses for many years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">(D.I. 168, ex. 2 at 45 (2008 Annual Report)) Reading the statements in context as defendants suggest does not lead to a conclusion of adequate disclosures. As discussed above, WTC made clear to investors that it mitigated credit risk. Moreover, investors were not receiving all of the available information as WTC was concealing its true financial position. <em>Cf. In re Am. Bus. Fin. Servs., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>413 F.Supp.2d 378, 401 (E.D.Pa.2005) (finding that defendant\u2019s optimistic statements are. typical of puffery and \u201c[r]ead in context with all of the information available to investors, defendants\u2019 alleged misleading statements are immaterial, .... [as] the company\u2019s publications also alerted investors to the fact that the company faced challenges in maintaining its low delinquency rates due to changes in economic conditions\u201d); <em>Grossman v. Novell, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 1112, 1121 (10th Cir.1997) (finding that in context, \u201cstatements [would be] considered immaterial because they are only vague' statements of corporate optimism ... [or] because other documents available to the investing public \u2018bespoke caution\u2019 about the subject matter of the alleged misstatement at issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Similarly, statements by WTC regarding its \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201cconsistent\u201d credit risk management practices are reflected not only in WTC\u2019s self-characterization, but in SEC filings. In discussing mitigating credit risk, WTC stated that it employed and \u201cconsistently\u201d applied \u201crigorous loan underwriting standards.\u201d (D.I. 168, ex. 2 at 44 (2008 Annual Report)) These statements are not properly characterized as mere \u201cpuffery.\u201d Instead,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbW\">where a defendant affirmatively characterizes management practices as \u201cadequate,\u201d \u201cconservative,\u201d \u201ccautious,\u201d and the like, the subject is \u201cin play.\u201d For example, if a defendant represents that its lending practices are \u201cconservative\u201d and that its collateralization is \u201cadequate,\u201d the securities laws are clearly implicated if it nevertheless intentionally or recklessly omits certain facts contradicting these representations. Likewise, if a defendant characterizes loan loss reserves as \u201cadequate\u201d or \u201csolid\u201d even though it knows they are inadequate or unstable, it exposes itself to possible liability for securities fraud. By addressing the quality of a particular management practice, a defendant declares the subject of its representation to be material to the reasonable shareholder, and thus is bound to speak truthfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6r\"><em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Plaintiffs also allege other false statements, including officer defendants\u2019 use of the 10% rule to make loans that far exceeded the 80% loan-to-value ratio generally required by federal and WTC guidelines. (D.I. 149 at \u00b6\u00b6 97, 100, 246, 426) Contrary to the SOX certifications signed by Cecala and Gibson and despite repeated warnings from the Federal Reserve, KPMG and the Internal Audit Group, WTC\u2019s internal controls were inadequate to prevent more than a billion dollars of fraudulently waived loans through the conspiracy. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 144, 151, 170, 256, 258, 434) The officer defendants misrepresented the quality of WTC\u2019s underwriting and asset review practices and denied credit problems in the commercial loan portfolio on various quarterly conference calls. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 180, 183-84, 192-93, 202-04, 259-77)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Contrary to North\u2019s contentions, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning North include his receipt of certain emails <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 73-84); his position as chair of the loan committee <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 81-84); approval of certain of Terranova\u2019s requested extensions <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 82); and approval of the loan waivers set forth in the delinquency re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ports <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 66). North dissects his imprecise responses to general questions on earnings calls, seeking to limit them to very contained matters, while at the same time arguing that his statements were immaterial, \u201cbecause they were too vague and subjective.\u201d (D.I. 177 at 1-6) 'For example, when asked whether WTC was \u201cseeing any trends ... slower payments and stuff\u2019 on \u201cthe non-resi[dential] commercial real estate in the strip malls, the retail as well as office,\u201d North responded that \u201c[w]e haven\u2019t\u201d and \u201cthat portfolio has held up well.\u201d North explains that the question related specifically to WTC\u2019s nonresidential commercial portfolio, and his answer was not false as it was limited thereto. Also, North alleges the FAC does not establish a negative trend in that particular portfolio. Plaintiffs allege that the commercial portfolio was experiencing significant deterioration and North\u2019s answer created the false impression that the commercial loan portfolio was \u201cholding up well.\u201d In the context of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, North\u2019s statements misrepresent the financial health of WTC, thus are material misstatements and omissions. The court concludes that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">b.

In connection with its 2007 and 2008 audit of WTC, KPMG issued letters to management identifying WTC\u2019s \u201clack of review of its loan portfolio as a material weakness in [WTC]\u2019s internal controls\u201d and criticizing WTC\u2019s \u201cinadequate asset review.\u201d (D.I. 149 at \u00b6 143) In early 2009, KPMG sent a letter to WTC stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">[T]he Corporation\u2019s Commercial Real Estate Lending Policy does not address specific underwriting standards for the acceptability of and limits on the use of interest reserves. The use of interest reserves to pay interest, without robust underwriting policies and timely, independent loan reviews, can potentially mask the deterioration of the creditworthiness of a borrower or the impaired viability of the underlying real estate project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\"><em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 82-84) In September 2009, the Federal Reserve issued its MOU regarding \u201cextensive failings in [WTC]\u2019s lending, risk management, and accounting functions, including that [WTC] lacked \u2018a process to monitor compliance- with [credit] policies and procedures.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 152) An October 29, 2009 email referred to the need to resolve the issue of \u201cmatured loans\u201d because these \u201cha[d] the attention of all the wrong people: [Cecala, the CEO; Harra, the Bank President; Gibson, the CFO], Examiners, Auditors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 79) WTC extended \u00e1 number of loans in the final days of 2009, without supporting appraisals or documentation. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 82-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Moreover, plaintiffs allege that KPMG was not prevented from examining any documentation, nor is there evidence that falsified records were provided to it. KPMG represented that WTC\u2019s financial statements conformed with GAAP, which would require an auditor to evaluate the loan reserves\u2019 reasonableness and review the process used by management to develop the reserves. However, KPMG did not request updated appraisals or any other required documentation for the extended loans. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 82-84) At the pleading stage, the court must view all factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. The court concludes that the allegations and red flags discussed above, along with the magnitude of the fraud, creates a strong and reasonable inference of KPMG\u2019s scienter. <em>See e.g., Suprema, </em>438 F.3d at 281 (finding that despite the protestations of the auditor, \u201c[in] the face of the numerous and not insignificant alleged accounting violations, we cannot rule out, as a matter of law, a strong and reasonable inference of [the auditor\u2019s scienter.\u201d); <em>In re Am.

Loss causation</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Loss causation requires plaintiffs to show that \u201cthe defendant misrepresented or omitted the very facts that were a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs economic loss.\u201d <em>McCabe v. Ernst &amp; Young, LLP, </em>494 F.3d 418, 430 (3d Cir.2007). Plaintiff may adequately plead loss causation by alleging either a corrective disclosure of a previously undisclosed truth that causes a decline in the stock price or the materialization of a concealed risk that causes a stock price decline. <em>In re Am. Intern. Grp., Inc. 2008 Sec. Litig., </em>741 F.Supp.2d 511, 533 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (citing <em>Leykin v.

With respect to the latter, \u201cwhere some or all of the risk is concealed by the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation or omission, courts have found loss causation sufficiently pled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Nathel v. Siegal, </em>592 F.Supp.2d 452, 467 (S.D.N.Y.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In the case at bar, plaintiffs have alleged corrective disclosures, e.g., on January 29, 2010, after issuing its 2009 earnings press release revealing a large quarterly loss,- WTC\u2019s stock price fell over 14%. Morgan Stanley issued a report that same day stating: \u201c[deteriorating credit drove a higher than expected reserve build.\u201d (D.I. 149 at \u00b6 178) Similarly, the stock price fell after another \u201cbigger-than-expected loan loss provision\u201d on April 23, 2010 and after Cecala\u2019s departure on June 3, 2010 <em>(Id. </em>at 179-183) In response to the WTC and M &amp; T\u2019s disclosure of crippling losses, on November 1, 2010, the stock price collapsed. While defendants attribute these decreases to the \u201cchallenging economic environment\u201d and \u201cbroader economic decline,\u201d plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence to show that the misrepresentations were plausibly reasons for the decline in value. <em>Robbins v. Kroger Properties, Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1441, 1447 n. 5 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cTo satisfy the loss causation element, a plaintiff need not show that a misrepresentation was the sole reason for the investment\u2019s decline in value. Ultimately, however, a plaintiff will be allowed to recover only damages actually caused by the misrepresentation.\u201d). Third Circuit precedent instructs that loss causation is a fact intensive inquiry which is best resolved by the trier of fact. <em>See EP Medsystems, Inc. v. EchoCath, Inc., </em>235 F.3d 865, 884 (3rd Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">d. Safe harbor provision</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">North moves to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on his statements made during earnings calls, arguing that each of these calls began with a \u201cforward-looking statement disclaimer,\u201d the statements were immaterial, and North had no knowledge that the statements were false. North does not provide the court with the text of the- disclaimer. Without more, the court declines to find that the disclaimer was a \u201cmeaningful cautionary statement ] identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\u201d <em>Avaya, </em>564 F.3d at 256. The court concluded above that North\u2019s statements were material and made with scien-ter. North\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The case at bar presents numerous complex factual issues. Defendants\u2019 arguments go to the merit and plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not appropriately dismissed at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>stage. Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled their claims with particularity. Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the Exchange Act claims are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">B. Securities Act Claims</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2c\">1. Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Plaintiffs allege violations of sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act in connection with the offering. These claims are not subject to the heightened pleading standards set forth in the PSLRA. <em>In re Adams Golf, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>176 F.Supp.2d 216, 230 (D.Del.2001). \u201cTo state a claim under section 11, plaintiffs must allege that they purchased securities pursuant to a materially false or misleading registration statement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To state a claim under section 12(a)(2), plaintiffs must allege that they purchased securities pursuant to a materially false or misleading \u2018prospectus or oral communication.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>In re Adams Golf, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>381 F.3d 267, 273-74 (3d Cir.2004) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cFraud is not a necessary element to establish a prima facie claim under Section 11 or Section 12(a)(2). But claims under those provisions can be, and often are, predicated on allegations of fraud.... [If] plaintiff grounds these Securities Act claims in allegations of fraud&amp;emdash;and the claims thus \u201csound in fraud\u201d&amp;emdash;the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) apply.\u201d <em>In re Suprema, </em>438 F.3d at 269 (citing <em>Cal. Pub. Emps. </em>\u2019 <em>Ret. Sys. v. Chubb Corp., </em>394 F.3d 126, 160-63 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201cCALPERS\u201d)). However, if the allegations are pled separately and plaintiffs expressly premise the Securities Act claims on negligence rather than fraud, Rule 9(b) is held inapplicable. <em>Id. </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">a. Materially false or misleading allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">The basis for the Security Act claims is that the offering documents contained materially untrue statements and omissions set forth in WTC\u2019s 10-Ks and registration statement, which were incorporated by reference. Plaintiffs carefully separate the Security Act claims, specifically stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">In this part of the Complaint, Lead Plaintiffs assert a series of strict liability and negligence claims based on the Securities Act on behalf of the Class (as defined in \u00b6 476 below, except that Lead Plaintiffs explicitly disclaim subparts [d] and [e] of \u00b6 478 from these Securities Act allegations). Lead Plaintiffs expressly disclaim any allegations of knowing or reckless misconduct, and to avoid an (unfounded) argument by Defendants that the claims below somehow \u201csound in fraud,\u201d it is necessary to state or summarize facts also stated above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">(D.I. 149 at \u00b6 387) Plaintiffs then describe the facts underlying the material misstate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ments and omissions in the offering documents and registration statement <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 403^44) and allege that these claims are based on a failure to \u201cconduct a reasonable investigation or possess reasonable grounds\u201d for such statements <em>(id. </em>at \u00b6 456). The Third Circuit in <em>In re Suprema </em>explained that although plaintiff \u201cdescribed its suit as arising out of a \u2018massive fraud\u2019 at Suprema,\u201d plaintiff made clear that its claims under the Securities Act were based in negligence. <em>In re Supremo, </em>438 F.3d at 269. The Court distinguished <em>CALPERS, </em>where the Court found that \u201c[t]he one-sentence disavowment of fraud contained within Plaintiffs\u2019 section 11 Count ... does not require us .to infer that the claims are strict liability or negligence claims, and in this case is insufficient to divorce the claims from their fraudulent underpinnings.\u201d <em>CALPERS, </em>394 F.3d at 160. The court concludes that the pleading at bar more closely resembles the one set out in <em>In re Suprema, </em>therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not sound in fraud. As discussed more fully above for the Exchange Act claims, the 2009 10-K filing materially understated WTC\u2019s past due loan amounts and the reserve. WTC misrepresented its underwriting and asset review practices. These are sufficient , allegations of materially false and misleading statements to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">b. Loan reserves</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Third Circuit has stated that \u201c[t]here appears to be no single method of evaluating and setting loan loss reserves,\u201d however, all methods \u201crequire quantitative and qualitative analyses of the past and present status of loans.... There is nothing unique about representations and omissions regarding loan loss reserves that removes them from the purview of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 281; <em>Underland v. Alter, </em>2012 WL 2912330, at *5 (E.D.Pa.2012) (citing <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 281). \u201c[Statements of \u2018soft\u2019 information may be actionable misrepresentations [under Section 11] [only] if the speaker does not genuinely and reasonably believe them.\u201d <em>In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., </em>7 F.3d 357, 368-69 (3d Cir.1993). Defendants argue that this court should adopt the similar reasoning of <em>Fait v. Regions Fin. Corp., </em>655 F.3d 105, (2d Cir.2011), that loan reserves are \u201cnot a matter of objective fact. Instead, loan loss reserves reflect management\u2019s opinion or judgment about what, if any, portion of amounts due on the loans ultimately might not be collectible\u201d and, therefore, require allegations that \u201cdefendant\u2019s opinions were both false and not honestly believed when they were made.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Contrary to the plaintiff in <em>Fait, </em>which did not \u201cpoint to an objective standard for setting loan loss reserves,\u201d in the case at bar, WTC alleged adequate reserves, calculated using an objective and consistent standard, in part based on credit risk and loan classifications. Plaintiffs allege these \u201ctwo distinct methodologies [used] to calculate [WTC\u2019s] Loan Loss Reserve, both ... violated GAAP and understated [WTC]\u2019s reserves.\u201d <em>Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 113; (D.I. 149 at \u00b6 165) WTC \u201cblindly \u2018waived\u2019 hundreds of millions of dollars of past due and nonperforming loans, and arbitrarily assigned percentage values to risk ratings in the ... loan portfolio.\u201d (D.I. 149 at \u00b6 165) Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>suffice to allege that WTC was inconsistently and arbitrarily applying the standards it claimed to use to calculate its loan reserve. Therefore, plaintiffs have adequately pled their Securities Act claims against WTC and the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Similarly, KPMG argues that the loan reserves and statements regarding the same are actionable only if they are knowingly or recklessly false. KPMG\u2019s reliance on <em>Shapiro </em>is misplaced, as the Third Circuit has made clear that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations which were not premised on the fact that \u201cdefendants possessed or made affirmative forecasts regarding the[] possible outcomes,\u201d were properly dismissed. <em>Shapiro, </em>964 F.2d at 283. As discussed above, plaintiffs in the case at bar allege that the loan reserves were calculated using methodologies which violated the GAAP. KPMG then certified these statements including the loan reserves. The court concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss and permit discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">c. Incorporated documents</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">DuPont moves for dismissal of the Section 11 claims as he did not sign the offering documents and, having resigned in October 2009, was not a director at the time of the February 23, 2010 offering. For support that the offering documents are a \u201cnew registration statement,\u201d duPont points to 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.512(a)(2), which states that for purposes of liability, \u201ceach such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\u201d Roselle joins this motion. DuPont and Roselle signed the form registration statement and the 2007 and 2008 10-Ks, each of which were incorporated by reference into the offering documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that duPont was not a director at the time of the offering but, rather, base liability on the fact that the offering documents incorporate by reference the registration statement, as well as the 2007 and 2008 10-Ks, which duPont did sign. Plaintiffs argue that duPont is not released from liability even after his resignation as he did not \u201cadvise the Commission and the issuer in writing that ... he would not be responsible for such part of the registration statement.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(b)(l)(B); <em>In re Enron Corp. Sec., Deriv. &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>258 F.Supp.2d 576, 596-642 (S.D.Tex.2003) (pre-offering resignation did not sever Section 11 liability, when director signed statements before resignation). Defendants\u2019 cases are inap-posite as they analyze situations where a director did not sign any statements. The parties have offered no cases that involve signed registrations statements (and other SEC filings) being incorporated into a post-resignation offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The court focuses its attention on whether the documents signed by duPont and Roselle allegedly contained misstatements and whether the individuals allegedly had knowledge thereof. Plaintiffs assert that WTC misstated its past due and nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2008 (D.I. 149 at \u00b6 70) and waived past due loans during each quarter of the class period (January 18, 2008-November 1, 2010). <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 61) The Federal Reserve issued escalating warnings to WTC during 2007 and 2008.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These allegations of knowledge generally directed to WTC.are insufficient as asserted against duPont and Roselle, who resigned their positions as directors prior to the offering. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>over, the signed form registration statement was amended at least once (on January 12, 2009), before becoming part of the offering documents. For these reasons, the motion to dismiss is granted with prejudice as to defendants duPont and Ro-selle.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">C. Violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 15 of the Securities Act</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Section 20(a) imposes joint and several liability on any person who \u201cdirectly or indirectly controls any person liable\u201d under any provision of the Exchange Act, \u201cunless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a); <em>In re Suprema, </em>438 F.3d at 284 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a)). Section 15 of the Securities Act provides for joint and several liability on the part of one who controls a violator of Section 11 or Section 12. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77o; <em>In re Suprema, </em>438 F.3d at 284. Plaintiffs \u201cmust prove that one person controlled another person or entity and that the controlled person or entity committed a primary violation of the securities laws.\u201d <em>In re Suprema, </em>438 F.3d at 284 (citation omitted). Accordingly, liability under Section 20(a) and Section 15 is derivative of an underlying violation of those sections by the controlled person.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The court has found that plaintiffs have adequately alleged primary violations of Section 10(b) and Section 11 (excluding duPont and Roselle) by the various defendants. As to the control element, plaintiffs allege the officer defendants had control, as these defendants signed documents, sent emails, and/or -made the allegedly false statements. (D.I. 149 at \u00b6\u00b6 217, 239, 349, 395, 449) The audit committee monitored the quality and integrity of WTC\u2019s policies, financial statements and practices, as well as its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The audit committee members thus controlled the content of the public statements made by WTC. Moreover, these defendants signed WTC\u2019s 10-K forms from 2007-2009, the offering documents, and/or the registration statement. (D.I. 149 at \u00b6\u00b6 372-86) The court concludes that plaintiffs have adequately pled \u201cactual control,\u201d sufficient to comply with the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">As to duPont and Roselle, the court granted dismissal of the Section 11 claims, thereby negating a derivative claim pursuant to Section 15. Plaintiffs support their Section 20(a) claim against Roselle by virtue of his participation in the audit committee and his signature on incorporated documents. However, as discussed above in the analysis of the Section 11 claim, Roselle did not sign the offering documents as a whole. Moreover, unlike the other audit committee members who were either directors or members of the audit committee through the date of the offering, Roselle\u2019s tenure as director and audit committee member terminated in 2009. Plaintiffs have not proffered any specific allegations that Roselle had any \u201cactual control\u201d over the 10(b) violations. Therefore, the court grants the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to duPont and Ro-selle.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">V.
