Langan filed an appeal. City notified her that a City official would act as the hearing officer or trier of fact at the appeal hearing, and that an administrative law judge (ALJ) would only advise on questions of evidence and procedure. Langan objected to the hearing procedure and filed a writ of administrative mandamus. The trial court granted Langan\u2019s petition and ordered that any appeal must be \u201cconducted either by the City Council . . . or conducted solely by an Administrative Law Judge . . . .\u201d City appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">We find that pursuant to the authority of <em>Usher </em>v. <em>County of Monterey </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 210 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 274] and Government Code section 21156,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> City cannot designate a hearing officer to serve as the trier of fact in a disability retirement benefits appeal hearing. Langan is entitled to a hearing conducted by either an ALJ who will render a \u201cproposed\u201d decision to City, or the entire El Monte City Council sitting in bank. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we decide other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">Langan was employed as a City police officer from 1985 through 1990. In 1991, she applied to City and to the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS) for disability retirement. On July 7, 1992, City denied Langan\u2019s application for industrial disability retirement benefits. Langan appealed the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>On April 28, 1994, City wrote Langan\u2019s counsel that the disability retirement appeal hearing was scheduled for July 25, 1994. City further stated: \u201cAn official from the City of El Monte will act as the hearing officer or trier of fact and an administrative law judge will be available but only in the capacity of legal advisor on questions of evidence, procedure, etc.\u201d On July 7, 1994, Langan\u2019s counsel wrote City that: \u201cWe are also in the process of considering and preparing a writ to establish whether or not the procedure you describe for the hearing comports with the approach intended in California Government Code Section 21025 [now section 21156] . . . .\u201d The parties\u2019 disputes about hearing procedure and obtaining records continued to delay the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">On January 31, 1995, Langan\u2019s counsel wrote City that \u201c[p]ursuant to Government Code section 21025 [now section 21156], as amended January 1, 1992, the parties are required to use an Administrative Law Judge from the State Office of Administrative Hearings to hear the appeal. fl[] We are currently waiting for a copy of your request for hearing and a copy of the Statement of Issues, which must be submitted by your office before this matter can be assigned an administrative law judge, . . . .\u201d On January 31, 1995, and on March 7, 1995, Langan\u2019s counsel requested from City a copy of Langan\u2019s personnel/payroll records. On March 21, 1995, City replied to the January 31, 1995, correspondence that the \u201crole of the Administrative Law Judge [will] be no more than to make procedural determinations,\u201d but that City would \u201chear\u201d the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">On May 30, 1996, Langan\u2019s counsel again requested from City a copy of Langan\u2019s personnel/payroll records. On July 1, 1996, Langan\u2019s counsel again explained to City that the parties were required to use an ALJ to hear the appeal, and again requested a copy of the statement of issues. On July 26, 1996, City replied that it was in the process of scheduling a hearing but that the ALJ\u2019s role would be limited to making \u201cprocedural determinations.\u201d On September 17, 1996, the City provided Langan with a copy of her personnel/payroll records.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On June 9, 1997, Langan sought mandamus relief in the superior court to direct City to schedule a disability retirement appeal hearing with the office of administrative hearings, to be conducted by an ALJ. Langan contended, in relevant part, that section 21156 required the appeal hearing to be conducted by an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">On September 9, 1997, the trial court granted Langan\u2019s petition. On October 9, 1997, the trial court issued a statement of decision and a peremptory writ of mandate was issued which \u201cdirected] [City] to schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>a hearing with the Office of Administrative Hearings to determine whether [Langan was] disabled from her job with [City], such hearing to be conducted either by the City Council of the City of El Monte, or conducted solely by an Administrative Law Judge employed by the California Office of Administrative Hearings who is to render a written proposed decision upon which the City may act consistent with the California Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">On November 5, 1997, City timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">City contends that:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">1. It may appoint its own representative to make factual determinations at Langan\u2019s disability retirement appeal hearing pursuant to sections 11512,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 11517,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 21156, 21173,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and various City resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">2.

An abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order is not supported by the findings or the findings are not supported by the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).) [*[[] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>... On review in this court, questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law warranting independent review. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Usher v. County of Monterey, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at pp. 215-216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">B. <em>City Must Use an ALJ to Hear the Case Alone, or City Must Hear the Case Itself with an AU Presiding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">As stated above, when Langan and City were corresponding regarding the procedures for Langan\u2019s appeal, Langan contended that City was required to use an ALJ to hear the appeal. City disagreed, and informed Langan that an official from City would act as the hearing officer or trier of fact, and an ALJ would be available only in the capacity of legal adviser on questions of evidence, procedure, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">City argues that sections 11512 and 11517 vest the city council with the power to determine whether it shall hear the case in conjunction with the ALJ or allow the ALJ to hear it and make recommendations. City contends that under sections 11500, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 21173, \u201cthis power, like any others vested in the member agency, may be delegated in the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d In other words, City argues that it should be allowed to have an ALJ preside over the case and have a designated City official act as finder of fact. City further argues: \u201cThere is no evidence whatsoever of a [legislative intent to make a disability retirement procedure so cumbersome that City Council members would either have to sit through the hearing themselves or yield their power to do this to an Administrative Law Judge, despite their own desire to delegate this to one of their trusted administrators.\u201d City asks this court to take judicial notice that its revised City regulations provide that an ALJ shall preside over each hearing and limit the hearing officer designated by City to either the city administrator or assistant city administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We disagree with City\u2019s position. We find that sections 11512, 11517 and 21156 together provide that an appeal from the denial of a disability retirement must be heard either (1) alone by an ALJ who will render a \u201cproposed\u201d decision to the local governing body, or (2) City must hear the case itself, with an ALJ presiding. An appointee of the city council may not serve as the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>Usher v. County of Monterey, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 210 rejected arguments similar to those of City. In <em>Usher, </em>Monterey County Deputy Sheriff David Usher applied to PERS for disability retirement. The county advised PERS that Usher was not incapacitated for deputy sheriff duties and was not eligible for disability retirement. Usher appealed the county\u2019s decision. A hearing was held before a county appointed hearing officer, and an ALJ. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 214.) The hearing officer issued his findings and determined that Usher was not substantially incapacitated. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Usher filed a petition for mandamus relief in superior court. \u201c[Usher] alleged the proceedings were unfair because a hearing officer employed by the County, rather than the administrative law judge, conducted the hearing and issued the findings, contrary to the express provisions of Government Code section 21025 [now section 21156].\u201d <em>(Usher </em>v. <em>County of Monterey, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 215, fn. omitted.) The question before the superior court was \u201cwhether the County was required to have the hearing conducted by an administrative law judge.\u201d The court granted the petition and a writ of mandamus issued. The county appealed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On appeal, the county contended that section 11512 specifically authorized use of a hearing officer, with an ALJ appointed to preside over the appeal hearing. Usher argued that former section 21025 (now \u00a721156) took precedence over section 11512 and required the county to appoint an ALJ to conduct the appeal hearing. <em>(Usher v. County of Monterey, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The court agreed with Usher and reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cFirst, where state statutes prescribe special hearing provisions for various individual agency proceedings, those provisions prevail over the more general provisions of the APA [Administrative Procedure Act]. [Citation.] . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">\u201cSecondly, . . . section 21156 does not necessarily conflict with the APA provisions describing the formal hearing process. Section 11512 gives the agency the choice of hearing the case itself, with an administrative law judge presiding, or having the administrative law judge hear the case alone. Section 21156 simply mandates that, in any appeal from a determination under PERS law that the employee is or is not entitled to disability benefits, the agency must follow the APA provisions which provide for an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing alone.\u201d <em>(Usher v. County of Monterey, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at pp. 217-218.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The court then determined that \u201cthe procedure used by the County in this case, whereby it contracted with a hearing officer to render a decision on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>merits, with an administrative law judge presiding to rule on evidentiary matters, does not in our view comply with either of the two procedures described in . . . section 11512. Although the administrative law judge \u2018presided over\u2019 the hearing and made evidentiary and other rulings, he did not \u2018hear the case alone.\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11512, subd. (a).) Nor did the \u2018agency itself . . . hear the case with an administrative law judge.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where the statute refers to the \u2018agency itself,\u2019 it means that \u2018the power to act shall not be delegated unless the statutes relating to the particular agency authorize the delegation of the agency\u2019s power to hear and decide.\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11500.) Thus if the County does not use an administrative law judge to hear the case alone, the County\u2019s governing body must hear the case itself, with an administrative law judge presiding; in other words, it may not delegate the decision making authority to a hearing officer.\u201d <em>(Usher v. County of Monterey, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 218, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We find <em>Usher </em>controlling in this appeal and hold that if City does not use an ALJ to hear the case alone, City must hear the case itself, with an ALJ presiding. It may not delegate its decisionmaking authority to a hearing officer. City cannot conduct disability retirement appeal hearings using City regulations that do not conform to statutory procedures in section 21156.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">C. <em>The Legislative History of Section 21156 Also Supports Langan\u2019s Position</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The Legislature specifically amended former section 21025 to prevent biased, untrained persons from deciding appeals of disability pension denials. Now the statute, section 21156, specifies that: \u201cAppeal hearings shall be conducted by an administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings pursuant to Chapter 5 ... of Part 1 of Division 3 of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The statutory amendment resulted from Assembly Bill No. 2168 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) introduced in 1991 by Assembly Member Gotch. The California State Firefighters Association sponsored the bill. It was concerned that \u201cdisability retirement determination hearings may be conducted by individuals or agencies that do not have adequate knowledge of the legal process and . . . employer decisions can be biased.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Public Employment and Retirement, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2168 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) July 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">PERS informed the Legislature: \u201cIt is PERS\u2019 opinion that the local agencies already have an obligation to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in the disability retirement process for their safety employees. PERS is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>governing body of the local agency acts as a delegate of the PERS Board of Administration in mating the determination of capacity or incapacity; therefore the local agency is bound by the APA in the same manner as the PERS Board itself. In other words, in case of an appeal to a local agency determination, the dispute must be heard by an administrative law judge of the State Office of Administrative Hearings. (Government Code section 11502.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC) supported the legislation and informed the Legislature: \u201cAB 2168 offers injured workers an impartial ear when they feel a local disability decision is incorrect or improper. No one injured or not likes to think their situation has been misunderstood or ignored. PORAC supports AB 2168 because it offers a fair way to handle disputes between local retirement boards and their injured safety workers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The original Assembly Bill of March 8, 1991, included the following language: \u201cIn the event of a dispute involving the issue of incapacity of a local member, any hearing shall be conducted by an administrative [law] judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings who shall make all relevant findings of fact.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 2168 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 1, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Senate amended the bill on July 18, 1991, to its present form: \u201cThe local safety member may appeal the determination of the governing body. Appeal hearings shall be conducted by an administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part I of Division 3 of this title.\u201d (Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 2168 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The legislative history shows that the Legislature meant to eliminate persons without proper legal knowledge and with potential biases from conducting disability retirement appeal hearings. City is bound by the provisions of section 21156.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">D. <em>Section 21173 Cannot Be Used to Conflict with Section 21156</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">City argues that section 21173 provides that the city council, as governing body, may delegate any power it has with regard to disability retirement hearings. Section 21173 provides as follows: \u201cThe governing body of a contracting agency may delegate any authority or duty conferred or imposed under this article to a subordinate officer subject to conditions it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>may impose.\u201d City relies on this section for authority to designate, under City regulations, the city administrator or the assistant city administrator to act as the trier of fact in appeal hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Education </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 196, 223-224 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 295], the court stated; \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is the general rule that where the general statute standing alone would include the same matter as the special act, and thus conflict with it, the special act will be considered as an exception to the general statute whether it was passed before or after such general enactment. Where the special statute is later it will be regarded as an exception to or qualification of the prior general one; . . .\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The subject of who may conduct disability retirement appeal hearing is directly addressed in section 21156. This statue is more specific than the broad, general reference to \u201cmay delegate any authority or duty conferred or imposed under this article to a subordinate officer\u201d contained in section 21173. The language of section 21156 controls over any conflict between sections 21156 and 21173.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Finally, \u201c \u2018[o]ne ferrets out the legislative purpose of a statute by considering its objective, the evils which it is designed to prevent, the character and context of the legislation in which the particular words appear, the public policy enunciated or vindicated, the social history which attends it, and the effect of the particular language on the entire statutory scheme. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018An interpretation which is repugnant to the purpose of the [statute] would permit the very \u201cmischief\u2019 the [statute] was designed to prevent. [Citation.] Such a view conflicts with the basic principle of statutory interpretation, [citation], that provisions of statutes are to be interpreted to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McLaughlin v. State Bd. of Education, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We find that City may not use section 21173 to appoint a trier of fact because such a procedure violates the legislative intent of section 21156 which was to provide, inter alia, for neutral hearing officers. City employees are not the neutral hearing officers envisioned by section 21156.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">E., F.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The ruling is affirmed.
