L., pp. </em>94, 106), does not operate to void the contract of loan, and render the loan uncollectable, unless and until there has- been a conviction of the offender in a court of criminal jurisdiction. The statute does not make conviction a prerequisite to the operation of this provision, either expressly or by fair intendment. The term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d was employed to delimit the class of offenses entailing these consequences, and not to denote a formal adjudication of the guilt of the offender in a court of criminal jurisdiction, a tribunal having a radically different function, as the minimum requirement of voidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">And the makers\u2019 affirmative declaration in the note that they \u201chave no joint or several defense to any action\u00bb either at law or in equity, which may be brought at any time for\u201d its collection does not, for obvious reasons, create an estoppel. The statute embodies a public policy which may not thus be set at naught by the parties themselves. It is beyond their power to waive statutory provisions of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
