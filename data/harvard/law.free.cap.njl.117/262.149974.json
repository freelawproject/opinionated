As found by the District Court judge, sitting without a jury, the property \u201cwas listed with several brokers under what is known as an \u2018open\u2019 listing;\u201d and the defense is that another broker actually \u201cproduced the buyer, while the plaintiff produced a prospect to purchase the property.\u201d The denials of defendant\u2019s motions for a nonsuit and a directed verdict are assigned for error. Appellant maintains that, under the circumstances, it was his privilege to remain \u201cneutral between\u201d the contending brokers, and to sell to a buyer produced by either without \u201cbeing called upon to decide which was the primary cause of the purchase,\u201d citing <em>Vreeland </em>v. <em>Vetterlein, </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>247.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">But, on the evidence adduced, it was open to the judge to find, as he did find, that plaintiff not only \u201cintroduced\u201d the purchaser to the property, but also was the efficient cause of the sale, and that, notwithstanding that plaintiff had actually effected a sale on February 38th, 1935, and the parties had agreed to execute a written contract on March 4th, ensuing, defendant, at the behest of the vendee, who was moved by considerations of friendship for the second broker, executed the written contract, dated February 38th, not earlier than March 3d, and purposely antedated it to give color to the claim that the sale was effected by the second broker and not by plaintiff, and thus fraudulently to deprive the latter of the fruits of its labors under the contract in suit. The doctrine of <em>Vreeland </em>v. <em>Vetterlein, supra, </em>is not apposite in such circumstances. Plainly, there was the collusion and bad faith which render the principle inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">And it was not, as suggested by appellant, a prerequisite that the respondent effect a written contract of sale. Under the brokerage contract, the commission was earned when respondent \u201cprocured or introduced a purchaser to the property;\u201d it was \u201cdue and payable\u201d on the execution and delivery of the contract of sale. Assuming that \u201cintroduction\u201d in the contractual sense, used as it was in the disjunctive, connotes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>a sale resulting from respondent\u2019s efforts (the wider signification seems to have been adopted by the District Couct judge), the judgment has a substantial basis in the proofs disclosed by the state of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
