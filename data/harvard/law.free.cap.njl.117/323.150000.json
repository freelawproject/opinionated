No Accidental Death Benefit will be paid if the death of the Insured is the result of self-destruction, whether sane or insane, nor if death is caused or contributed to, directly or indirectly, or wholly or partially, by disease, or by bodily or mental infirmity * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The trial judge, sitting without a jury, entered judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The sole specification of alleged error is that \u201cthe trial judge erroneously denied defendant\u2019s motion made at the conclusion of the entire case for a direction of a verdict in its favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Now when that motion was made the evidence tended to show the following matters of fact: The insured at the time of his death was about sixty years of age. On July 15th, 1934, the body of the insured was found in the water at or near the bank of the Hackensack river. Almost immediately thereafter the chief of police of Secaucus and Dr. Leonard Kimmel, a physician connected with the Secaucus General Hospital, were called to the scene. They found the body fully clothed, with the exception of shoes and stockings, and the clothing and the body wet. Resuscitation methods used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>in drowning cases were applied for forty minutes by Dr. Kimmel, and thereafter the doctor pronounced the insured dead. The doctor testified that for a month prior to the insured\u2019s death he had attended the insured, and at that time found him suffering from a \u201cweakening of the musculature of the heart,\u201d and kindred troubles such as \u201cstart about the age of fifty.\u201d lie further testified that during his examination of the wet body, and in his attempt at resuscitation, there was no indication of any superficial wounds or abrasions, but that a froth came out of the mouth such as would not be seen in cases which had not been in the water. After forty minutes of resuscitation effort the doctor pronounced the body dead. Soon thereafter the body was examined by Dr. Manuel Hernandez, the assistant county physician. This doctor testified \u201cthis man had been in the water and apparently drowned in the water.\u201d He then wrote a death certificate in which he declared that it was a ease of \u201caccidental drowning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a direction of a verdict was based upon the assertion that there was no evidence that \u201cthe death was caused by external, violent and accidental means, directly and independently of all other causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We believe that the motion was properly denied. It ignored the rule that \u201cin passing upon a motion for the direction of a verdict the court must take as true all evidence which supports the view of the party against whom the motion is made, and must give him the benefit of all legitimate inferences which are to be drawn therefrom in his favor.\u201d <em>Andre </em>v. <em>Mertens, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>626.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Now in the case at bar the defendant expressly admitted that \u201cthere is no contention that the death was suicidal.\u201d It seems to be argued, however, that the insured was not drowned. The answer to that contention is that the evidence clearly justifies the inference that the insured was drowned. The defendant on this phase of the case relies upon the case of <em>Shopp </em>v. <em>Prudential Insurance Co., </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>162. But that case is not in point. There, the uncontradicted evidence was that the death was not caused by drowning. Not so here. It is also argued that if it was a case of drowning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>it was not accidental drowning. Bnt that was at least a jury question. The evidence justifies the inference of accidental drowning. There was no evidence of a natural cause of death. Lastly, the defendant suggests that the death may have been the result of heart trouble. The answer to that is that there is no evidence \u2014 certainly no conclusive evidence \u2014 to support such suggestion, but on the contrary the evidence furnishes ample support for the conclusion of the trial judge that it was a case of accidental drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Of course such evidence which amply supports the inference of accidental drowning likewise justifies the conclusion that death was caused by external, violent and accidental means, directly and independently of all other causes within the terms of the policies, and hence the motion for a direction of a verdict for the defendant was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The judgment below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
