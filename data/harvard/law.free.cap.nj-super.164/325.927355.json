Appellants are school teachers and they were not covered by the unemployment compensation law at all until the enactment of the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974, <em>P. L. </em>93-567, 26 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 3304 mote (West Cum. Supp. 1978-1979) at 259, as amended by the Emergency Compensation and Special Unemployment Assistance Extension Act of 1975 [SUA], <em>P. L. </em>94 \u2014 45. This covered certain public employees, including school teachers, under specified conditions. As to school personnel, the federal act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">(b) An individual wbo performs services in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution or agency shall not be eligible to receive a payment of assistance or a waiting period credit with respect to any week commencing during the period between two successive academic years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>(or, when the contract provides instead for a similar period between two regular but not successive terms, during such similar period) if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">(1) Such individual performed services in any such capacity for any .educational institution or agency in the first of such academic years or terms; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">(2) Such individual has a contract to perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution or agency for the later of such academic years or terms. P. L. 93-567, as am. \u00a7 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Thus, under this act, a teacher employed .by a local board of education who performs services in the first of two successive academic years and who has a contract to work the later of such school years is ineligible for unemployment compensation for any week commencing during the period between the end of the first academic year and the beginning of the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In all other respects, the federal act requires compliance with the terms and conditions of the state unemployment compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Appellants were employed as nontenured specialty teachers by the Passaic Board of Education under a federal program known as Title I, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 20 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 236 <em>et seq. </em>[E. S. E. A.]. Holstein had been employed as a teacher of remedial reading for ten years; Calamusa for five years as a bilingual English instructor. On April 12, 1976, pursuant to the notice requirements of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:27-10 <em>(West Gum. Supp. </em>1978-1979), appellants received a letter from their empAyer which stated that their contracts would not be renewed for the 1976-1977 school year because of the uncertainty of availability of federal funding for the E. S. E. A. program. The letter indicated that the uncertainty would not be resolved until the summer of 1976 \u201cwhen further commitments are usually received.\u201d However, it was suggested that appellants \u201ccontinue in contact\u201d with the school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Appellants had received similar notices in prior years and had been rehired as late as August. Indeed, prior to the enactment of the notice statute in 1972 claimants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>not notified either way of their status until the August preceding the start of the new school year. Although their current contracts for the 1975-1976 school year were to end on April 30, 1976, appellants were permitted to work through the end of June.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Appellants filed for unemployment compensation benefits against the New Jersey fund during the first week of July 1976 and commenced efforts to find other employment. Holstein read the teacher want ads in the Sunday <em>New York Times </em>and replied to two ads for remedial reading instructor positions in North Jersey. Calamusa contacted two school districts in Wisconsin as well as Paterson and Newark in regard to employment as a bilingual instructor. This was the extent of their efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On August 2, 1976 appellants were notified by a claims deputy of the State Division of Unemployment that they were ineligible for benefits because they were \u201cemployed.\u201d On or about August 11, 1976 appellants were notified by letter of their reassignment to the Passaic public schools for the school year beginning September 7, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">On appeal to the Appeal Tribunal that body held that the Board\u2019s letter of April 12, 1976 was an \u201cimplied contract\u201d for a successive year\u2019s employment, thus bringing claimants within the proscription of \u00a7 203. Moreover, the decision held claimants ineligible duo to their failure to show \u201cavailability for work.\u201d On further appeal to the Board of Beview, the decision of the Appeal Tribunal was modified to the extent that it was held that the disqualification under SUA was applicable only after August 11, 1976 when appellants were notified of their assignment for the ensuing school year. Prior thereto they had no contract. The Board of Beview nevertheless denied both appellants anjr benefits as it agreed with the Appeal Tribunal determination that appellants were unavailable for work during the period involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> We find the plain language of the federal statute applicable to bar appellants\u2019 rights to unemployment com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>pensation subsequent to August 11, 1976. There being no challenge before us as to the modification by the Board of Review of the Appeal Tribunal holding that appellants had an implied contract even before that date, we need express no: opinion on the point as we are constrained to hold there was substantial credible evidence to support the decision of both agency tribunals that appellants\u2019 efforts to find work were insufficient to constitute compliance with the \u201cavailability for work\u201d prerequisite for unemployment compensation benefits. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :21-4(c). See <em>Worsnop v. Board of Review, Div. of Emp. Sec., </em>92 <em>N. J. Super. </em>260, 264-265 (App. Div. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We find no merit in appellants\u2019 additional contention that they were not put on notice that the question of availability for work would be an issue before the Appeals Examiner. See <em>Ferry v. Board of Review, Div. of Emp. Sec., </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>99 (App. Div. 1974) certif. den. 67 <em>N. J. </em>80 (1965). The notice of hearing given them specifically noted that question as one to be considered, and appellants did offer evidence on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
