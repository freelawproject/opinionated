On August 21, 1977 the infant plaintiff, Mary Lon Austin, was a passenger on a motorcycle operated by Theodore T. Millard in Spring Lake, New Jersey. The motorcycle collided with an automobile which, according to the Spring Lake police, was being driven by Ellsworth R. Haver and owned by Haver\u2019s wife, Dorothy C. Haver.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">On September 14, 1977 the instant suit was commenced by plaintiffs against Millard and the Havers for personal injuries and consequential damages allegedly sustained by plaintiffs. The answers to plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories brought to plaintiffs\u2019 attention that Ellsworth E. Haver was contending that at the time of the accident his wife\u2019s automobile was being driven by one \u201cAnatole\u201d and Ellsworth was a passenger. With the answers to the interrogatories the Havers supplied a copy of a letter which Ellsworth wrote to the Manasquan Police Department (Manasquan is a municipality close by to Spring Lake), in which he recounted his version of the accident. In the letter he stated that Anatole was an automobile mechanic whom he had met through acquaintances shortly before the accident; that Anatole was driving the vehicle and Ellsworth was a passenger; that after the accident Anatole drove away, ostensibly to take the injured Ellsworth to a hospital, but instead of taking him to the hospital Anatole abandoned the car and Ellsworth at some distance from the accident scene, and that Ellsworth thereafter tried to find him on information that Anatole was from the Trenton area and was believed to work there for an automobile dealer. Ellsworth also stated that he did not know whether \u201cAnatole\u201d was the driver\u2019s first or last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">On May 11, 1978 plaintiffs applied to the trial court for an order permitting them to amend their complaint to add \u201cJohn Doe\u201d as a party defendant and to authorize service of a summons and the amended complaint upon respondent in this appeal, Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate), which insured the Haver vehicle at the time of the accident. On May 11, 1978 the trial judge granted leave to plaintiffs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>name \u201cJohn Doe\u201d as an additional defendant, but without expressing any reasons for his action the judge denied leave to make substituted service on John Doe through service of process on Allstate. We granted leave to plaintiffs to appeal from that negative interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">At the outset, it may be noted that neither Allstate nor plaintiffs appear to accept as fact that one other than Ellsworth was driving the automobile. Skepticism as to this fact is indicated in both briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The controlling authority for decision of the issue before us is <em>Feuchtbaum v. Constantino, </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>167 (1971). There the court held that in an automobile collision case where the driver of a vehicle was a New Jersey resident who could not be found for the service of process upon him, such service could be made upon the automobile liability carrier (per <em>B. </em>4:4-4[i]) without violating rules of due process. In arriving at thip conclusion the court invoked a balancing test, weighing four factors: \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s need, the public interest, the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s efforts under all the circumstances to inform the defendant, and the availability of other safeguards for the defendant\u2019s interests.\u201d 59 <em>N. J. </em>at 177, citing <em>Dobkin v. Chapman, </em>21 <em>N. Y. </em>2d 490, 503, 289 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 161, 172, 236 <em>N. E. </em>2d 451, 458 (Ct. App. 1968) (a decision also involving substituted service in an automobile-accident case); <em>R. </em>4:4-4(i). See also, <em>Ledbetter v. Schnur, </em>107 <em>N. J. Super. </em>479 (Law Div. 1969), cited with approval in <em>Feuchtbaum, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Allstate primarily argues that the trial court correctly denied plaintiffs\u2019 application, because the facts in the instant case fail to meet the <em>Feuchtbaum </em>balancing test. Allstate first reasons that plaintiffs\u2019 needs would not be furthered by allowing service on Allstate. It insists that the factfinder could only make one of two possible conclusions in this case: (1) Ellsworth R. Haver was the actual driver of the Havers\u2019 automobile at the time of the accident; (2) Anatole was the actual driver of the automobile at the time of the accident, but he was clearly acting as Ellsworth\u2019s agent, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>he was employed by Ellsworth. In either case, Allstate asserts, plaintiffs would be able to recover because of the car owner\u2019s insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">However, Allstate does admit that the pleadings raise a question as to whether Ellsworth is an owner of the Haver automobile or whether Dorothy Haver is the sole owner. The question of ownership could be important in determining the insurance company\u2019s obligations under its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">More significantly, at the hearing on this motion before the trial judge, Allstate\u2019s counsel said its opposition to the motion for substituted service depended at least in part on Allstate\u2019s belief that it could escape liability for Anatole\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Since there is a possibility that Anatole\u2019s conduct could relieve Allstate except under the omnibus clause, it would in fact serve plaintiffs to have Anatole represented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Allstate\u2019s second point under said balancing test is that the public interest would not be served by allowing service on it. However, Allstate admits that there is a strong public interest in seeing that plaintiffs are justly compensated. Moreover, Allstate\u2019s interests are to avoid payment to plaintiffs, whether by reason of its insureds\u2019 common-law defenses to the negligence asserted against them or by invoking contractual defenses existing under the terms of its policy. If the latter results, the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Eund may be compelled to make payment. <em>Feuchtbaum, supra </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>at 178. Public interest under these circumstances certainly would be furthered by the presence of a representative of the actual driver of the automobile in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Allstate raises a more cogent contention when it asserts that plaintiffs have not satisfied the third factor of the balancing test because they have not made reasonable efforts to locate Anatole or advise him of this suit. It insists that the letter from Ellsworth R. Haver to the Manasquan police provides plaintiffs with valuable \u201cleads\u201d to the identity of Anatole. That letter states that Ellsworth\u2019s neighbors told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>him about Anatole; gave the general street lor:\u2019 .on of Anatole\u2019s acquaintances where Anatole is apparen ' quite well known, and further indicates that Anatole is .\u2022 ployed by a car dealership in the Trenton area.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">We agree that plaintiffs have neither shown that th--. made any efforts to locate Anatole nor that such efforts v nld be futile or unproductive. <em>Cf. Ledbetler v. Schnur, supra, </em>and <em>Young v. Bunny Bazaar, Inc., </em>107 <em>N. J. Super. </em>320 (Law Div. 1969). We believe, however, that plaintiffs should be afforded' the opportunity to secure the identity of said alleged driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Allstate raises as its final point under its due-process argument the contention that no adequate safeguards exists to protect the interests of Anatole. We disagree. We consider the fact that Anatole allegedly perpetrated a hit-and-run accident and then fled the Haver automobile leaving injured parties behind. Under such circumstances Anatole could be said to be reasonably apprised of the possibility of a lawsuit. As noted in <em>Feuchtbaum, supra </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>at 178, \u201c[I]n an automobile case, no defendant need be without notice unless he chooses and wants to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">After plaintiffs make adequate efforts to locate Anatole, his due-process rights would not be infringed by service upon Allstate. As the court in <em>Young v. Bunny Bazaar, Inc., supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\"><em>* * * </em>Defendant knows of the accident, that people were injured, and that a claim may be made against him. He can keep in touch with either his insurance carrier or the injured victim in order to protect himself against not receiving actual notice. [107 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 325]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Allstate finally argues that <em>B. </em>4:26-4 does not permit the service of process upon an unknown person if there is no appropriate description sufficient to identify him. Apart from the fact that the trial judge has already authorized service upon \u201cJohn Doe as party defendant operator of the Haver vehicle\u201d and there has been no appeal from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>order, <em>Farrell v. Votator Div. of Chemetron Corp., </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>111, 116 (1973), holds to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Accordingly, the order under appeal which denies to plaintiffs authorization to serve Anatole through substituted service upon Allstate is vacated. The cause is remanded to the trial court for the purpose of entering an order affording plaintiffs a reasonable time to locate said person in order to serve him personally, and, if said efforts reasonably made prove to be unsuccessful, to permit substituted service of him upon Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"> Although in the complaint filed in the trial court the action is captioned for plaintiff as \u201cDonald Austin, Individually and as guardian ad litem of Mary Lou Austin, a minor,\u201d the body of the complaint refers to each Donald Austin (father of Mary Lou) and Mary Lou Austin as plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\u2019 part of the caption should have read substantially: \u201cMary Lou Austin, a minor by her father and guardian <em>ad litem </em>Donald Austin and Donald Austin, individually.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:26-2; <em>Orr v. Orr, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>236, 238-239 (1961); <em>Hare v. Pennell, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>558 (App. Div. 1955) ; <em>Gillette v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>91 <em>N. J.
