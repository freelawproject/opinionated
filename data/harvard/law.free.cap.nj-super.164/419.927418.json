J. S. A. </em>40:55D-1 <em>et seq., </em>40:55D-65(f)), he carefully distinguishes between such a use and a variance. 152 <em>N. J. Super. </em>354, 363 (Law Div. 1977). We concur in the particular significance of that distinction in a matter such as this where the ordinance in question, in dealing with the special exception use for which application was here made, expressly prescribes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>large number \u2014\u25a0 ten \u2014 of carefully detailed conditions which must be met before a permit for such use shall issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In such circumstances, we are of the opinion that if the applicant is in careful compliance with each of these conditions, denial of the permit would be an arbitrary action in the absence of evidence of substantial detriment to the public good or substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance. Accordingly, we believe that in the factual context of this case the right result was reached, and substantially for the reasons set forth in the opinion of Judge Marzulli.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
