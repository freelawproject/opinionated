A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">Defendant was indicted for assault with intent to commit sodomy <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:90-2), sodomy <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:143-1) and impairing the morals of a child <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:96-3). Prior to trial, on the prosecutor\u2019s motion, the count charging defendant with impairing the morals of a minor was dismissed because the alleged victim was over 16 at the time of the incident generating the charge. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case the trial judge dismissed the sodomy count for failure of the State to prove penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The case against defendant was submitted to the jury on the charge of assault with intent to commit sodomy and attempted sodomy as a lesser included offense thereof. The jury found defendant guilty of assault with intent to commit sodomy. As interpreted by our courts, sodomy includes anal intercourse and bestiality, but does not include fellatio or cunnilingus. See <em>State v. </em>Morrison, 25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>534 (Cty. Ct. <em>1953); State v. Pitman, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>626 (Sup. Ct. 1923), aff\u2019d 99 <em>N. J. L. </em>527 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A. 1924). Emission is not required. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>316, 334-335 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The prosecution arose from an incident which occurred on July 23, 1975 in the Township of Dover, Ocean County. The alleged victim, N., a male slightly over 16 years old, testified that he was hitchhiking at night and was picked up by defendant. N. agreed to go to defendant\u2019s home for an alleged party. They arrived at defendant\u2019s home at about 10:45 p.m. No one else was present, making N. suspicious. N. said that he told defendant he wanted to leave and that defendant then struck him on the forehead. N. said he became very scared and withdrawn. Sexual activity then took place after both partially disrobed. Defendant got on top of N., tongued his ear, put his mouth on N.\u2019s penis, and put his penis between N.\u2019s buttocks. N. said that after about one-half hour he ran from the house, walked to his home a mile and a half away, and went to bed. The next day N. told his mother about the episode and a complaint was made to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">At trial defendant, through counsel, contended that any sexual activity between the two was consensual, nonviolent, and did not include attempted anal intercourse. The trial judge ruled that proof of consent was irrelevant. Defendant asserts that he did not testify at trial because of the court\u2019s ruling on the consent issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Defendant\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the trial judge erred in precluding any affirmative evidence or cross-examination on the alleged victim\u2019s consensual participation in the episode. The ease was tried in September 1976 when the question of the criminality of sodomy between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>consenting males over 16 years o\u00ed age was controlled by <em>State v. Lair, 62 N. J. </em>388, 396-397 (1973). The Supreme Court in <em>Lair </em>had rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the constitutional right of privacy immunizes unmarried participants in the act of sodomy from prosecution, although the court there recognized that the act was noncriminal when performed by married persons. <em>Id. </em>at 396. In rejecting defendant Lair\u2019s contention that constitutional considerations demanded decriminalization of private, consensual sodomy the Supreme Court stressed the legislative alternative to judicial reformation of this aspect of our penal law, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">We think it worth mentioning that several of the problems raised by the arguments presented upon this appeal would readily respond to appropriate legislation. We call especial attention to provisions appearing in the proposed <em>New Jersey Penal Code </em>submitted as part of the <em>Pinal Report of the New Jersey Criminal haw Revision Commission </em>(1971). Section 2C:14r-2 is entitled \u201cSodomy and Related Offenses.\u201d This proposal \u201cexcludes from the criminal law all sexual practices not involving force, adult corruption of minors, or public offense . . . based on the grounds that no harm to the secular interests of the community is involved in a typical sex practice in private between consenting adult partners. This area of private morals is the distinctive concern of spiritual authorities.\u201d 2 <em>N. J. Penal Code: </em>Commentary, 196. The wisdom of this or of any other like proposal is, of course, purely a matter for legislative determination. [at 397-398]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Weintraub expressed \u201creservations as to the constitutionality of the application of the sodomy statute to a consensual act between adults committed in private\u201d but concluded that \u201cthis is not the case in which to grapple with the constitutional issue\u201d because \u201cthere was no room for a finding that the anal penetration was consented to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">However, several decisions of our Supreme Court since <em>State v. Lair, supra, </em>convince us it has been implicitly overruled insofar as it affirms the criminality of consensual homosexual sodomy between adults. In <em>State v. J. O., </em>69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>N. J. </em>574 (1976), a unanimous Supreme Court held that the private act of fellatio between mutually consenting males was not criminally indecent exposure within the meaning of the \u201cprivate lewdness\u201d statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:115-1. The Supreme Court noted that its views on the noncriminality of the consensual homosexual conduct in which the defendants engaged squared with the terms of the then proposed Code of Criminal Justice. The court stated that \u201ca private consensual act between adults such as committed by defendants, should not be within the ambit of criminal statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Finally, in <em>State v. </em>Saunders, 75 <em>N. J. </em>200 (1977), the Supreme Court held that the fornication statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:110-1, unconstitutionally criminalized heterosexual conduct between consenting adults, in violation of their constitutional right of privacy. The majority opinion by Justice Pashman stated broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">We conclude that the conduct statutorily defined as fornication involves, by its very nature, a fundamental personal choice. Thus, the statute infringes upon the right of privacy. Although persons may differ as to the propriety and morality of such conduct and while we certainly do' not condone its particular manifestations in this ease, such a decision is necessarily encompassed in the concept of personal autonomy which our Constitution seeks to safeguard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">* * * We therefore join with other courts which have held that such sexual activities between adults are protected by the right of privacy, [at 213-214]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><em>Lair\u2019s </em>refusal to decriminalize private consensual sodomy between unmarried adults was, in our view, undermined by the majority opinion in <em>Saunders </em>when it stated in footnote 7 at 75 <em>N. J. </em>217:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">It may also he observed that <em>State v. Lair, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>388, may have been a poor case in which to discuss the problems of sexual relations between unmarried persons. In construing our sodomy statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:143-1, we were not faced with any factual basis for finding that consent had been given for the sexual acts performed there. Thus, there was no reason to apply the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>protection which we find today to unmarried persons. <em>See </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>at 398-99 (Weintraub, C. J., concurring). <em>See also State v. J. O., </em>69 <em>N. J. </em>574 (1974), where we narrowly construed the private lewdness statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :115-1, to avoid any constitutional objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Of further pertinence in discerning the breadth of the constitutional path which the court took in holding that the individual\u2019s right of personal privacy and autonomy prevailed over the state\u2019s right to regulate private sexual conduct is footnote eight at 75 <em>N. J. </em>219 in the <em>Saunders </em>majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Our decision today confirms the determination of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission that fornication should not constitute a criminal offense. <em>See The New Jersey Penal Code, Volume II: Commentary, </em>Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, October 1971, Introductory Note to Chapter 14 on Fornication at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In sum, the court\u2019s legal and constitutional perception coincided with the dimensions of the pending legislative reform. Of further significance is our Supreme Court\u2019s declination in <em>Saunders </em>to embrace the United States Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmance in <em>Doe v. Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for City of Richmond, </em>403 <em>F. Supp. </em>1199, 1200, aff\u2019d 425 <em>U. S. </em>901, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>1489, 47 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 751, reh. den. 425 <em>U. S. </em>985, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>2192, 48 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 810 (1976), which upheld the constitutionality of Virginia\u2019s sodomy statute as applied to private sexual conduct between consenting male adnlts, and its decision to rest its constitutional interpretation on our State\u2019s analogue to the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, par. 1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, noting that \u201cthe lack of constraints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>imposed by considerations of federalism permits this Court to demand stronger and more persuasive showings of a public interest in allowing the State to prohibit sexual practices than would be required by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>State v. Saunders, supra </em>75 <em>N. J. </em>at 217. Our review of <em>post-Lair </em>judicial developments leads us to the conclusion that <em>Lair </em>has been impliedly overruled by <em>State v. Saunders, supra. </em>Where more recent decisions of the Supreme Court plainly undermine the authority of a prior decision although not squarely and explicitly overruling it, we are entitled to follow the current doctrine and need not be confined by the prior ruling. See <em>e.g.; State v. Chiarello, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>479, 498 ,(App. Div. 1961), certif. den. 36 <em>N. J. </em>301 (1962). Moreover, we conclude this ease is appropriate for retroactive application of the <em>Saunders </em>holding since defendant asserted the defense of consent at trial, this case was pending on direct appeal when <em>Saunders </em>was decided, and the change in the law was to defendant\u2019s benefit. <em>State v. Nash, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>464, 468-471 (1974); <em>State v. Koch, </em>118 <em>N. J. Super. </em>421, 429-433 (App. Div. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">So that our opinion today may not be misconstrued as approving or fostering what many consider opprobrious conduct, we here iterate the concluding paragraphs of the majority in <em>Saunders.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">This is not to suggest that the State may not regulate, in an appropriate manner, activities which are designed to further public morality. Our conclusion today extends no further than to strike down a measure which has as its objective the regulation of <em>private </em>morality. To the extent that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:110-1 serves as an official sanction of certain conceptions of desirable lifestyles, social mores or individualized beliefs, it is not an appropriate exercise of the police power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Fornication may be abhorrent to the morals and deeply held beliefs of many persons. But any appropriate \u201cremedy\u201d for such conduct cannot come from legislative fiat. Private personal acts between two consenting adults are not to be lightly meddled with by the State. The right of personal autonomy is fundamental to a free society. Persons who view fornication as opprobrious conduct may seek strenuously to dissuade people from engaging in it. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>they may not inhibit such conduct through the coercive power of the criminal law. As aptly stated by Sir Francis Bacon, \u201c[t]he sum of behavior is to retain a man\u2019s own dignity without intruding on the liberty of others.\u201d The fornication statute <em>mocks the </em>dignity of both offenders and enforcers. Surely police have more pressing duties than to search out adults who live a so-called \u201cwayward\u201d life. Surely the dignity of the law is undermined when an intimate personal activity between consenting adults can be dragged into court and \u201cexposed.\u201d More importantly, the liberty which is the birthright of every individual suffers dearly when the State can so grossly intrude on personal autonomy. [75 <em>N. J. </em>219-220].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Following defendant\u2019s conviction here, and pending the hearing of this appeal, the Legislature adopted and the Governor signed into law the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, <em>chapter 95 </em>of the <em>Laws of 1978; N. J. S. A. </em>2C.1-1 <em>et seq., </em>effective date September 1, 1919. The new Code of Criminal Justice codified the recommendation of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, noted in <em>State v. Lair, supra, </em>and decriminalized private consensual sodomy. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>20:14-1 <em>et seq., </em>\u201cSexual Offenses.\u201d Legislative reform, of course is not sufficient standing alone for acceptance of defendant\u2019s argument that private consensual sodomy between adults is constitutionally protected conduct, retrospectively. Such reform does demonstrate the parallel judicial and legislative attitudes to the criminality of private sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The State contends that a defendant\u2019s consent is irrelevant to a charge of assault, citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>143 <em>N. J. Super. </em>511 (Law Div. 1916), aff\u2019d o.b. 154 <em>N. J. Super. </em>511 (App. Div. 1918). This is no doubt correct with respect to a violent assault capable of producing injury or designed to compel nonconsensnal submission to any sexual act. However, in this case, as we construe the court\u2019s charge, the jury was presented with alternate theories of assault. The judge explained to the jury that any assault must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that it must have concurred with an intent to commit sodomy. The judge then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Now there is testimony in this case as to two possible assaults. There was testimony concerning an alleged striking of Mr. N., and there was testimony with regard to an alleged placing of the defendant\u2019s penis against the body of Mr. N.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The jury was free under the testimony presented and this instruction to accept or reject one or both theories of assault, <em>i.e., </em>an alleged blow to U.\u2019s head or a nonviolent technical assault, the touching of U.\u2019s body with defendant\u2019s penis. Such a touching could have occurred with U.\u2019s consent under a view of the evidence which the jury might have reasonably entertained if the defendant\u2019s testimony on consent had not been precluded by the judge\u2019s ruling. The judge\u2019s exclusion of any proof relevant to defendant\u2019s contention that this was a nonviolent consensual attempt at sodomy may have caused defendant to be convicted under an improper theory. Therefore, we cannot accept the State\u2019s contention of harmless error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Since a retrial is necessary we comment on an additional point of error claimed by defendant. He argues that he was improperly prevented on cross-examination from exploring the alleged victim\u2019s use of marijuana on the evening of the alleged criminal episode. Defendant argues that such evidence of marijuana use was relevant to the evaluation of U.\u2019s ability to perceive and recall the events of the episode. We agree with defendant\u2019s contention. The substantially contemporaneous use of illegal and potentially dangerous drugs, insofar as it may relate to a witness\u2019 ability to perceive and recall, is highly relevant to credibility. <em>State v. Franklin, 52 N. J. </em>386, 398-400 (1968) (alcohol); 3A Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. ed. 1970), \u00a7 933 at 761-762; Annotation, \"Use of drugs as affecting competency or credibility of witness,\u201d 65 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 705, 720-725, 731 \u2014 733 (1975). Thus this line of examination is proper but the jury should be carefully instructed that any testimony about drug use is admitted solely for the purpose of evaluating credibility, and no other.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In view of the reversal the remaining points raised by defendant need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\"> The State has not suggested that N., at the age of 16 years and 2 months, was too young to consent. We do not think the State could make such a contention consistent with the Equal Protection Clause in light of the legislative approval of 16 years as the \u201cage of consent\u201d for female sexual conduct. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:90-2 (assault with intent to carnally abuse a female under 16) ; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:138-1 (carnal abuse of a female under 16 years; New Jersey\u2019s equivalent of statutory rape).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\"> Natural and unalienable rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">1.
