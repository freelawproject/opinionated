The site will be used for VFR Daylight Operations Only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-18\">[and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-19\">b.

The area is zoned General Commercial and Manufacturing. The nearest residential zones begin approximately 800 feet to the northwest across Route 287 and approximately 800 feet to the south across State Highway 22. The proposed landing site is in a paved parking area to the east of the Ronson Corporation building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">The type helicopter to be used is a Bell 206B, and will be employed as transport for executive (and possibly sales) personnel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The township argues that the Commissioner erred in permitting the helistop license to issue and that he \u201chas no jurisdiction to create an expansion of an Extraordinary Variance by circumventing or ignoring the Local Board of Adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Following the filing on August 9 of the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Garden State Farms, Inc. v. Bay, </em>77 <em>N. J. </em>439 (1978), the parties, by leave granted, filed supplemental letter memoranda regarding the impact of that opinion on this appeal. This was followed by appellant township\u2019s motion for an order to remand the matter to the Department for its further consideration in keeping with the applicable principles set forth in <em>Garden State Farms. </em>We, nonetheless, heard oral argument and, since \u201cthe status of the law in <em>effect </em>at the time of the disposition of a cause by an appellate court governs,\u201d <em>S &amp; L </em>Associates, <em>Inc. v. Washington Tp., </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>224, 227 (19(51), we are now entirely satisfied that the requested remand is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">While the appellant township and the respondent Department urge the remand, respondent Ronson Corporation argues that this case \u201cis more akin to the <em>P. T. &amp; L. </em>case <em>[State v. P. T. &amp; L. Construction Co., Inc., </em>77 <em>N. J. </em>20 (1978)] than it is to the <em>Garden State </em>ease,\u201d and that there is, accordingly, \u201cno necessity for a remand in this matter.\u201d Bonson\u2019s reliance on <em>P. T. &amp; L. </em>is misplaced. While the Township Land Use Ordinance does allow as permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>accessory uses in the General Commercial and Manufacturing Zone \u201c[o]ther uses and structures customarily incidental to \u00e1 principal permitted use,\u201d \u00a7 12:3-11(2) (a), there has as yet been no administrative or judicial holding as to whether the proposed helistop use is \u201ccustomarily incidental to [the] principal permitted use\u201d of the Ronson premises. As pointed out in <em>P. T. &amp; L. </em>two determinations must first be made before such a holding can be arrived at.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">The first is whether the use is incidental to the main use: does the use \u201c* * * bear a close resemblance and obvious relation to the main use to which the premises are put\u201d? <em>Honigfeld v. Byrnes, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>600, 606 (1954) ; * *\u25a0 * Second, it must be determined whether a use which is found to be incident to the permitted use is also a customary use. *\u25a0 *' * Generally, a use which is so necessary or commonly to be expected that it cannot be supposed that the ordinance was intended to prevent it will be found to be a customary use. [77 <em>N. J. </em>at 26-27],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In <em>P. T. &amp; L. </em>the court, after analyzing the facts and circumstances there involved, concluded that they were sufficient \u201cto bring the [helistop]' use within the accessory coverage of the [local zoning] ordinance,\u201d and so held. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Here, on the other hand, the required analysis has not been made. And, in fact, there are not sufficient facts in the record to warrant such an analysis. Compare <em>P. T. &amp; L. </em>at 27-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Beyond this, while the Commissioner of Transportation has \u201cthe ultimate authority as to the placement of aeronautical facilities,\u201d <em>Garden State Farms, Inc. v. Bay, supra, </em>77 <em>N. J. </em>at 454, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>6:1-29, it is \u201centirely appropriate\u201d for him \u201cto pay due attention to the lawful zoning expressions of local governments and not act * * in an unreasonable fashion so as to arbitrarily override all important legitimate local interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garden State Farms, supra </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Clearly he [the Commissioner] should, at the very least, acknowledge the relevance of the local zoning ordinance with respect to applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>tions for private heliports and helistops. To this we would add as a material consideration that the Commissioner ought to take into account whether an applicant for a private heliport has availed itself of any right to a variance under the local zoning law[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and whether an application for a variance should be pursued as a helpful procedure for fleshing out the impact of the proposed facility upon neighboring land uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">These observations are not inconsistent with current thinking with respect to locating helistops and heliports. As the Director of the Division testified at trial, normal administrative procedure is to accommodate the needs and desires of localities in establishing aeronautical facilities; so much so that as a matter of policy the initiative would not ordinarily be taken to place a helistop or heliport within a municipality unless the municipality permitted such a use. <em>[Garden State Farms, Inc. v. </em>Bay] 136 N. <em>J. Super. </em>[1] at 9. Such deference to municipal zoning ordinances expresses the statutory policy to assimilate local land-use decisions, N. <em>J. S. A. </em>40 :55-1.11(e) (currently N. <em>J. S. A. </em>40 :55D-28(b) (4)), tempered by the supervision of the Commissioner. N. <em>J. S. </em>A. 6 :1-29. Thus, a failure on the Commissioner\u2019s part to weigh conscientiously local interests, to examine carefully whether the proposed avigation facility is compatible with the surrounding land uses and to consult the local ordinances and authorities in making its licensing decision would constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>[Id. </em>at 455-456].</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The adjudication and order under review is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner of Transportation for further proceedings and determination as to Ronson\u2019s license application consistent with this opinion and the applicable standards and principles set forth in <em>Garden State Farms, Inc. v. Bay, supra. </em>We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> If it is found that the proposed helistop use is not a permitted accessory use in the <em>zone.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
