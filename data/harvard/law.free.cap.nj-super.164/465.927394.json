J. Super. </em>133 (Law Div. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Plaintiff Andrew Rogozinski received $1,200 in income for a trailer-repair job performed during the interval of his unemployment. We find that this amount should have been deducted in the computation of the damages to which said plaintiff was entitled. Since interest on said $1,200 is also to be credited, we remand the matter to the trial court for the purpose of revising the judgment to reflect the mitigation of the amount thereof, including interest, by reason of the $1,200 deduction. We1 do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
