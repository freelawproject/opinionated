RODOWSKY, J. (Retired, Specially Assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">At issue here are the applicability of the personal injury protection (PIP) coverage provisions and the validity of the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage in an automobile liability policy issued by the appellee, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) to its named insured, Alaskan Bundue-Conteh (the Claimant). These proceedings arise on the Claimant\u2019s complaint to the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) that State Farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>had denied his claim for PIP benefits. Applying certain trade practice enforcement provisions, MIA agreed with the Claimant on the merits and, in final agency action, imposed a penalty on State Farm by ordering payment of the benefits with statutory interest. In an action for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversed. This appeal followed. For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The facts are undisputed. The Claimant was the owner of two automobiles. His 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee was insured by State Farm under an automobile liability policy that included PIP coverage. He also owned a 2006 Ford Crown Victoria that he drove as a taxicab. It was insured for liability with Amalgamated Casualty Insurance Co. under a policy that did not contain PIP coverage. On November 14, 2011, while Claimant was occupying his taxicab, it was rear-ended by another automobile, causing Claimant personal injuries. Claimant is seeking a recovery of PIP benefits under a policy covering an owned motor vehicle that he was not occupying at the time of the accident. That State Farm policy contains the exclusion from PIP coverage that is set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq1\">\u201cExclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cTHERE IS NO COVERAGE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201c3. FOR YOU OR ANY RESIDENT RELATIVE WHILE OCCUPYING A MOTOR VEHICLE OWNED BY YOU OR ANY RESIDENT RELATIVE AND WHICH IS NOT INSURED UNDER THE LIABILITY COVERAGE OF THIS POLICY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXS\">There are a number of provisions of the Insurance Article of the Maryland Code that are relied upon in the arguments of the parties. Some of those statutes are set forth below. Unless otherwise noted, all references are to sections of Maryland Code (1997, 2011 Repl.Vol.), Article, \u201cInsurance,\u201d Title 19, \u201cProperty and Casualty Insurance,\u201d Subtitle 5, \u201cMotor Vehicle Insurance \u2014 Primary Coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u201c\u00a7 19-501.

People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994). Further, the expertise of the agency in interpreting the statute which it administers should be respected. <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">MIA makes two submissions which we have converted into questions presented.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">I. Does the plain meaning of the statutory provisions relating to mandatory PIP coverage require that State Farm pay PIP benefits to its insured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">II. Did MIA correctly determine that the owned but uninsured exclusion did not permit State Farm to deny PIP benefits to its Insured?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">Much of the ground covered by the first issue has been plowed in <em>Nasseri v. Geico General Ins. Co., </em>390 Md. 188, 888 A.2d 284 (2005). There, the named insured under a GEICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>automobile policy, covering the insured\u2019s private motor vehicle, was injured in an automobile collision while driving a taxicab that was owned by a third party. The GEICO policy included PIP coverage but the policy on the taxicab did not. GEICO denied the insured\u2019s claim for PIP benefits, relying on the policy\u2019s exclusion for injuries in an uninsured automobile which was available for the regular use of the insured. The Court held that PIP benefits must be paid by GEICO. Essentially, the Court said that, unlike automobile liability coverage that follows the insured vehicle, PIP coverage follows an insured individual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">PIP coverage was not negated by the exclusion relied upon by GEICO because the exclusion was broader than the authorizing statute, \u00a7 19 \u2014 505(c)(l)(ii) 1, which required the vehicle occupied by the insured at the time of the collision to be owned by him, as opposed to being available for the insured\u2019s regular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Despite <em>Nasseri, </em>MIA argues that, because a taxicab is excluded from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d the Claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>was not occupying a motor vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii), the authorization for the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP. The argument undertakes to prove too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">MIA seems to argue that, because the authorization permits exclusion from PIP of injuries to certain persons \u201coccupying an [owned,] uninsured motor vehicle,\u201d and because a taxicab is, by definition, not a motor vehicle, the exclusion cannot apply. <em>Nasseri, </em>however, explained the purpose of the definition. It was enacted by Ch. 655 of the Acts of 1977,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201c \u2018[for] the purpose of exempting certain vehicles, as defined in the Vehicle Laws, from certain required primary coverage insurance provisions; and subdividing a section.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHK\">\u201cConsequently, the purpose of Ch. 655 was simply to provide that the compulsory automobile liability insurance policies on taxicabs and certain other vehicles did not have to contain policy provisions for PIP and some other statutory coverages. The purpose was not to negate required PIP and other required coverages, under policies on all other types of motor vehicles, whenever a taxicab happened to be involved in an accident with another type of motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">390 Md. at 195-96, 888 A.2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The definitional statute tells us that a taxicab is not required to carry PIP coverage as primary insurance for taxicab occupants, but it does not tell us whether the taxicab occupant\u2019s policy does or does not provide secondary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">MIA similarly contends that Claimant was not occupying a taxicab that was \u201cuninsured\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 19 \u2014 505(c)(l)(ii) because the taxicab was covered for liability in at least the minimum amounts required by law. In this respect, the agency\u2019s opinion looked to, and relied heavily upon, \u00a7 19-509(a) which defines an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d Section 19-509 deals with uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>definition applies only to \u00a7 19-509 and has no effect on the exclusion from PIP authorized by \u00a7 19-505(c)(l). In the context of \u00a7 19 \u2014 505(c)(1), \u201cuninsured\u201d refers to uninsured for PIP which ordinarily (and absent express waiver) will manifest itself in the automobile liability policy of the claimant by the absence of the owned vehicle from the declaration of vehicles insured against liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">As recognized in <em>Nasseri, </em>PIP coverage follows an insured, even into a taxicab, principally because of two statutes, each of which uses the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as an element of coverage. The requirement for a motor vehicle liability insurer to provide PIP, found in \u00a7 19-505(a), applies to \u201can insured who is injured in any motor vehicle accident, including an accident that involves an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Nasseri </em>held that the claimant there was involved in a motor vehicle accident, because the other vehicle was not a taxicab, 390 Md. at 193, 888 A.2d at 287, and the claimant-occupied taxicab was an \u201cuninsured [for PIP] motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, \u00a7 19-513(d)(1)\u00a9 requires a PIP insurer to pay those benefits \u201cto an individual insured under the policy who is injured in a motor vehicle accident ... while occupying a motor vehicle for which [PIP] coverages are not in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Having determined in <em>Nasseri </em>that the claimant\u2019s driving a taxicab was not a valid basis for denying PIP, the Court nevertheless was required to decide whether the scope of the coverage was restricted by an authorized exclusion. In <em>Nas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>sen, the exclusion was unauthorized (policy\u2019s \u201cregular use\u201d scope broader than statute\u2019s \u201cowned\u201d scope).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Here, MIA asserts that the Claimant \u201cwas not occupying an uninsured motor vehicle because his taxicab had the required vehicle insurance.\u201d But, the taxicab in <em>Nasseri </em>also had the required (liability) insurance. That did not shortcut the need for the Court to analyze the PIP exclusion in the policy on which the PIP denial was based against the statutorily permissible exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While we recognize that MIA\u2019s opinion on the correct interpretation of the statutes it administers is entitled to some deference, we conclude on de novo review of the issue of law before us that MIA has not given effect to the legislative intent. The history of this issue begins with <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The automobile policy in that case included an owned but uninsured exclusion applicable to PIP and to uninsured motorist coverages. <em>Gartelman </em>pointed out that the statutes at that time did not authorize such exclusions. In response, the General Assembly enacted Chapter 573 of the Acts of 1982, at the urging of the insurance industry. <em>See Nasseri, </em>390 Md. at 200 n. 11, 888 A.2d at 291 n. 11. Chapter 573 authorized an owned but uninsured exclusion for uninsured motorist coverage as Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.), Article 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(1), today \u00a7 19-509(f)(l) and a similarly worded exclusion for PIP coverage as Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl. Vol.), Article 48A, \u00a7 545(c), today \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Maryland appellate courts have sustained applications of the uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) exclusion. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Comer, </em>419 Md. 89, 18 A.3d 830 (2011), involved a claimant who incurred over $200,000 in medical expenses due to injuries suffered in an accident on his motorcycle. The tortfeasor had $100,000 of liability coverage and the claimant\u2019s policy on his motorcycle provided an additional $50,000 in UM/UIM. A policy on an automobile owned by the claimant\u2019s father, in whose household the claimant resided, had single limit UM/UIM coverage of $300,000. The claimant sought a judgment declaring that, as an insured under his father\u2019s policy, he was entitled to UM/UIM benefits, although his motorcycle was not insured under the father\u2019s policy. The father\u2019s policy contained the following UM/UIM exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">\u201cBodily injury sustained by an insured while occupying a motor vehicle owned by an insured and not described in the declarations and not covered by the bodily injury and property damage liability coverage of this policy is not covered.\u201d (Emphasis omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed a judgment in favor of the claimant, despite the general language in the policy affording coverage, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">\u201cComer\u2019s and the Circuit Court\u2019s reliance upon the basic uninsured/underinsured coverage provision, and the paragraph dealing with primary/excess insurance, is misplaced. These two provisions, standing alone, may well indicate excess coverage for Comer under the GEICO policy. The two provisions, however, do not stand alone. The nature of an exclusion, dealing with a more specific circumstance, is to modify, or create an exception to, the broader coverage provisions. If the two coverage provisions of the GEICO policy did not arguably cover Comer\u2019s claim, there would be no need to consider any exclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 95, 18 A.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The Court held that \u201c[t]he exclusion is not ambiguous and clearly precludes coverage of Comer\u2019s claim under the GEICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 18 A.3d at 834. Section 19-509(f)(l) authorized the exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 18 A.3d at 835. One of the rationales on which it is bottomed is set forth below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">\u201cOne purpose of exclusion 4 in the GEICO policy, as well as a purpose of \u00a7 19 \u2014 509(f)(1), is obviously to prevent a family, owning several motor vehicles, from insuring only one or two of them with an insurer, leaving the other vehicles uninsured, or underinsured under a different policy, and being able to claim uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits from the first insurer even though no premium was paid to the first insurer for coverage of the other vehicles. An interpretation of the Insurance Code that would allow this would be unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 98, 18 A.3d at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">This Court had reached the same conclusion on similar facts in <em>Powell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>86 Md.App. 98, 585 A.2d 286 (1991). We said that present \u00a7 19-509(0(1) recognized an owned but uninsured exclusion for UM/UIM because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201c[t]o hold as appellant also urges, i.e., that his wife\u2019s vehicle was not <em>uninsured </em>because it was covered under another policy, would be to permit an owner to buy excess coverage under one policy for one vehicle at a relatively small premium and coverage under a separate policy for his other vehicles at a lesser cost, and have the excess coverage of the first policy apply to the vehicles covered under the subsequent policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 110, 585 A.2d at 291. The Court of Appeals, in <em>Comer, </em>concurred with our opinion in <em>Powell </em>and quoted, with favor, the above language from <em>Powell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">MIA has not presented us with any principled distinction between the statutory authorization of an owned but uninsured exclusion from UM/UIM coverage and the statutory authorization for an owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage. Nor do we discern any, particularly in view of the lock-step authorization with which the General Assembly has treated the two exclusions. For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">. The Court in <em>Nasseri </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\"The language of the Insurance Article, as well as numerous opinions by this Court, make it clear that an insured, who has PIP coverage under a policy on the insured's motor vehicle, and who is injured in an accident while occupying a different motor vehicle owned by someone else, is ordinarily entitled to PIP coverage under the policy on the insured's vehicle. If the vehicle occupied by the insured also has PIP coverage, that coverage will be primary and the coverage under the policy on the insured\u2019s vehicle will be secondary. If the occupied vehicle has no PIP coverage, the coverage under the insured\u2019s policy will be primary. <em>See, e.g., Bishop v.
