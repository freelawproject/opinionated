In this Court, he challenges the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granting summary judgment in favor of the owner of the Property, Home Equity USA, Inc. (\u201cHome Equity\u201d), appellee, on the ground that Mr. Rogers did not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Towanda Property was the source of his lead exposure and elevated lead levels in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>On appeal, Mr. Rogers presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">Did the circuit court err in granting Home Equity\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on the ground that Mr. Rogers failed to establish that the Towanda Property contained lead-based paint, and therefore, he failed to meet his burden to show that the Property was a substantial factor in causing his injuries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Mr. Rogers was born on February 28,1994. From his birth until March 1998, when he moved to New York with his mother, Toni Rogers-Coy, Mr. Rogers lived in numerous locations in Baltimore, often staying at each location for very brief periods of time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">For the first \u201ccouple months\u201d after Mr. Rogers was born, he lived at 2828 Nevada Street in Baltimore. Later in 1994, after temporarily residing at various other locations, Mr. Rogers moved to 6149 Chinquapin Parkway in Baltimore (\u201c6149 Chinquapin\u201d), where he lived until approximately October 1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>For at least the first year of his residence at 6149 Chinquapin, the windows, doors, and radiators were in poor condition, with \u201cbroken pieces of paint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Following his residence at 6149 Chinquapin, Mr. Rogers moved to the Towanda Property, which was built in 1920. He lived at that residence for approximately six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">With respect to the presence of lead in the Towanda Property, Mr. Rogers admitted evidence that, in 1976, 20 years prior to his residency, the Baltimore City Health Department (\u201cBCHD\u201d) required a lead abatement of the Towanda Property (the \u201c1976 Abatement\u201d) after an inspection and analysis showed that certain areas tested positive for lead in paint-chip sampling, and eight areas of flaking paint were in need of corrective action. In October 1976, the BCHD issued an abatement card, indicating that abatement work had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Subsequently, additional improvements were made to the property. In 1979, the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development (\u201cDHCD\u201d) issued a building permit for a new gas boiler. In 1983, the DHCD issued a rehab permit, which involved roofing, carpentry, plumbing repairs, and painting. In February 1994, DHCD issued a permit for $19,000 worth of rehabilitation work, which included re-stuccoing the home and repairing the rear decks.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Ms. Rogers-Coy moved to the Towanda Property when \u201c[s]omeone told [her] about it,\u201d and she paid rent to another tenant who was \u201cjust trying to help [her] out until [she] got where [she] was trying to go.\u201d Because she was not a party to the lease, she had no evidence of chipping, flaking, or peeling paint at the inception of the lease. She did not know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>if the tenant owned the property, and she paid him \u201cwhat [she] could.\u201d In her deposition, Ms. Rogers-Coy described the windows in the Towanda Property as having \u201creally bad\u201d chipping and flaking paint, and she stated that they \u201cwere actually more flaky than Chinquapin was.\u201d Ms. Rogers-Coy testified in her deposition that she left the Towanda Property between March and April 1997, after residing there for approximately six months. At that point, she and Mr. Rogers moved to 2534 Loyola Northway.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Mr. Rogers was tested for elevated lead levels on multiple occasions. His medical records show the following results, which the parties do not dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\n<em>Blood Lead</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMp\"><em>Date </em>Level<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Address</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABg\">6/29/95 7 |xg/dL 6149 Chinquapin</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjI\">3/25/96 14 |xg/dL 6149 Chinquapin</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdAD\">1/8/97 21 |xg/dL 3738 Towanda</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFU\">3/26/97 20-21 fxg/dL 3738 Towanda</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6i\">4/30/97 17-18 (xg/dL 2534 Loyola Northway</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMu\">8/22/97 13 ]xg/dL Foster care/2534 Loyola Northway</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">Following his test on January 8, 1997, Mr. Rogers was referred to the Community Health Nurse for evaluation. On March 17, 1997, a caseworker from the Lead Paint Poisoning Prevention Program met with Ms. Rogers-Coy at the Towanda Property. The caseworker noted that the house was \u201cin very [] dilapidated condition.\u201d Mr. Rogers, who was three years old at the time, was observed \u201cmouthing the window sills in the house.\u201d The property had flaking paint \u201cinside and outside,\u201d but Mr. Rogers was \u201clisted as playing indoors and not outdoors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">As a result of Mr. Rogers\u2019 increased blood lead level test on January 8, 1997, he was referred to the Kennedy Krieger Institute Lead Poisoning Prevention Clinic. On March 26, 1997, Ms. Rogers-Coy took Mr. Rogers to Kennedy Krieger, and his blood lead level tested 20, 21 |xg/dL. Ms. Rogers-Coy reported at that time that Mr. Rogers was at the Towanda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Property \u201c[a]ll the time,\u201d and there was interior flaking paint on the ceiling, walls, window frame, windowsills, window wells, and woodwork. She reported exterior flaking paint on the front porch and window frames. There were no replacement windows. During a follow-up appointment on April 30, 1997, while Mr. Rogers was living at 2534 Loyola Northway, his blood lead levels were 17,18 |xg/dL.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">On May 29,2013, Mr. Rogers filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Home Equity and the owners of 6149 Chinquapin, asserting claims of negligence and unfair trade practices relating to his alleged exposure to lead: (1) between 1994 and 1996 at 6149 Chinquapin, and (2) between 1996 and 1997 at the Towanda Property, which was owned by Home Equity. He alleged that, at all times during his tenancies, the properties contained lead-based paint in such a deteriorated condition that it was peeling, chipping, and flaking from the walls, baseboards, windowsills, and other areas of the premises, and that Home Equity and the owners of 6149 Chinquapin knew or had reason to know of the hazardous conditions. He alleged that, as a consequence of his exposure to lead-based paint, Mr. Rogers \u201csuffered permanent brain damage resulting in developmental and behavioral injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On February 12, 2014, Home Equity answered the complaint, and discovery commenced. Dr. Robert Simon, a Ph.D. with ETI Environmental Laboratory (\u201cETI\u201d), provided a report including the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">It was my conclusion, to a reasonable degree of scientific probability, that [the Towanda Property] was a pre-1950 house confirmed with the presence of lead based paint by BCHD testing in 1976. The presence of lead based paint hazards was confirmed by BCHD in 1976 and on 03/17/97. The need for continuing abatement of lead based paint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>hazards from 2008 to 2013 was listed in the [housing authority] records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">It was my conclusion, to a reasonable degree of scientific probability, that the 21 gg/dL elevated blood lead levels of the plaintiff on 01/08/97 and 03/26/97 both occurred while he was living at [the Towanda Property]. The documented presence of lead based paint hazards and his [elevated blood levels] while residing there led me to conclude that [the Towanda Property] was a substantial contributing source of his lead exposure and lead poisoning during his early childhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On December 8, 2014, Home Equity moved for summary judgment. In its motion, Home Equity asserted that, throughout his life, Mr. Rogers lived in, and was exposed to, lead in multiple residences, and therefore, he was unable to draw a causal relationship between his residence at the Towanda Property and any alleged damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, Home Equity asserted that Mr. Rogers\u2019 expert witnesses, Arc Environmental, Inc. (\u201cArc\u201d) and Dr. Simon, acknowledged that Mr. Rogers was exposed to lead at other residences and could not eliminate the other properties as the cause of his alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Home Equity attached to the motion for summary judgment a November 1, 2013, report prepared by Arc, which showed that Arc tested the interior and exterior of 6149 Chinquapin and found lead-based paint above the Maryland standard. An October 15, 2014, report issued by Arc with respect to the Towanda Property, however, indicated that Arc tested only the exterior of the Towanda Property, and Home Equity asserted that mere testing of the exterior of a home is not sufficient to establish that the home was a substantial contributing source of alleged lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>With respect to Dr. Simon, Mr. Rogers\u2019 causation expert, Home Equity stated that, although Dr. Simon asserted in his report, which was attached to the motion for summary judgment, that the Towanda Property was a substantial contributing source of Mr. Rogers\u2019 lead exposure, he conceded in his subsequent deposition that multiple properties likely contributed to Mr. Rogers\u2019 lead exposure, and based on an elevated blood lead level of 14 p,g/dL on March 25, 1996, \u201cthere existed a substantial contributing factor to [Mr. Rogers\u2019] lead exposure before he ever lived at the Towanda Property.\u201d Dr. Simon admitted that he was not qualified to testify as to the specific causation of any injury to Mr. Rogers because he was not a medical doctor. He stated that he did not collect or analyze any samples in forming his opinion that the Towanda Property was a contributing cause of Mr. Rogers\u2019 alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Home Equity asserted that Dr. Simon\u2019s conclusion that the Towanda Property was a substantial contributing cause of Mr. Rogers\u2019 alleged lead exposure was based solely on the age of the property,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the deposition testimony of Ms. Rogers-Coy, documentation of the 1976 Abatement, which he opined was a \u201climited abatement,\u201d and the lack of information that any flaking paint at the Towanda Property in the 1990s was not lead-based.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Home Equity asserted that Dr. Simon\u2019s assertions \u201cflatly contradict\u201d Mr. Rogers\u2019 burden of proving all facts essential to the cause of action, and Mr. Rogers had \u201cput forth no affirmative evidence to show that lead paint at the Towanda Property \u2014 and not at some other property \u2014 caused his alleged injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>On December 29, 2014, Mr. Rogers filed a response to Home Equity\u2019s motion for summary judgment, asserting that he presented both</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">direct and circumstantial evidence of the existence of lead-based paint at [the Towanda Property] as well as expert toxicological and medical testimony opining that there was more likely than not lead-based paint exposure at [the Towanda Property] and that [he] was injured as [a] result of that exposure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Mr. Rogers stated that he was not required to present direct evidence, \u201cby way of interior testing,\u201d to prove that his blood lead levels were caused by exposure to lead at the Towanda Property because there was evidence of deteriorated paint located in areas that were easily accessible to him at the property during his tenancy, and he experienced his \u201chighest elevated blood lead levels while living\u201d at the property. He stated that he \u201chad access to areas with chipping and flaking paint and was seen mouthing windowsills that tested positive for lead-based paint in 1976,\u201d and he was not required to \u201crule out all possible sources of lead\u201d exposure because there \u201ccan be multiple causes of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In addition to Dr. Simon\u2019s report indicating that the Towanda Property was a substantial source of Mr. Rogers\u2019 lead exposure, Mr. Rogers attached an October 24, 2014, report from his medical expert, Dr. Jeanette R. McDaniel, in which she concluded that, based on the age of the property, the condition of the property during Mr. Rogers\u2019 residency as described by Ms. Rogers-Coy, the home visit conducted by the BCHD in 1997, Mr. Rogers\u2019 blood lead levels, his age and risk factors, the 1976 positive lead-testing of the property, the 2014 Arc testing, and the absence of gut rehabilitation, Mr. Rogers was exposed to lead at the Towanda Property. Mr. Rogers argued that, because he lived at the Towanda Property for six months, had access to areas of deteriorated paint at the property, and had his \u201chighest sustaining elevated blood lead levels while he lived at the property,\u201d the evidence was sufficient for a trier of fact to conclude that the Towanda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Property was a substantial contributing source of his lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In opining that Mr. Rogers\u2019 exposure to lead at the Towanda Property was a \u201csubstantial contributing factor to his elevated lead levels,\u201d Dr. McDaniel stated that \u201cChinquapin may have also contributed to his exposure but to a lesser degree.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She concluded that Mr. Rogers \u201csustained injuries to his central nervous system from his lead exposure.\u201d Although he was functioning in society and school, \u201chis test scores and his ADHD as well as his executive function and working memory skills may have been affected by his lead exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Dr. McDaniel stated that it typically takes 30-45 days after lead ingestion for blood lead levels to increase, and it takes the same amount of time for blood lead levels to decrease. She agreed that, if Mr. Rogers began living in the Towanda Property on January 1, 1997, a blood draw on January 8,1997 could not be a result of exposure at Towanda, but rather, it \u201cwould probably be more a reflection on where he left.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She also agreed that, because the previous blood lead level he had was 14 gg/dL in March 1996, it was possible that Mr. Rogers\u2019 21 gg/dL blood lead level in January 1997 reflected a decrease in blood lead levels from what it was before he moved into the Towanda Property. She further testified that an increase in blood lead level from 14 |xg/dL to 21 [xg/dL did not change the impact of Mr. Rogers\u2019 injuries, but rather, the numbers were \u201cjust a reflection of his exposure of the lead load \u2014 lead load level \u2014 lead load at that residence, so he\u2019s still suffering the same damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On January 23, 2015, the court held a hearing. Home Equity argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on two bases: (1) there was no evidence of medical causation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>and (2) Mr. Rogers could not eliminate other sources of exposure to lead-based paint. With respect to causation, Home Equity argued that Mr. Rogers had not established that the increase in his blood lead levels were substantial enough to contribute to his injuries, noting that Dr. McDaniel testified that the increase in blood lead level from 14 pg/dL to 21 (xg/dL did not change the impact of Mr. Rogers\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">With respect to Mr. Rogers\u2019 inability to eliminate other sources of lead paint exposure, counsel argued that there was direct evidence of lead-based paint at 6149 Chinquapin, but there was no direct evidence of any lead-based paint in the interior of the Towanda Property. To \u201cconnect the dots between a defendant\u2019s property and plaintiffs exposure to lead\u201d in a lead exposure case involving circumstantial evidence, a plaintiff must \u201crule out other reasonably probable sources\u201d of lead exposure, which Mr. Rogers had not done, given the testimony that the Chinquapin property was a source of his lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Counsel for Mr. Rogers argued that the evidence showed that Mr. Rogers lived at the Towanda Property from October 1996 through April 1997, a period of approximately six months, and Dr. McDaniel opined that Mr. Rogers\u2019 blood lead levels of 21 [xg/dL were attributable, to a substantial degree, to his residence at the property. Mr. Rogers asserted that there was \u201cdirect evidence of lead in the interior of the property\u201d based on the 1976 lead testing and the lack of subsequent records showing \u201cgut rehabilitation or significant rehab of the house.\u201d Thus, he argued, the \u201csame components that were tested positive with lead in 1976 were still there\u201d during Mr. Rogers\u2019 tenancy at the property. Moreover, in March 1997, the house was in a dilapidated condition, Mr. Rogers was seen chewing on the windowsills, and his blood lead levels were elevated. Counsel stated that Mr. Rogers did not dispute that other properties contributed to his elevated blood lead levels, but he asserted that the evidence indicated that the Towanda Property was a \u201cdirect, actual, substantial contributing factor of those blood lead levels.\u201d And recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>testing of the Towanda Property showed \u201cmultiple areas of lead on the exterior of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted Home Equity\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Initially, it noted that it rejected Home Equity\u2019s argument that Mr. Rogers could not prove medical causation \u201cbecause of Dr. McDaniel\u2019s testimony that the level of 21, as opposed to 14, did not cause any additional injury to Mr. Rogers.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">I\u2019m aware from other cases with testimony concerning cumulative levels and increased levels, and in addition, I think that the testimony at deposition of Dr. McDaniel is not conclusive. There is the reference ... suggesting that she would attribute additional injury to the higher level. And while there\u2019s certainly grist for cross-examination in her later statement as well, I don\u2019t find that that creates an undisputed state of facts that warrant summary judgment on that argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The court than addressed Home Equity\u2019s second argument, that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence of the presence of lead paint as a source of exposure for Mr. Rogers in the Towanda Road property.\u201d With regard to that contention, the court concluded \u201cthat the Plaintiffs in this case do not have sufficient evidence to proceed on those issues of source and source causation.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">The Plaintiffs in this case explicitly disavow any reliance on <em>[Dow v. L &amp; R Properties, </em>144 Md.App. 67, 796 A.2d 139 (2002)] in a purely circumstantial theory[,] emphasizing the evidence that they have that a lead-paint hazard was present in this property in the mid 1970s. That certainly is evidence that the Plaintiffs can use, and I agree with Plaintiffs that that moves the ball beyond any presumption from the age of the house to actual evidence that lead paint existed in the house at one point. But I think the causal dots that are not connected for the Plaintiffs case are then the supporting evidence from which a jury could conclude that the same lead paint, which was present in the house in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>1976 or the mid 1970s, remained in the house in 1996 and 1997 when Mr. Rogers was allegedly exposed.<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">And I think the Plaintiff would have to rely on some other circumstantial theory to support those issues concerning the actual exposure in \u2014 alleged exposure in the 1990s. Because they\u2019ve disavowed any reliance on Dow, and because their experts have not purported to exclude other sources or circumstantially demonstrate that the Towanda Road property was the source of both lead exposure and the elevated levels measured in 1997, I will grant summary judgment for this Defendant on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Following the hearing, the court issued an order granting Home Equity\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">On February 2, 2015, Mr. Rogers filed a motion for reconsideration. In his Motion for Reconsideration, Mr. Rogers argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that an inspection certificate filed by the owner of the Towanda Property in 2007 indicated that the property was not free of lead paint, showing that the lead paint found in 1976 had not been removed. He attached an inspection certificate issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment, which included the following five categories: (1) Lead Free; (2) Full Risk Reduction; (3) Modified Risk Reduction; (4) Lead Safe Qualified Offer; and (5) Lead Safe Not Qualified Offer. The inspector checked the category \u201cFull Risk Reduction.\u201d A Full Risk Reduction certificate indicates that there is a reduced risk of lead exposure in a rental unit, and this standard is met by \u201cpassing the test for lead-contaminated dust, provided that that any chipping peeling, or flaking paint has been removed or repainted on interior and exterior of the rental dwelling unit.\u201d Maryland Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ment of the Environment, <em>Lead Poisoning Prevention Program: Lead Paint Certificates for Rental Housing </em>(Rev. Jan. 2015). https://perma.cc/AAQ5-UHHP.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In its opposition, Home Equity argued that this exhibit was \u201cpreviously admissible as evidence,\u201d but Mr. Rogers chose not to admit it, and reconsideration of summary judgment was not merited. On March 31, 2015, the circuit court issued an order declining to reconsider its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 501(f) governs motions for summary judgment and provides that a trial court \u201cshall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Accord Reiter v. Pneumo Abex, LLC, </em>417 Md. 57, 67, 8 A.3d 725 (2010). A determination \u201c[w]hether a circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is proper in a particular case is a question of law, subject to a non-deferential review on appeal.\u201d <em>Tyler v. City of College Park, </em>415 Md. 475, 498, 3 A.3d 421 (2010). Thus, the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment on the law is <em>de novo. D'Aoust v.

In support, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">[Mr. Rogers] put forth direct evidence of the existence of lead-based paint in the house in 1976, and evidence that the original lead paint components that were dilapidated and contained many layers of old deteriorated paint remained in the house during [his] residency. [He] has also put forth evidence of building and renovation permits establishing a reasonable inference that there was no lead abatement or removal of all the leaded components prior to 1996. Absent evidence of complete lead abatement to <em>contradict </em>these facts, [he] has put forth sufficient evidence for a jury to logically infer the likely existence of lead-base[d] paint during his residency in 1996-97.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Mr. Rogers asserts that, based on the \u201ctotality of the facts, a fact finder could reasonably infer the existence of deteriorate[d] lead-based paint at the [Towanda Property] that substantially contributed to [his] lead exposure, elevated blood lead levels and resulting injuries.\u201d He lists those facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">1) the house was an older house built in 1920 at a time when 95 percent of homes contained lead-based paint; 2) the home was found to contain lead paint throughout the interior in 1976; 3) these lead paint components were not completely abated in 1976; 4) the home was found to contain lead paint in 2014 on the exterior porch and adjacent exterior window where [he] spent significant time; 5) [t]he house contained many areas of deteriorated paint in the interior and exterior during [his] residency and these areas match areas found to contain lead-based paint; 6) [he] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>had frequent hand to mouth activity, and mouthed the windows in the home ...; 7) [he] was of a tender age when he spent all of his time in the home containing deteriorated paint; 8) [he] had his highest sustained elevated blood lead levels while residing at [the Towanda Property], that increased rather than declined as would be expected if he were removed from a lead paint source; 9) [t]he home was not certified lead free by a Maryland Department of the Environment certified inspector in 2007; 10) there is no evidence in the record that the home was gut renovated prior to residency, and to the contrary, the home was described as old, dilapidated and condemned; 11) the windows in the home were original to the home and not replacement windows during [Mr. Rogers\u2019] residency; 12) [t]here is no evidence in the record, other than pure speculation, that [Mr. Rogers] was exposed to any other probable sources of exposure while residing at [the Towanda Property].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Accordingly, he concludes, \u201cit was improper for the trial court to grant summary judgment and deny the motion for reconsideration.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Home Equity responds that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in its favor because Mr. Rogers did not put forth sufficient evidence that the Towanda Property proximately caused his alleged injuries. It asserts that Mr. Rogers failed to \u201cdemonstrate the presence of lead at the Towanda Property, let alone his exposure to lead there or any additional injury from such exposure,\u201d and therefore, he could not \u201cestablish that the Towanda Property proximately caused his injuries.\u201d Home Equity contends that a \u201c[p]laintiff cannot create a genuine dispute of material fact by pointing to the presence of lead paint that was detected and remediated twenty years prior to his alleged residence at the Towanda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Property, especially where renovation, repair, and repainting took place in the intervening decades.\u201d It asserts that Mr. Rogers \u201cseeks to invert the burden of proof,\u201d arguing that he should be able to submit his claim to a jury unless Home Equity can show \u201cby testimony, or other evidence\u201d that the lead paint discovered in the Towanda Property in 1976 had been remediated, a standard not supported by Maryland law. In any event, it asserts that the record shows that the lead paint found in 1976 was abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Additionally, Home Equity asserts that the Arc report showing lead paint on the exterior of the Towanda Property in 2014 does not \u201csave [Mr. Rogers] from the lack of causation evidence.\u201d It contends that \u201c[m]erely testing the exterior of a home is not sufficient to establish that the home was a substantial contributing source of ... alleged lead exposure.\u201d Moreover, it argues that, to the extent that Mr. Rogers argues on appeal that he was exposed to lead paint while spending time on the front porch, this argument is not properly before this Court because it was not raised in or decided by the trial court. In any event, it asserts, there is \u201cno evidence that [Mr. Rogers] engaged in any hand-to-mouth activity on the porch ... or that [he] otherwise ingested paint from the outside of the home.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]o the extent [Mr. Roger\u2019s] new theory is even plausible, he failed to develop sufficient facts to support it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Home Equity further argues that, even if Mr. Rogers could show the presence of lead at the property, \u201che lacks sufficient evidence to submit to a jury the question of whether this lead caused him harm because he cannot eliminate other properties as the source of his exposure.\u201d In that regard, it asserts that Dr. Simon \u201cconceded that there existed at least one other substantial contributing factor to [Mr. Rogers\u2019] lead exposure before he lived at the Towanda Property.\u201d In sum, Home Equity argues that, because Mr. Rogers cannot \u201cput forth sufficient evidence to show the presence of deteriorated lead paint at the Towanda Property during his residence there,\u201d and he cannot show that the Towanda Property, and not some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>other property, caused his alleged injuries, summary judgment was proper.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">A plaintiff alleging negligence has the burden of proving \u201c1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, 2) that the defendant breached that duty, 3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and 4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u201d <em>Rowhouses, Inc. v.

Where a plaintiff bases his negligence claim on an alleged violation of a statute or ordinance governing lead paint, the plaintiff must prove \u201c(a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d <em>Brooks v.

At times, these separate inferences may be drawn from the same set of facts, but parties would do well to remember that these inferences are separate and often will require different evidentiary support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><em>Hamilton v. Kirson, </em>439 Md. 501, 529-30, 96 A.3d 714 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">A plaintiff may show causation through either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 527, 96 A.3d 714. Circumstantial evidence may satisfy the plaintiffs burden of proof if it demonstrates that the property is a reasonable probable source of lead exposure. <em>Rowhouses, </em>446 Md. at 654-57, 133 A.3d 1054. The evidence is sufficient if it \u201c \u2018creates a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility supporting a rational inference of causation, and is not wholly speculative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 529, 96 A.3d 714 (quoting <em>West v. Rochkind, </em>212 Md.App. 164, 170-71, 66 A.3d 1145 (2013)). In other words, the plaintiff must show that \u201cthere is a fair likelihood that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a source of the lead exposure.\u201d <em>Rowhouses, </em>446 Md. at 657-59, 133 A.3d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\"> Causation in a lead paint case involves \u201ca series of links: (1) the link between the defendant\u2019s property and the plaintiffs exposure to lead; (2) the link between specific exposure to lead and the elevated blood lead levels[;] and (3) the link between those blood lead levels and the injuries allegedly suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 529, 96 A.3d 714 (quoting <em>Ross v. Housing Auth. of Baltimore City, </em>430 Md. 648, 668, 63 A.3d 1 (2013)). Thus, to be a substantial factor in causing a plaintiffs alleged injuries, the home in question must have been a source of the plaintiffs exposure to lead, the \u201cexposure must have contributed to the elevated blood lead levels, and the associated increase in blood lead levels must have been substantial enough to contribute to [plaintiffs] injuries.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Here, with respect to the first link, Mr. Rogers contends that he had both direct and circumstantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>showing that the Towanda Property was a reasonable probable source of his lead exposure. Although there was no testing of the residence during the time that he lived there, Mr. Rogers asserts that there was direct evidence that the Towanda Property contained lead-based paint in the interior of the home in 1976, which he asserts \u201cwas not completely removed based on the abatement standard in effect during that time, and direct evidence of lead-based paint still remaining in 2014 on the exterior porch and windows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Home Equity argues, and the circuit court found, that evidence of the existence of lead paint in the residence in 1976 was not \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of the presence of lead paint during Mr. Rogers\u2019 residency, 20 years later. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 547 n. 8, 823 A.2d 664 (2003), the Court of Appeals defined \u201cdirect evidence\u201d as \u201c \u2018[e]vidence, which if believed, proves existence of fact in issue without inference or presumption.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 461 (6th ed. 1990)). Evidence of the presence of lead paint in the Towanda Property in 1976 is not direct evidence of lead paint in the property in 1996-97. As the circuit court noted, Mr. Rogers\u2019 theory requires a fact finder to presume the presence of lead paint in 1996-97 in the absence of specific evidence that the lead paint found in 1976 was removed. To allow Mr. Rogers to go to the jury on the argument that, because the house contained lead paint at one time, 20 years earlier, and \u201c[n]o one has ever determined\u201d that the interior was lead-free after that time, would ignore Mr. Rogers\u2019 burden to show a reasonable probability, not a possibility, that lead paint existed at the property during the time he lived there.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We agree with the circuit court that evidence of lead paint in the house 20 years before Mr. Rogers resided there is not direct evidence of lead paint in the property during his residency, and it is not sufficient to satisfy Mr. Rogers\u2019 burden and get the case to the jury. Although it may establish a \u201cpossibility\u201d of causation, it does not satisfy Mr. Rogers\u2019 burden to show that the Towanda Property was a \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>probable source\u201d of his lead exposure. <em>Rowhouses, </em>446 Md. at 654-57, 133 A.3d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">That is not to say that this evidence could not be considered, with other evidence, as circumstantial evidence showing that the Towanda Property was a reasonable probable source of lead exposure. Mr. Rogers argues that there was such evidence, citing to evidence that he asserts provided an inference that lead remained in home during his residency, such as the \u201clack of evidence of any gut renovations\u201d prior to his residency and the evidence that, during his tenancy, the original windows remained, the property was dilapidated, as well as evidence that lead paint was found on the exterior porch in 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Home Equity disagrees. It argues that Mr. Rogers \u201ccannot put forth sufficient evidence to support his proposed inferences that deteriorated lead paint remained at the Towanda Property after the 1976 Abatement and that further repair work did not take place,\u201d noting that the record reflects that the Towanda Property had significant renovations during the 20 years after the 1976 finding that lead was present, an abatement card was issued in 1976, and the Baltimore City Code in effect in 1976 required the removal of lead paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Because Home Equity relies heavily on the abatement card issued in 1976, we address that issue first. In Dr. Simon\u2019s report, admitted below, Dr. Simon stated that the abatement in 1976 was a limited abatement, which corrected the flaking paint found, but did not address other areas that tested positive for lead paint. Although Home Equity did not challenge this conclusion below, in this Court, Home Equity asserted that the issuance of the abatement card established as a matter of law that all lead paint was removed from the Property because an abatement, under the law at that time, required the removal of all interior lead paint. Our review of the Baltimore City Code in effect in 1976, Art. 13 \u00a7\u00a7 703, 703, reveals a requirement that all peeling or flaking paint be removed, and that no new painting be done with lead-based paint. We did not find, however, a requirement to remove all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>lead-based paint, as Home Equity alleges, even if it was not flaking or peeling. Similarly, Md.Code (1976 Supp.), Art. 43, \u00a7 117A, permitting tenants to put rent in escrow if a landlord failed to remove lead paint from surfaces <em>easily accessible </em>to children, did not require the removal of all lead-based paint, but merely removal from surfaces easily accessible to children. On the record presented here, we are not persuaded that the mere existence of the abatement card shows, as a matter of law, that there was a \u201cfull abatement\u201d in 1976, as opposed to a \u201climited abatement,\u201d as Dr. Simon opined.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Although the abatement in 1976 does not resolve the issue, that is not the end of the inquiry. As indicated, Mr. Rogers has the burden to show that it was reasonably probable that lead-based paint found in 1976 still existed during his residency at the Towanda Property 20 years later, and this lead paint substantially contributed to his lead exposure, his elevated blood lead levels, and his injuries. We need not resolve whether Mr. Rogers met his burden in this regard because, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the other evidence was sufficient to create an inference that the Towanda Property contained lead-based paint in 1996-97, we conclude that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment on the ground that Mr. Rogers has not adequately demonstrated \u201cthat the Towanda Road property was the source of both lead exposure and the elevated levels measured in 1997.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In this regard, Mr. Rogers asserts that he presented evidence that he \u201chad his highest sustained elevated blood lead levels while residing at [the Towanda Property], that increased rather than declined as would be expected if he were removed from a lead paint source.\u201d Although the record does support his assertion that his blood lead levels were highest at the Towanda Property, the record does not support his assertion that his blood lead levels increased after moving to the Towanda Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">With respect to the lead levels at various residences, the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Mr. Rogers, reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Date_Blood Lead </em>Level_Address_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">06/29/1995 7 gg/dL 6149 Chinquapin Park_way_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">03/25/1996 14 (xg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">October 1996 3738 Towanda Avenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">01/08/1997 21 (xg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">03/26/1997 20-21 |xg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">April 1997 2534 Loyola Northway</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">04/30/1997 17-18 (xg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">08/22/1997 13 (xg/dL_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">As the chart reflects, Mr. Rogers\u2019 blood lead level was elevated, at 14 [xg/dL, on March 25, 1996, before he moved to the Towanda Property. Given this evidence of Mr. Rogers\u2019 elevated blood lead level when he lived at 6149 Chinquapin Parkway, Mr. Rogers\u2019 expert, Dr. McDaniel, agreed that Chinquapin was a source of Mr. Rogers\u2019 lead exposure. She also testified that there were no additional blood tests before January 8, 1997, approximately 10 months later, and because there were no blood tests administered before Mr. Rogers moved to the Towanda Property in October 1996, the 21 |xg/dL blood lead level recorded on January 8, 1997, could reflect a decrease in his blood lead levels from what it was before he moved into the Towanda Property. Under these circumstances, the record does not reflect, as Mr. Rogers asserts, evidence that his blood lead levels increased while he was residing at the Towanda Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">Given this evidence, Mr. Rogers did not produce evidence that created a reasonable probability that he was exposed to lead at the Towanda Property that caused his alleged lead-exposure injuries. Although his factual allegations supported a <em>possibility </em>that he was exposed to lead there, he did not show a reasonable probability that the Towanda Property was a substantial contributor to his elevated blood lead levels. Accordingly, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Home Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\">. Home Equity states that Mr. Rogers did not respond to its requests for admissions until after it filed its motion for summary judgment. It argues that, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-424(b), which provides that \"[ejach matter of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted\u201d if not answered within 30 days, Mr. Rogers\u2019s failure to timely respond to Home Equity\u2019s request for admissions results in his admitting that he lived in multiple residences, both before and after he lived at the Towanda Property, and he was exposed to lead at those residences. Mr. Rogers did not specifically contest this assertion. We note, however, the circuit court\u2019s comment that, even if the matters requested were deemed admitted, it was of no moment because Mr. Rogers\u2019 position was that there was enough direct evidence of exposure at the Towanda Property that \"could be a substantial factor in addition to those other properties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\">. There does appear to be a factual dispute regarding when Mr. Rogers moved to the Towanda Property. Mr. Rogers asserts that, in a light most favorable to him, the evidence showed that he began living at the Towanda Property in October 1996, \"based on information in Kennedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Krieger Institute medical records, Maryland Department of Social Services records, as well as statements from Ms. Rogers-Coy.\u201d As Home Equity points out, however, some of the records indicate that the date was in 1997. If this fact was critical, we could not affirm the grant of summary judgment. Home Equity argues, however, that even relying on the October 1996 date, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment.

Again, Home Equity is relying on Maryland Rule 2-424(b), relating to the failure to respond to requests for admissions, to argue that Mr. Rogers lived in multiple residences where he was exposed to lead. As Home Equity points out, Mr. Rogers does not contest this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">. Dr. Simon explained that most houses built before 1950 \"would most likely contain lead-based paint ... unless proven negative by testing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. On October 7, 2014, when Dr. Simon issued his report, Arc had not yet issued a report of its findings from the exterior testing of the Towanda Property. After receiving a copy of the Arc report relating to the finding of lead on the exterior of the Towanda Property, Dr. Simon issued an addendum to his report, restating his previous conclusion that the Towanda Property was a substantial contributing source of Mr. Rogers' alleged injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">. At her deposition, Dr. McDaniel agreed that 6149 Chinquapin \u201cwas a source of exposure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">. The transcript states July, but in context, it is clear that the reference was to January 8, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[10]\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">10. During the hearing, the court repeatedly asked Mr. Rogers\u2019 counsel how evidence of lead in the interior of the residence in 1976 supported an inference that there was lead in the interior in 1996, noting that Mr. Rogers had the burden to produce evidence of lead in the premises when he lived there, and the law did not permit a presumption that once there was lead in the house it remained, unless the defendant rebutted the presumption with evidence that it was gone. The court stated that Mr. Rogers had the burden to show that the lead paint was not removed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. Mr. Rogers does not make any argument of error in denying the motion for reconsideration that is different from the argument of error in denying the motion for summary judgment. Thus, we will focus our analysis on the initial ruling granting the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. Home Equity further argues that, if this Court concludes that Mr. Rogers did present a question of material fact regarding the presence of deteriorated lead paint at the Towanda Property and link that lead paint to his elevated blood lead levels, his \"claim still fails as a matter of law because [he] lacks evidence to link his alleged harm to any increased blood lead levels he attributes to the Towanda Property.\u201d It asserts that Mr. Rogers\u2019 sole medical expert, Dr. McDaniel, testified that she did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that an increase in blood lead level from 14 (tg/dL to 21|xg/dL necessarily resulted in greater injury to Mr. Rogers. That testimony, argues Home Equity, \u201dshow[s] that [her] opinion is insufficient to link [Mr. Rogers'] alleged exposure at the Towanda Property to any injury over and above what he already sustained.\u201d Therefore, Home Equity asserts, even if Mr. Rogers \"could show the presence of lead hazards at the Towanda Property and link these lead hazards to an increased blood lead level, he cannot link his blood lead levels during the alleged time period of his residence to any additional or separate injury.\u201d Based on our resolution of this case, we need not address Home Equity's argument in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
