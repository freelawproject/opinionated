LVNV Funding LLC, </em>212 Md.App. 748, 71 A.3d 193, <em>cert. denied, </em>435 Md. 266, 77 A.3d 1084 (2013), this Court held that judgments obtained by collections agencies that do not have a license are void. In this case, we must determine whether Old Republic Insurance Company (\u201cOld Republic\u201d), appellant, is a collection agency pursuant to Md.Code (2010 RepLVol.) \u00a7 7-101(c) of the Business Regulation Article (\u201cBR\u201d), part of the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Act (\u201cMCALA\u201d), and therefore, was required to be licensed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>collection agency to pursue this action against Nancy Gordon, appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Old Republic is an insurance company that offers, among other things, credit insurance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In December 2006, Old Republic issued a credit insurance policy to Countrywide Home Loans (\u201cCountrywide\u201d) to insure a mortgage that Countrywide had extended to Ms. Gordon. Ms. Gordon defaulted on her mortgage, and Old Republic paid Countrywide pursuant to the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Old Republic filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Ms. Gordon, seeking the unpaid amount of her debt. It subsequently moved for summary judgment. Ms. Gordon opposed Old Republic\u2019s motion, arguing that she was entitled to summary judgment because Old Republic was an unlicensed collection agency, and therefore, it could not obtain a judgment against her. After a hearing, the circuit court found, as a matter of law, that Old Republic was engaged in collection activity, and it granted Ms. Gordon\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On appeal, Old Republic raises three questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">1. Did the circuit court err in its construction of the phrase \u201ccollection agency\u201d under BR \u00a7 7-101(c)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">2. Did the circuit court err in granting an oral summary judgment request?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">3. Did the circuit court err in dismissing the case with prejudice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer the first question in the affirmative, and therefore, we shall reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">On July 28, 2005, Ms. Gordon purchased a property in Parkville, Maryland for $589,700. On October 26, 2006, Countrywide extended a loan to Ms. Gordon in the amount of $95,000, secured by a deed of trust in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Old Republic states, and Ms. Gordon does not dispute, that Old Republic issued a credit insurance policy to Countrywide in December 2006, \u201cproviding insurance coverage for loss if a qualified loan held by Countrywide defaulted.\u201d Although the insurance contract is not a part of the record on appeal, Old Republic stated in its motion to vacate, alter, or amend, or for other appropriate relief, and Ms. Gordon has not disputed, that the policy set forth subrogation rights, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-7\">In the event of any payment under this Policy, the Company [i.e., Old Republic] shall be subrogated to all of the Assured\u2019s [i.e., Countrywide] rights of recovery against the Borrower and any other person or organization liable under the terms of the defaulted Note and against any reserve or holdback funds in its hands, and the Assured shall execute and deliver at the request of the Company instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to transfer, assign and secure such rights. The Assured shall do nothing after Loss to prejudice such rights, and the execution by the Assured of a release or waiver of the right to collect the unpaid balance of a Loan shall equally release the Company from any further obligation under this Policy as to said Loan, anything in this Policy to the contrary notwithstanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">On or around February 1, 2011, Ms. Gordon defaulted on her loan, and Countrywide submitted a claim to Old Republic. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>At the time of default, $70,481.19 remained unpaid on the loan. Old Republic determined that the claim was covered and paid it. Old Republic then began to pursue repayment from Ms. Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">On February 29, 2012, after negotiations with Ms. Gordon, Old Republic agreed to release the deed of trust in exchange for a payment of $9,000 and Ms. Gordon\u2019s acknowledgment that she still owed $85,541.62 on the loan, minus the $9,000 she paid. By October 2013, Old Republic had received no further payment from Ms. Gordon. It then filed a complaint for money due on accounts stated. Old Republic sought $70,481.19, as well as pre-judgment interest of $10,572 and attorney\u2019s fees of $10,572.18, plus costs. Old Republic also filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that Ms. Gordon had no defense to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Ms. Gordon filed an answer and an opposition to the motion for summary judgment. She asserted that the collection attempt was illegal because Old Republic acquired the alleged debt when it was in default, and therefore, Old Republic was acting as a \u201ccollection agency\u201d under BR \u00a7 7-101(c), but Old Republic was not licensed as a collection agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Finch, </em>212 Md.App. at 764, 71 A.3d 193, in which this Court held that \u201ca judgment entered in favor of an unlicensed debt collector constitutes a void judgment as a matter of law,\u201d Ms. Gordon argued that Old Republic was not entitled to summary judgment against her because any judgment it obtained would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>be void. She requested that the circuit court enter judgment against Old Republic because it was not entitled to the relief it sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The circuit court directed Old Republic to file a reply, not to exceed five pages and limited to the argument that it was not authorized to bring the complaint because it was not licensed as a collection agency. Old Republic did so, asserting that it was not required to be licensed under MCALA because it did not engage in debt collection, but rather, it was licensed in the State of Maryland to conduct insurance business. It argued that it was pursuing the subrogation rights it obtained after paying Countrywide pursuant to its insurance policy, and therefore, it did not \u201cacquire\u201d Ms. Gordon\u2019s debt at a time when she was in default, but rather, it \u201cstepped into the shoes\u201d of Countrywide and enjoyed \u201cthe same rights that [Countrywide] enjoyed prior to filing its claim.\u201d Moreover, Old Republic stated that it did not engage in the debt collection agency business, noting that it did not undertake debt collection for third parties or purchase defaulted debts from third parties for the purpose of collection. Citing MCALA\u2019s legislative history, it asserted that BR \u00a7 7-301(c)(l)(ii) was targeted at \u201c \u2018debt purchasers,\u2019 a special subset of entities,\u201d which did not include insurance companies pursuing subrogation rights. Consequently, it argued that it was not a collection agency, and it was permitted to obtain a judgment against Ms. Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Ms. Gordon disagreed, asserting that Old Republic was requesting the circuit court to \u201ccreate a judicial exception for it that does not exist under the statute or common law.\u201d Stating that MCALA governs businesses attempting to assert a consumer claim \u201cif the claim was in default when the person acquired it,\u201d Ms. Gordon asserted that, because Old Republic acquired this debt when it was in default and was trying to collect it, Old Republic was required to be licensed under MCALA, regardless of its status as an insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">On March 6, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing on Old Republic\u2019s motion. Counsel for Old Republic listed three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>reasons why Old Republic should not be required to be licensed in this matter. First, Old Republic was an insurance company and did not do business as a collection agency. Second, MCALA was targeted toward debt purchasers, not insurance companies pursuing subrogation rights, and Old Republic did not purchase the debt at issue in this case. Third, Old Republic\u2019s rights vested prior to Ms. Gordon\u2019s default, as it was essentially stepping into Countrywide\u2019s shoes as Ms. Gordon\u2019s creditor. It argued that, because MCALA was not targeted toward a party in Old Republic\u2019s position, Old Republic did not qualify as a collection agency under BR \u00a7 7-101, and it did not need to be licensed as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Counsel for Ms. Gordon argued that Old Republic acquired its interest in Ms. Gordon\u2019s debt when it was in default, and it was now pursuing a consumer claim against her. Accordingly, counsel asserted that, pursuant to the plain language of BR \u00a7 7-101, Old Republic was acting as a collection agency. He argued that, because any judgment obtained by Old Republic, an unlicensed collection agency, would be void, Ms. Gordon was entitled to judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Counsel for Ms. Gordon also noted that BR \u00a7 7-102 contains a list of persons and entities to whom MCALA is inapplicable, and insurance companies pursuing subrogation rights are not listed. He argued that this list would be essentially meaningless if the court carved out a new exception for Old Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">At the end of the hearing, counsel for Old Republic stated that, because the parties had been limited to five pages of argument on the issue of interpreting MCALA, it believed that the parties could \u201cflesh out\u201d the record more substantially with further submissions, particularly with regard to MCA-LA\u2019s legislative history. The court responded: \u201cIf you want to supplement the record, I am going to permit you to do that.\u201d The court took the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment under advisement and indicated that it would issue a written opinion at an unspecified later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>On March 18, 2014, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion. The court stated that there were no facts in dispute, and the sole question before it was the legal issue whether Old Republic was required to be licensed as a collection agency in order to pursue its claim against Ms. Gordon. The court found that, under the plain language of MCALA, Old Republic was acting as a collection agency because it was asserting a consumer claim related to a debt that it acquired while the debt was in default. It refuted Old Republic\u2019s arguments to the contrary, stating: \u201cThat [Old Republic] acquired the debt through a subrogation agreement as opposed to a debt purchase is immaterial. The plain meaning of the statutory language captures the activity that [Old Republic] is engaging in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The court stated that MCALA\u2019s legislative history \u201cdoes not supersede a plain meaning analysis of the statutory language,\u201d which \u201crequires a court to end its inquiry into legislative intent when the statutory language is unambiguous and the resulting application of the statute is reasonable, as it is in the instant case.\u201d In any event, it was not persuaded by Old Republic\u2019s argument that MCALA was targeted solely at debt purchasers because BR \u00a7 7-102(b) contained an extensive list of persons and entities who were not required to obtain a collection agency license, and insurance companies were not included in that list. Because it found that Old Republic was acting as a collection agency without a license, the court granted summary judgment to Ms. Gordon and dismissed Old Republic\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">On April 14, 2014, Old Republic filed a motion to vacate, alter, or amend, or for other appropriate relief. It stated that the court\u2019s initial order limiting it to a five page reply on the issue whether it was required to be licensed \u201cmaterially limited\u201d its ability to respond, and therefore, it was \u201cmaterially prejudiced\u201d when the court granted Ms. Gordon\u2019s oral summary judgment motion. It explained that it was in the process of preparing its supplemental memorandum when the court issued its order, but it was unable to submit it prior to the order. Old Republic asserted that the court \u201cappear[ed] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to miss certain material points\u201d in granting Ms. Gordon\u2019s motions. In particular, it noted that the court did not discuss what it meant to \u201cengage in the business of\u2019 collecting consumer claims, and it argued that it was not engaged in any such business.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Old Republic elaborated on its argument that MCALA was targeted only at regulating debt purchasers. It asserted that debt purchasers were a very specific group of entities, whose primary business was collecting debts that they had purchased. It contended that it was not a debt purchaser, and accordingly, MCALA did not apply to it. Old Republic stated that it was not seeking to carve out a judicial exception for itself, but rather, it simply was seeking a construction of the statute that recognized it was not \u201cengaged in the business of\u2019 collecting consumer claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Old Republic also argued that the rule of lenity was applicable to the court\u2019s analysis because MCALA contained both civil and criminal provisions. It asserted that, because it was at least ambiguous whether MCALA applied to it, pursuant to the rule of lenity, that ambiguity should be resolved in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Finally, Old Republic asserted that, even if the court disagreed with Old Republic\u2019s proposed interpretation of MCALA, it would be deciding that Old Republic did not have standing to bring the complaint. Accordingly, it argued that only a dismissal without prejudice was appropriate because the court\u2019s decision would not constitute an adjudication of the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Ms. Gordon filed a response, characterizing Old Republic\u2019s pleading as a \u201c \u2018kitchen sink\u2019 tome.\u201d She asserted that Old Republic did not raise any new arguments and had a full and fair opportunity to present its position before the circuit court, objecting to the five-page limitation only after the court ruled against it. In any event, Ms. Gordon argued that MCALA was unambiguous, and therefore, its legislative history and the rule of lenity were not applicable. She asserted that the court did not err in holding that the plain language of MCALA required Old Republic to be licensed as a collection agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>and precluded it from obtaining a judgment against her. Finally, she argued that the court did not err in dismissing Old Republic\u2019s action with prejudice, as any judgment it obtained would be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Ms. Gordon subsequently filed a document entitled Supplemental Authority in Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion to Vacate, Alter or Amend. She noted that Old Republic was involved in a related matter in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, <em>Old Republic Insurance Company v. Joana Oteng, </em>in which it sought to enforce a debt as subrogee of a mortgage company, and the circuit court in that case found that Old Republic was a collection agency and could not collect the debt. She attached a copy of the Frederick County decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">On June 24, 2014, the circuit court issued another memorandum opinion and order denying Old Republic\u2019s motion to vacate, alter or amend. The court rejected Old Republic\u2019s claim that it did not have an adequate opportunity to respond to Ms. Gordon\u2019s oral motion for summary judgment, noting that: (1) Old Republic did not object to the oral motion at the hearing; and (2) Ms. Gordon \u201cunequivocally requested \u2018that the Court grant judgment against [Old Republic] since it is not entitled to the relief it seeks in this action\u2019 in her Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d The court further noted that it had permitted Old Republic to submit a supplemental response to the court after the hearing, but Old Republic failed to submit it timely. For these reasons, the court believed that, even if there were any procedural abnormalities, Old Republic was not prejudiced. In any event, the court stated that the additional materials recently submitted by Old Republic did not impact its decision because MCALA was unambiguous. The court further ruled that dismissal with prejudice was proper because, Old Republic\u2019s assertions notwithstanding, the court did not rule that Old Republic lacked standing to sue Ms. Gordon, but rather, it ruled that Old Republic was engaged in illegal debt collection and was not permitted to obtain the relief it was seeking. Accordingly, the court denied Old Republic\u2019s motion to vacate, alter, or amend. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Before addressing the propriety of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on the merits, we address Ms. Gordon\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal. This motion is based on Old Republic\u2019s action, subsequent to the judgment here, in obtaining a Maryland collection agency license. Ms. Gordon asserts that, given that action, this appeal should be dismissed as moot because it \u201cnow concerns a hypothetical question for which no further controversy exists.\u201d She contends that, \u201c[b]y voluntarily seeking and obtaining a collection agency license as of November 7, 2014, Old Republic is equitably estopped from acting in a manner contrary to its declaration to the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Board that it requires a collection agency license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Addressing first the mootness argument, this Court has stated that \u201c \u2018[a] case is moot when there is no longer any existing controversy between the parties at the time that the case is before the court, or when the court can no longer fashion an effective remedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thana v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs for Charles County, </em>226 Md.App. 555, 567, 130 A.3d 1103 (2016) (quoting <em>Green v. Nassif, </em>401 Md. 649, 654, 934 A.2d 22 (2007)). Here, Old Republic\u2019s action in obtaining a license after the hearing does not make this appeal moot. The issue presented, whether the circuit court properly determined that the action against Ms. Gordon should be dismissed because Old Republic did not have a license at the time it instituted suit, remains an existing controversy. Dismissal on the grounds of mootness is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Turning to the equitable estoppel argument, we note that the Court of Appeals has explained the doctrine of equitable estoppel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">\u201cThe basis of equitable estoppel is the effect of the conduct of one party on the position of the other party\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201c[t]he estopped party is therefore \u2018absolutely precluded both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed ... against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><em>Dickerson v. Longoria, </em>414 Md. 419, 453, 995 A.2d 721 (2010) (quoting <em>Creveling v. GEICO, </em>376 Md. 72, 101-02, 828 A.2d 229 (2003)). Equitable estoppel consists of three elements: \u201c \u2018voluntary conduct or representation, reliance, and detriment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, LLC, </em>402 Md. 281, 316, 936 A.2d 343 (2007) (quoting <em>Mona Elec. Co. v. Shelton, </em>377 Md. 320, 334, 833 A.2d 527 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Ms. Gordon argues that Old Republic voluntarily represented to the licensing board that it is a collection agency, and the licensing board relied on that representation in issuing Old Republic a license. She asserts that this \u201cinures to the detriment of the State to the extent such action is deemed to mitigate its prior illegal collection activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Old Republic disagrees. It argues that Ms. Gordon cannot establish any of the elements of equitable estoppel because it made no representation to her, she did not rely on any representation from Old Republic, and she was not harmed by any representation from Old Republic. It asserts that it \u201cchose to act in compliance with the lower court\u2019s ruling ... while [it] pursues an appeal to hopefully remedy what [it] perceives\u201d as an erroneous decision, and that this action should not preclude it from maintaining this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">We agree with Old Republic on this issue. Ms. Gordon has not alleged that her position in the underlying litigation changed based on Old Republic\u2019s action, after the court\u2019s ruling, in getting a license. The doctrine of equitable estoppel is inapplicable here and does not warrant dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">MCALA</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">In <em>Finch, </em>212 Md.App. at 758, 71 A.3d 193, this Court noted that, pursuant to Maryland law, persons doing business as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>collection agency generally must have a license. <em>See </em>BR \u00a7 7-301(a) (\u201c[A] person must have a license whenever the person does business as a collection agency in the State.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to lawsuits, we stated in <em>Finch </em>that, \u201c[generally, a party that lacks a required license may not file an action in a Maryland court to enforce rights related to its unlicensed activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756-57, 71 A.3d 193. Specifically, with respect to debt collection, we explained that \u201cMCALA is an integral part of a collection agency\u2019s status as a claimant in Maryland,\u201d and without a license, a collection agency has no authority to file suit against the debtor. <em>Id. </em>at 763-64, 71 A.3d 193. Accordingly, a \u201cjudgment entered in favor of an unlicensed debt collector constitutes a void judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764, 71 A.3d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The issue presented here is whether Old Republic is a collection agency under MCALA. Old Republic argues that the circuit court erred in ruling that an insurer pursuing its subrogation right is a collection agency business required to get a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In determining whether the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Ms. Gordon, our first determination is whether there was a genuine dispute of material fact. <em>Deutsche Bank Nat\u2019l Trust Co. v. Brock, </em>430 Md. 714, 727, 63 A.3d 40 (2013). For a disputed fact to be material, it must be one that will affect the outcome of the case. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] reasonable dispute over a material fact will preclude summary judgment, because its resolution lies with the jury.\u201d <em>Carter v. Aramark Sports &amp; Entm\u2019t Servs., Inc., </em>153 Md.App. 210, 225, 835 A.2d 262 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 Md. 231, 844 A.2d 427 (2004).

Our first step toward that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>goal is to examine the text. \u201cIf the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction.\u201d <em>Lockshin v.

State, 442 </em>Md. 254, 265-66, 112 A.3d 408 (2015) (footnote omitted). The Court further noted, however, that given \u201cthe ultimate end of divining the will of the Legislature,\u201d this Court may look to the legislative history \u201ceven if merely to ratify that our conclusion of the unambiguous meaning of the statute is correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265 n. 6, 112 A.3d 408. \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we consider <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 265, 112 A.3d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Evolution of MCALA</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The statutory provision we must construe in this case was added in 2007. To put this language in context, we will briefly discuss the provisions of MCALA prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Prior to 2007, MCALA applied only to businesses that collected debt owed to another person. <em>See </em>Charles W. Turnbaugh, Commissioner of Financial Regulation and Chairman of the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Board, Testimony in Support of H.B. 1324 (\u201cMaryland law regulates collection firms that collect consumer debt as agents of the creditor (hospitals, retailers, credit card issuers etc.). The law does not require licensing for businesses that only collect their <em>own </em>consumer debts, unless the business uses a name or other artifice that indicates that another party is attempting to collect the consumer debt.\u201d); 65 Md. Op. Atty. Gen. 316 (1980) (persons who collect rent owed to themselves as owners of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>claim are not in the business of a collection agency, but a third party, such as a management agent collecting debt on behalf of a homeowners association, is considered a collection agency). Old Republic contends, and Ms. Gordon does not dispute, that, prior to 2007, an insurance company pursing a subrogation claim was not \u201cviewed to be in the business of a collection agency\u201d requiring a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In 2007, the General Assembly amended the definition of \u201ccollection agency,\u201d adding the language at issue here, i.e., a person who engages in the business of \u201ccollecting a consumer claim the person owns, if the claim was in default when the person acquired it.\u201d BR \u00a7 7-101(c)(l)(ii). The question here is whether this new language makes Old Republic a collection agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u201cIn the Business of\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Old Republic argues that it is not a company that \u201cengages ... in the business of ... collecting a consumer claim.\u201d It asserts that it is an insurance company, and pursing subrogation rights is merely incidental to its primary business of insurance, and therefore, it does not qualify as engaged \u201cin the business of\u2019 debt collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">There is a dearth of authority in Maryland addressing the meaning of the phrase \u201cin the business of.\u201d Other courts, however, have defined the term. In <em>American Legion Post </em># <em>49 v. Jefferson Insurance Co., </em>125 N.H. 758, 485 A.2d 293, 294 (1984), the New Hampshire Supreme Court opined that \u201cin the business of\u2019 has two ordinary meanings: (1) \u201cany regular activity that occupies one\u2019s time and attention, with or without direct profit motive;\u201d or (2) \u201can activity with a direct profit objective.\u201d <em>Accord Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5906, </em>276 S.W.3d 298, 301 (Ky.Ct.App.2009) (quoting <em>Jefferson Insurance Co., </em>485 A.2d at 294). <em>See also Royal Foods Co. v. RJR Holdings, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[A]n entity is engaged \u2018in the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>where that entity buys or sells to further its commercial enterprise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">There is support for Old Republic\u2019s contention that, in interpreting the phrase \u201cin the business of,\u201d a court should look at the nature and extent of the activity. For example, in <em>Farmers Insurance Exchange v. AAA of Michigan, </em>256 Mich. App. 691, 671 N.W.2d 89, 94 (2003), the Court of Appeals of Michigan applied a \u201cprimary purpose/incidental nature test.\u201d In that case, the issue was whether a day-care provider\u2019s vehicle was a \u201cmotor vehicle operated in the business of transporting passengers\u201d pursuant to a statute providing that the insurance of such a vehicle must pay no-fault benefits to an injured passenger. <em>Id. </em>at 90. The court held that the vehicle was not operated \u201cin the business of\u2019 transporting passengers because the day-care provider\u2019s transportation of the children to school was an incidental part of her day-care business and the vehicle\u2019s primary use was as a personal vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 94-95. <em>Accord State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Seeba, </em>209 Ga.App. 328, 433 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1993) (the \u201cwords \u2018engage in business\u2019 imply an element of continuity or habitual practice,\u201d not a secondary activity); <em>Wellesley College v. Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 49 N.E.2d 220, 227 (1943) (college was not \u201cin the business of\u2019 serving meals to the public for purposes of meal tax, but rather, that was incidental to its function as an educational institution).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Other courts, however, have interpreted the phrase \u201cin the business of\u2019 more broadly. For example, in <em>Mission Insurance Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>160 Cal.App.3d 97, 101-02, 206 Cal.Rptr. 383 (1984), the court held that a company was \u201cengaged in the business of\u2019 leasing trailers without operators, even if it was only a small part of the company\u2019s business, which did not make a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Given the different interpretations of the phrase \u201cin the business of,\u201d we conclude that the language of the statute is ambiguous in the context of the issue presented here. Accordingly, we look to the legislative history of MCALA.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">A review of the legislative history underlying the 2007 amendments to MCALA indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to change the law regarding \u201ccollection agencies\u201d that are required to obtain a license to include insurers pursuing subrogation claims. Instead, the legislative history makes clear that the General Assembly enacted the 2007 amendments to regulate \u201cdebt purchasers,\u201d who were exploiting a loophole in the law to bypass the MCALA\u2019s licensing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Senate Finance Committee Report on House Bill 1324 explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">House Bill 1324 extends the purview of the State Collection Agency Licensing Board to include persons who collect consumer claims acquired when the claims were in default. These persons are known as \u201cdebt purchasers\u201d since they purchase delinquent consumer debt resulting from credit card transactions and other bills; these persons then own the debt and seek to collect from consumers like other collection agencies who act on behalf of original creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Charles W. Turnbaugh, Commissioner of Financial Regulation and Chairman of the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Board offered the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">[Tjthe evolution of the debt collection industry has created a \u201cloophole\u201d used by some entities as a means to circumvent current State collection agency laws. Entities, such as \u201cdebt purchasers\u201d who enter into purchase agreements to collect delinquent consumer debt rather than acting as an agent for the original creditor, currently collect consumer debt in the State without complying with any licensing or bonding requirement. The federal government has recognized and defined debt purchasers as collection agencies, and requires that these entities fully comply with the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>This legislation would include debt purchases within the definition of \u201ccollection agency,\u201d and require them to be licensed by the Board before they may collect consumer claims in this State. Other businesses that are collecting their own debt continue to be excluded from this law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Susan Hayes, a member of the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Board, submitted the following in support of the bill: j</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">The traditional method of dealing with distressed accounts has been for creditors to assign these accounts to a collection agency. These agencies, operating under a contingency fee arrangement with the creditor, keep a portion of the amount recovered and return the balance to the creditor. Today, a different option is available \u2014 selling accounts receivables to a third party debt collector at a discount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">HB 1324 closes a loophole in licensing of debt collectors under Maryland law. Just because a professional collector of defaulted debt \u201cpurchases\u201d the debt, frequently on a contingent fee basis, should not exclude them from the licensing requirements of Maryland law concerning debt collectors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The March 28, 2007, Floor Report of the House Economic Matters Committee on House Bill 1324 noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqG\">[The Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation] advises that the State Collection Agency Licensing Board currently regulates 1,304 collection agencies. The department estimates that the bill would make 40 debt purchasers subject to State regulation. Debt purchasers are not currently subject to regulation, as they purchase the debt directly from the creditor and are generally compensated as a percentage of their recovery. Although this activity falls under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Maryland consumers are not currently protected in these transactions by the State Collection Agency Licensing Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\n<em>Q. What problem is this bill addressing?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">A. Although debt collectors must be licensed in Maryland to collect debts owed to a creditor, currently individuals collecting debts owed to themselves are exempt. Creditors have taken to selling defaulted receivables at a discount to collectors who are not licensed under Maryland law, although they are subject to the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Given this legislative history, it is clear that the General Assembly had a specific purpose in mind in adopting the 2007 amendments, i.e., including debt purchasers, people who purchased defaulted accounts receivable at a discount, within the purview of MCALA. There is no dispute that Old Republic is not a \u201cdebt purchaser.\u201d It did not purchase Ms. Gordon\u2019s debt at a discount. Rather, Old Republic became vested with subrogation rights to Countrywide\u2019s claim pursuant to Old Republic\u2019s pre-existing insurance policy with Countrywide.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The legislative history of MCALA does not support the conclusion that the General Assembly intended to include an insurance company pursuing subrogation rights under the definition of \u201ccollection agency\u201d in BR \u00a7 7-101.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court erred in granting Ms. Gordon\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Old Republic was a collection agency and did not have the right to sue Ms. Gordon because it did not have a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL DENIED.

Ms. Gordon makes two additional arguments. First, she objects to references in Old Republic\u2019s brief to circuit court proceedings in other cases, arguing that they were not part of the record below and should not be considered. We will not consider those cases in the resolution of this case. Second, she asserts that Old Republic did not present in any pleading its theory of subrogation, and its argument on appeal in this regard is waived.

I respectfully disagree, though, that there is any ambiguity in Md.Code (1992, 2015 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-101(c) of the Business Regulation Article (\u201cBR\u201d), or any doubt that it applies to an issuer of credit insurance. The General Assembly may well not have meant to include insurance companies <em>generally </em>within the definition of \u201ccollection agency\u201d in its 2007 revisions to the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Act (\u201cMCALA\u201d). But I see no principled way to distinguish <em>credit </em>insurers like Old Republic \u2014 which sell, for profit and as their avowed business, insurance policies against default on a debt, then seek to collect after they pay claims \u2014 from any other company that buys and collects defaulted debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The majority and I agree on the core factual and analytical premises of the case, all of which are undisputed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">1. Countrywide Home Loans (\u201cCountrywide\u201d) lent money to Nancy Gordon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">2.

Old Republic became subrogated to Countrywide\u2019s rights against Ms. Gordon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">8. Old Republic was not licensed as a collection agency in Maryland at any relevant time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">We agree as well that the outcome of this case is driven by well-settled principles of statutory construction, op. at 15-17, 137 A.3d at 245-46, as applied to the definition of \u201ccollection agency\u201d found in the 2007 amendment of MCALA. If a collection agency sues to collect a consumer debt at a time when it lacks a license, any ensuing judgment is void. <em>Finch v. LVNV Funding LLC, </em>212 Md.App. 748, 71 A.3d 193 (2013). Ms. Gordon argued in this case that Old Republic was a collection agency at the time its subrogation rights ripened, and that she was entitled to judgment on Old Republic\u2019s collection claim because Old Republic lacked a debt collector\u2019s license at the time it sought to enforce the claim. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">As the majority states it, \u201cthe issue before us is whether, as a matter of law, Old Republic was a collection agency pursuant to MCALA.\u201d op. at 13, 137 A.3d at 244. The definition of collection agency has five elements: a collection agency is \u201c[a] a person who [b] engages directly or indirectly in the business of ... collecting a [c] consumer claim the [d] person owns, [e] if the claim was in default when the person acquired it.\u201d BR \u00a7 7 \u2014 101(c)(ii) (bold, bracketed markers added). Old Republic indisputably satisfied four of these elements in connection with Ms. Gordon\u2019s debt: [a] Old Republic is a person for purposes of MCALA; [c] Ms. Gordon\u2019s debt qualified as a consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>claim; [d] the debt was originally owed to Countrywide, but Old Republic eventually came to own it; and [e] the debt was in default at the time Old Republic took ownership. So Old Republic\u2019s status as a collection agency, and thus this case, turns on whether it \u201cengages directly or indirectly in the business of\u2019 collecting consumer claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Old Republic casts this question in broad terms \u2014 overly broad, in my view. It characterizes itself as \u201c[a]n insurer pursuing subrogation rights as an adjunct of its insurance business,\u201d op. at 14, 137 A.3d at 245, and argues that insurance companies are engaged in the business of insurance, not debt collection. The majority ultimately agrees, finding ambiguity in the phrase \u201cin the business of\u2019 from the absence of Maryland case law interpreting it and the use of varying formulations in other states, op. at 17-19, 137 A.3d at 246-48. Then, in light of that ambiguity, the majority looks at the legislative history of the 2007 MCALA amendments and finds no intention to include insurance companies. <em>Id. </em>at 18-21, 137 A.3d at 247-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">To me, this is the wrong question. The issue is not whether the General Assembly meant to exclude all insurance companies from MCALA \u2014 we don\u2019t have all insurers before us \u2014 or whether insurers who seek subrogation can be characterized as a \u201cdebt purchaser.\u201d The issue is whether persons (who can be insurers) who issue credit insurance policies that entitle them to collect defaulted debts are \u201cin the business\u201d of collecting consumer claims. Or, put another way, the relevant \u201cbusiness\u201d for purposes of this case isn\u2019t insurance, but <em>credit </em>insurance. And viewed through that lens, there is no ambiguity at all: Old Republic was \u2014 directly, by design and with the blessing of the Maryland Insurance Administration \u2014 in the business of collecting consumer claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The picture sharpens when one looks more closely at credit insurance itself. Citing a classic treatise on insurance, Old Republic describes credit insurance as \u201ca form of surety insurance and general casualty insurance\u201d that is \u201cgenerally defined as insurance against loss or damage resulting from failure of debtors to pay their obligations to the creditor.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>(quoting 12 L.R. Russ &amp; T.F. Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance 3d, </em>\u00a7 167.31 (2005)). The Policy itself is not contained anywhere in the Record Extract or the parties\u2019 various appendices,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but its purpose and structure, and the purpose and structure of this line of business, are not in dispute. Lenders buy (or require borrowers to buy on their behalf) credit insurance as protection against the possibility that borrowers fail to pay the loan. When the borrower (Ms. Gordon) defaults, the insured (the lender, in this case Countrywide) can make a claim against the policy to collect the unpaid debt. And <em>\u201c[i]n the event of any payment </em>under this Policy, [Old Republic] shall be subrogated to all of [Countrywide]\u2019s rights of recovery against [Ms. Gordon] and any other person or organization liable under the terms of the defaulted Note and against any reserve or holdback funds in its hands.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Importantly, Old Republic\u2019s rights to step into its insured\u2019s shoes ripen after the borrower defaults and the Company pays on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Old Republic\u2019s agreement to assume the risk of Countrywide\u2019s loan to Ms. Gordon was not an act of altruism or charity. According to its Company Details Report from the Maryland Insurance Administration, Old Republic is a property and casualty insurance company licensed to sell seven different lines of insurance. The credit insurance subsidiary before us in this case is part of a New York Stock Exchange-traded holding company. Old Republic underwrites the risks it is assuming and charges a premium in exchange for its agreement to assume that risk, and the risk it assumes includes some assessment of the likelihood that it will collect any unpaid balance from the borrower. If Old Republic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>predicts the risks appropriately and calculates premiums correctly, it makes a profit. But whether or not it succeeds, I would hold that Old Republic is, by any rational measure, <em>in the business </em>(and directly so) of selling credit insurance in Maryland for profit, a contractual relationship that includes an enforceable right, <em>after default and payment to the original creditor, </em>to collect the unpaid consumer debt previously owned by its insured. And for that reason, I would affirm the circuit court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Ms. Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Two other points lend further support to my view of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\"><em>First, </em>although I would affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment without analyzing the legislative history of the 2007 MCALA amendments, credit insurers do, in my view, fall within the universe of debt collectors that the General Assembly was trying to capture in the updated definition of \u201ccollection agency.\u201d Indeed, from a functional standpoint, credit insurers are nearly indistinguishable from third-party debt collectors. Both acquire consumer debt from a prior (if not the original) owner \u2014 and the use of the broader word \u201cacquired,\u201d rather than \u201cpurchased,\u201d seems to contemplate that the collection agency could take ownership of the debt through different mechanisms. Upon acquisition, both step into the shoes of their predecessors and take the predecessor\u2019s rights, whatever they may be, to collect the unpaid portion of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The only differences between the two businesses that I can discern lie in the timing and manner of calculating what each pays to acquire the debt. Debt purchasers buy debt at the back end of the life cycle. They pay a discount from its face value, and if they negotiate that discount properly, they collect more from debtors than they paid. Credit insurers, on the other hand, get paid up front, in the form of a premium that covers the risk of default and projects the risk of collection (or not) through subrogation after they pay the claim. In both scenarios, the original creditor gets paid for the debt after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>default and pays, either by taking less than it\u2019s owed or by paying a premium, for the hedge against recovering less or nothing at all. Even with these differences, though, the ability to collect unpaid debt from consumer debtors that originated elsewhere is a core element of their businesses. From the perspective of the debtor \u2014 the party that the Maryland <em>Consumer </em>Debt Collection Act is designed to protect \u2014 it makes no difference <em>how </em>the new creditor came to acquire their debt, only that they\u2019re trying to collect it. And in that role, I see nothing in the statute or the legislative history expressing an intention to exempt credit insurers from fair debt collection rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><em>Second, </em>MCALA does (and did before the 2007 amendments) exempt certain specified businesses from its reach\u2014 mostly financial institutions, but also, among others, \u201ca title company as to its escrow business.\u201d BR \u00a7 7-102(b)(7). This tells me that the General Assembly understood that not all insurers and insurance products are the same, and confirms my belief that Old Republic\u2019s request for a sweeping exemption overstates the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-11\">. Although Ms. Gordon sought to use Old Republic\u2019s eventual decision to obtain a license for estoppel rather than evidentiary purposes, I view it as being in the nature of a subsequent remedial measure, <em>cf. </em>Maryland Rule 5-407, which only bolsters my agreement with the majority on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\">. Old Republic's descriptions of and one quotation from the Policy in its brief cite two sources: the Reply to Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment that it filed in the circuit court, a four-page memorandum that neither attaches nor even quotes from the Policy, and its motion to alter or amend, a longer document that quotes the one provision of the Policy that follows but doesn't attach it. The rest of the Policy language doesn't really matter for my purposes, but it\u2019s frustrating that the many heated and voluminous filings don't contain the one document that defines the parties\u2019 rights vis-\u00e1-vis each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
