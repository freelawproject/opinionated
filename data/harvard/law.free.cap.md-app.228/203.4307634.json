We hold that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The appellants are the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (\u201cthe UFCW\u201d), its subsidiary, the Organization United for Respect at Walmart (\u201cOURWalmart\u201d), and related people and organizations (collectively \u201cthe Union\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellees are Walmart Stores, Inc., and its affiliated companies, WalMart Stores East, LP, and Sam\u2019s East, Inc. (collectively \u201cWalmart\u201d). In the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Walmart sued the Union for trespass and public and private nuisance, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and nominal damages. The court granted a preliminary injunction; denied the Union\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and granted summary judgment in favor of Walmart, entering a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In this appeal, the Union presents five questions for review, which we have consolidated, rephrased, and reordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">I. Did the circuit court err by denying its motion to dismiss Walmart\u2019s claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">II. Did the circuit court err by denying its motion to dismiss Walmart\u2019s public nuisance claim for lack of standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>III. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in fashioning the scope of its permanent injunction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">IV. Did the circuit court err by ruling that this controversy is not a \u201clabor dispute\u201d and/or by finding that Walmart satisfied the heightened requirements of the Anti-Injunction Act? [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The UFCW is a labor union that represents grocery, retail, meatpacking, and food processing workers. Beginning in 2011, the Union held a number of demonstrations at Walmart stores in 13 states, including Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Walmart employees are not unionized.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The Union demonstrations in Maryland took place between July 16, 2011, and September 5, 2013, at Walmart stores in Laurel, Landover Hills, Bowie, Hanover, Arbutus, Severn, and Germantown. Most were carried out inside the stores, with some being held on adjacent parking areas that were owned or leased by Walmart, and one being held on a nearby public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>road. The demonstrations were organized like \u201cflash mobs,\u201d meaning that demonstrators were summoned by social media or mobile phone communications to quickly gather at a store. The demonstrators showed up <em>en masse, </em>\u201ccrashing\u201d the store in a coordinated effort. They marched through the store vestibule and aisles, chanting, singing, blowing whistles, shouting into bullhorns and megaphones, and littering the store with flyers. Some of the demonstrations were small, lasting only 15 to 20 minutes. Others were large, with upwards of 100 or more demonstrators, and lasting over an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In many of the in-store events, the demonstrators interfered with customers by blocking access to the cash registers and the restrooms. During a demonstration in the Laurel Walmart on July 16, 2011, for example, 40 demonstrators wearing \u201cOURWalmart\u201d tee-shirts formed a human chain stretching from the first to the last checkout counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The demonstrators also blocked ingress and egress to parking lots, parking spaces, and store entrances. In May of 2012, demonstrators at the Bowie Walmart parked a large van emblazoned with OURWalmart logos in the parking lot. They played OURWalmart videos on a television screen mounted on the van, piped music through speakers, and solicited customers and employees as they passed by.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In some instances, demonstrators inside stores interrupted Walmart management meetings, forcing themselves into the meeting rooms and videotaping the managers\u2019 efforts to get them to leave. In all the demonstrations, Walmart managers repeatedly told the demonstrators to leave Walmart\u2019s property, but they refused. Ultimately, they were removed by the police. Walmart\u2019s lawyers sent cease and desist letters to counsel for the UFCW in October of 2011, October of 2012, November of 2012, and April of 2013, to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In March of 2013, Walmart filed an unfair labor practice (\u201cULP\u201d) charge against the UFCW and OURWalmart, with the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d). It alleged that the UFCW had violated section 8(b)(1)(A) of the NLRA \u201cby planning, orchestrating, and conducting a series of unau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>thorized and blatantly trespassory in-store mass demonstrations\u201d by which it \u201crestrained and coerced [Walmart] employees\u201d in the exercise of their right to refrain from unionizing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It attached a summary of 70 \u201cevents\u201d the Union had held at Walmart stores in thirteen states, including twelve in Maryland. The allegations in the ULP charge all pertained to instances when demonstrators confronted Walmart managers or employees directly, using \u201cin your face\u201d tactics in an effort to intimidate them into supporting the Union. Instances during the demonstrations that did not include such coercive activities were not included in the ULP charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Walmart amended its ULP charge in May of 2013, narrowing its scope to several events at a few stores around the country. The amended ULP charge did not include any events at Walmart stores in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">On September 20, 2013, Walmart filed the lawsuit that gives rise to this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a first amended complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d), filed on October 2, 2013, it alleged that the Union had violated Maryland law \u201cthrough coordinated, statewide acts of trespass,\u201d including by conducting \u201cin-store \u2018flash mobs\u2019 \u201d and by blocking \u201cingress and egress to parking lots, parking spaces, vehicular traffic, and store entrances.\u201d The FAC recited detailed allegations about more than 15 demonstrations at the seven Maryland Walmart stores we have named. As noted, Walmart set forth claims for trespass and public and private nuisance, and sought nominal damages, a permanent injunction, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">On October 10, 2013, Walmart filed a motion for preliminary injunction. The court held an evidentiary hearing and granted the motion. Its order, entered on November 26, 2013, enjoined the Union from entering Walmart\u2019s property in Maryland \u201cfor any purpose other than shopping for and/or pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>chasing merchandise\u201d; from \u201cengaging] in activities such as unlawful picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, \u2018flash mobs,\u2019 handbilling, solicitation, customer interference, and manager confrontations\u201d; and from \u201cengaging in any nuisance conduct off Walmart\u2019s private property ... which blocks, causes to be blocked, disrupts and/or interferes\u201d with access by consumers or employees to the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In the meantime, on October 11, 2013, the Union filed a motion to dismiss the FAC for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that Walmart\u2019s claims were preempted by the NLRA. Walmart opposed the motion. The court held a hearing, at the conclusion of which it ruled that Walmart\u2019s claims were not preempted by the NLRA. It entered an order denying the motion on November 26,2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">On August 19, 2014, after extensive discovery, Walmart and the Union filed cross-motions for summary judgment. At a hearing on March 3, 2015, the court denied the Union\u2019s motion and granted Walmart\u2019s motion. It issued a memorandum opinion and order to that effect, which was docketed on March 16, 2015. Also on that day, the court entered a permanent injunction, prohibiting the Union and its agents or associates from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">1. Entering on Walmart\u2019s private property in the State of Maryland to engage in activities such as picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, chanting, \u201cflash mobs,\u201d handbilling, solicitation, customer disruptions, manager delegations or confrontations, or associate engagement for a non-shopping purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">2. Entering on Walmart\u2019s private property in the State of Maryland without permission for any purpose other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>shopping for and/or purchasing merchandise at Walmart\u2019s stores;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">3. Interfering with, obstructing or blocking Walmart\u2019s and its customers\u2019 access to, and use of, easements and/or right-of-ways granted by Walmart across or upon apron sidewalks and parking lots adjacent to stores for which Walmart has a \u201cbuilding only\u201d lease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">4.

Gen. Elec. Co., </em>496 U.S. 72, 78-79, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65 (1990). State law may be preempted by federal law expressly, when Congress so states, or impliedly, either when Congress regulates a field so as to evidence its intent that it be occupied exclusively by federal law, or when federal law conflicts with state law. <em>Law v. Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs Local No. 37, </em>373 Md. 459, 466-67, 818 A.2d 1136 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">The NLRA, enacted in 1935, and amended and expanded in 1947, by the Labor Management Relations Act, implemented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>new federal policy legitimizing \u201clabor unionization and encouraging the practice of collective bargaining.\u201d <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. San Diego Cty. District Council, </em>436 U.S. 180, 190, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 56 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978). It established a body of law governing labor relations and, in order \u201cto achieve uniform as well as effective enforcement of the national labor policy,\u201d created the NLRB, an administrative agency vested with the power to implement the law. <em>Vane v.

Because Congress was silent, it has been left to the courts to ascertain the extent to which the NLRA preempts state common and statutory law, and other federal laws. <em>See San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 240, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959) (\u201cthe aims and social policy of [the NLRA] were drawn with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>broad strokes while the details had to be filled in ... by the judicial process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><em>Garmon </em>is the seminal case about federal preemption of state law claims that are based on conduct regulated by sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There, members of several unions that had negotiated unsuccessfully with Garmon to employ only union members peacefully picketed Garmon\u2019s place of business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Garmon filed a ULP charge against the unions with the NLRB and also filed suit against the unions in state court, for statutory injunctive relief and tort damages. The NLRB declined jurisdiction, likely because \u201cthe amount of interstate commerce involved did not meet the [NLRB\u2019s] monetary standards in taking jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 79 S.Ct. 773. The state court declined to grant an injunction, because its injunction statute conflicted with the NLRA, but ruled that the picketing was an unfair labor practice, under section 8 of the NLRA, and awarded Garmon tort damages, under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The case reached the United States Supreme Court, which held that the state law tort claim was preempted by the NLRA. The essence of the issue before the Court was which body, a court (state or federal) or the NLRB, was to decide whether an ULP had been committed. The Court explained that, \u201cWhen an activity is <em>arguably subject to </em>\u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the [NLRA], the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the [NLRB] if the danger of state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>interference with national policy is to be averted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that, because the unions\u2019 conduct was \u201carguably within the compass of \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the [NLRA], the State\u2019s jurisdiction [wa]s displaced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 79 S.Ct. 773. It recognized two exceptions from preemption, however. First, when the conduct the state is regulating or sanctioning \u201ctouch[es] interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we c[an] not infer that Congress ha[s] deprived the States of the power to act\u201d (\u201clocal interest exception\u201d); and second, when the activity is \u201ca merely peripheral concern of the [NLRA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 79 S.Ct. 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Nearly twenty years later, in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. San Diego District Council, </em>436 U.S. at 180, 98 S.Ct. 1745, the Supreme Court addressed whether an employer\u2019s state law trespass claim was preempted by the NLRA, under the principle articulated in <em>Garmon. </em>In protest over Sears\u2019s employing non-union carpenters, members of a local carpenters union engaged in peaceful picketing on Sears\u2019s privately owned walkways and parking lot. When the union members would not heed Sears\u2019s demand to leave its property, Sears sued the union in state court, \u201cseeking an injunction [under state law] against the continuing trespass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 98 S.Ct. 1745. The court issued a preliminary injunction, and the union appealed. The California Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Supreme Court of California reversed, holding that because \u201cthe picketing was both arguably protected by \u00a7 7 and arguably prohibited by \u00a7 8 [of the NLRA] ... state court jurisdiction was pre-empted under the <em>Garmon </em>guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 98 S.Ct. 1745.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari to decide \u201cwhether, or under what circumstances, a state court has power to enforce local trespass laws against a union\u2019s peaceful picketing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 98 S.Ct. 1745 (footnote omitted). It reversed, upholding the injunction against the union\u2019s continuing trespass. Observing that Garmon\u2019s \u201carguably prohibit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ed\u201d and \u201carguably protected\u201d formulations are not to be applied in a \u201cliteral, mechanical fashion,\u201d it explained that whether they apply \u201c \u2018must depend upon the nature of the particular interests being asserted and the effect upon the administration of national labor policies\u2019 of permitting the state court to proceed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188-89, 98 S.Ct. 1745 (quoting <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 180, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967)). Although, ordinarily, state courts lack jurisdiction to redress conduct that is arguably prohibited by section 8 or arguably protected by section 7, they nevertheless may \u201cenforce certain laws of general applicability even though aspects of the challenged conduct\u201d are arguably prohibited by section 8 or protected by section 7. <em>Id. </em>at 194-95, 98 S.Ct. 1745. In particular, as it observed in <em>Garmon, </em>state courts retain jurisdiction to regulate and sanction \u201cconduct that touches \u2018interests ... deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>ie., </em>when the local interest exception applies. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 98 S.Ct. 1745 (quoting <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at 244, 79 S.Ct. 773).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The Court explained that because the purpose of preemption under the \u201carguably prohibited\u201d (section 8) prong of <em>Garmon </em>is to ensure that state courts will not interfere with the NLRB\u2019s jurisdiction to decide controversies committed to it, the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d in deciding whether a state claim is preempted is \u201cwhether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to ... that which could have been, but was not, presented to the [NLRB].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197, 98 S.Ct. 1745. When the controversy is not identical, the risk is slight that a state court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over it will interfere \u201cwith the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the [NLRB,]\u201d and the state law claim is not preempted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The <em>Sears </em>Court recognized that the union members\u2019 picketing on Sears\u2019s property was a continuing trespass under state law and also was conduct \u201carguably prohibited\u201d by section 8 of the NLRA, either as \u201crecognitional picketing,\u201d in violation of section 8(b)(7)(c), or as \u201cwork reassignment,\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>violation of section 8(b)(4)(D).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the crux of these violations is the union\u2019s aim in engaging in the conduct, if Sears had filed ULP charges, the NLRB\u2019s \u201cconcern would have been limited to the question whether the [u]nion\u2019s picketing had an objective proscribed by the [NLRA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 98 S.Ct. 1745. Its decision would involve \u201ccomplex factual and legal determinations [about objectives] <em>completely unrelated to the simple question whether a trespass had occurred.\u201d Id. </em>at 198 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). \u201c[T]he location of the picketing would have been irrelevant\u201d to that determination. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 98 S.Ct. 1745.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The Court concluded that, in the conflict between Sears and the union, the \u201ccontroversy which Sears might have presented to the [NLRB was] not the same as the controversy presented to the state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745. In that circumstance, state court adjudication of the trespass claim would \u201ccreate no realistic risk of interference with the [NLRB\u2019s] primary jurisdiction to enforce the statutory prohibition against unfair labor practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745. Accordingly, the state law trespass claim was not preempted under the \u201carguably prohibited\u201d prong of the <em>Garmon </em>formulation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In this appeal, the Union contends Walmart\u2019s state law claims for trespass and public and private nuisance are preempted by the NLRA because they are being advanced to redress conduct that is \u201carguably prohibited\u201d by section 8(b)(1)(A) of the NLRA. It asserts that Walmart conceded as much by first filing its ULP charge. It argues that the local interest exception does not apply because it is limited to conduct that is violent, threatening, or malicious, and the conduct of the demonstrators did not fit that bill. And, even if the exception is not so limited, it still does not apply because the legal controversies in Walmart\u2019s ULP charge and in its state law claims are identical, or, as the Union puts it, \u201cfundamentally the same\u201d because they are based on the same facts. The Union maintains, moreover, that the NLRB could have granted Walmart the same remedy it obtained from the circuit court. The Union argues that <em>Sears </em>is distinguishable because in the case at bar the trespass and nuisance claims concern the location <em>and </em>the nature of the demonstrators\u2019 activities, not just their location.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Walmart responds that trespassing and nuisance are not, in and of themselves, conduct that is \u201carguably prohibited\u201d by section 8 of the NLRA. And, even if some of the Union\u2019s conduct during the demonstrations was arguably prohibited by section 8 (namely actions directed at employees in an effort to coerce them into unionizing), the local interest exception applies because the State has a fundamental interest in protecting the safety and property rights of its citizens and the legal controversy in the coercive conduct ULP charge was not identical to the legal controversy in the state law claims. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>maintains that factual overlap does not make controversies identical. The Union is wrong, Walmart argues, that the local interest exception only applies to conduct that is violent, threatening, or malicious, and also is wrong that the NLRB has jurisdiction to enjoin trespassing on an employer\u2019s property. Walmart maintains that, as in <em>Sears, </em>the location of the arguably prohibited conduct was not important to its initial ULP charge, but was essential to the trespass and nuisance claims. It argues that its state law claims are not preempted because their adjudication does not create any meaningful risk of interference with the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Whether state claims are preempted by the NLRA is a question of law that we decide <em>de novo. See CSX Transp., Inc. v.

The short answer to this question is that some of the conduct, in particular the confrontational acts by the demonstrators against managers and other employees, was arguably prohibited by section 8, as activities by a labor union to coerce employees to refrain from exercising their right not to unionize.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>There is no basis for the Union\u2019s argument, however, that, by filing its initial ULP charge, Walmart conceded that all aspects of the demonstrators\u2019 conduct, including conduct constituting trespass or nuisance, is \u201carguably prohibited\u201d by section 8(b)(1)(A), so that a state law claim for trespass or nuisance necessarily is preempted by the NLRA. The <em>Sears </em>case is dispositive on this point. The Court recognized that the picketing on Sears\u2019s private property by union members could have been the basis for ULP charges and also was a trespass under state law; and the fact that Sears could have brought ULP charges did not mean the trespass could not be remedied under state law. This same reasoning applies when a ULP charge actually is filed. Nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Sears </em>suggests that had Sears brought ULP charges for recognitional picketing or work reassignment, its doing so would have amounted to a concession that every aspect of its controversy with the unions was within the sole jurisdiction of the NLRB to decide so that its trespass claim was preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Because at least some of the Union\u2019s conduct was arguably prohibited by section 8 of the NLRA, one begins with the presumption, under <em>Garmon, </em>that Walmart\u2019s trespass and nuisance claims are preempted by federal law. If the local interest exception applies, the presumption is rebutted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whether that exception applies is a two-part inquiry. We first \u201cdetermine whether a significant state interest exists in protecting the citizen from the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Vane, </em>303 Md. at 373, 494 A.2d 181. If there is no such interest, the exception does not apply. If there is, we then decide \u201cwhether the exercise of state jurisdiction entails \u2018little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the [NLRB].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sears, </em>436 U.S. at 196, 98 S.Ct. 1745).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In the first prong of the inquiry, we find no merit in the Union\u2019s argument that the local interest exception does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>apply here because the only significant state interest that -will support application of that exception is the interest in protecting citizens from conduct that is violent, threatening, or malicious, and there was no such conduct here. To be sure, by the time the Supreme Court decided <em>Sears </em>in 1978, it had found the exception to apply when the arguably prohibited union conduct was violent, <em>see United Auto. Aircraft Workers of Am. v. Wisconsin Emp\u2019t Relations Bd., </em>351 U.S. 266, 76 S.Ct. 794, 100 L.Ed. 1162 (1956); was calculated to provoke violence and was likely to do so unless restrained, <em>see Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., </em>355 U.S. 131, 78 S.Ct. 206, 2 L.Ed.2d 151 (1957); and when the conduct satisfied the elements of state law claims for defamation, <em>see Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers of Am., Local 114, </em>383 U.S. 53, 86 S.Ct. 657, 15 L.Ed.2d 582 (1966), intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>see Farmer v. United Bhd. of Carpenters of Am., </em>430 U.S. 290, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 51 L.Ed.2d 338 (1977), or malicious interference with lawful occupation, <em>see Int\u2019l Union, United Auto. Workers v. Russell, </em>356 U.S. 634, 78 S.Ct. 932, 2 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The holding in <em>Sears </em>makes plain, however, that the local interest exception can apply not only to state claims brought to protect citizens from violence or likely violence, or from harm caused by torts with a component of malice, but also to state claims advanced to protect against harm to possessory rights in private property, in the absence of violence, threats of violence, imminent violence, or malicious acts. The picketing in <em>Sears </em>was peaceful and non-confrontational, and Sears\u2019s trespass claim was brought solely to remove the protesters from its private property. Even before <em>Sears </em>was decided, Chief Justice Burger observed, in his concurring opinion in <em>Taggart v. Weinacker\u2019s Inc., </em>397 U.S. 223, 90 S.Ct. 876, 25 L.Ed.2d 240 (1970), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adn\"><em>[t]he protection of private property, whether a home, factory, or store, through trespass laws is historically a concern of state law.

In such a situation, if the state, by means of its police force, does not intervene when the protesting union members refuse to leave the employer\u2019s private property, the employer has \u201cno alternative but to forcefully remove the [demonstrators].

The Union argues interference is shown when the factual allegations underlying the potential (or actual) ULP charge are identical to the factual allegations underlying the state law claim; and here, the factual allegations are identical. Walmart counters that it is the legal controversies presented, not the factual allegations, that control, and the controversies presented in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>original ULP charge and in its state law claims for trespass and nuisance are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Walmart is correct that we must focus on whether the controversies, not the factual allegations, are identical in deciding whether the circuit court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the trespass and nuisance claims will interfere with the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction. In <em>Sears, </em>the Supreme Court decided the issue of identity by comparing the \u201ccontroversy\u201d the NLRB would have been required to decide had Sears filed ULP charges for recognitional picketing and work reassignment to the \u201ccontroversy\u201d the state court was required to decide to resolve Sears\u2019s trespass claim. 436 U.S. at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745. Its analysis makes clear that the same core of factual allegations can give rise to \u201ccontroversies\u201d before the NLRB and before a state court that are not identical in the sense that adjudication of the state claims will interfere with the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction. 436 U.S. at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745. The Court later applied this principle when a ULP charge in fact was brought. <em>See Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, </em>463 U.S. 491, 510, 103 S.Ct. 3172, 77 L.Ed.2d 798 (1983) (no preemption when controversies raised in NLRB cross-charges concerning whether a strike was a ULP and whether the employer improperly replaced striking workers did not have \u201canything in common\u201d with controversy before a state court in a suit for breach of contract and misrepresentation against the employer by strike replacement workers). <em>See also Linn, </em>383 U.S. at 63-64, 86 S.Ct. 657 (no preemption of state court defamation claim brought by manager against union based upon statements in a leaflet even though leaflets were arguably prohibited and were the basis of a ULP charge filed by the employer); <em>Zavadil v.

Only when a ULP charge that the NLRB has heard and rejected on the merits is \u201crecast as a state law claim\u201d is \u201c \u2018[t]he risk of interference with the [NLRB\u2019s] jurisdiction ... obvious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>substantial.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Platt v. Jack Cooper Transp., Co., </em>959 F.2d 91, 95 (8th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Local 926 IUOE v. Jones, </em>460 U.S. 669, 683, 103 S.Ct. 1453, 75 L.Ed.2d 368 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As originally filed, Walmart\u2019s ULP charge alleged that the Union\u2019s events at particular Walmart stores in Maryland violated the NLRA because the demonstrators \u201crestrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights (which includes the right to refrain from supporting the UFCW).\u201d Walmart complained that the events were orchestrated to \u201cdemonstrate to facility management in front of their employees that local management could not control its own work environment\u201d and to persuade the Walmart sales force to \u201cyield to the UFCWs wishes\u201d and that the demonstrations were coercive because the protesters confronted managers, filmed employees reacting to the demonstrations, offered to pay employees for their support, and blocked ingress and egress so as to disrupt the employees in their work.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Of course, Walmart amended its ULP charge to eliminate all the allegations about the Maryland events. Even if it had not done so, the controversy before the NLRB and the controversy before the circuit court would not have been identical. On the one hand, the NLRB\u2019s concern would have been whether the confrontational activities by the Union demonstrators were coercive toward Walmart employees, in violation of their right to remain non-unionized. On the other hand, the circuit court\u2019s concern was whether the Union demonstrators\u2019 entry onto Walmart property for any non-shopping purpose, including to march about, make noise, and draw attention to themselves, exceeded the scope of Walmart\u2019s limited invitation to the public, constituting a trespass, <em>see Howard Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Cheyne, </em>99 Md.App. 150, 155, 636 A.2d 22 (1994) (a business invitee under Maryland law is one \u201cwho enters a business establishment to purchase goods or services\u201d), and invaded Walmart\u2019s interest in the use and enjoyment of its land, constituting a private nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">To be sure, the arguably coercive conduct by the demonstrators was one aspect of the Union\u2019s conduct, so there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>factual overlap between the allegations in the ULP and in the state claims. It was not material to the resolution of Walmart\u2019s state claims whether the Union\u2019s non-shopping activities were undertaken to coerce Walmart employees in the exercise of their rights under the NLRA. Just as Walmart could prove a trespass claim against the Union demonstrators for entering Walmart\u2019s parking lot and setting up a yard sale, Walmart could prove such a claim against them for entering its property to blow whistles and sing songs about Walmart\u2019s labor practices. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that the pertinent inquiry is whether the person or persons claiming invitee status entered the business establishment with a purpose to benefit the landowner in some way); <em>see also UFCW v. Wal-Mart, </em>430 S.W.3d 508, 513 (Tex.Ct.App.2014) (UFCW demonstrators were trespassing because they \u201cused Wal-Mart property on a venture for their own purposes.\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Like in <em>Sears, </em>Walmart sought to enjoin the Union from demonstrating <em>on its private property </em>(or, in the instance of the public nuisance, in a location blocking ingress and egress to and from its private property). Had the Union targeted Walmart employees by picketing, hand-billing, and forming flash mobs on public property or even on private property owned by another retailer near a Walmart store, and the objective of the conduct was to coerce Walmart employees in the exercise of their section 7 rights, Walmart still would have had grounds to file a ULP charge with the NLRB. It would not have had a claim for trespass or nuisance against them, however. Here, the core of the controversy was that the Union was entering on Walmart\u2019s private property for a non-shopping purpose. Adjudication of that controversy by the circuit court would not realistically interfere with the NLRB\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>primary jurisdiction to regulate unfair labor practices under the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Finally, we note that in cases such as this, where a labor organization that does not represent the employees enters on the employer\u2019s private property to demonstrate about its labor practices, without any arguably protected right to do so under the NLRA, it would make little sense if, by also engaging in conduct arguably prohibited by the NLRA, it could deprive the employer of the state law claims it otherwise could bring to remedy the conduct. In other words, a labor union cannot fairly say that because it violated the NLRA, it is no longer subject to state trespass and nuisance laws. Ordinarily, it would constitute trespass and nuisance for a labor organization not representing employees to enter a retail business to disrupt it; if the labor organization also does so to wrongly coerce employees into unionizing, it should not be free to commit wrongs prohibited by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Accordingly, the circuit court properly denied the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\n<em>Public Nuisance Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Walmart\u2019s public nuisance claim was premised on a single incident that took place on September 5, 2013. That day, the Union arranged for several buses filled with almost 200 demonstrators to go to the Landover Hills Walmart. In the middle of rush hour, a large group of these demonstrators exited the buses and walked onto nearby Route 450, blocking traffic for about 20 minutes. During that time, hundreds of cars attempted to use Walmart\u2019s private access road and parking lot as a detour around the blockage. As a result, the access road became jammed with traffic, making customers\u2019 access to the store virtually impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">As documented in its memorandum opinion, the trial court found as a fact that the Union intentionally orchestrated this major disruption. As the court put it, the Union \u201cplanned and conducted a demonstration that blocked a major intersection on Highway 450 by a Walmart store in Landover Hills, causing a traffic jam on Highway 450 and in Walmart\u2019s parking lot and preventing Walmart customers from entering and exiting Walmart\u2019s parking lot.\u201d The court found that the Union\u2019s \u201cblocking or interference with vehicle and pedestrian traffic on public roadways adjacent to Walmart stores ... constitute^] an enjoinable nuisance\u201d; and that Walmart \u201cha[d] established a \u2018special injury\u2019 to entitle it to an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>against demonstrations on public property (like [the September 5, 2013 Landover Hills demonstration]) that block or interfere with its customers\u2019 access to Walmart stores and parking lots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Union contends the trial court erred in ruling that Walmart suffered a special injury different in kind from that suffered by the public generally, so as to give it standing to sue for public nuisance. Walmart responds that the law is clear that when a defendant blocks a public road, adjacent property owners whose access to their property is obstructed have standing to sue for public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Section 821C of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>addresses the standing requirements for a claim of public nuisance. As relevant here, it explains that the plaintiff must \u201chave suffered harm of a kind different from that suffered by other members of the public exercising the right common to the general public that was the subject of interference.\u201d <em>See also Ray v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 74, 94, 59 A.3d 545 (2013) (citing section 821C). Comment f to section 821C provides a helpful illustration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">The right of access to land, that is, the right of reasonable and convenient ingress and egress, is itself a property right in the land. If the public nuisance interferes with immediate ingress and egress to the plaintiffs land, the nuisance is a private as well as a public one and the harm suffered by the plaintiff is particular harm differing in kind from that suffered by the general public, so that the plaintiff can recover for the public nuisance. Complete deprivation of access, so that the land of the plaintiff is completely cut off is obviously sufficient particular damage. But the deprivation need not be complete and it is enough that the ingress or egress is made unreasonably burdensome or inconvenient or unsafe. Access by a particular entry is still a valuable property right even though there may be another entry left open; and the fact that there is access from the north left open does not prevent the recovery when the plaintiff is deprived of access from the south.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 821C cmt. f (1979); <em>see also Smith v. Shiebeck, </em>180 Md. 412, 421-22, 24 A.2d 795 (1942) (plaintiffs stated a claim for public nuisance when they alleged that adjacent property owners erected a fence obstructing a public right-of-way that was the most convenient means to access the plaintiffs\u2019 property).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In the case at bar, the evidence on the summary judgment record showed that the Union obstructed a public road\u2014 Route 450 \u2014 directly in front of the entrance to the Landover Hills Walmart store and that, to avoid the obstruction, cars were forced to detour onto Walmart\u2019s private access road, hindering customers and employees from exiting or entering Walmart\u2019s property. This plainly was an injury that was different in kind from any injury suffered by the public generally. The circuit court did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Scope of Permanent Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The Union challenges the scope of the circuit court\u2019s permanent injunction on two bases. First, it argues that Walmart did not have a right to exclusive possession of exterior common areas that it owned, but were subject to non-exclusive easements; therefore, absent a showing by Walmart that the Union\u2019s demonstrations in those areas unreasonably interfered with Walmart\u2019s use of the areas, the Union could not be prohibited from demonstrating in those areas. Second, the injunction is overly broad because it prohibited Union members from entering Walmart\u2019s property for any non-shopping purpose, not just for the purpose of engaging in demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Walmart responds that it retains exclusive possession of all exterior property it owns or leases. Its reciprocal business-use cross-easements extended to neighboring tenants and their invitees. It did not have to prove unreasonable interference in order to exclude demonstrators or protestors from its property. Moreover, the court properly enjoined the Union from entering Walmart\u2019s property for any non-shopping pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>pose because the undisputed evidence showed that the Union had engaged in small scale handbilling and manager/associate confrontations that exceeded the scope of the limited business invitation to shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>A. Common Areas Subject to Easements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">At all but three of its Maryland locations, Walmart owns or leases the tract of land on which its retail store is situated, the parking lot, the apron areas, and the sidewalks.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Walmart sought a permanent injunction \u201cprohibiting [the Union] from coming onto property over which [Walmart] maintains a right to exclude,\u201d defined to mean \u2018TOO percent of its interior retail space ... and the parking lots, apron areas and sidewalks it owns or leases (under a ground lease) outside the front entrances to its stores.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These areas include parking lots and sidewalks over which Walmart has granted \u201ca nonexclusive easement for vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress over and across\u201d to adjacent property owners, their tenants, and their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">As relevant here, in its written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">At a few stores or other facilities located within a shopping center or building that contains other retail shops or businesses, Walmart has granted reciprocal cross-easements over portions of its parking lot and sidewalk areas (which it owns or controls as lessee) to provide access to those shops and businesses\u2019 customers and employees for the purpose of shopping and conducting business at those establishments. <em>Those cross-easements do not permit [the Union] (or any other group) to use Walmart\u2019s parking lot and sidewalk areas for any reason other than to shop for and purchase </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>merchandise (or to conduct authorized business) at other retail shops or businesses located in the shopping center.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKq\">(Emphasis added.) The court ruled that, as a matter of law, Walmart has a right to \u201cexclude trespassers from property it owns or leases even where it grants specific business-use easements or rights-of way to neighboring tenants in a shopping center.\u201d Thus, the Union demonstrators who used \u201cthe easements over Walmart\u2019s parking lots and sidewalks\u201d for a purpose other than to \u201cprovide access to other retail establishments\u201d committed a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The Union argues that there was no evidence that it unreasonably interfered with Walmart\u2019s use of those portions of its property subject to the easements; therefore, Walmart could not prove an action for trespass on those parts of its property and was not entitled to an injunction covering them. Walmart responds that the easements were limited to business-use and, as such, its right to exclude any non-business use of its property was not diminished. For this reason, it did not need to prove an unreasonable interference with its use of those parts of its property. We agree with Walmart.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">This Court has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201ctrespass is a tort involving \u2018an intentional or negligent intrusion upon or to the possessory interest in property of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell v.

Having consented to entry onto its land for that limited purpose, it did not give up its right to exclude from its property others entering for a non-business purpose, such as the Union demonstrators who paraded and otherwise protested on its common areas, even if those activities did not unreasonably interfere with Walmart\u2019s use of the property.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>B. Enjoining all non-shopping activity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The Union argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to enjoin all non-shopping activity on its part was not supported by the evidence; \u201cat most,\u201d the court should have enjoined only \u201cdemonstrations.\u201d This is so, it maintains, because Walmart \u201cfocused\u201d on the demonstrations in its motion for summary judgment and because Walmart did not allege that it suffered irreparable harm from the other non-shopping conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Walmart responds that the uncontested evidence on the summary judgment record showed that the Union engaged in a multitude of objectionable non-shopping activities in Walmart\u2019s stores and on its property. It staged large and small scale flash mobs and demonstrations at stores, engaged in hand-billing, solicited customers and employees, disrupted customers, and confronted managers on the floor. All of this activity exceeded the scope of the limited business invitation extended by Walmart to the public, causing irreparable harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to Walmart\u2019s business. The Union does not possess a right, under the First Amendment or otherwise, to enter onto Walmart\u2019s private property to engage in \u201cnon-obstructive and non-disruptive speech\u201d unrelated to the limited business invitation to shop at the store. <em>See Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, </em>407 U.S. 551, 564-65, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed.2d 131 (1972) (noting that the Supreme Court \u201chas never held that a trespasser or an uninvited guest may exercise general rights of free speech on property privately owned and used nondiscriminatorily for private purposes only,\u201d and vacating an injunction prohibiting a shopping center from enforcing a \u201cno handbilling\u201d policy). We agree with Walmart that the circuit court did not err in enjoining all non-shopping activity by the Union.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\n<em>Anti-Injunction Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The trial court ruled that this case does not involve a \u201clabor dispute\u201d and therefore is not within the purview of Maryland\u2019s Anti-Injunction Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d); and even if the Act applies, Walmart satisfied its stringent requirements. The Union contends the court\u2019s ruling was erroneous in both respects. Walmart responds that the court correctly determined that conduct constituting trespass and nuisance by third parties is not a labor dispute and, in any event, Walmart was entitled to an injunction under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Enacted in 1935, Maryland\u2019s Anti-Injunction Act, Md.Code (1991, 2008 RepLVol.), section 4-314 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d), places \u201crestrictions on the power of [an] equity court[ ] to grant injunctions in labor disputes.\u201d <em>District 1199E v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>293 Md. 343, 345, 444 A.2d 448 (1982); <em>see also Vu v. Allied Foot &amp; Ankle, </em>180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Md.App. 663, 682, 952 A.2d 379 (2008) (\u201cThe anti-injunction statutes of the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s, including the Maryland Act, were designed to limit and, in some circumstances, circumscribe entirely the remedy of injunction as it was being used by employers to suppress labor organization.\u201d). As currently codified, the Anti-Injunction Act states that, \u201cin a case that involves or grows out of a labor dispute,\u201d a court may not grant preliminary or permanent injunctive relief unless certain heightened criteria are met. A \u201clabor dispute\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMa\">any controversy, regardless of whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employee or employer, concerning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">(1) terms or conditions of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">(2) employment relations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">(3) the association or representation of persons in negotiating, setting, maintaining, or changing terms or conditions of employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">(4) any other controversy arising out of the respective interests of employee or employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">LE \u00a7 4-301 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">We agree with the trial court that this case does not \u201cinvolve[ ] or grow[ ] out of a labor dispute.\u201d The Union is not and does not seek to be the collective bargaining representative for Walmart\u2019s employees and has expressly disclaimed any interest in organizing Walmart\u2019s employees. Walmart filed suit against the Union, but specifically excluded as defendants any current Walmart employees. The controversy before the circuit court concerned the right of third parties to demonstrate on the private property of a business. Although the ultimate goal of the Union\u2019s demonstrations was to encourage Walmart employees to unionize or to improve the terms and conditions of their employment, that goal was not at issue in the case before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Even if this case <em>did </em>involve a labor dispute, we nevertheless would affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the Anti-Injunction Act criteria were met. The Union asserts that Walmart failed to prove three of the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Anti-Injunction Act: 1) \u201cunless [the court] grants the relief requested, the property of the plaintiff will be injured substantially and irreparably\u201d (LE section 4 \u2014 314(3)(ii)); 2) Walmart lacked an \u201cadequate remedy at law\u201d (LE section 4 \u2014 314(3)(v)); and 3) the police failed to or were unable to adequately protect Walmart\u2019s property (LE section 4-314(3)(vi)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The Union maintains that Walmart was required to present evidence of property damage, not damage to \u201cbusiness, goodwill, or similar proprietary or intangible interest,\u201d to satisfy LE section 4 \u2014 314(3)(ii). Walmart responds that the court\u2019s findings that the damage to Walmart\u2019s business as a result of the protests could not be quantified; that store managers received complaints from customers about the demonstrations; that customers waiting in line to check out left the store without making any purchases as a result of the demonstrations; and that Walmart associates were pulled away from assisting customers to respond to demonstrators amply demonstrated that Walmart\u2019s \u201cproperty ... [would] be injured substantially and irreparably\u201d if an injunction were not granted. We agree. The interference with Walmart\u2019s right to operate its business free from loud and disruptive demonstrations that block customer ingress and egress and otherwise prevent customers from shopping in Walmart\u2019s stores amounts to substantial and irreparable harm to its \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of LE section 4 \u2014 314(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The Union argues that Walmart did not lack an adequate remedy at law because it could have refiled its ULP with the NLRB to redress the conduct. For the reasons already discussed, however, the NLRB\u2019s jurisdiction did not extend to the trespassory and nuisance nature of the conduct. In any event, as Walmart points out, a showing of irreparable harm presumes that there is no adequate remedy at law. <em>See State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Talbot Cty., </em>370 Md. 115, 141, 803 A.2d 527 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Finally, the Union maintains that the undisputed material facts showed that the police promptly responded each time they were called by Walmart and they were able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>remove demonstrators or persuade them to leave. Walmart responds that, because the Union demonstrations are held without notice at different stores and because it takes time for the police to arrive on the scene and disperse them, the police cannot adequately protect Walmart\u2019s business. Moreover, there was uncontested testimony from a police officer that it is often the policy of the police not to intervene in these types of peaceful demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Walmart presented sufficient evidence of harm to its ability to carry on its business that could not be adequately protected against by police. The Union\u2019s actions took place without notice and were designed to be disruptive. There was evidence that customers responded to the demonstrations on several occasions by abandoning their carts and leaving the store without checking out. Thus, even if the police were able to respond within minutes and were willing to intervene, Walmart\u2019s business may already have been harmed. For all of these reasons, the circuit court did not err by ruling that Walmart satisfied the Anti-Injunction Act criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In <em>Weis Markets, Inc. v.

The store\u2019s employees were not unionized and the aim of the pickets was to encourage the store's customers to shop elsewhere for that reason. The UFCW took the position that its picketing was arguably protected by section 7 of the NLRA (not arguably prohibited by section 8 of the NLRA, as is the case here). We relied upon the Supreme Court\u2019s arguably protected analysis in <em>Sears </em>to support our holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. In the Texas case, the Union noted an interlocutory appeal from the denial of its motion to dismiss one of the state court claims filed by Walmart relating to the same UFCW conduct.

As noted above, Walmart brought state law claims for trespass in response to the Union\u2019s demonstrations in Maryland, Florida, Arkansas, Colorado, Ohio, and Washington. The trial courts in all these states except Washington ruled against the Union on preemption and granted injunctions. In Washington, the trial court ruled in favor of the Union, and the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

It also reasoned that, unlike in <em>Sears, </em>the Union\u2019s \"conduct [was] central to Walmart\u2019s trespass theory.\u201d 354 P.3d at 36. Emphasizing that Walmart \"objected to both the [demonstrations] and the location of the [Union\u2019s] conduct,\u201d the court concluded that because Walmart had filed a ULP and could refile the charges arising from the conduct in Washington State, it was not without \"legal recourse\u201d if its trespass action were to be dismissed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We agree with Walmart\u2019s position in the case at bar that the Washington intermediate appellate court incorrectly focused on the identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of <em>facts </em>alleged in the ULP and the first amended complaint, when it should have focused on the identity, or lack of identify, of the <em>legal controversy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Very recently, the Colorado Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the trial court\u2019s decision that Walmart\u2019s state law claims were not preempted by the NLRA. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, </em>- P.3d -, 2016 WL 2605737 (Colo.App.2016). The court held that the controversy Walmart presented to the NLRB in its ULP charge and the controversy it presented to the state court in its trespass claim were not the same, and therefore the state law claims were not preempted. (Walmart furnished the Colorado Court of Appeals opinion to this Court in a recently filed motion; the Union opposed the motion. Obviously, this Court can take into account in our legal analysis recently filed relevant opinions by other courts, so the motion is granted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">.
