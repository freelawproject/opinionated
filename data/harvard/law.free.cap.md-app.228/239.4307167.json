Introduction: Ground Leases and the 2007 Modifications to the Ground Lease System</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">This case is the latest chapter in the litigation that grew out of the 2007 legislative modifications to Maryland\u2019s centuries-old system of financing real estate purchases through the use of \u201cground leases.\u201d <em>See generally State v. Goldberg, </em>437 Md. 191, 85 A.3d 231 (2014); <em>Muskin v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation, </em>422 Md. 544, 30 A.3d 962 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">In very brief summary, a ground lease is a 99-year, perpetually renewable lease, by which an owner rents land to a lessee, who is allowed to use and improve the land much as a typical landowner would. Ground leases are quite common in residential real estate in Baltimore City and have been employed in other areas of the State as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Under a ground lease, the lessee agrees to pay a specified amount of yearly rent, as well as taxes and other assessments. If the lessee defaults, the ground-lease owner may become entitled to reenter the property and eject the tenant, terminate the lease, and take possession of the land and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>improvements. When the ground-lease owner successfully enforces the right of reentry, the lessees lose any equity that they had accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In late 2006, the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>ran a series of articles highlighting what it considered to be grave and unfair abuses by ground rent owners. Among other things, the articles reported that tenants had been evicted, and had lost all of their equity, after they failed to make ground-rent payments totaling far less than the value of their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Galvanized by the articles, the General Assembly unanimously passed two laws that altered the ground-rent system in the 2007 legislative session. Chapter 290 mandated that the lessors record their leases in a central registry upon pain of losing their reversionary interests and having fee-simple title vest in their lessees. Chapter 286, the provision at issue in this case, eliminated an action for ejectment in most cases involving a failure to pay ground rents on residential real estate. In place of the action for ejectment, Chapter 286 established a lien-and-foreclosure remedy, similar to the remedy for mortgage foreclosures. Under the lien-and-foreclosure remedy, the tenants would not lose their equity if the proceeds of the foreclosure sale exceeded the unpaid rent and the recoverable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">After the 2007 legislation, the market for ground leases, previously seen as a stable, low-risk investment, dropped drastically.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">B. The Early Phases of this Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">On November 1, 2007, William Braverman, Stanley Goldberg, and 47 other plaintiffs filed suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to challenge Chapter 286. After several amendments, their complaint alleged that the legislation resulted in both the physical and regulatory taking of property without just compensation in violation of the federal and State constitutions and that it violated the Contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Clause<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sole defendant was the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The State removed the case to federal court, but the court on its motion exercised its discretion to remand the case to the circuit court. The circuit court rejected the State\u2019s effort to transfer the case to Baltimore City on grounds of improper venue and forum non conveniens. The court did, however, dismiss all claims that alleged a physical taking of property. In addition, the court certified the case as a class action for purposes of liability, but not damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">After several years of litigation, in September 2010, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On January 6, 2011, the circuit court denied the motions, stating \u201cthat the evidence presents genuine and novel questions of law as to whether Chapter 286 constitutes a taking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">C. The <em>Muskin </em>Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Meanwhile, a challenge to Chapter 290, the registration provisions of the 2007 legislation, was wending its way through the courts. On October 25, 2010, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City upheld Chapter 290. Exactly one year later, however, a divided Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Muskin v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation, </em>422 Md. 544, 554, 30 A.3d 962 (2011). In a 5-2 decision, the <em>Muskin </em>Court held that, by extinguishing ground rents and transferring title to lessees as a penalty for the failure to record ground leases, the legislation abrogated vested rights and took private property without just compensation in violation of the Maryland Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>tution. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 30 A.3d 962; <em>id. </em>at 560, 30 A.3d 962; <em>id. </em>at 563, 30 A.3d 962; <em>id. </em>at 565, 30 A.3d 962.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Adkins, joined by former Chief Judge Bell, dissented. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 30 A.3d 962 (Adkins, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><em>Muskin </em>did not directly concern Chapter 286 and its replacement of the right of reentry with the lien-and-foreclosure remedy. Nonetheless, in reaching its decision, the <em>Muskin </em>majority implied that the owner of a ground lease had a vested right in the right of reentry. For example, the Court stated: \u201cA ground lease creates a bundle of vested rights for the ground rent owner, a contractual right to receive ground rent payments <em>and the reversionary interest to re-enter the property in the event of a default or if the leaseholder fails to renew.\u201d Muskin, </em>422 Md. at 559, 30 A.3d 962 (emphasis added). The Court added: <em>\u201cThese two rights cannot he separated from the other, </em>together they are the essence of this unique property interest, <em>and </em>as such, <em>vested rights analysis must consider them together.\u201d Id. </em>at 559-60, 30 A.3d 962 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">On the other hand, the <em>Muskin </em>Court recognized \u201can exception\u201d to the \u201cgeneral prohibition\u201d against abrogating vested rights. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 30 A.3d 962. The exception, wrote the Court, \u201capplies solely to remedies and rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the exception, \u201cthe Legislature has the power to alter the rules of evidence and remedies, which in turn allows statutes of limitations and evidentiary statutes to affect vested property rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In short, <em>Muskin </em>did not clearly decide the question of whether the General Assembly had impermissibly deprived ground-lease owners of a vested right, or whether it had merely altered the applicable remedies, when it substituted the lien-and-foreclosure remedy for the right of reentry that was implemented through an action for ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>D. Summary Judgment and Affirmance on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Immediately after the <em>Muskin </em>decision, the plaintiffs in this case renewed their motion for partial summary judgment on the claim that Chapter 286 violated the Maryland Constitution by abrogating their vested right to reenter the leased property in case of a default. On December 20, 2011, the circuit court granted their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">After the grant of summary judgment on the State constitutional claims, the plaintiffs secured a final judgment by having the court dismiss all remaining claims, including any individual claims for damages by the two named plaintiffs, on mootness grounds. The State appealed, and a divided Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Goldberg, </em>437 Md. 191, 199, 85 A.3d 231 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In reaching its decision, the <em>Goldberg </em>majority rejected the State\u2019s contention that Chapter 286 abrogated no vested rights, but simply substituted the new lien-and-foreclosure for the previous remedy of ejectment, which facilitated the right of reentry. Instead, the majority held that the legislation unconstitutionally impinged upon a vested right to reenter the leased premises and to terminate the lease. <em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 85 A.3d 231. Two judges dissented. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 85 A.3d 231 (Adkins, J., dissenting); <em>id. </em>at 227, 85 A.3d 231 (Watts, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">On remand, the State agreed not to enforce the unconstitutional statute. The court awarded no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">E. The Fee Award</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Class counsel represented the class on a contingent-fee basis, under which no fee would be due or payable unless the action were successful. The fee agreement did not identify a percentage of any recovery that would accrue to counsel in the event of settlement, trial, or appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Lawyers\u2019 R. of Profl Conduct 1.5(c). Instead, counsel agreed that if the lawsuit were certified as a class action (as it was), they would \u201capply to the court for any success fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>In response to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Goldberg, </em>the plaintiffs filed a fee petition in the circuit court. In the petition, class counsel requested over $5,560,000.00 in fees, $109,925.45 in costs, and a \u201cfee multiplier\u201d of 1.5 times the fee award, or more than $2,780,000.00, because of the undesirability of the representation, the State\u2019s refusal to resolve the case, and the amount of value restored to the class.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">After an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court ordered the State to pay $5 million in fees. In reaching that decision, the court employed a number of theories: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which authorizes an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in an action to enforce the provisions of a number of federal statutes; the common-fund doctrine, under which class counsel may receive a fee from the monetary recovery that they generate for the class; Md.Code (1974,2015 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-106 of the Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d), which allows a court to award reasonable legal fees that a prevailing \u201cdefendant\u201d has \u201cactually incurred\u201d in a condemnation action; and Md. Rule 1-341, which allows a court to award the \u201creasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d that a party has \u201cincurred\u201d because the opposing party has maintained or defended a case in bad faith or without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>Question Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">This case boils down to one question: Did the circuit court err in concluding that attorneys\u2019 fees were authorized in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">We answer this question in the affirmative. The circuit court had no legal authority to award any amount of attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>fees. We reverse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>The Circuit Court Had No Authority to Award Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">A. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201cWe generally adhere to the \u2018American Rule,\u2019 in which each party is responsible for its own legal fees, regardless of who wins in the litigation.\u201d <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 294, 992 A.2d 446 (2010) (footnote and citations omitted). Exceptions are available only by contract, by statute or court rule, or (in rare instances) under a well-established common-law principle. <em>See Nova Research, Inc. v. Penske Truck Leasing Co., </em>405 Md. 435, 445 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3, 952 A.2d 275 (2008).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The circuit court premised its award of fees on four legal grounds. The applicability of those grounds is a question of law, which we review on a de novo basis. <em>See Barufaldi v. Ocean City, Maryland Chamber of Commerce, </em>206 Md.App. 282, 295-96, 47 A.3d 1097 (2012). To the limited extent to which the award depends on factual findings, we review the decision for clear error. <em>See Inlet Assocs. v. Harrison Inn Inlet, Inc., </em>324 Md. 254, 267, 596 A.2d 1049 (1991) (concerning Rule 1-341).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>B. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 allows the court to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9A\">any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1981a, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of [title 42], title IX of Public Law 92-318 [20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1681 et seq.], the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000bb et seq.], the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000cc et seq.], title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d et seq.], or section 13981 of [title 42].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The circuit court concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to an award of fees under \u00a7 1988 because, it said, they had brought a \u201csubstantial claim\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. To the contrary, the plaintiffs neither alleged nor could have alleged a \u00a7 1983 claim against the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Section 1983 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Although the plaintiffs alleged that Chapter 286 violated the federal Constitution in several respects, they did not expressly or even implicitly set forth a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983\u2014 i.e., a claim that a \u201cperson\u201d acting \u201cunder color of\u2019 Maryland law had deprived them \u201cof any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States. More important, the plaintiffs had no viable \u00a7 1983 claim against the sole named defendant in the case \u2014 the State of Maryland \u2014 because the United States Supreme Court has held that a State is not a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 1983. <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Had the plaintiffs asserted \u00a7 1988 claims against the State officials who administered Chapter 286, they might have obtained a different result. <em>See, e.g., Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 23, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (holding that \u201cstate officials sued in their individual capacities are \u2018persons\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 1983\u201d). If a plaintiff raises alternative grounds for relief under \u00a7 1983 and state law, but the court rules in the plaintiffs favor only on state-law grounds, the plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees as long as \u201cthe \u00a7 1983 ground was substantial and grew out of the same facts.\u201d <em>Cnty. Exec. of Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Doe, </em>300 Md. 445, 456, 479 A.2d 352 (1984); <em>accord Maryland Green Party v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>165 Md.App. 113, 125, 884 A.2d 789 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We must, however, decide the case not on the basis of what the plaintiffs might have done, but on the basis of what they actually did. The plaintiffs named one and only one defendant \u2014 the State of Maryland. The State is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. As a matter of law, therefore, the circuit court had no authority to award fees against the State under \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">C. The Common-Fund Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Under the \u201ccommon-fund doctrine,\u201d class counsel are paid out of the monetary recovery that they generate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the class. <em>See, e.g., Hess Constr. Co. v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>341 Md. 155, 166, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996) (stating that an equity court has \u201cthe power to direct payment of counsel fees out of a fund that has been created by the efforts of counsel\u201d); <em>Bowling v. Brown, </em>57 Md.App. 248, 268, 469 A.2d 896 (1984) (allowing fees \u201cwhere a common fund, benefitting the public, has been created as a result of litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The circuit court employed the common-fund doctrine to support its award of fees to class counsel. The court erred, because the common-fund doctrine does not apply in this case for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">First, by definition, the common-fund doctrine requires a fund. In this case, however, the judgment resulted in the invalidation of the statute, but not in any actual monetary recovery or fund. Second, the common-fund doctrine envisions that the class members themselves will pay class counsel out of the recovery that they receive. In this case, however, the court ordered the State, and not the class members, to pay class counsel\u2019s fees. The circuit court erred in employing the common-fund doctrine in a case that generated no common fund and in ordering payment from outside a common fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The circuit court itself recognized that \u201cno common-fund has actually been created.\u201d Nonetheless, the court reasoned that class counsel had \u201crestored\u201d an estimated $60 million in value to Maryland landowners. On the premise that it would be \u201cimpractical to seek reimbursement from the class,\u201d the court ordered the State to pay $5 million in fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In that aspect of its decision, the circuit court relied on <em>Brewer v. School Bd. of Norfolk, </em>456 F.2d 943 (4th Cir.1972), which employed what that court called \u201ca quasi-application of the \u2018common fund\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 951. In <em>Brewer, </em>the plaintiffs had secured free busing to facilitate an earlier desegregation order against the school board. Although the order yielded a pecuniary benefit to the students, the court recognized that it did not generate a common fund or result in a monetary recovery. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, because the \u201cbasic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>purpose\u201d of the order was \u201cto secure transportation <em>without cost or deduction,\u201d </em>the court required the school board to pay the students\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>at 952 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Brewer </em>is of questionable viability in 2016. <em>Brewer </em>was decided at a time when federal courts were devising federal common-law theories to compensate prevailing parties for the attorneys\u2019 fees that they incurred in civil rights cases and other litigation against governments and governmental officials. The Supreme Court put an end to those efforts in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 269, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), when it held that federal law recognizes only statutory exceptions to the American Rule. \u201c[CJourts,\u201d the Supreme Court wrote, \u201care not free to fashion drastic new rules with respect to the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party in federal litigation or to pick and choose among plaintiffs and the statutes under which they sue and to award fees in some cases but not in others, depending upon the courts\u2019 assessment of the importance of the public policies involved in particular cases.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In light of <em>Alyeska, </em>it appears that the <em>Brewer </em>court overstepped its authority. We would likewise overstep our authority by extending Maryland\u2019s common-fund doctrine to a situation without a fund. Applying the common-fund doctrine where there is no fund is not just uncommon; it is unheard of in Maryland (or anywhere else within the last 44 years). We do not start today.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The intangible value restored to the class is not a \u201cfund.\u201d But even if it were, the common-fund doctrine would only allow an award of fees off the top of the fund, not on top of it. By reducing the class members\u2019 recovery, the doctrine allocates costs between the class and its counsel. It does not allocate costs between the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Class counsel cannot use the common-fund doctrine to collect fees out of nothing. Nor can the class employ the common-fund doctrine to require its adversary to pay the class counsel. As a matter of law, therefore, the circuit court erred in relying on the common-fund doctrine to support the award of fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">D. Section 12-106 of the Real Property Article</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Subtitle 1 of Title 12 of the Real Property Article contains the general rules for eminent domain proceedings. Section 12-106(a) states that in those proceedings <em>u[t]he plaintiff </em>shall pay all the costs in the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 12-106(b) states that \u201c[t]he costs in a condemnation proceeding include ...

Rule 12-201(a)) in Title 12, Chapter 200, of the Maryland Rules. In those proceedings, the State is the plaintiff; the property owner, whose private property is taken for public use under the power of eminent domain, is the defendant. \u201c[I]f the judgment is for the defendant on the right to condemn,\u201d the plaintiff \u2014 i.e., the State \u2014 must pay the defendant\u2019s \u201creasonable legal ... fees.\u201d RP \u00a7 12 \u2014 106(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">This is not a case in which the State exercised the rights of eminent domain to acquire property by condemnation. The plaintiffs, however, claim that this is an \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d case, where an owner attempts to recover the value of property that the government has taken through legislative or regulatory action, \"without any \u201c \u2018formal exercise of the power of eminent domain.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Litz v.

We shall assume, without deciding, that this is an inverse condemnation action. Even so, \u00a7 12-106(b)(5) does not apply in inverse condemnation claims, because, by definition, they do not involve the power of eminent domain. As a matter of law, therefore, the circuit court erred in employing RP \u00a7 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>106(b)(5) to award fees in an inverse condemnation action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Finally, \u00a7 12-106(b)(5) authorizes an award of fees that have been \u201cactually incurred.\u201d But although some of the individual plaintiffs did advance about $100,000.00 to class counsel to cover some of the initial costs of the litigation, no one has \u201cactually incurred\u201d any attorneys\u2019 fees, much less $5 million in fees. Nor does it appear that the plaintiffs have any contractual liability for the fees, as the fee agreement stated that class counsel would look only to the court for an award of fees. For that additional reason, the circuit court erred, as a matter of law, in relying on \u00a7 12-106(b)(5) to require the State to pay class counsel\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">E.

After dismissing several counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint because of their legal insufficiency, the court itself denied the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, stating \u201cthat the evidence presents genuine and novel questions of law as to whether Chapter 286 constitutes a taking.\u201d Indeed, in justifying the magnitude of the $5 million fee, class counsel acknowledged that \u201c[tjhis case presented novel and difficult constitutional questions.\u201d Yet, if those issues were sufficiently novel, difficult, and debatable to justify dismissing portions of the complaint and denying cross-motions for summary judgment, they must also have been sufficient to justify the State in defending the case. <em>See Needle, </em>81 Md.App. at 478-80, 568 A.2d 856 (holding that circuit court was clearly erroneous in making post-trial award of Rule 1-341 (a) sanctions against plaintiff after denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment before trial and motions for judgment during trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The circuit court reasoned that after <em>Muskin </em>Chapter 286 was obviously indefensible. To the contrary, while <em>Muskin </em>contains dicta implying that a ground rent owner has a vested right of reentry <em>(Muskin, </em>422 Md. at 559, 30 A.3d 962), it also recognizes \u201can exception\u201d to the \u201cgeneral prohibition\u201d against abrogating vested rights when the legislature exercises a power to alter remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 30 A.3d 962. Both before and after the <em>Muskin </em>decision, the State had contended that the Chapter 286 represented a legitimate exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s power to substitute one remedy for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The Court of Appeals did not settle the question of Chapter 286\u2019s constitutionality until <em>Goldberg, </em>which effectively held that the legislation abrogated a vested right in a remedy. <em>See Goldberg, </em>437 Md. at 216-17, 85 A.3d 231.

When two of the seven judges of the State\u2019s highest court agree with a party\u2019s position, it is, as a matter of law, erroneous to conclude that the party lacks substantial justification to advocate that position.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">2. <em>Bad Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">A party acts in bad faith when it acts \u201cvexatiously, for the purpose of harassment or unreasonable delay, or for other improper reasons.\u201d <em>Inlet Assocs., </em>324 Md. at 268, 596 A.2d 1049. Citing comments by a total of three of the 187 members of the General Assembly,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the circuit court traced the State\u2019s bad faith \u201cintent on abolishing property rights\u201d to \u201cthe very beginning of the law.\u201d The legislators\u2019 comments have no bearing on whether the State defended this litigation in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Rule 1-341 concerns bad faith conduct in a \u201ccivil action.\u201d When the legislators made their comments, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>legislation had not even become law, much less a subject of civil litigation. The court had no authority to impose sanctions against the State for comments made by three legislators before this litigation ever began.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Even if the legislators had made their comments in the course of the litigation, a statement by an individual legislator is not a party-admission by the State. <em>See, e.g., Bennett v. Yoshina, </em>98 F.Supp.2d 1139, 1153-54 (D.Haw.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>259 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also id. </em>at 1154 (\u201c[i]f every legislator could be said to speak on behalf of the state with regard to every piece of legislation, there could be no cogent state voice\u201d). In any event, under the doctrine of separation of powers, courts simply should not inquire into the motives for enactment of the legislation. <em>See O\u2019Hara v. Kovens, </em>92 Md.App. 9, 23, 606 A.2d 286 (1992). As a matter of law, therefore, the circuit court erred in imposing sanctions on the State on account of comments by three legislators.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The circuit court also erred in ignoring the Attorney\u2019s General legal duty, \u201cas the State\u2019s advocate[,] to present the best arguments he can possibly muster in support of the State\u2019s position.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Att\u2019y Gen. v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </em>301 Md. 9, 36, 481 A.2d 785 (1984). A presumption of constitutionality attaches to the enactments of the General Assembly <em>(id. </em>at 35, 481 A.2d 785), and \u201cthe Attorney General ordinarily has the duty of appearing in the courts as the defender of the validity\u201d of those enactments. <em>Id. </em>at 37, 481 A.2d 785. Even if the Attorney General believes that a statute may ultimately be held unconstitutional, that belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201cdoes not make it such.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 481 A.2d 785. \u201cA statute, with its presumption of constitutionality, has just as much right to an advocate of its validity\u201d as a criminal defendant has to an advocate of his or her defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">This is not to say that Attorney General must defend a law that is undeniably unconstitutional. <em>See, e.g., American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. Goldstein, </em>312 Md. 583, 589, 541 A.2d 955 (1988). Chapter 286, however, was not such a law. At the outset of the case, the circuit court dismissed part of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about the law. Later, the court denied cross-motions for summary judgment because of \u201cgenuine and novel questions of law\u201d about the constitutionality of Chapter 286. The plaintiffs agreed that the case \u201cpresented novel and difficult constitutional questions.\u201d With the impermissible benefit of hindsight, one might say that <em>Muskin </em>foreshadowed the ultimate outcome in this case; yet not only did <em>Muskin </em>not decide the specific issue of Chapter 286\u2019s constitutionality, but the <em>Muskin </em>majority made some statements implying that the legislature could constitutionally substitute one remedy for another, as the State believed it had done. Even when <em>Goldberg </em>invalidated Chapter 286, two judges of the Court of Appeals wrote forcefully in support of their conclusion that the majority was wrong and that the legislation was valid. Once the Court of Appeals had settled the question of Chapter 286\u2019s constitutionality, the State accepted the decision. In these circumstances, the State, as a matter of law, did not act in bad faith in defending the constitutionality of Chapter 286.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>3. <em>Fees \u201cIncurred </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Finally, Rule l-341(a), much like RP \u00a7 12-106(b)(5), authorizes an award only of the fees that a party has \u201cincurred.\u201d A party can \u201cincur[ ]\u201d fees, within the meaning of the rule, even if a third party has paid the fees on the party\u2019s behalf. <em>See Worsham v.

In every legislative session since 2013, the General Assembly has considered and rejected legislation that would authorize a court to award reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in an action to remedy the violation of a Maryland constitutional right, such as a regulatory taking by inverse condemnation. The initial proposal was introduced by the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee at the request of the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals. H.B. 130, 2013 Gen. Assemb. Reg. Sess. (Md.2013).

As an additional instance of bad faith, the court cited the State's \"scorched earth litigation\u201d tactics \"following the decision in <em>Muskin.\" </em>We disagree that the State acted in bad faith by continuing to defend a statute whose invalidity was, at most, in question after <em>Muskin </em>and by advocating a position that won the approval of two judges on the Court of Appeals. Elsewhere, the court seemed to object that the State attempted to remove the case to federal court (on account of the numerous federal claims in the complaint) and to have it transferred to Baltimore City (where the majority of ground rents are located). Suffice it to say that it was no more of an exercise in bad faith for the State to assert its right to remove or transfer the case to a jurisdiction in which it could have been brought than it was for the plaintiffs to bring the case in the forum of their choice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">. As previously noted, some of the class members did incur about $100,000.00 in costs when they advanced that sum to class counsel at the outset of the litigation. Nonetheless, because the State did not defend the case in bad faith or without substantial justification, the circuit court could not have employed Rule 1-341 to require the State to reimburse the class members for those costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
