Appellant was subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>quently committed to the Department of Juvenile Services for placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In this appeal, appellant raises two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">1. Did the juvenile court err in refusing to permit the removal of shackles from appellant during the court proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">2. Did the juvenile court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">For the reasons expressed herein, we find neither reversible error nor abuse of discretion, and affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">At about 9:50 a.m. on August 5, 2014, Nicole DiHart was walking on Pratt Street in Baltimore City when her cell phone rang. As she retrieved the cell phone to answer the call, it was snatched from her hands by a young black man with short hair, whom she estimated to be between ten and 12 years of age, wearing blue jeans, blue underwear visible above the jeans, and no shirt, riding an older blue and red BMX-style bicycle. As he rode away, he looked back over his shoulder two times, allowing DiHart to see his face. When she got to work at the University of Maryland, DiHart reported the incident to the campus security officers in her building.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">About two-and-a-half hours later, DiHart was contacted by the police who asked her if she would ride by in a police cruiser to view a potential suspect at a nearby McDonald\u2019s. At the McDonald\u2019s, DiHart first noticed an older blue and red BMX-style bicycle parked nearby. She then recognized appellant as the person who had snatched her cell phone earlier that morning. She noticed that he had changed his clothes and was now wearing a shirt or jumpsuit, but was, nonetheless, able to affirmatively identify him to the police. At the adjudicatory hearing, DiHart again identified appellant as the individual who had stolen her cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Following his arrest, appellant appeared with his attorney at several hearings before a juvenile court master.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 6, 2014, appellant was brought to court for an adjudicatory hearing before the master. He was transported in leg and wrist restraints by court security officers, and remained so shackled during the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">At the outset, appellant\u2019s attorney requested that the master authorize the removal of appellant\u2019s restraints, which the master declined to order. We shall discuss that matter in further detail in Part I of this opinion. Counsel also moved to suppress DiHart\u2019s out-of-court identification. After hearing testimony from DiHart and argument from counsel, the master denied the suppression motion and ruled that appellant was involved in the theft of DiHart\u2019s cell phone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The formal adjudication followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Appellant filed exceptions challenging both the master\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and her refusal to order removal of his shackles during the adjudication hearing. The exceptions were heard, on the record, in the circuit court on January 20, 2015. After hearing the arguments of counsel, the court determined that the identification procedure used by the police was not impermissibly suggestive and that DiHart\u2019s out-of-court identification was reliable. The court further concluded that requiring appellant to remain shackled during his adjudication hearing was not prejudicial. Accordingly, the court denied appellant\u2019s exceptions, and affirmed the delinquency adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">I. Shackling During Adjudicatory Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Prior to each of his hearings before the juvenile master, defense counsel requested that appellant\u2019s shackles be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>removed. In each instance, the master denied the request without making any findings of the need for him to remain shackled.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">At the adjudicatory hearing on November 6, 2014, appellant\u2019s attorney again requested that appellant\u2019s restraints be removed during the proceedings. For understanding of the issue, we include the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">[Defense Counsel]: I would like the restraints removed before any -witnesses come into the courtroom. This is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_j\">THE COURT: They\u2019re not going to be removed. He can have them in front if the officer says it\u2019s okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, this is a case that I\u2019ve had (indiscernible). Most cases are a witness identifying D as the person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">THE COURT: That happens all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">[Defense Counsel]: But, Your Honor, having him in shackles is an indication to the witnesses that this is the young man who did it. This is a due process issue, Your Honor. It\u2019s not just I want them off because we\u2019re having a hearing. We don\u2019t allow \u2014 in the adult system we would never allow a jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">THE COURT: This is not the adult system, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">[Defense Counsel]: Okay. But the implication is the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7b\">THE COURT: If his hands are handcuffed in front of him then they could be down in his lap and no one can see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">[Defense Counsel]: You know, Your Honor, when you walk in the courtroom you\u2019ll see the leg shackles. They -will see\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">THE COURT: Oh, I\u2019m not having anybody\u2019s leg shackles taken off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">THE COURT: It\u2019s not going to happen, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">[Defense Counsel]: Then this is not going to be a fair trial because you\u2019ll be sending the signal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>THE COURT: Okay, [Defense Counsel], let\u2019s do this. We\u2019ll just <em>go </em>ahead and then you\u2019ll take your exception. Now, Officer [WJ\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">OFFICER [WJ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">THE COURT: \u2014the young man has a trial. Is he handcuffed in front or in back right now? Okay. Now, are you going to be staying with him the whole time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">OFFICER [WJ: If I have to, probably will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">THE COURT: Okay. Are you comfortable putting his handcuffs in front?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">OFFICER [WJ: No. I\u2019m going to leave them on the back. He has a problem with his fingers so I have him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afo\">THE COURT: Say that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">OFFICER [WJ: He has a problem with his fingers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">THE COURT: What do you mean with his fingers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1i5\">OFFICER [WJ: He\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">THE COURT: You mean he gives people the finger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUK\">OFFICER [WJ: Yeah, he (indiscernible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, he\u2019s never done that in a courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">THE COURT: Okay. Hold on. Well, here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s going to be awhile and I don\u2019t think he can sit comfortably handcuffed behind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">[DJ,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-15\">[D.MJ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-16\">THE COURT: \u2014you know we don\u2019t allow that here. You don\u2019t give people the finger here in court. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-17\">[D.MJ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-18\">THE COURT: So I\u2019m going to ask Officer [WJ to put your handcuffs in front and I\u2019m going to trust you to respect the rules of court and not give anybody the finger, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-19\">[D.MJ: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-20\">THE COURT: Okay. Now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: You\u2019re not giving me an exception. You\u2019re giving me a plea. This is an issue where\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], you do your thing, my friend. I\u2019m just trying to run my courtroom the way I\u2019ve been doing it for about 20 years now. Okay. Now, do you want to borrow a jacket or something to put over his handcuffs since the officer doesn\u2019t feel comfortable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATD\">[Defense Counsel]: I don\u2019t see how that makes it any better, Your Honor, not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">THE COURT: Well, other than that, he\u2019d just have to keep them down in his lap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Well, I mean, if he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">THE COURT: Your attorney, [D.], is concerned about someone seeing your handcuffs. So when you\u2019re sitting down, can you keep your hands in your lap?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">[Defense Counsel]: Well, Your Honor, that\u2019s a problem too because I need him to communicate with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">THE COURT: Well, he can talk to you in your ear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS\">[Defense Counsel]: I need him to write things down so I can\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">THE COURT: He\u2019s not going to write anything down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae8\">[Defense Counsel]: Are you kidding me? The last two adjudications we had all he did was write things down and he has an absolute right to communicate with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">THE COURT: Well, then he can put the pad in his lap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXT\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, you\u2019re restricting his right to effectively assist his own counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-12\">THE COURT: Well, I appreciate your argument. I do not agree with your argument. I\u2019m going to try to put him in a situation where he can participate fully. Now, actually, I don\u2019t think that people are going to be able to see all the way over there to his table. If he wants to write on the table with a pad and pen, that\u2019s fine. If he wants to write down in his lap, keep the pad and pen down in his lap, that\u2019s fine, too. You two may decide that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>I\u2019m happy to lend you something to put over his handcuffs physically so they won\u2019t be obvious or he can just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac0\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I\u2019m not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">THE COURT: \u2014keep them in his lap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014conceding anything. He shouldn\u2019t have handcuffs on his hands\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014during trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">THE COURT: Okay. Thank you, [Defense Counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIk\">[Defense Counsel]: So when the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">THE COURT: He should have handcuffs on.

There\u2019s no risk of violence, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], I am responsible. Now, this is my training. I am responsible for the welfare of everybody who comes into my courtroom. I speak to the officers about security and I respect what they tell me because I am the one who will answer if someone gets hurt in here, including [D.]. So that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s the perspective that I\u2019m coming from, just so you understand. Now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">[Defense Counsel]: And the first allegation that\u2019s been raised (indiscernible)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">THE COURT: Okay. That\u2019s enough.

Call your case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Appellant suggests that the presumption against shackling that is recognized in adult criminal courts should likewise be applied in juvenile proceedings. We agree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that, in criminal proceedings against adult defendants, the Due Process Clause \u201cprohibit[s] the use of physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination, in the exercise of its discretion, that they are justified by a state interest specific to a particular trial.\u201d <em>Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 629, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005). The prohibition applies to both the guilt and penalty phases of trial, <em>id. </em>at 633, 125 S.Ct. 2007, and is based on \u201cthree fundamental legal principles\u201d: (1) the presumption of innocence; (2) the right to consult with counsel; and (3) the \u201ccourtroom\u2019s formal dignity, which includes the respectful treatment of defendants....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630-31, 125 S.Ct. 2007. Maryland has adopted the law enunciated in <em>Deck: </em>\u201cThe prejudice posed by security measures, and whether a compelling state interest outweighs that prejudice, must be measured on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 640, 702 A.2d 261 (1997) (quoting <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 410, 583 A.2d 218 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Nonetheless, there are practical limits to this constitutional right. Where a defendant is \u201cdisruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant\u201d in a manner that interferes with the dignity, order, and decorum of a courtroom, the trial court has the discretion to order \u201cconstitutionally permissible\u201d accommodations made, after warning the defendant of those potential consequences, up to and including expelling the defendant from the courtroom. <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 343-44, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970) (offering shackling, citation for contempt, and outright removal from the courtroom as among acceptable means of maintaining order during criminal proceedings). The right does not expire upon the court\u2019s use of such consequences; once lost, it \u201ccan, of course, be reclaimed as soon as the defendant is willing to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>himself consistently with the decorum and respect inherent in the concept of courts and judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057. These measures are to be tailored to the specifics of each case, though, and are not meant for use in a blanket application to all defendants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Shackling and other such accommodations are only appropriate when there is a compelling state interest. <em>Wagner v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 419, 477, 74 A.3d 765 (2013). Such essential state interests that may justify the physical restraint of a defendant include preventing the defendant\u2019s escape, protecting those in the courtroom, and maintaining order in the courtroom. <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. at 410, 583 A.2d 218. But, \u201c[u]nless one or more of these factors outweigh any prejudice to the defendant, physical restraint is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A particularized finding of such must be made on the record. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In <em>Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986), the Supreme Court limited the scope of the right of adults to appear without overtly suggestive security measures to the effects of its possible violation. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 106 S.Ct. 1340 (\u201cThis does not mean, however, that every practice tending to single out the accused from everyone else in the courtroom must be struck down.\u201d). Judicial review of such a complaint is limited to determining whether \u201cwhat [jurors] saw was so inherently prejudicial as to pose an unacceptable threat to defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial; if the challenged practice is not found inherently prejudicial and if the defendant fails to show actual prejudice, the inquiry is over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 106 S.Ct. 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The constitutional rights afforded adult defendants are not automatically applied to juveniles, because the juvenile system is not in the nature of criminal proceedings. Rather, it is a system designed with the goal of treatment and rehabilitation of children, rather than punishment. Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-8A-02(a)(l); <em>see also In re Keith W., </em>310 Md. 99, 106, 527 A.2d 35 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The distinctions between the juvenile and criminal systems have engendered considerable discussion. \u201cJuvenile proceedings are of a special species that has been designed by the General Assembly in response to a particular need and to meet a peculiar problem.\u201d <em>In re Appeal Misc. No. 32, </em>29 Md.App. 701, 704, 351 A.2d 164 (1976). \u201c[A] distinction exists between delinquency proceedings involving juvenile offenders and criminal proceedings involving adults in the criminal justice arena, even though the conduct underlying a delinquent act and a crime may be the same.\u201d <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 580, 598, 843 A.2d 915 (2004). \u201cThe dispositions of the juvenile court are not to be considered as punishment for a crime nor are adjudications of delinquency \u2018convictions\u2019, as that word is generally applied with respect to criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Appeal Misc. No. 32, </em>29 Md.App. at 704, 351 A.2d 164. Juvenile proceedings aspire to \u201cthe idealistic prospect of an intimate, informal protective proceeding,\u201d <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. 528, 545, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971), and \u201cretain their special and informal nature,\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 92, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994) (quotation marks omitted). The purpose of juvenile delinquency proceedings is not primarily to punish the child; rather, \u201cin disposition, the court will fashion a plan of supervision, treatment, and rehabilitation appropriate to the juvenile and serving the rehabilitative goals of the [Juvenile Causes] Act.\u201d <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>155 Md.App. at 598, 843 A.2d 915; <em>see also </em>Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-8A-19(d)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Given the special characteristics of the juvenile system, the procedural rights accorded to juveniles have always deviated substantially from those guaranteed to adult defendants\u2014 differences that have been insisted upon in order to meet the treatment goals of the juvenile system. <em>See In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 14, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). To combat the dangers of an entirely civil system, though, where a child theoretically cannot be deprived of his constitutional rights because he has none, the Supreme Court has held that children in the juvenile system are entitled to due process. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 87 S.Ct. 1428.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>However, the Court has refrained from \u201ctaking the easy way with a flat holding that all rights constitutionally assured for the adult accused are to be imposed upon the state juvenile proceeding.\u201d <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. at 545, 91 S.Ct. 1976.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is a careful consideration required of each right prior to extending it to juveniles, which arises from a deep respect for the juvenile system\u2019s purpose. For instance, the Supreme Court has ruled that coerced confessions may not be used against juveniles, <em>Haley v. Ohio, </em>332 U.S. 596, 601, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948), but it has also been held \u201cthat the juvenile is not entitled to bail, to indictment by grand jury, to a public trial or to a trial by jury,\u201d <em>Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 14, 87 S.Ct. 1428, as those rights would skew the focus from treatment of the child to something reflective of the criminal system. We have noted several other rights that Maryland courts have reviewed and found applicable to juveniles, including the right to a speedy trial, double jeopardy protections, and the right to counsel. <em>See Lopez-Sanchez, </em>155 Md.App. at 599, 843 A.2d 915 (surveying Maryland case law as it pertains to rights of accused juvenile offenders). The analysis of whether a particular procedural right is guaranteed to juveniles under the Due Process Clause centers on whether granting that right would help achieve or serve to hinder the goals of the juvenile system.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We see no reason why extending to children the right guaranteed adult criminal defendants to appear in court free of shackles, absent a particularized finding of need, would impede the objectives of the juvenile system. Indeed, a presumption against shackling would more closely serve those objectives, while indiscriminate shackling threatens them.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The Court of Appeals summarized: \u201cthe overriding goal of Maryland\u2019s juvenile statutory scheme is to rehabilitate and treat delinquent juveniles so that they become useful and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>productive members of society.\u201d <em>Keith W., </em>310 Md. at 106, 527 A.2d 35. The General Assembly included the creation of competency, character development, protection and treatment of the child, and wholesome mental and physical development among the purposes of the Juvenile Causes Act. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-8A-02(a). These are less likely to be achieved in parallel to the risks of psychological harm, of an exacerbated sense of shame, and of distrust in the court system that may arise from the unnecessary shackling of juveniles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">There are practical consequences to the appearance of juveniles in restraints. While juveniles are not entitled to trial by jury, their cases often involve witnesses whose perceptions may be swayed by the sight of a child in physical restraints. Indiscriminate shackling also physically and, at times, psychologically inhibits the juvenile respondent\u2019s right to assist counsel and participate in his or her own defense. Where there is the potential for the loss of liberty, a juvenile\u2019s needs in court are \u201ccomparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution.\u201d <em>Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 36, 87 S.Ct. 1428. The use of restraints may impair a juvenile\u2019s physical ability to take notes and confer freely with counsel, and it might also impair a psychological willingness to testify or answer a magistrate\u2019s questions openly and candidly. The goals of the juvenile system being rehabilitative, a juvenile\u2019s active participation in his or her defense may demonstrate to the court an eagerness to receive treatment or may help guide the court in crafting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>effective and personalized treatment plan. It may further serve as an example to the juvenile of how engaging the support of others can be beneficial.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The presumption against shackling juvenile respondents has, in recent months, been one of public concern and discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">During the briefing in this case, effective September 21, 2015, the Court of Appeals adopted the Maryland Judicial Council\u2019s <em>Resolution Regarding Shackling of Children in Juvenile Court.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For many of the same reasons appellant so eloquently asserted in his brief and during oral argument, the Resolution \u201cadopts as policy the presumption against the shackling of children during proceedings in the Juvenile Court.\u201d Pursuant to the Resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">[AJgencies that are responsible for the transport or transfer of children to, from, and within courthouses shall retain the discretion to employ practices that will ensure the security of the child and others. Once in the court or hearing room, however, a child is to be unshackled and remain so absent a particularized security concern. The judge or juvenile magistrate conducting the proceeding shall determine whether the child needs to be shackled in the court or hearing room pursuant to this policy. Security personnel have the ongoing responsibility for maintaining security and order throughout the proceeding.<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>While the adoption of the Judicial Council Resolution would preclude the routine use of shackles in juvenile proceedings, the fact remains that, prior to the Court of Appeals doing so, no court rule, policy, or statute precluded the shackling of juvenile offenders appearing in Maryland juvenile courts without any particularized findings that such restrictions were necessary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has opined regarding the due process implications of in-court restraint of juvenile respondents. Likewise, the policy has never been considered by the Rules Committee as a procedural requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The actions of the Judicial Council and the Court of Appeals are aspirational policies without, as yet, force of either statutory or case law. To effect uniformity and to eliminate disparities in practice from courtroom to courtroom, we hold that juveniles should not be shackled while appearing at juvenile court hearings, unless and until there has been a finding on the record that the juvenile poses a security concern or threat that would disrupt those particular proceedings or involve danger to the juvenile or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Appellant asserts that the master erred by denying defense counsel\u2019s request to remove his shackles during his adjudicatory hearing, that the master failed to make individualized findings that he posed a risk that justified the use of restraints, and that the record did not demonstrate that the restraints were necessary. Appellant concludes that, because the master\u2019s refusal to remove his restraints was so highly prejudicial, it constituted reversible error, and that the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>court further erred by overruling his exception to the master\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In our view, the undisputed fact of D. having been restrained throughout the proceeding did not impede his right to a fair adjudicatory proceeding. It is our function to consider the scene presented to those who might have been prejudiced by the sight of the shackles and determine whether what they saw was so inherently prejudicial as to pose an unacceptable threat to D.\u2019s right to a fair proceeding. <em>See Holbrook, </em>475 U.S. at 572, 106 S.Ct. 1340. As in <em>Holbrook, </em>D. has failed to show that he was unable to communicate with his counsel, or that the witness was unduly prejudiced by his restraints. DiHart made a reliable out-of-court identification prior to seeing him in restraints in the courtroom, reducing the need for a constitutionally pure in-court identification. Accordingly, we shall affirm the holding of the juvenile court overruling D.\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Moreover, the juvenile court master who conducted appellant\u2019s adjudicatory hearing was not bound by then-existing rules, policies, statutes, or holdings of any other jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, at the time of appellant\u2019s adjudicatory hearing, whether to remove his shackles was left to the discretion of the court and no particularized findings of fact were required to justify denying defense counsel\u2019s request for removal of the shackles.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The juvenile master\u2019s function was to make factual findings and recommendations for review by the circuit court regarding the sufficiency of the evidence of appellant\u2019s involvement in the theft of DiHart\u2019s cell phone. <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-807(d)(1) (providing \u201cthe proposals and recommendations of a master for juvenile causes do not constitute orders or final action of the court\u201d) (applicable to this case through \u00a7 3-8A-04 of same Article); Md. Rule ll-lll(a)(2) (same); \u00a7 3-807(d)(2) (a master\u2019s \u201cproposals and recommendations shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>promptly reviewed by the court, and, in the absence of timely and proper exceptions, they may be adopted by the court and appropriate orders entered based on them.\u201d); Md. Rule 11-111(c) \u2014 (d) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In conducting its exceptions function, the circuit court recognized that the master was required to act as a \u201cneutral arbitrator in the case\u201d and to exercise her \u201ccapacity to separate and ignore any shackles\u201d appellant was wearing during the hearing. There is no indication in the record that the master\u2019s fact-finding and application of the law was adversely affected by the shackles. Nor, despite counsel\u2019s assertions, does the record reveal that the shackles prevented appellant from taking notes or communicating effectively with his attorney during the hearing. While appellant asserts damaging prejudice, none is apparent from the record. Therefore, discerning no prejudice, we conclude that appellant\u2019s due process rights and presumption of innocence were not compromised by the master\u2019s refusal to order removal of the restraints during the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Appellant further suggests that DiHart may have misidentified him as her assailant at the adjudication hearing because he was the only person in the room bound in restraints. As we discuss at greater length below, neither the master nor the circuit court erred in concluding that DiHart\u2019s out-of-court identification of appellant was reliable and therefore admissible at his adjudication hearing. It was for the master to consider all the applicable circumstances, including that appellant\u2019s shackles were potentially visible, and to evaluate Di-Hart\u2019s credibility in light of those circumstances. The master was able, throughout the proceedings, to consider DiHart\u2019s demeanor and hear her responses to the parties\u2019 questions as they occurred. The master found DiHart\u2019s testimony, which was consistent with her previous out-of-court identification, to be compelling. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the master\u2019s findings in this case were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the circuit court did not err by sustaining appellant\u2019s exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>master\u2019s denial of his request to remove his shackles during his adjudication hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">II. The Out-of-Court Identification</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We turn now to the assertions that the show-up procedure utilized by the police was impermissibly suggestive and that the master erred in not granting appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the resulting out-of-court identification by DiHart. On review of D.\u2019s exceptions, the circuit court accepted the master\u2019s findings, agreeing that her identification was reliable, based on DiHart\u2019s opportunity to view her assailant at the time of the incident, the detailed descriptions she provided regarding both her assailant and the bicycle, and the fact \u201cthat she appeared to memorize what he was wearing or the lack thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Principles of due process protect those accused of criminal acts \u201c \u2018against the introduction of evidence of, or tainted by, unreliable pretrial identifications obtained through unnecessarily suggestive procedures.\u2019 \u201d <em>James v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 233, 251-52, 991 A.2d 122 (2010) (quoting <em>Webster v. State, </em>299 Md. 581, 599-600, 474 A.2d 1305 (1984)). The Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed the two-step analysis of the admissibility of an extrajudicial identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">The first question is whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. If the procedure is not impermissibly suggestive, then the inquiry ends. If, however, the procedure is determined to be impermissibly suggestive, then the second step is triggered, and the court must determine whether, under the totality of circumstances, the identification was reliable. If a <em>prima facie </em>showing is made that the identification was impermissibly suggestive, then the burden shifts to the State to show, under a totality of the circumstances, that it was reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>Smiley v. State, </em>442 Md. 168, 180, 111 A.3d 43 (2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In evaluating the reliability of an out-of-court identification, the factors we consider include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>(i) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">(ii) the witness\u2019 degree of attention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">(iii) the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">(iv) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">(v) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\"><em>Webster, </em>299 Md. at 607, 474 A.2d 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">This Court has emphasized: \u201cIt is only where there is \u2018a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u2019 to wit, a situation where the identification could not be found to be reliable, that exclusion would be warranted. Short of that point, the \u2018evidence is for the jury to weigh.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 175, 184, 964 A.2d 695 (2009) (drawing on <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 116, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977) and <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">In assessing the admissibility of an extrajudicial identification, we look exclusively to the record of the suppression hearing and view the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>White v. State, </em>374 Md. 232, 249, 821 A.2d 459 (2003). We accept the circuit court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, but extend no deference to the circuit court\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to the admissibility of the identification. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">The evidence heard by the master revealed that Di-Hart contacted campus security and provided an account of the robbery she had experienced just minutes before. She also provided a detailed description of her assailant and the bicycle he had been riding. Within two-and-one-half hours, the police located a BMX-style bicycle, matching the description provided by DiHart, outside a McDonald\u2019s a few blocks from where the robbery had occurred. After detaining appellant and his bicycle, the police brought DiHart to the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and, while she had a clear view of him from the police cruiser, she identified him as the individual who had stolen her cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">On those facts, we cannot find that DiHart\u2019s identification of appellant was the product of an impermissibly suggestive procedure. \u201cA show-up has always been considered a perfectly permissible procedure in the immediate wake of a crime while the apprehension of the criminals is still turbulently unsettled.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>184 Md.App. at 185, 964 A.2d 695 (citations omitted). In this case, the show-up took place less than three hours after DiHart contacted campus security, informed them that she had been robbed, and provided a detailed description of the assailant and the bicycle he was riding. Shortly thereafter, the police detained appellant with his bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">To determine whether to arrest appellant for the robbery or to release him and continue the search, the police brought DiHart to the McDonald\u2019s and asked her whether the individual they had detained was, in fact, the individual who had snatched her cell phone from her hand that morning. The show-up here was a permissible procedure justified by the police\u2019s need to assess quickly whether they had the culprit, in which case the search could be concluded, or whether the culprit was still at large, in which case the suspect in custody could be released and the search could be continued while the trail was still fresh. <em>See Turner, </em>184 Md.App. at 185, 964 A.2d 695, and <em>Green v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 506, 514-15, 558 A.2d 441 (1989) (noting that the \u201cpractice of presenting single suspects to persons for the purpose of identification\u201d may be justified by \u201cthe desirable objectives of fresh, accurate identification which in some instances may lead to the immediate release of an innocent suspect and at the same time enable the police to resume the search for the fleeing culprit while the trail is still fresh\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Even were we to assume that the show-up was impermissibly suggestive, we cannot \u201csay that under all the circumstances of this case there is a very substantial likelihood of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>184 Md.App. at 186, 964 A.2d 695 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). DiHart carefully committed the physical appearance of her assailant and his bicycle to memory as he twice looked back at her while he was riding away. DiHart was able to provide a very detailed description of appellant and his bicycle that was largely consistent with his physical appearance and that of his bicycle at the time he was apprehended by the police. At the time of the show-up, DiHart was able to articulate to the police that appellant had changed his clothing, but that she was certain he was the person who had taken her cell phone only a few hours before.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We are persuaded that, under the totality of the circumstances presented, there were sufficient indicia of reliability overall to support the court\u2019s decision to admit DiHart\u2019s out-of-court identification of appellant, even were we to find that the show-up procedure utilized by the police rendered it impermissibly suggestive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the master did not err by denying the defense motion to suppress DiHart\u2019s identification. Nor did the circuit court err in overruling appellant\u2019s objection to the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\">.
