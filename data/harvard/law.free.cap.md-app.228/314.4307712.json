On July 2, 2014, the Liquor Board charged Kougl with violating three Liquor Board Rules related to solicitation of prostitution, indecent exposure, and violation of public morals, all occurring on April 25, 2013, at Club Harem, when an employee exposed herself to an undercover police officer and then solicited sexual intercourse from the same officer. The Liquor Board found Kougl guilty of all three violations and ordered that his liquor license be suspended for one month. Kougl filed for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which affirmed the decision of the Liquor Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">On appeal to this Court, Kougl raises four questions for our review, which we have condensed and rephrased as two ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tions:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">1.

Jamaica Brickhouse, a woman who worked at Club Harem, approached Det. Jackson at the bar and asked if she could join him. Det. Jackson said \u201csure,\u201d and bought Brickhouse a drink. After some initial conversation, Brickhouse exposed her breasts to Det. Jackson. Brickhouse invited Det. Jackson to touch her breasts, which he did. Brickhouse then suggested a lap dance or a trip to \u201cthe VIP,\u201d where they could \u201cdo whatever up there.\u201d Det. Jackson asked how much it would cost him to have sex with Brickhouse; Brickhouse replied that it would cost $170 \u201cfor the room,\u201d plus a tip for her services. Det. Jackson said that he could tip $100, and Brickhouse agreed. Brickhouse returned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>stage to perform, and Det. Jackson notified other officers. Brickhouse, however, was not issued a criminal summons until December 10, 2013, almost eight months later.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Fifteen months after the incident, on July 2, 2014, the Liquor Board charged Kougl with violating three Liquor Board Rules related to solicitation of prostitution in violation of Rule 4.17(a), indecent exposure in violation of Rule 4.17(b), and violation of public morals in violation of Rule 4.18. On July 17, 2014, the Liquor Board held a hearing on the charges against Kougl. Det. Jackson was the only witness for the prosecution; Kougl testified in his own defense. The Liquor Board voted 2-1 that Kougl was guilty of the three violations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and suspended his liquor license for one month.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On July 18, 2014, Kougl filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the circuit court. On March 2, 2015, Kougl filed his Memorandum, in which he argued that (1) the Liquor Board\u2019s decision was not based on substantial evidence, because \u201c[t]here [wa]s nothing in [Det. Jackson\u2019s] testimony to indicate that the [licensee knew, allowed or permitted this type of activity, which is needed to sustain the violations\u201d; (2) its decision was unreasonable and arbitrary, because the Chairman of the Liquor Board stated that a licensee \u201cwould be responsible for actions of an employee\u201d regardless of \u201cwhether the [licensee knew or did not know or allowed or did not allow or permitted or did not permit\u201d the prohibited activity; and (3) the Liquor Board failed to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law as required. On April 15, 2015, the Liquor Board filed its Response to Kougl\u2019s Memorandum, in which it contended that (1) its decision was based on substantial evidence; (2) its decision was reasonable; and (3) the Liquor Board made sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>On May 22, 2015, the circuit court held oral argument and issued an oral ruling affirming the decision of the Liquor Board. On May 28, 2015, the court entered its order affirming the Liquor Board\u2019s decision. On June 22, 2015, Kougl filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Maryland law provides by statute that the action of a local liquor board is presumed to be proper and places the burden of proof upon the licensee to show that the decision complained of was arbitrary, fraudulent, unsupported by substantial evidence, illegal, or against the public interest. Md.Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol), Art. 2B, \u00a7 16 \u2014 101(e)(l)(i). This Court has explained appellate review of a Liquor Board\u2019s decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">While the last sentence of \u00a7 16-101(e)(l)(i) expressly permits the trial court, under certain circumstances, to hear additional evidence, the court may hear such evidence only to ascertain the veracity of findings of fact and conclusions of law reached by the Board. As the section does not authorize appeals <em>de novo, </em>the trial court may not hear additional evidence on matters not addressed by the Board. This Court has consistently explained that judicial review of a decision by the Board is similar to review of decisions by most other administrative agencies. It is a cardinal rule of administrative appeals that a reviewing court ... shall apply the substantial evidence test to final decisions of an administrative agency such as the Board, but it must not itself make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">Judicial review of administrative action differs from appellate review of a trial court judgment. In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court. However, in judicial review of agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustaina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ble on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reason stated by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><em>Blackburn v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs for Balt. City, </em>130 Md.App. 614, 623-24, 747 A.2d 725 (2000) (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u201cOf course, the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the [Liquor] Board on questions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624, 747 A.2d 725. In deciding whether to substitute its judgment on a question of law, a court should accord a degree of deference to the position of the administrative agency. <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005). \u201cThus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn agency conclusion will not be upheld upon review, however, if based upon an error of law.\u201d <em>Hoyle v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs for Balt. City, </em>115 Md.App. 124, 129, 692 A.2d 1 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Sufficient Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u201cThere is no express requirement that the Board set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. In order for any meaningful review to be conducted, however, the Board must do so, at least informally.\u201d <em>Blackburn, </em>130 Md.App. at 624, 747 A.2d 725 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Kougl argues that the Liquor Board did not make sufficient findings of fact to allow for meaningful judicial review. Specifically, Kougl contends that the Liquor Board\u2019s decision consists of the following two statements, neither of which contain any findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">All right. The verdict is responsible for all three charges. The police department is not on trial here. Mr. Kougl is. And bar owners or licensees are responsible for the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>of their employees, as I have said before, in all cases, in all bars, in the city of Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">All right, my finding is responsible to all three charges and close him for one month, effective immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">According to Kougl, the above statements were insufficient to support a legal conclusion that Kougl violated the Rules at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The Liquor Board responds that there is no requirement that it set forth specific findings of fact so long as its informal findings are sufficient to allow for \u201cmeaningful appellate review.\u201d Furthermore, the Liquor Board argues that it made informal findings of fact that were \u201csufficient for this Court to determine whether substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Kougl violated the three Liquor Board Rules as charged.\u201d We agree with the Liquor Board and shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">As previously indicated, Kougl, as the licensee, was charged \u25a0with violating Rules 4.17(a), 4.17(b), and 4.18. Rule 4.17 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">Sexual Practices and Obscenity</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">(a) No licensee shall permit or suffer his premises to be used for the purpose of any sexual activity, nor shall any licensee permit or suffer any employee, patron or frequenter to solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">(b) No licensee shall permit or suffer any person to appear in any act or other performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered; nor shall any licensee knowingly permit or suffer his premises to be used for the conduct, exhibition or performance of an obscene act or other performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Rule 4.18 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">Illegal Conduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>No licensee shall commit or allow the commission on his premises of any act which shall be contrary to any federal, state or local statute, law or ordinance or against the public peace, safety, health, welfare, quiet or morals.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing on the charges against Kougl, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">CHAIRMAN WARD: All right. The verdict is responsible for all three charges. The police department is not on trial here. Mr. Kougl is. And bar owners or licensees are responsible for the conduct of their employees, as I have said before, in all cases, in all bars, in the city of Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">The only question now is punishment----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">All right, my finding is responsible to all three charges and close him for one month, effective immediately. And I\u2019d be glad to hear from the other commissioners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>COMMISSIONER JONES: I agree. I agree that there\u2019s a guilty for all charges. It\u2019s clear to me that this thing took place. I have confidence in the police department. If I didn\u2019t, the system would have a great defect in it, so I agree to the one month close order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">CHAIRMAN WARD: Commissioner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">COMMISSIONER MOORE: I disagree. I don\u2019t think that the evidence substantiates the charges. And I\u2019m concerned that there was a lapse of eight months. And I think that is extraordinary. It is unusual and it is not acceptable practice. And I think that that argues against a finding of guilt. So I say no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">CHAIRMAN WARD: Two to one. You heard the thing, you heard the penalty, sir. Good luck to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The excerpt above makes clear that Commissioner Jones expressly relied on Det. Jackson\u2019s testimony, and Chairman Ward implicitly relied on such testimony. Moreover, Kougl, in his testimony, did not dispute any of the evidence presented in Det. Jackson\u2019s testimony, so a finding of guilty necessarily meant that Chairman Ward and Commissioner Jones credited Det. Jackson\u2019s testimony as true.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Furthermore, a \u201cBoard Summary\u201d was issued after the hearing, which set forth the factual basis for each violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">Violation of Rule 4.17(a) \u201cNo licensee shall permit or suffer his premises to be used for the purpose of any sexual activity, nor shall any licensee permit or suffer any employee, patron or frequenter to solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.\u201d <em>(Re: April 25, 2013, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>dancer solicited undercover police officer for sexual intercourse </em>) GUILTY 2-1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">Violation of Rule 4.17(b) \u201cNo licensee shall permit or suffer any person to appear in any act or other performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered; no[r] shall any licensee knowingly permit or suffer his premises to be used for the conduct, exhibition or performance of an obscene act or other performance\u201d <em>(Re: April 25, 2013, dancer exposed herself to undercover police </em>officer) GUILTY 2-1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APD\">Violation of Rule 4.18 \u201cNo licensee shall commit or allow the commission on his premises of any act which shall be contrary to any federal, state or local statue [sic], law or ordinance or against the public peace, safety, health, welfare, quiet or morals.\u201d <em>(Re: April 25, 2013, dancer solicited undercover police officer for sexual intercourse; dancer exposed herself to undercover police </em>officer) GUILTY 2-1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE1\">(Italics added) (bold in original). The facts supporting each violation, as emphasized in italics above, tracks Det. Jackson\u2019s testimony, and provides a sufficient factual basis to allow for meaningful judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Strict Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Kougl argues that Rules 4.17 and 4.18 require some evidence or inference therefrom that Kougl suffered, permitted, or allowed solicitation and nudity to occur, and there was no evidence to support such a finding. According to Kougl, there was insufficient evidence for the Liquor Board to infer that Kougl permitted such conduct to occur \u201cmerely by reason that the dancer solicited the detective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The Liquor Board responds that the three violations \u201care, as a matter of law, strict liability offenses,\u201d none of which require \u201ca licensee\u2019s knowledge of the impermissible conduct.\u201d The Liquor Board analogizes Rules 4.17(a) and (b) to Rule 4.01(a), which prohibits sales of alcohol to minors, to argue that both Rules \u201ccontain[] both a strict liability prohibition and a second provision with a knowledge requirement.\u201d As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>for Rule 4.18, the Liquor Board argues that it \u201ccontains no knowledge or mens rea language. Therefore, it describes a strict liability offense.\u201d According to the Liquor Board, Kougl was found guilty of violating the strict liability portion of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">By virtue of its argument that the charged violations are strict liability offenses, the Liquor Board concedes that the evidence adduced at the hearing was insufficient to find that Kougl had actual or constructive knowledge of the violations. Upon review of the record, we agree that there was simply no evidence of Kougl\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Whether Rules 4.17 and 4.18 impose a strict liability standard on a licensee depends on the meaning of the words \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d and \u201callow\u201d as used in the Rules. In determining the meaning of such words, \u201cwe apply well-settled rules of statutory construction, the cardinal rule of [which] is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Assateague Coastkeeper v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t, </em>200 Md.App. 665, 708-09, 28 A.3d 178 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">In so doing, we look first to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, read as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. Where the language of the statute is ambiguous and may be subject to more than one interpretation, however, we look to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, purpose, structure, and overarching statutory scheme in aid of searching for the intention of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Whitley v. Md. State Bd. of Elections, </em>429 Md. 132, 149, 55 A.3d 37 (2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>In accord with the above standard, we turn to the plain meaning of the subject terms in the Rules. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csuffer\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">To allow, to admit, or to permit. It includes knowledge of what is to be done under sufferance. To suffer an act to be done or a condition to exist is to permit or consent to it; to approve of it, and not to hinder it. It implies knowledge, a willingness of the mind and responsible control or ability to prevent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1432 (6th ed.1990) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \u201cPermit\u201d is defined as: \u201cTo suffer, allow, consent, let; to give leave or license; to acquiesce, by failure to prevent, or to expressly assent or agree to the doing of an act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1140. Finally, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201callow\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">The word has no rigid or precise meaning, its import varying according to circumstances or context in connection with which it is used. It may mean to bestow or assign to any one as his right or due. To approve of, accept as true, admit, concede, adopt, or fix. To grant something as a deduction or an addition; to abate or deduct; as, to allow a sum for leakage. To sanction, either directly or indirectly, as opposed to merely suffering a thing to be done; to acquiesce in; to suffer; to tolerate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 76 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">No Maryland appellate opinion exists regarding the meaning of these words in the context of the Liquor Board Rules. Other jurisdictions that use \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d or \u201callow,\u201d in their liquor board rules are divided on whether such terms impose a strict liability standard, or whether knowledge on the part of the licensee must be proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Wisconsin, Oregon, and New Jersey courts have held that their states\u2019 liquor board rules, all of which use the words \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d or \u201callow,\u201d impose strict liability on the part of the licensee. In <em>City of West Allis v. Megna, </em>the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that an ordinance that stated that no licensee shall \u201ceither directly or indirectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>suffer or permit any person of either sex under the age of 21 years ... to enter or be on such licensed premises for any purpose,\u201d imposed a strict liability standard. 26 Wis.2d 545, 133 N.W.2d 252, 253 (1965). The Court determined that \u201c[p]roof of knowledge on the part of the tavern keeper that the patron is actually under age is not required by the statute in order to obtain a conviction,\u201d and that such standard \u201cis a price that the operator pays for the privilege of becoming licensed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Similarly, the Court of Appeals of Oregon held in <em>DK Entertainment, LLC v. Oregon Liquor Control Commission </em>that, when interpreting an ordinance stating that \u201c \u2018[n]o licensee or permittee will permit any unlawful activity on the licensed premises or in areas the licensee controls that are adjacent to or outside the premises,\u2019 \u201d the Oregon Liquor Control Commission \u201cmay impute to the licensee the knowledge of the licensees employees.\u201d 249 Or.App. 659, 278 P.3d 112, 113 n. 2, 114 (2012). Finally, in <em>Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Maynards Inc., </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey held an ordinance providing that \u201c[n]o licensee shall allow, permit or suffer in or upon the licensed premises any unlawful possession of or any unlawful activity pertaining to\u201d narcotics and other controlled dangerous substances imposed a strict liability standard. 192 N.J. 158, 927 A.2d 525, 536 (2007). The Court noted that \u201c[i]t has long been the law in New Jersey that, in the context of the regulation of alcoholic beverages, \u2018the word suffer ... imposes responsibility on a licensee, <em>regardless of knowledge, </em>where there is a failure to prevent the prohibited conduct by those occupying the premises with his authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (ellipses and italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Conversely, other courts, such as those in Colorado, California, New York, and Washington, have held that the terms \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d or \u201callow\u201d require actual or constructive knowledge. In <em>Full Moon Saloon, Inc. v. City of Loveland, </em>the Colorado Court of Appeals held that a statute making it unlawful to, among other things, \u201cpermit the sale, serving, giving, or procuring of any alcohol beverage to or for a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>under the age of twenty-one years\u201d required that \u201csome level of knowledge by the licensee must be established by the evidence.\u201d Ill P.3d 568, 569-70 (Colo.App.2005). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">The word \u201cpermit\u201d connotes affirmative or knowing conduct. Thus, licensees and their employees and agents \u201cpermit\u201d such conduct if they have actual knowledge of the violation or have constructive knowledge that it is occurring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afi\">Our conclusion that constructive knowledge of liquor code violations is sufficient to hold a licensee responsible for permitting the violation is consistent with cases from other jurisdictions. <em>See Spitz v. Mun. Court, </em>127 Ariz. 405, 621 P.2d 911 (1980) (licensee is deemed to have constructive knowledge of the age of underage buyer if licensee provides alcohol to the minor and fails to follow certain procedures); <em>Laube v. Stroh, </em>2 Cal.App.4th 364, 3 Cal.Rptr.2d 779 (1992) (to suspend liquor license, evidence must be presented that licensee had either actual or constructive knowledge of activity); <em>Pinacoteca Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Bus. Regulation, </em>580 So.2d 881 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.[4th DCA]1991) (where activity is persistent and recurring, licensee\u2019s knowledge of the activity may be inferred); <em>State v. Engberg, </em>109 Idaho 530, 708 P.2d 935 (Ct.App.1985) (violation may be found if licensee had constructive knowledge of the prohibited activity); <em>Town &amp; Country Lanes, Inc. v.

Stroh, </em>the Court of Appeal of California \u201ch[e]ld that a licensee must have knowledge, either actual or constructive, before he or she can be found to have \u2018permitted\u2019 unacceptable conduct on a licensed premises.\u201d 2 Cal.App.4th 364, 3 Cal.Rptr.2d 779, 788 (1992). The Court continued: \u201cIt defies logic to charge someone with permitting conduct of which they are not aware.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Court noted that \u201c[failure to prevent the problem from recurring, once the licensee knows of it, is to \u2018permit\u2019 by a failure to take preventive action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Likewise, in <em>Leake, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York noted the following regarding the statutory words \u201csuffer\u201d or \u201cpermit\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">There is no particular mystery or magic in the language of the statute. This court in <em>Matter of Migliaccio v. O\u2019Connell </em>[307 N.Y. 566, 122 N.E.2d 914 (1955)] defined the intent of the statute when it stated that in considering what is implied by the phrase suffer or permit as employed in the statute quoted above, we are guided by what was written for this court (per Cardozo, J.) in <em>People ex rel Price v. Sheffield Farms </em>[225 N.Y. 25, 121 N.E. 474 (1918) ]: Sufferance as here prohibited implies knowledge or the opportunity through reasonable diligence to acquire knowledge. This presupposes in most cases a fair measure at least of continuity and permanence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">358 N.Y.S.2d 749, 315 N.E.2d at 797 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">Finally, in <em>Reeb, </em>the Court of Appeals of Washington held: The word \u201cpermit\u201d as used in the regulation does not imply that the licensee must have permanently sanctioned the prohibited act; it refers to the licensee\u2019s actual or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>structive knowledge of the circumstances which would foreseeably lead to the prohibited activity. Reeb was aware of the propensity of its dancers to engage in questionable conduct and chose nevertheless to maintain topless dancing on its licensed premises. Under these circumstances, the Board could find that Reeb permitted the conduct in violation of [the Liquor Board Rules]. This violation is sufficient to support the 7-day license suspension imposed by the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">600 P.2d at 581 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Considering the plain meaning of the words \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d and \u201callow,\u201d we conclude that the use of those words in Rules 4.17 and 4.18 necessarily require that \u201csome level of knowledge by the licensee must be established by the evidence.\u201d <em>Full Moon Saloon, </em>111 P.3d at 569. As indicated above, the definition of \u201csuffer\u201d expressly states that \u201c[i]t includes knowledge of what is to be done under sufferance.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 1432. The terms \u201cpermit\u201d and \u201callow\u201d also imply knowledge of what is to be permitted or allowed. <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Port Chester v. New York Title Ins. Co., </em>171 Misc. 854, 12 N.Y.S.2d 703, 709 (1939) (\u201cIt has been said that every definition of \u2018suffer\u2019 and \u2018permit\u2019 includes knowledge of what is to be done under the sufferance and permission, and intention that what is done is to be done.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">We are fully cognizant of the strong public policy considerations behind requiring a strict liability standard in the Liquor Board Rules. Unlawful or immoral activities may be associated with places where alcoholic beverages are sold. However, one of the primary purposes of the Liquor Board Rules is to clearly inform licensees of their responsibilities regarding prohibited activities so that they can conform their conduct and the conduct of their businesses to be in compliance with the Rules. Interpreting the words used in the Liquor Board Rules at variance with their plain meaning does not advance the public purpose of achieving compliance with the Rules. Although we are obligated to give deference to the Liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Board\u2019s interpretation of its Rules, <em>see Noland, </em>386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d 1145, \u201c[a]n agency conclusion will not be upheld upon review, however, if based upon an error of law,\u201d <em>Hoyle, </em>115 Md.App. at 129, 692 A.2d 1. Accordingly, we hold that the Liquor Board erred in interpreting the words \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d and \u201callow\u201d in Rules 4.17 and 4.18 to impose a strict liability standard on licensees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">We also hold that the knowledge requirement implicit in the terms \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d and \u201callow\u201d can be satisfied by proof of either actual or constructive knowledge on the part of the licensee. <em>See Full Moon Saloon, </em>111 P.3d at 570. Actual knowledge is, of course, actual awareness of the prohibited activity. Actual knowledge also includes the concept of \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d or \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d <em>See Rice v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 593, 604, 766 A.2d 663 (2001). In <em>State v. McCallum, </em>Judge Chasanow explained the meaning of this form of knowledge in a concurring opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">There is more than one mental state that may constitute \u201cknowledge.\u201d The first and highest form of \u201cknowledge\u201d is actual knowledge, that is, an actual awareness or an actual belief that a fact exists. A second form of \u201cknowledge\u201d is what has often been called \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d or \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>Ch. 7, \u00a7 4 at 687 (1957). The latter form of \u201cknowledge\u201d exists where a person believes that it is probable that something is a fact, but deliberately shuts his or her eyes or avoids making reasonable inquiry with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth. <em>See </em>1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Substantive Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 3.5 at 307 (1986), and authorities cited therein. In <em>United States v. Jewell, </em>532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 3173, 49 L.Ed.2d 1188 (1976), the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>deliberate ignorance or willful blindness form of knowledge has been accepted by leading commentators in the United States and in England. The opinion quoted from Professor Glanville Williams\u2019 <em>Criminal Law: The General Part, </em>\u00a7 57 at 157, 159 (2d ed.1961), as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201cTo the requirement of actual knowledge there is one strictly limited exception.... [T]he rule is that if a party has his suspicion aroused but then deliberately omits to make further enquiries, because he wishes to remain in ignorance, he is deemed to have knowledge____The rule that wilful blindness is equivalent to knowledge is essential, and is found throughout the criminal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">321 Md. 451, 458-59, 583 A.2d 250 (1991) (Chasanow, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Constructive knowledge, however, implies knowledge where a licensee should have known of the prohibited activity if reasonable care and diligence had been exercised. <em>See Leake, </em>358 N.Y.S.2d 749, 315 N.E.2d at 797 (stating that \u201cit must be demonstrated that the licensee had knowledge or the opportunity through reasonable diligence to acquire knowledge of the alleged acts\u201d); <em>Morgan v. Bd. of Water Works of Pueblo, </em>837 P.2d 300, 303 (Colo.App.1992) (stating that, if in the exercise of ordinary diligence a party should have known a fact, it will be deemed to have knowledge).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The Colorado Court of Appeals explained constructive knowledge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">Constructive knowledge may be inferred if the conduct occurs openly, such that a reasonable person would observe it. If knowledge of the prohibited conduct could have been obtained through the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, constructive knowledge may be inferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">Applying a constructive knowledge standard does not place an undue burden on the licensee because constructive knowledge requires only reasonable care and diligence and does not require extraordinary vigilance. Constructive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>knowledge means knowledge that one using reasonable care or diligence should have, and therefore that is attributed by law to a given person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\"><em>Full Moon Saloon, </em>111 P.3d at 570 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Nevertheless, the Liquor Board argues that Rule 4.17 is similar to Rule 4.01(a), which we held in <em>Hoyle </em>to impose strict liability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Rule 4.01(a) provides: \u201cNo licensee shall sell or furnish alcoholic beverages to any person under twenty-one (21) years of age or to any person with the knowledge that such person is purchasing or acquiring such beverages for consumption by any person under twenty-one (21) years of age.\u201d <em>Hoyle, </em>115 Md.App. at 130, 692 A.2d 1. In <em>Hoyle, </em>the Liquor Board ruled that Martini\u2019s Bar had violated Rule 4.01(a) when one of its employees served alcohol to a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 692 A.2d 1. Martini\u2019s Bar appealed, arguing that this Court \u201cshould read a \u2018due caution\u2019 provision into the [R]ule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 692 A.2d 1. We declined to do so, and instead held that the Rule \u201cimposes strict liability for the sale on the licensees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 692 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Our holding in <em>Hoyle </em>is clearly distinguishable from our holding in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Rule 4.01(a), unlike Rule 4.17, does not use the words \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d or \u201callow,\u201d which, as explained above, necessarily include an element of knowledge. Instead, Rule 4.01(a) sets forth a simple directive \u2014 \u201cNo licensee shall sell or furnish ....\u201d, which carries no implication of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Finally, because the word \u201cknowingly\u201d appears in the second independent clause (\u201csecond clause\u201d), and not in the first independent clause (\u201cfirst clause\u201d), of Rule 4.17(b), the Liquor Board claims that such sentence construction necessarily implies a strict liability standard in the first clause. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">To reiterate, Rule 4.17(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>No licensee shall permit or suffer any person to appear in any act or other performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered; nor shall any licensee knowingly permit or suffer his premises to be used for the conduct, exhibition or performance of an obscene act or other performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The first clause clearly identifies the prohibited act \u2014 any person \u201cappearing] ... with breasts or the lower torso uncovered.\u201d On the other hand, the second clause prohibits the performance of an \u201cobscene act or other performance.\u201d In our view, the word \u201cknowingly\u201d appears in the second clause because an element of knowledge is required to constitutionally regulate obscenity, a class of unprotected speech that is not clearly defined in First Amendment jurisprudence. <em>See generally Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 20, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (summarizing \u201cthe somewhat tortured history of the Court\u2019s obscenity decisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the Liquor Board erred in finding that Kougl was guilty of violating Rules 4.17(a), 4.17(b), and 4.18, because there was no evidence that Kougl had actual or constructive knowledge of his employee\u2019s prohibited activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

A licensee, any employee, patron or frequenter may not solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">(b) A licensee may not permit a person to appear in an act or other performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered. A licensee may not knowingly permit the licensed premises to be used for the conduct, exhibition, or any unlawful performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">(c) Section (b) of this rule does not apply to licensees that have a valid adult entertainment license issued by this Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">Rule 4.16 \u2014 Illegal Conduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">A licensee may not commit or allow the commission on the licensed premises of an act that is contrary to any federal, State or local statute, law or ordinance or that is against the public peace, safety, health, welfare, quiet, or morals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">The prior version of Rule 4.17 did not contain a subsection (c) exempting the application of the Rule to licensees with a valid adult entertainment license. There is nothing in the record, nor do the parties contend, that Kougl held a valid adult entertainment license for Club Harem at the time of the violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\">. The existence of \"the VIP\" appears to be the only contested factual finding. In his testimony, Kougl denied that a \"VIP room\u201d existed at Club Harem. According to Det. Jackson, however, Brickhouse never referred to a room, but rather stated that she and Det.
