The product at issue was manufactured and sold to Mr. Stein\u2019s employer, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, by Quigley, Inc., both before and after it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">If Pfizer does not qualify as an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d then it is covered by the \u201cchanneling injunction\u201d issued by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, in addressing Quigley\u2019s petition for Chapter 11 protection, that bars asbestos-related lawsuits against Quigley or Pfizer, such as the one before us, and directs such claims to a trust for consideration and, ultimately, compensation. If, on the other hand, Pfizer satisfies the criteria of such a designation, then Mr. Stein\u2019s family, appellants, may continue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>pursue their products liability claims against Pfizer in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, where this matter was initially filed by Mr. Stein, before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The Baltimore City circuit court resolved this issue, by granting summary judgment in favor of Pfizer, after determining that it did not qualify as an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d We agree and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I. The Stein Family\u2019s Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Carl Stein (the \u201cdecedent\u201d) worked, from 1949 through 1985, as a bricklayer for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its Sparrows Point plant. During his thirty-six years of employment at the Sparrows Point plant, the decedent purportedly used Insulag, an asbestos-containing cement, in the performance of his duties at that facility. After the decedent became ill, from his exposure to asbestos, he brought an action, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, against a number of business entities,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which had sold asbestos-containing materials to Bethlehem Steel, alleging negligence, breach of warranty, strict liability, fraud, and conspiracy. None of these entities is, however, a party to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Then, in April 2012, the decedent, who had, by that time, been diagnosed with mesothelioma, succumbed to that disease. Fifteen months later, in July of 2013, his widow, Harriette Stein, individually, and as the personal representative of his estate, together with his surviving children, Carl B. Stein, Jr.; Mark A. Stein; Robert B. Stein; and Patricia A. Robinson (all of whom we shall collectively refer to as \u201cthe Stein family\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>filed an amended complaint, in the same action, adding Pfizer Inc., the appellee, as a defendant in that suit, as well as several new counts averring loss of consortium and wrongful death. The theory underlying the Stein family\u2019s claims against Pfizer was that the decedent\u2019s exposure to an asbestos-containing refractory cement, called \u201cInsulag,\u201d which was supplied to his employer, Bethlehem Steel, by Pfizer\u2019s subsidiary, Quigley Company, Inc., was a substantial factor in bringing about his illness and resultant death from mesothelioma and that, because Quigley\u2019s invoices and marketing materials also bore Pfizer\u2019s trademarks, as well as its own, and because, in some instances, the words: \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products,\u201d appeared beneath the exhibition of those corporate designations, Pfizer had, in effect, held itself out as a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of Insulag and was therefore liable for the illness and death of Mr. Stein, as an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">II. Quigley\u2019s Relationships with Pfizer and Bethlehem Steel</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Quigley, founded in 1916, manufactured and sold refractory products, that is, products \u201cthat retain their strength at high temperatures,\u201d for use in steel mills, power plants, and refineries. <em>In re Quigley Co., </em>449 B.R. 196, 198 (S.D.N.Y.2011), <em>aff'd, </em>676 F.3d 45, 48, 59 (2d Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Pfizer, Inc. v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2849, 186 L.Ed.2d 908 (2013). One of the products it manufactured and sold, beginning in the 1930\u2019s, was \u201cInsulag,\u201d a heat-resistant cement, which contained asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">In August 1968, Pfizer acquired all of the stock of Quigley, thereby rendering that corporate entity a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. <em>In re Quigley Co., </em>676 F.3d at 47. After its acquisition by Pfizer, Quigley continued to operate as a separate and distinct corporation, designing and manufacturing its products, and maintaining its own sales and distribution network, without any participation by Pfizer in those processes. Yet, its marketing and promotional materials, and its invoices, \u201cbegan to include the Pfizer name, logo, and trademark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Nor did its acquisition by Pfizer affect its relationship with Bethlehem Steel. It continued to directly supply Bethlehem Steel with Insulag, as it had done, periodically, since 1955, regularly shipping that asbestos-containing product to the decedent\u2019s place of employment, Bethlehem Steel\u2019s Sparrows Point plant, until 1974, when Quigley phased out its manufacture of Insulag, in favor of producing \u201cInsulag AF,\u201d a non-asbestos containing cement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">After the decedent became ill, as a result of his purported exposure to asbestos at the plant, he filed suit, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, against Bethlehem Steel and a number of other business entities. During the course of that litigation, he was deposed, and, though he testified in detail as to the products to which he was exposed while working at the Sparrows Point plant, he did not mention \u201cInsulag,\u201d or, for that matter, either Quigley or Pfizer, which is not surprising as, in the complaint he filed, Insulag was not alleged to have been the cause of his illness, and neither Pfizer nor Quigley were named as \u201cdefendants.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, there is no dispute that Insulag was used at the Sparrows Point plant, by bricklayers (such as the decedent), from 1955 to 1974,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which overlapped with the time period, from 1968 to at least the filing of this suit, during which Quigley was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Nor is there any dispute that the decedent worked at that plant throughout the time period when Insulag was being used there, and there is no disagreement that that product was supplied by Quigley.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>III. The Quigley Bankruptcy and the \u201cChanneling Injunction\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u201cAfter the health effects of asbestos became known,\u201d and more than 160,000 asbestos-related suits had been filed against Quigley (approximately 100,000 of which also named \u201cPfizer\u201d as a defendant), Quigley filed, in 2004, a bankruptcy petition, under Title 11 of the United States Code (\u201cChapter 11\u201d), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. <em>In re Quigley Co., supra, </em>449 B.R. at 199. In its petition, Quigley sought court approval of a reorganization plan and, most relevant to the issue before us, \u201can injunction that would stop all asbestos-related lawsuits against itself and Pfizer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">At the outset of those proceedings, the bankruptcy court \u201cpreliminarily enjoined all asbestos-related claims from proceeding against both companies (including those arising from Pfizer\u2019s own products) during the pendency of Quigley\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That injunction was subsequently amended, in accordance -with 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(g),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to channel asbestos-related lawsuits against either Quigley or Pfizer or both to a trust, largely funded by Pfizer, for review and possible compensation of such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The amended injunction (hereafter the \u201cchanneling injunction\u201d) provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">during the pendency of Quigley\u2019s chapter 11 case, all parties ... are hereby stayed, restrained and enjoined from commencing or continuing any legal action against Pfizer alleging that Pfizer is directly or indirectly liable for the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>of, claims against, or demands on Quigley to the extent such alleged liability of Pfizer arises by reason of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">(I) Pfizer\u2019s ownership of a financial interest in Quigley, a past or present affiliate of Quigley, or a predecessor in interest of Quigley;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">(II) Pfizer\u2019s involvement in the management of Quigley or a predecessor in interest of Quigley; or service as an officer, director or employee of Quigley or a related party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">(III) Pfizer\u2019s provision of insurance to Quigley or a related party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">(IV) Pfizer\u2019s involvement in a transaction changing the corporate structure, or in a loan or other financial transaction affecting the financial condition, of Quigley or a related party, including but not limited to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">(aa) involvement in providing financing (debt or equity), or advice to an entity involved in such a transaction; or (bb) acquiring or selling a financial interest in an entity as part of such a transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\"><em>In re Quigley Co., supra, </em>676 F.3d at 48.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Because Pfizer fell \u201cwithin the ring of fire created by asbestos litigation,\u201d <em>In re Quigley Co., 449 </em>B.R. at 202, the \u201cchanneling injunction\u201d at issue, here, covered most, though not all asbestos-related claims against Pfizer, Quigley\u2019s parent company.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">IV. The Scope of the \u201cChanneling Injunction\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">After the \u201cchanneling injunction\u201d was issued by the bankruptcy court, a controversy arose as to its scope when, \u201c[b]e-ginning in 1999,\u201d The Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, PC (the same law firm that represents the Stein family in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>appeal), \u201ccommenced lawsuits in Pennsylvania on behalf of plaintiffs who had been exposed to asbestos-containing products sold by Quigley and Pfizer, including Insulag.\u201d <em>In re Quigley Co., </em>449 B.R. at 199. As in the instant case, the Pennsylvania asbestos claimants alleged that Pfizer was an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of Insulag. And, as does the Stein family here, they claimed that Pfizer, by placing \u201cits logo on Insulag packaging\u201d and on advertisements, had \u201cheld itself out to consumers as a manufacturer of Insulag.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">When, in response, Pfizer filed a motion, requesting that the bankruptcy court enforce the \u201cchanneling injunction\u201d as to those claims, the bankruptcy court granted that motion, holding that the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d claims were enjoined by the \u201cchanneling injunction\u201d and ordering the Angelos law firm to cease its prosecution of all of its \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d lawsuits in Pennsylvania state courts. <em>Id. </em>at 198-200. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York disagreed, however, and reversed that decision, holding that the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d claims did not fall within the scope of the \u201cchanneling injunction.\u201d 449 B.R. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">That decision was, in turn, affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 676 F.3d 45. It avowed that a claim against Pfizer is subject to the \u201cchanneling injunction\u201d only when Pfizer\u2019s alleged liability for \u201cthe conduct of or claims against\u201d Quigley has arisen \u201cas a legal consequence of\u2019 one of the four of the following: \u201c(I) Pfizer\u2019s ownership of a financial interest in Quigley, a past or present affiliate of Quigley, or a predecessor in interest of Quigley\u201d; \u201c(II) Pfizer\u2019s involvement in the management of Quigley or a predecessor in interest of Quigley; or service as an officer, director or employee of Quigley or a related party\u201d; \u201c(III) Pfizer\u2019s provision of insurance to Quigley or a related party\u201d; or \u201c(IV) Pfizer\u2019s involvement in a transaction changing the corporate structure, or in a loan or other financial transaction affecting the financial condition, of Quigley or a related party[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Thus, as the Second Circuit observed, a claim against Pfizer, based upon a product manufactured by Quigley, that seeks the imposition of liability under such legal doctrines as \u201cpiercing the corporate veil,\u201d respondeat superior, or successor liability, is subject to the \u201cchanneling injunction,\u201d as the products liability it alleges \u201carise[s] as a <em>legal </em>consequence\u201d of Pfizer\u2019s ownership, management, or control of Quigley. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 60. But that is not so, declared the Second Circuit, with respect to a claim that Pfizer was an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of a product, actually manufactured by Quigley, because such a claim, explained that court, does not \u201cin any legal sense\u201d depend upon Pfizer\u2019s ownership, management, or control of Quigley. <em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">V. Cross-motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Predictably, the parties herein filed, in the circuit court, cross-motions for summary judgment as to the issue of whether Pfizer was an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of Insulag. The Stein family claimed, in their motion, that Pfizer, as well as Quigley, had \u201cput out the asbestos-containing Insulag to which [the decedent] was exposed\u201d and that, though Quigley was the manufacturer of Insulag, Pfizer qualified as an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of that asbestos-containing cement. Specifically, it cited advertisements and promotional materials for Insulag, as well as invoices, from sales of Insulag, issued by Quigley, from 1968 to 1974, which displayed both Pfizer\u2019s and Quigley\u2019s trademarks and, in some instances, stated, beneath those trademarks: \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products.\u201d That reference to \u201cManufacturers,\u201d maintained the Stein family, was an allusion to both Pfizer and Quigley, and thus established that Pfizer had held itself out as a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of the asbestos-containing Insulag.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Then, as further evidence that Pfizer qualified as an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of Insulag, the Stein family noted that a 1971 end-of-year Pfizer sales report stated the sales price and cost of Pfizer\u2019s annual product sales to Bethlehem Steel (which presumably included sales of Insulag) but contained no mention of Quigley (or, for that matter, Insulag); and that each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>several filings (Forms 10-K), by Pfizer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), during the 1990\u2019s, asserted that \u201c[t]hrough the early 1970\u2019s, Pfizer (Minerals Division) and Quigley Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold a minimal amount of one construction product and several refractory products containing some asbestos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The evidence proffered by Pfizer, and relied upon by the circuit court in granting summary judgment, included the following unrebutted testimonial statements and documents: the deposition testimony of Louis Killian, the former plant manager of Quigley\u2019s New Jersey factory where Insulag was manufactured, stating that, even after Pfizer acquired Quigley, it \u201chad no role in running Quigley\u2019s business\u201d and \u201chad no input whatsoever\u201d; an affidavit of that same individual, asserting that, \u201c[following its acquisition by Pfizer, Quigley continued to operate as a separate and independent corporation, manufacturing, selling, and marketing Insulag as it had done prior to the stock purchase\u201d of its shares by Pfizer; the deposition testimony of Terence Gallagher, a former Pfizer attorney and member of Quigley\u2019s board of directors, stating that Quigley, after its 1968 acquisition by Pfizer, \u201cwas a separate corporation and subsidiary of Pfizer,\u201d that no Quigley employees held positions with Pfizer, and that the only Pfizer employees, who held positions with Quigley, were several high-ranking Pfizer employees who sat on Quigley\u2019s board of directors; the deposition testimony of Susan M. Raterman, C.I.H., an industrial hygienist and an expert witness for the Stein family, stating that, to her knowledge, \u201cQuigley was responsible for manufacturing\u201d Insulag; and the deposition testimony of three Bethlehem Steel employees, who had worked in the Brick Department and were responsible for purchasing the supplies used at the Sparrows Point plant, collectively asserting that Insulag was manufactured and sold by Quigley.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Moreover, in response to the Stein family\u2019s heavy reliance on and repeated references to the phrase: \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products\u201d and its placement on Quigley products beneath the trademarks of both Pfizer and Quigley, Pfizer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>presented an assortment of Quigley invoices and sales brochures, all of which bore dates preceding Quigley\u2019s acquisition by Pfizer, which displayed only the Quigley trademark, and which, nonetheless, stated: \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court, while acknowledging that the \u201cdocuments that have been produced ... do mention both names on the letterhead,\u201d stressed that \u201c[tjhey don\u2019t say anything explicit about the manufacturer other than this phrase \u2018manufacturers of Insulag\u2019 ... which is the logo that ... Quigley had long used,\u201d that is, long before its acquisition by Pfizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The court further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">I don\u2019t think a reasonable person could rely in any way, if that were required, upon Pfizer as the manufacturer ... particularly given [the documents] were provided to sophisticated people involved in the industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The court then declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">I do not believe that a reasonable person under all the circumstances provided to me in this case could come to the conclusion from the documents that Pfizer was the manufacturer of the product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">VI. Motion to Take Judicial Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">During the pendency of this appeal, the Stein family filed, in this Court, a motion, requesting that we exercise our discretion, under Maryland Rule 5-201, and take judicial notice of additional documentary evidence, which, it claims, contradicts Pfizer\u2019s contention that, both before and after its 1968 acquisition of Quigley, the marketing and promotional materials of Quigley included the plural designation: \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products.\u201d We decline to do so, as the Stein family does not claim that it did not have an opportunity to present this evidence below. To do otherwise would run afoul of Maryland Rule 8-131 (a), which confines the scope of our appellate review to matters which were before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>VII. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">A circuit court may grant summary judgment if there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact,\u201d and \u201cthe party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f). In reviewing a circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we must construe all facts, as well as the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from those facts, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, in this case, appellants. <em>May v. Air &amp; Liquid Sys., Inc., </em>446 Md. 1, 8, 129 A.3d 984 (2015). Because a grant of summary judgment is predicated upon a ruling on a question of law and not a dispute of fact, our review is de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">VIII. History of the \u201cApparent Manufacturer\u201d Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Before proceeding any further with our analysis of the issues, we feel impelled to provide an account of the history of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine, tracing its decisional evolution in the context of the successive <em>Restatements </em>issued by the American Law Institute, notably: the <em>Restatement of Torts </em>(\u201cthe <em>First Restatement </em>\u201d), then the <em>Restatement (Second ) of Torts </em>(\u201cthe <em>Second Restatement </em>\u201d), and finally, the <em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability </em>(\u201cthe <em>Third Restatement\u201d). </em>We believe that account will provide some helpful assistance in understanding the development and current nature and scope of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine and thereby provide guidance in addressing the central question of this appeal: whether Pfizer was an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of Insulag.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">References to what was to become known as the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine first appeared in judicial decisions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the early twentieth century. By the 1930\u2019s, this doctrine had gained enough notoriety that it was included in the 1934 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>publication of the <em>First Restatement, </em>as Section 400, under the rubric: &lt;cVendor Selling as His Own Product Chattel Made by Another.\u201d It asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">One who puts out as his own product a chattel manufactured by another is subject to the same liability as though he were its manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7 400 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">That articulation of what was to be dubbed the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine confined the application of that doctrine to just sellers and distributors of goods or, in other words, only to those in the chain of distribution of the product in question, a constraint reaffirmed by comment a to that section, which defined, \u201cone who puts out a chattel,\u201d as \u201cany one who supplies it to others for their own use or for the use of third persons, either by sale or lease or by gift or loan.\u201d And a central feature of that doctrine, though unexpressed in the body of Section 400, was, according to comment c to Section 400 of the <em>First Restatement, </em>a buyer\u2019s reliance upon the care taken by the seller, who puts out a product as if it were his own. As that comment explained: \u201cBy putting a chattel out as his own product,\u201d a seller \u201ccauses it to be used in reliance upon his care in making it\u201d and, consequently, is liable, as an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d if, \u201cbecause of some negligence in its fabrication or through lack of proper inspection during the process of manufacture, the article is in a dangerously defective condition which the vendor could not discover after it was delivered to him.\u201d Or, as it was more succinctly put by the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in a decision which cited a \u201cTentative Draft\u201d of what would later become Section 400 of the <em>First Restatement, </em>a seller, by \u201cputting out a chattel as his own product\u201d and thereby \u201cinducting] reliance,\u201d by the purchasing public, \u201cupon his care in making it,\u201d is estopped from denying his identity as its manufacturer. <em>Burkhardt v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>115 Conn. 249, 161 A. 385, 391 (1932) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The appellate decisions rendered during the early years of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine either expressly or impliedly employed an objective \u201creliance\u201d test, in determining whether an individual or entity should be deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d for liability purposes. That is, the test was whether a reasonable consumer would have relied upon a business\u2019s label or advertising materials in purchasing the product at issue. <em>See, e.g., Swift &amp; Co. v. Blackwell, </em>84 F.2d 130, 132 (4th Cir.1936); <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. Hawkins, </em>174 Miss. 253, 164 So. 231, 231-32 (1935); <em>Slavin v. Francis H. Leggett &amp; Co., </em>114 N.J.L. 421, 177 A. 120, 121 (N.J.Sup.Ct.1935); <em>Burkhardt, supra, </em>161 A. at 391; <em>Thornhill v. Carpenter-Morton Co., </em>220 Mass. 593, 108 N.E. 474, 491 (1915); <em>Willson v. Faxon, Williams &amp; Faxon, </em>208 N.Y. 108, 101 N.E. 799, 800-01 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">And, at least one federal appellate court took \u201creliance\u201d a step further and promulgated an \u201cactual reliance\u201d test. Under that test, a claimant must show not only that it was reasonable to rely upon the seller\u2019s representation that it was the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of the defective product at issue but that he or she \u201cactually\u201d did so. <em>Carney v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>309 F.2d 300, 304 (4th Cir.1962) (applying Virginia law) (stating that \u201cthe basic test is whether or not the vendee reasonably believed in and relied upon the vendor\u2019s apparent manufacture of the product\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">It is important to keep in mind, however, that, when the <em>First Restatement </em>was published, setting forth the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine, products liability law, at that time, differed from its current manifestation in two significant respects: First, actual manufacturers of defective products and mere non-manufacturing sellers of those products were not generally subject to the same tort rules; and, second, the doctrine of strict liability had not yet gained much currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Indeed, at the time that the <em>First Restatement </em>was issued, a non-manufacturing seller of a defective product was usually (unless deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d) held to a lesser duty than the manufacturer of that commodity. The general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>rule, then, was that, in the \u201cabsence of misrepresentation or of negligence in the selection of goods, an intermediate distributor [was] liable to a customer only for defects discoverable upon reasonable inspection, unless he ha[d] represented that he was the actual manufacturer[.]\u201d <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. Blackwell, supra, </em>84 F.2d at 132. If he had, the <em>First Restatement </em>imposed a greater duty on him than the duty placed on a non-manufacturing seller or distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In other words, while an actual manufacturer of a chattel had a duty to warn potential users of any danger that might arise from its intended use, <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 388, 394,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a non-manufacturing seller or distributor of that chattel generally did not. And, although an actual manufacturer had a duty \u201cto exercise reasonable care in the manufacture of a chattel which, unless carefully made,\u201d presented \u201can unreasonable risk of causing substantial bodily harm\u201d to its user, <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7 395, a non-manufacturing seller or distributor of that chattel generally had no such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">But, when a non-manufacturing seller or distributor of a chattel was deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d under Section 400 of the <em>First Restatement, </em>such a person or entity was held to the same duty of care borne by the actual manufacturer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The scope of that liability was not, yet, however, extend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ed to trademark licensors or other non-sellers. That extension did not occur until the 1970\u2019s, when, for the first time, trademark licensors were held to be, under certain circumstances, \u201capparent manufacturers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Furthermore, at the time of the <em>First Restatement, </em>unlike today, tort liability of the supplier of a defective chattel, whether the supplier was an actual manufacturer, a non-manufacturing seller, or an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d was predicated upon proof of some negligent act. <em>See Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 394-398. In instances where an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d had not, itself, committed a negligent act, the plaintiff, in a tort-based products liability action, had to prove that someone in the distribution chain, typically the actual manufacturer, was negligent, as a prerequisite to the imposition of liability on an \u201capparent manufacturer.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">When, in 1965, the <em>Restatement </em>(Second) <em>of Torts </em>(\u201cthe <em>Second Restatement </em>\u201d) was issued, it included a revised Section 400, which was nearly identical to its predecessor, Section 400 of the First <em>Restatement. </em>Comment d to Section 400 of the <em>Second Restatement, </em>in expounding upon the reliance-based rationale for the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine, which had been set forth in the <em>First Restatement, </em>explained that an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d \u201cfrequently\u201d induces consumer reliance in two ways: by causing a chattel \u201cto be used in reliance upon his care in making it\u201d; and by causing a chattel \u201cto be used in reliance upon a belief that he has required it to be made properly for him and that the actor\u2019s reputation is an assurance to the user of the quality of the product.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 400, cmt. d (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">While leaving largely undisturbed the explication of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine that appeared in the <em>First Restatement, </em>the <em>Second Restatement </em>broke new ground by adding Section 402A, entitled \u201cSpecial Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm to User or Consumer,\u201d to its text, which extended the liability of sellers by prescribing a doctrine of strict liability as to those in the chain of distribution. Specifically, it stated that \u201c[o]ne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property\u201d was liable for any physical harm caused by that condition to \u201cthe ultimate user or consumer, or to his property,\u201d even when \u201cthe seller ha[d] exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Or, as expressed in comment f to Section 402A, strict liability \u201capplies to any person engaged in the business of selling products for use or consumption,\u201d including \u201cany manufacturer of such a product\u201d as well as \u201cany wholesale or retail dealer or distributor.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>(Second) <em>of Torts, </em>\u00a7 402A, cmt. f.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">During the decade that followed the publication of the <em>Second Restatement, </em>most state appellate courts that addressed this issue<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> adopted the strict liability doctrine of Section 402A. Those states were joined by Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals, in <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 346, 352-53, 363 A.2d 955 (1976), where our highest Court adopted both Section 402A and its \u201cofficial comments\u201d as part of Maryland common law. Thereafter, in all jurisdictions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>had adopted Section 402A (including Maryland), strict products liability was imposed on all entities in the distribution chain of a defective product, from the manufacturer to the retail seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">That development, some courts and commentators believed, called into question whether the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine retained any relevance, since the strict liability of Section 402A appeared to now \u201cprovide a remedy for consumers injured by unsafe products,\u201d which was the \u201caim\u201d of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine. <em>Hebel v. Sherman Equip., </em>92 Ill.2d 368, 65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d 199, 202 (1982); <em>see </em>David G. Owen and Mary J. Davis, 2 <em>Owens &amp; Davis on Products Liability, </em>\u00a7 16:15, at 636 (4th ed.2014).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">But, in the years following the widespread adoption of strict products liability, the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine did not fall into desuetude. In fact, state and federal courts began to apply that doctrine to entities outside the chain of distribution of defective products, such as trademark licensors.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In so doing, those courts frequently relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>comment d to Section 400 of the <em>Second Restatement, </em>which first appeared as a 1948 revision to the <em>First Restatement. </em>It provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">The actor puts out a chattel as his own product in two types of cases. The first is where the actor appears to be the manufacturer of the chattel. The second is where the chattel appears to have been made particularly for the actor. In the first type of case the actor frequently causes the chattel to be used in reliance upon his care in making it; in the second, he frequently causes the chattel to be used in reliance upon a belief that he has required it to be made properly for him and that the actor\u2019s reputation is an assurance to the user of the quality of the product.... Thus, one puts out a chattel as his own product when he puts it out under his name or affixes to it his trade name or trademark. When such identification is referred to on the label as an indication of the quality or wholesomeness of the chattel, there is an added emphasis that the user can rely upon the reputation of the person so identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\"><em>Restatement </em>(Second) <em>of Torts, </em>\u00a7 400 cmt. d (emphasis added). In sum, comment d seemingly imposed \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d liability on one who \u201caffixes to [a defective product] his trade name or trademark,\u201d regardless of whether that individual or entity played no role in the manufacture or distribution of that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Thereafter, judicial decisions considering the applicability of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine, under Section 400 of the <em>Second Restatement, </em>to trademark licensors fell \u201croughly into three categories\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>: (1) decisions \u201cholding that a non[-]seller trademark licensor could be held liable as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>apparent manufacturer if it exercised substantial control over the production of the product\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>; (2) decisions \u201cholding that a non[-]seller trademark licensor may be held liable as an apparent manufacturer, despite having had little or no participation in the design or manufacture of a product, by reason of the likelihood that buyers or users of the product would rely on the trademark as an assurance of the product\u2019s quality\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; and (3) decisions \u201cwhich declined to hold trademark licensors liable under the apparent manufacturer doctrine in circumstances in which they had little or no involvement in the design or manufacture of the product.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As we shall see, in the following subsection of this opinion, application of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine to trademark licensors led to the development of an alternative test, for determining whether a non-selling defendant should be deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d in a products liability action, namely, the \u201centerprise liability\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In 1998, the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine was presented, in a slightly modified form, in the <em>Restatement </em>(Third) <em>of Torts: Products Liability </em>(hereinafter \u201cthe <em>Third Restatement </em>\u201d), in Section 14, which is entitled \u201cSelling or Distributing as One\u2019s Own a Product Manufactured by Another.\u201d That section states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">One engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing products who sells or distributes as its own a product manufactured by another is subject to the same liability as though the seller or distributor were the product\u2019s manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The authors of the <em>Third Restatement </em>acknowledged that the adoption of strict liability, in the years following the publication of the <em>Second Restatement, </em>called into question the continued vitality of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">[a]fter inclusion of \u00a7 402A in the Restatement, Second, imposing strict liability on all commercial sellers of defective products for harm caused by product defects, it was questionable whether \u00a7 400 remained relevant in the context of products liability. Once \u00a7 402A imposed strict liability on all product sellers it made little, if any, difference whether the seller of a defective product was a retailer or a manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-9\"><em>Restatement </em>(Third) <em>of Torts: Products Liability, </em>\u00a7 14, cmt. a (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Nonetheless, comment c to Section 14, largely echoing the comments to Section 400 of the <em>First </em>and <em>Second Restatements,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which we have previously discussed, appeared to retain the rationale, if not the test, of \u201cconsumer reliance,\u201d as to non-manufacturing sellers of defective products. Comment c to Section 14 provides that, when \u201ca commercial seller sells a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>product manufactured by another under its own trademark or logo, the seller is liable as though it were the manufacturer of the product\u201d because \u201cthe seller is presumed to cause the product to be used or consumed, in part at least, in reliance on the seller,\u201d or, in other words, the \u201cseller\u2019s reputation is an implied assurance of the quality of the product[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Recognizing, however, that some courts had begun to apply the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine to entities outside the chain of distribution of defective products, the drafters of the <em>Third Restatement </em>attempted to clarify, in comment d to Section 14, when non-sellers, specifically trademark licensors, may be held liable for defective products, under an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\"><em>d. Liability of trademark licensors. </em>The rule stated in this Section does not, by its terms, apply to the owner of a trademark who licenses a manufacturer to place the licensor\u2019s trademark or logo on the manufacturer\u2019s product and distribute it as though manufactured by the licensor. In such a case, even if purchasers of the product might assume that the trademark owner was the manufacturer, the licensor does not \u201csell or distribute as its own a product manufactured by another.\u201d Thus, the manufacturer may be liable under \u00a7\u00a7 l-4,[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] but the licensor, who does not sell or otherwise distribute products, is not liable under this Section of this Restatement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">Trademark licensors are liable for harm caused by defective products distributed under the licensor\u2019s trademark or logo when they participate substantially in the design, manufacture, or distribution of the licensee\u2019s products. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>In these circumstances they are treated as sellers of the products bearing their trademarks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">A cursory reading of comment d could easily lead to the mistaken conclusion that it has abandoned \u201creliance,\u201d either as a rationale underlying the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine or as a test for determining its applicability to a particular defendant. Because, however, the very premise of comment d is its applicability to trademark licensors, that comment, by implication, incorporates \u201creliance,\u201d to a limited extent. For, as has long been recognized, consumers have come \u201cto rely more and more upon trademarks and tradenames as symbols of quality and guaranties of satisfaction.\u201d Frank I. Schechter, <em>The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, </em>40 Harv. L.Rev. 813, 824 (Apr.1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Consumer reliance upon trademarks as symbols of product quality, in turn, supplies the underlying rationale for imposition of \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d liability on what is, after all, a class of non-selling defendants, that is, trademark licensors. As one commentator has explained it, the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine, as applied to trademark licensors, \u201cfocuses on what the trademark owner did to induce consumers to believe that the trademark owner actually manufactured the goods in question and purchase those goods in reliance on this specific belief.\u201d David J. Franklyn, <em>The Apparent Manufacturer Doctrine, Trademark Licensors and the Third Restatement of Torts, </em>49 Case W. Res. L.Rev. 671, 693 (Summer, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">But, while comment d has not abandoned the \u201creliance\u201d rationale underlying the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine, it does represent a shift \u201caway from the earlier emphasis on a consumer\u2019s reliance on the presence of a trademark as indicative of \u2018an assurance of quality,\u2019 in favor of an approach that focuses on whether the trademark owner in fact actively worked to assure the quality of the trademarked product.\u201d Erin K. Higgins, <em>What\u2019s in a Name? Possibly, Strict Liability as an Apparent Manufacturer, </em>78 Def. Couns. J. 355, 359 (July 2011). Its test, for determining whether a trademark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>licensor should be deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d focuses on the licensor\u2019s participation \u201cin the design, manufacture, or distribution of the licensee\u2019s products\u201d and is predicated on what has been designated the \u201centerprise liability\u201d test, according to which \u201ca trademark licensor may be held vicariously liable for the torts of its licensee if the licensor is a \u2018significant participant\u2019 in the overall enterprise that places a defective product into the stream of commerce.\u201d Franklyn, <em>supra, </em>at 706. It thereby focuses \u201calmost entirely on the licensor\u2019s control over, or involvement in, its licensee\u2019s affairs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">IX. The Tests for Determining Whether an Entity is an \u201cApparent Manufacturer\u201d and Their Application to the Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">As our review of the history of the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine has shown, three tests for determining whether an entity may be found to be an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d have emerged from the caselaw: \u201cobjective\u201d reliance test, \u201cactual\u201d reliance test, and what has been described as the \u201centerprise liability\u201d test, as set forth in comment d to Section 14 of the <em>Third Restatement. </em>Unfortunately, the only two Maryland decisions, <em>Armour &amp; Co. v. Leasure, </em>177 Md. 393, 9 A.2d 572 (1939), and <em>Telak v. Maszczenski, </em>248 Md. 476, 237 A.2d 434 (1968), that address the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d doctrine do not designate a specific test to be applied.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But, on the other hand, no matter which of the three tests we employ, we reach the same result: Pfizer cannot be deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of Insulag, under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>A. \u201cObjective\u201d Reliance Test</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">A majority of state and federal appellate courts that have considered this question have applied an objective test in determining reliance, that is, whether a reasonable consumer would have relied upon a label or advertising materials of a product in purchasing it. An early statement of this test appeared in <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. Blackwell, supra, </em>84 F.2d at 132, where the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a wholesaler of a defective can of evaporated milk was liable as an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d because \u201cthe average reader would certainly conclude from a perusal of the label that the goods in the can were the product of\u2019 the wholesaler. <em>See also Burkhardt, supra, </em>161 A. at 391 (upholding trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe ordinary, reasonable person reading this label would have inferred that Armour &amp; Co. was the packer of the product\u201d); <em>accord Hebel v. Sherman Equip., supra, </em>65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d 199 (1982); <em>Markel v. Spencer, </em>5 A.D.2d 400, 171 N.Y.S.2d 770 (1958); <em>Chapman Chemical Co. v. Taylor, for use and benefit of Wilson, </em>215 Ark. 630, 222 S.W.2d 820 (1949); <em>Commn\u2019rs of State Ins. Fund v. City Chem. Corp., </em>290 N.Y. 64, 48 N.E.2d 262 (1943); <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. Hawkins, supra, </em>164 So. 231 (1935); <em>Slavin v. Francis H. Leggett &amp; Co., supra, </em>177 A. 120 (N.J.Sup.Ct.1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In applying the \u201cobjective\u201d reliance test to the facts of the instant case, we must consider the question whether, in doing so, we should view reliance from the vantage point of an ordinary, reasonable consumer or from the perspective of a reasonable purchaser, in the position of the actual purchaser. As there are no Maryland appellate decisions directly on point, we turn to the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois, in <em>Hebel v. Sherman Equipment, supra, </em>65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d 199, for assistance, as it involved a very similar set of circumstances. That Illinois case, like the case before us, dealt with the purchase of a defective product by a commercial entity and not by a consumer, which factually distinguishes it, and the instant case, from the vast majority of \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d cases. That, of course, is not surprising because, as the Illinois Supreme Court observed, the \u201capparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>manufacturer\u201d doctrine \u201cwas developed in the context of suits by consumers against sellers of dangerous chattels,\u201d and \u201c[nearly all the cases imposing liability on this basis involved] defendants who were retailers or distributors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Rohn Hebei was sixteen years old when, while working at the Glenwood Standard Service Station and Car Wash, his foot was caught in a \u201cconveyor,\u201d a component of the service station\u2019s car-washing apparatus. He subsequently brought a products liability suit against Sherman Industries, Inc., a manufacturer of automatic car-washing machinery (which we shall hereafter refer to as \u201cSherman Equipment\u201d), alleging that the \u201ccar washing machine,\u201d at the Glenwood station, had been \u201cdesigned, manufactured and sold by Sherman [Equipment] and that it was in a defective and unreasonably dangerous condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Glenwood station had, in fact, purchased all of its car-washing equipment from a distributor of automotive cleaning machinery, Haverberg Auto Laundry Equipment Company. That company, in turn, had obtained \u201cnearly all\u201d of its equipment from Sherman Equipment (whose products it regularly distributed), except for the \u201cconveyor\u201d at issue, which it had, itself, designed and manufactured. <em>Id. </em>65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d at 200-01. As it was undisputed that Sherman Equipment did not manufacture the defective conveyor, Hebei claimed that, since all of the other car-washing equipment prominently displayed Sherman Equipment\u2019s trade name and trademark, it should be deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of the entire apparatus, including the defective conveyor. <em>Id. </em>65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of Illinois found that Sherman Equipment was not an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of the purportedly defective conveyor as it had not held itself out to the public \u201cas the manufacturer of Haverberg\u2019s conveyor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>65 Ill.Dec. 888, 442 N.E.2d at 203. The \u201cprimary rationale for imposing liability on the apparent manufacturer of a defective product,\u201d explained the Illinois court, \u201cis that it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>induced the <em>purchasing public </em>to believe that it is the actual manufacturer, and to act on this belief \u2014 that is, <em>to purchase the product in reliance </em>on the apparent manufacturer\u2019s reputation and skill in making it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Restatement (Second </em>) <em>of Torts, </em>\u00a7 400 cmt. d). Therefore, \u201cwhether a holding out has occurred must be judged from the viewpoint of the purchasing public, and in light of circumstances as of the time of purchase,\u201d declared that court. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Illinois\u2019s highest court, consequently, rejected the claim that the proper frame of reference was a \u201creasonable person in [Hebei\u2019s] position,\u201d observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">It is clear, and [Hebei] does not seriously dispute, that the various car-washing machines made by Sherman [Equipment], as well as the conveyor made by Haverberg, were individual pieces of equipment which were purchased and sold as separate items, and apparently also were operated independently of one another. That a casual observer, viewing the machines after their purchase and installation, might think otherwise does not mean that a reasonable purchaser of car-washing equipment, such as Glen-brook, would rely on such an impression.....The mere fact that [Sherman Equipment\u2019s] machines, which bore its name, were sold by Haverberg and used by Glenbrook in conjunction with a separate, unlabeled piece of equipment does not, we think, identify Sherman [Equipment] in the mind of the reasonable purchaser as the maker of the unlabeled machine, or render Sherman [Equipment] liable for injuries caused by it under the apparent-manufacturer rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Applying the sound reasoning of <em>Hebei, </em>we conclude that, to prevail in this case, under the \u201cobjective\u201d reliance test, the Stein family must show that a reasonable purchaser of refractory materials, that is, Bethlehem Steel, during the time period from 1968 to 1974, would have relied upon Pfizer\u2019s reputation and assurances of quality in purchasing the refractory material at issue, namely, Insulag. \u201cThat a casual ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>server\u201d might have believed that Pfizer was the manufacturer of Insulag \u201chas no bearing on the issue\u201d before us.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It is clear that, under the \u201cobjective\u201d reliance test, the Stein family\u2019s claim fails. Given that Bethlehem Steel was unquestionably a sophisticated purchaser of Insulag and that Insulag was not a consumer product, we believe that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that a reasonable person, in the position of a Bethlehem Steel purchasing manager during the period from 1968 through 1974, who had purchased Insulag for decades from Quigley, could have purchased Insulag in reliance upon Pfizer\u2019s reputation and assurances of quality. Rather, it is manifest that Bethlehem Steel knew, at all relevant times, that it was purchasing Insulag from Quigley, not Pfizer. <em>See Telak, supra, </em>248 Md. at 487, 237 A.2d 434 (holding that, where the identity of the actual manufacturer of a product was \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d a wholesale distributor of that product cannot be deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">B. Actual Reliance Test</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">At least one court, in determining whether a defendant is an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d has applied an \u201cactual reliance\u201d test, under which a plaintiff must prove that he or she actually and reasonably relied upon the reputed \u201capparent manufacturer\u2019s\u201d trademark, reputation, or assurances of product quality, in purchasing the defective product at issue. <em>Carney v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>309 F.2d 300, 304 (4th Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Because, in <em>Carney, </em>the plaintiff was also the purchaser of the defective product at issue, the appellate court did not have to consider whether it is the plaintiffs actual reliance or the purchaser\u2019s that is dispositive. In the instant case, regardless of whether we apply the \u201cactual reliance\u201d test from the perspective of the plaintiff (that is, the user) or the wholesale purchaser, the end result is the same. If we assume that it is the user\u2019s perspective that governs, then, given the total absence of any mention, by the decedent in his 1987 deposition testimony, of any use of or exposure to Insulag, or any mention whatsoever of Pfizer, it is clear that there was no reliance by the decedent sufficient to deem Pfizer the \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">If, on the other hand, we assume that the purchaser\u2019s perspective governs the application of the \u201cactual reliance\u201d test, then the Stein family\u2019s claim fares no better, as the only evidence establishes that Bethlehem Steel had purchased Insulag directly from Quigley for many years before its acquisition by Pfizer and that, after that corporate acquisition, it continued to do so without interruption. Nor was any evidence adduced that Bethlehem Steel actually relied upon Pfizer\u2019s trademark, reputation, or assurances of quality, in deciding to purchase Insulag, and therefore, the Stein family\u2019s \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d claim must fail, regardless of whose \u201creliance\u201d we focus on.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">C. \u201cEnterprise Liability\u201d Test</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">A few courts have not appeared to require that a plaintiff, raising an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d claim, show any reliance upon the defendant\u2019s reputation or assurances of quality, applying instead the \u201centerprise liability\u201d test, that is, whether the defendant \u201cparticipate[d] substantially in the design, manufacture, or distribution\u201d of the defective product at issue, <em>Restatement {Third) of Torts: Products Liability, </em>\u00a7 14, cmt. d, provided, of course, that the defendant\u2019s trademark appeared on that product.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Lou v.

In the instant case, there was no trademark licensing agreement between Pfizer and Quigley, and thus, it would appear that the \u201centerprise liability\u201d test is inapplicable. But even if their relationship were deemed analogous to that between a trademark licensor and its licensee, given that, once Pfizer had acquired Quigley and, thereafter, throughout the relevant time period, from 1968 to 1974, Pfizer\u2019s trademark appeared on advertisements and promotional materials for Insulag, as well as invoices, from sales of Insulag, issued by Quigley, Pfizer would not qualify as an \u201capparent manufacturer,\u201d under that test, because there is no evidence that it participated \u201csubstantially\u201d in the design, manufacture, or distribution of Insulag. According to the \u201centerprise liability\u201d test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">Trademark licensors are liable for harm caused by defective products distributed under the licensor\u2019s trademark or logo when they participate substantially in the design, manufacture, or distribution of the licensee\u2019s products. In these circumstances they are treated as sellers of the products bearing their trademarks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability, </em>\u00a7 14, cmt. d.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The Stein family asserts that the invoices and promotional materials, issued by Quigley after its acquisition by Pfizer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>indicating that both Pfizer and Quigley were \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products,\u201d create a jury question of whether Pfizer participated \u201csubstantially\u201d in the distribution of Insulag and that, indeed, we should regard Pfizer as a seller of that asbestos-containing product. They attempt to bolster that assertion with the observation that, after Pfizer\u2019s acquisition of Quigley, certain Pfizer sales reports and Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) filings included information regarding Quigley\u2019s sales of Insulag.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Although Pfizer\u2019s trademark appeared on Quigley\u2019s invoices and promotional materials, no evidence was presented that Pfizer participated \u201csubstantially [or for that matter, at all] in the design, manufacture, or distribution of\u2019 Insulag. For one thing, the Stein family\u2019s assertion that the description, \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products,\u201d on Quigley\u2019s invoices and promotional materials, in combination with the depiction of both Quigley\u2019s and Pfizer\u2019s trademarks, suggests that Pfizer was holding itself out as a manufacturer of Insulag, is refuted by the simple observation that, before its acquisition by Pfizer, Quigley issued substantially similar documents, with only its own trademark, but nonetheless stated: \u201cManufacturers of Refractory Products.\u201d Moreover, the invoices and promotional materials indicated no more than that Quigley was a subsidiary of Pfizer, and, as for the reports and SEC filings, it would be expected that a corporate parent would account for the sales of its subsidiaries, and, indeed, Pfizer was legally obligated to do so in its SEC filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">All of the other evidence indicates, however, that, both before and after its acquisition by Pfizer, Quigley manufactured and designed Insulag and sold it to Bethlehem Steel, without any significant participation by Pfizer. That evidence established that Quigley shipped that product directly to Bethlehem Steel, that Pfizer did not design, manufacture, or distribute Insulag, and that Insulag was manufactured by Quigley long before its acquisition by Pfizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Finally, even after construing all of the facts, as well as the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from those facts, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>a light most favorable to the Stein family, <em>May v. Air &amp; Liquid Sys., Inc., supra, </em>446 Md. at 8, 129 A.3d 984, we conclude that the Stein family has failed to make its case that, under any of the three aforementioned tests, Pfizer should be deemed an \u201capparent manufacturer\u201d of Insulag.

Sections 1 through 4 of the <em>Third Restatement </em>set forth the general rules of products liability. Although it is not directly relevant to this case, we feel impelled to note that the Court of Appeals has expressly disapproved Section 2 and has declined to adopt it as the law of Maryland, choosing instead to retain Section 402A of the <em>Second Restatement, </em>including its \u201cconsumer expectations\u201d test, in all strict products liability actions in Maryland. <em>Halliday v.

And, in <em>Telak v.

But we hasten to add that, in an \"apparent manufacturer\" case involving a consumer product, the rule enunciated in the instant case becomes, as a practical matter, merely a question of whether an ordinary, reasonable consumer purchaser would have relied upon a reputed \"apparent manufacturer\u2019s\u201d reputation and assurances of quality in deciding whether to purchase the product at issue. The rule, in the instant case, is different precisely because the product at issue was not a consumer product, that is, a product \"used or bought for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d Md.Code (1975, 2013 Repl.VoL), Commercial Law Article, \u00a7 9-102(23).

We note that, more than thirty years after the decision in <em>Bathory </em>was rendered, the Supreme Court of Michigan declined \"to supplement [its] current products liability jurisprudence with the apparent-manufacturer doctrine.\u201d <em>Seasword v.

We make one additional observation regarding the \"enterprise liability\u201d test. Several of the cases, cited by the <em>Lou </em>Court, supporting that test, 933 N.E.2d at 147, did not actually consider, expressly or impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>edly, the \"apparent manufacturer\" doctrine, in holding that trademark licensors could be strictly liable for defective products, which bore their trademarks, provided that those licensors were substantially involved in placing such products into the stream of commerce. See, e.g., <em>Torres v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>163 Ariz. 88, 786 P.2d 939, 945 (1990) (imposing liability on trademark licensor, under \"enterprise liability\u201d theory, reasoning that \"the brain that so competently and thoroughly directs the entire enterprise must be liable for the acts of its appendages\u201d); <em>Kasel v.
