The court also granted Wife use and possession of the family home for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">On appeal, Wife challenges the court\u2019s factual findings as to her potential income, the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining the amount and duration of alimony, and the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining the time limit for use and possession of the family home. Although we leave many of the court\u2019s findings and rulings undisturbed, we vacate the judgment in part and remand so that the court may re-evaluate the alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">A. <em>The Marriage and its Demise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The parties to this case were married in 1994. Before the marriage, Wife worked as an assistant branch manager at a surety company, earning around $45,000 per year. She stopped working in 1995, upon the birth of the family\u2019s first child, a daughter. Another daughter was born in 1997, followed by a son in 1999. Wife served as primary caregiver to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">During most of the marriage, Husband served as the family\u2019s sole wage earner. In the first year of the marriage, he earned less than Wife. His income gradually increased as his career in sales and distribution progressed. In 2000, Husband started working in a management position.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">During the marriage, Husband and Wife consumed nearly all of their household income, saving little. They lived in a house that tested the extent of their means.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2004, they nearly lost the home to foreclosure. Wife did not return to work at that time. Instead, Husband sold the house to a lender, rented it from the lender for two years, and repurchased it at a substantially higher price. When he fell delinquent on mortgage payments again in 2010, he negotiated a loan modification that allowed him to make payments at a temporary interest rate of two percent, subject to sharp annual increases beginning in March 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In 2009, Wife was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. She underwent chemotherapy and bone marrow extraction, and her cancer went into remission. Husband provided little emotional support during this time of medical need.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">In the fall of 2011 at the latest, Husband started an extramarital affair. Wife learned of the relationship, but agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>attempt to reconcile with Husband after he denied that the relationship was sexual. For several months, Husband lived in the family home on many nights, while secretly spending other nights with another woman at an apartment that he had rented.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Wife eventually learned of her husband\u2019s deception. In September 2012, the parties separated permanently. Husband did not return to the family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">B. <em>The Divorce Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\"><em>On </em>July 1, 2013, Husband filed a complaint for absolute divorce in the Circuit Court for Harford County. He asked the court to grant him sole legal custody and shared physical custody of the parties\u2019 minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Wife counterclaimed for divorce, sole legal custody and primary physical custody of the minor children, alimony, child support, equitable division of marital property, use and possession of the family home and family-use personal property, and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Adopting a master\u2019s report and recommendation, the circuit court issued a pendente lite order that granted Wife use and possession of the family home and required Husband to continue paying the mortgage (approximately $2,850 per month). In addition, the order required Husband to pay alimony and child support for the two minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Wife later amended and supplemented her pleadings, asking the court to transfer title of the family home to her and to declare the couples\u2019 oldest child to be a destitute adult child for support purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">C. <em>Trial in the Circuit Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The court heard the case on five trial days between September 22, 2014, and October 6, 2014. Much of the testimony concerned the parties\u2019 financial circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">At the time of trial, Husband was 46 years old with an extensive work history. He earned in excess of $200,000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>annual salary and bonuses in an executive or management position. On the other hand, Wife, at the age of 47, had not been employed for nearly two decades. A central issue was whether she was capable of re-entering the workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Husband testified that Wife had decided that she did not want to return to work after the birth of their first child and that he had supported that decision while the children were young. According to Husband, he asked his wife to contribute financially when they faced the threat of foreclosure in 2004, but she maintained that she was \u201cnever going back to work.\u201d He testified that, at other times when he brought up the possibility of bringing a second income to the household, she would respond that there was \u201cno way\u201d that she would resume working. He admitted that his wife sometimes slept excessively when she was experiencing health problems during the later years of the marriage. He had observed that she had always been able to wake up in the morning \u201cif she needed to\u201d to attend to the needs of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">According to Wife, she and her husband mutually decided that she would be a stay-at-home mother so that the family could follow Husband\u2019s career path. During cross-examination, Wife stated that she believed that Husband should continue to bear sole financial responsibility for the family after the separation: \u201cThat is what we signed up for.... That is his responsibility!.]\u201d She added: \u201cFrom the very onset of the marriage, the agreement that Mark and I set forth was Mark would be the person who was the breadwinner in the family, that was extremely clear, and I would be the one raising the children.\u201d When counsel asked more specifically about her future expectations of support, she answered: \u201cI expect Mark to fulfill the duties that he said that he would twenty years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Regarding her physical condition, Wife testified that she began to experience chronic fatigue around 2007. At the time of her cancer diagnosis in 2009, she also tested positive for mononucleosis, which she characterized as \u201cthe cause of the fatigue.\u201d Wife testified that, after learning of her husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>affair, she underwent therapy at the instructions of her doctors. She reported that she was currently taking an antidepressant, a mood stabilizer, thyroid medication, and blood pressure medication. She stated that her cancer was in remission at the time, but that she suffered from neuropathy in her hands and feet as a result of her chemotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">At the time of trial, Wife did not believe that she would be able to resume employment. She said that she was still physically weak and continued to experience episodes of depression. Regarding her daily functioning, she stated: \u201cI have to pace myself. I know I can\u2019t go out for twelve hours in a day. I know I can\u2019t do a ten hour day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In response to a question about her future employment capacity, she answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">It depends on what my doctors suggest____I\u2019m in constant contact with them. I still have a few months left in remission. Right now, based on the limited amount of energy that I have to pace myself during the day, I don\u2019t believe that I would be able to perform a full day\u2019s work that would be required by any employer. So, I would have to consult with my doctors. Maybe in November this year we\u2019ll see if things have improved healthwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Nonetheless, Wife testified that her fatigue had not prevented her from involving herself heavily in her children\u2019s activities. She opined that her level of activity outside the home was \u201ca little different than working full-time\u201d and not \u201ca twelve hour day,\u201d which she said was \u201ctypically how long you work when you\u2019re working in a corporate world.\u201d She stated that she needed \u201cto pace [her]self\u201d and she \u201cwish[ed] that [she] had more energy to do some things even better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">When asked whether she was capable of working full-time, Wife responded: \u201cNot at this time.\u201d She said that her ability to work part-time \u201cwould depend\u201d on the circumstances, but she believed that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to do anything that has to do with standing up or typing.\u201d Regarding her intention to provide financial support to her children, she answered: \u201cIt would depend on my health in the future. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>During closing arguments, counsel for Husband asked the court to impute income of $400 per week to Wife for the purpose of calculating alimony and child support. Counsel argued that Wife\u2019s testimony \u201cmade it abundantly clear [that] she [had] no intention to return to work\u201d and that the court should not simply accept her self-reported opinion that she was physically unable to work. He pointed out that she had made no efforts to seek employment or to increase her employability and that she produced \u201cno medical evidence\u201d of documentation of her alleged ongoing symptoms. Counsel for Husband argued that, although it would be unreasonable to expect a 47-year-old woman with a 20-year employment gap to \u201cgo to work in some office and make $50,000.00 a year,\u201d the court should conclude that she could at least \u201cget a job for forty hours a week making $10.00 an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">During closing, counsel for Wife asserted that she had not worked for two decades \u201cby the agreement of the parties.\u201d Her attorney commented that, under her existing circumstances, \u201c[s]he is at $10.00 an hour and [Husband] has admitted that.\u201d Her attorney argued that she was \u201centitled to indefinite alimony\u201d because \u201cher history of medical problems and ... her current physical limitations\u201d meant that she could \u201cnever hope to achieve a level of self-sufficiency that will enable her to obtain the standard of living the parties would have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">D. <em>Judgment of the Circuit Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">On February 25, 2015, the circuit court issued a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum opinion setting forth its rulings on each of the claims raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">First, the court granted the divorce on the ground of Husband\u2019s adultery, finding that the allegations of adultery had been admitted and proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Wife received sole legal custody of the parties\u2019 two minor children. The court granted Husband\u2019s request for visitation rights with the parties\u2019 son, who was then a 15-year-old high school sophomore. Husband had not requested a visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>order regarding the minor daughter, a 17-year-old high school senior who was estranged from her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The court granted Wife use and possession of the family home until February 2016 and ordered Husband to continue paying the mortgage, taxes, and insurance during that period. The court directed that a trustee be appointed to sell the house as soon as possible after February 1,2016, and to divide any net proceeds from the sale evenly between the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The court rejected Wife\u2019s argument that she was incapable of working and instead found that she was voluntarily impoverished. The court concluded that she had the capacity to work 40 hours per week at an \u201centry level\u201d position with a salary of $10 per hour. The court agreed with Husband that \u201ca conservative approach\u201d of imputing a gross monthly income of $1,733.33 per month was \u201cfair and appropriate.\u201d In addition, the court determined Husband\u2019s monthly gross income to be $18,614, a figure that was in line with some of the highest estimates offered by Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">After weighing the statutory factors pertaining to an alimony award, the court awarded rehabilitative alimony of $1,800 per month for a period of 15 years. The court stated that Wife had not met her burden of proving that she was entitled to indefinite alimony. In view of Wife\u2019s failure to adduce medical or other evidence to substantiate her insistence that she was incapable of working, the court commented that it would not \u201cspeculate\u201d on the questions of \u201chow long it [would] take\u201d for Wife to make sufficient progress and \u201chow far she can be expected to progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The court evaluated the parties\u2019 child support obligations based on its findings that Husband\u2019s actual income was $18,614 per month and that Wife\u2019s potential income was $1,733 per month. The court ordered Husband to pay child support in the amount of $1,600 per month until February 2016 (the end of the period for use and possession of the family home) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and $2,116 per month thereafter. The court also ordered Husband to continue to pay for medical insurance, dental insurance, and extraordinary medical expenses for the two minor children. The court rejected Wife\u2019s claim that the parties\u2019 19-year-old daughter was a destitute adult child.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Among its other orders, the court granted Wife a monetary award of $81,122, representing one-half of the value of her husband\u2019s 401(k) retirement account. The court also awarded her 75 percent of the family furniture and transferred Husband\u2019s interest in an automobile to her. Finally, the court ordered Husband to pay $15,000 of the attorney\u2019s fees that Wife had incurred in pursuing her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The court finalized its orders in a judgment entered on April 20, 2015. Thereafter, Wife filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">While the appeal was pending, Wife moved for a partial stay of the judgment. Effectively, she asked this Court to modify the portion of the judgment that provided that her use and possession of the family home would terminate on February 1, 2016. This Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\n<em>Questions Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In her appeal, Wife presents a number of questions and sub-questions. For analytical clarity, we have reorganized those issues<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in this form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>I. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in imputing income to Wife for the purposes of alimony and child support?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in awarding Wife rehabilitative alimony in the amount of $1,800 per month for a period of 15 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">III. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in granting Wife use and possession of the family home until February 1, 2016?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Addressing the first question, we conclude that there is no basis to set aside the court\u2019s findings as to Wife\u2019s short-term earning capacity. Nevertheless, we conclude that the court\u2019s alimony analysis was incomplete. After fully accepting the court\u2019s findings about the parties\u2019 incomes, we are unable to determine whether the court erred or abused its discretion in determining the amount and duration of alimony. Therefore, the awards must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">On the final issue, we conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion in setting a time limit for use and possession of the family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The trial court imputed income to Wife for the purpose of evaluating her claims for alimony and child support. She contends that the court erred by finding that she was currently capable of earning $1,733 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">\u201cTechnically, \u2018imputed income\u2019 is a child support concept predicated on a finding of voluntary impoverishment[.]\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Reynolds, </em>216 Md.App. 205, 220, 85 A.3d 350 (2014). The Maryland child support guidelines define a parent\u2019s income as either: \u201c(1) actual income of a parent, if the parent is employed to full capacity; or (2) potential income of a parent, if the parent is voluntarily impoverished.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-201(h) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d); <em>see also </em>FL \u00a7 12-204(b) (providing that \u201cif a parent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>voluntarily impoverished, child support may be calculated based on a determination of potential income\u201d but that \u201c[a] determination of potential income may not be made for a parent who ... is unable to work because of a physical or mental disability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Potential income means \u201cincome attributed to a parent determined by the parent\u2019s employment potential and probable earnings level based on, but not limited to, recent work history, occupational qualifications, prevailing job opportunities, and earnings levels in the community.\u201d FL \u00a7 12-201 ((). Although the legislature has not defined the term \u201cvoluntary impoverishment,\u201d the courts have held that a parent is \u201cconsidered \u2018voluntarily impoverished\u2019 whenever the parent has made the free and conscious choice, not compelled by factors beyond his or her control, to render himself or herself without adequate resources[.]\u201d <em>Wills v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 480, 490, 667 A.2d 331 (1995) (quoting <em>Goldberger v. Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. 313, 327, 624 A.2d 1328 (1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The Family Law Article does not expressly require a trial court to consider a spouse\u2019s voluntary impoverishment or potential income for alimony purposes. Using more general terms, the alimony statute directs the court to \u201cconsider all the factors necessary for a fair and equitable award,\u201d including: \u201cthe ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting\u201d (FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(1)); \u201cthe time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment\u201d (FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(2)); and \u201cthe financial needs and financial resources of each party, including ... all income and assets\u201d (FL \u00a7 ll-106(b)(ll)(i)). Consequently, the court may consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>er the potential income of a voluntarily impoverished spouse when it considers an alimony request. <em>See Reynolds, </em>216 Md.App. at 220, 85 A.3d 350; <em>Turner v. Turner, </em>147 Md.App. 350, 385, 809 A.2d 18 (2002); <em>Durkee v. Durkee, </em>144 Md.App. 161, 181, 797 A.2d 94 (2002); <em>Long v. Long, </em>141 Md.App. 341, 350-53, 785 A.2d 818 (2001); <em>Digges v. Digges, </em>126 Md.App. 361, 379-81, 730 A.2d 202 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">After a bench trial such as this one, an appellate court \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). We review the court\u2019s findings as to a party\u2019s earning capacity under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Sieglein v. Schmidt, </em>224 Md.App. 222, 249, 120 A.3d 790 (2015), <em>aff'd, </em>447 Md. 647, 136 A.3d 751, 2016 WL 2941117 (2016); <em>Reynolds, </em>216 Md.App. at 222, 85 A.3d 350; <em>Long, </em>141 Md.App. at 352, 785 A.2d 818; <em>Crabill v. Crabill, </em>119 Md.App. 249, 265-66, 704 A.2d 532 (1998). Under that standard, \u201c[i]f there is any competent evidence to support the factual findings [of the trial court], those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 202, 857 A.2d 1109 (2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In explaining its decision to impute income to Wife, the court stated that Wife had earned a bachelor\u2019s degree before the marriage and that she had earned $45,000 annually before she decided to stop working in 1995.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the parties had offered conflicting narratives about that decision, the court credited Husband\u2019s testimony that he had merely acquiesced in Wife\u2019s unilateral decision. This finding was consistent with the court\u2019s other comments that Wife had demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>strated an \u201cunwillingness to work\u201d regardless of circumstances during the marriage and that she \u201cinsisted] on being totally supported by husband, because that was her perception of their agreement 19 years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The court credited Wife\u2019s testimony that she had endured \u201csevere lethargy\u201d around the time of her 2009 cancer diagnosis. Yet the court was not persuaded by her testimony regarding the extent of her current condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">The problem with wife\u2019s assertions on her health status is that she produced absolutely no medical testimony to support it. While it is not disputed that she suffered from cancer, this appears to be in remission. There was no testimony as to her diagnosis, prognosis or current status. There was no testimony to support her other allegations of health problems and concerns. To the contrary, it was pointed out that she endured long days of trial and never presented as being unable to continue with the same. She spent many hours on the witness stand and did not appear fatigued, and quite frankly, she was quite combative and energetic in her sparring with opposing counsel, even at the end of long days. Such reflects her energy and ability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">In addition, she provided much testimony of her running around for her children\u2019s activities, going on college visits and attending innumerable sports tournaments. None of these activities were limited by her alleged medical conditions. Something more than her bald assertion, which was unsupported by her other testimony and her courtroom demeanor, should be shown to make a claim for permanent disability....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Concluding that Wife \u201cshould be able to work a 40-hour week earning $10 per hour at this time,\u201d the court imputed to her \u201c$20,800 annual income, which equates to $1,733.33 per month.\u201d We see no error, let alone clear error, in these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In her appeal, Wife asserts that the evidence showed that she was wholly incapable of earning income. Relying on her own testimony regarding fatigue, depression, and neuropathy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>she asserts that the facts at trial \u201cpaint a picture of someone who is not likely\u201d to be able to support herself. It may be true that her testimony, if believed in its entirety, would have been sufficient for a court to find that she was incapable of holding a job. <em>See Allison v. Allison, </em>160 Md.App. 331, 345, 864 A.2d 191 (2004). On the other hand, her testimony \u201cby no means compelled that conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The court was entitled to weigh Wife\u2019s testimony in light of the other evidence about her active lifestyle. <em>See Schwartz v.

The court was also competent to draw inferences about Wife\u2019s condition based on its first-hand observations. <em>See Blake v.

As the trial court indicated, her own testimony was inconclusive on this point, because she had discussed her inability to work a 10- or 12-hour day. She opined that she was not ready for full-time work \u201cat this time,\u201d but she stated that her opinion on that matter \u201cwould depend\u201d on her future doctors\u2019 recommendations and on the type of work. She also suggested that the divorce itself was contributing to her vulnerability, and she expressed her intention to re-evaluate in November <em>2015 </em>\u2014 i.e., the month after the trial. In her own words, she stated that she \u201cd[id]n\u2019t know\u201d whether she would be capable of contributing financially to the support of her children in the future. Similarly, during closing argument, her attorney was equivocal about whether Wife contended that she was utterly incapable of supporting herself, or only partially so.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Wife has expressly challenged the court\u2019s finding that she had the ability to work, but she does not argue that the court otherwise erred or abused its discretion in determining the <em>amount </em>of potential income.

An appellate court will uphold a trial court\u2019s determination of potential income as long as the underlying factual findings are not clearly wrong, and \u201cthe amount calculated is realistic\u201d and not \u201cso unreasonably high or low as to amount to an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>discretion[.]\u201d <em>Sieglein, </em>224 Md.App. at 249, 120 A.3d 790 (citing <em>Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. at 223, 649 A.2d 24) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In the present case, Wife has challenged only the court\u2019s finding as to the number of hours she could reasonably work.

The court\u2019s findings on this matter are central to an award of rehabilitative alimony.

The circuit court\u2019s opinion included a detailed and thorough discussion of these considerations. Many of the court\u2019s findings are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In summary, the court found that: the parties \u201cenjoyed a high, upper middle class standard of living,\u201d but had lived \u201cbeyond their means\u201d during the marriage (addressing FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(3)); the marriage lasted for 20 years, but it was only an \u201cactive marriage\u201d for 18 of those years (FL \u00a7 11\u2014 106(b)(4)); Husband made almost all of the monetary contributions, while Wife made most of the non-monetary contributions as primary caregiver to the children (FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(5)); the breakup directly resulted from Husband\u2019s affair and his subsequent deceptive behavior, but other underlying problems with the parties\u2019 financial habits and Wife\u2019s \u201cconfrontation and aggression\u201d also contributed to their estrangement (FL \u00a7 11\u2014 106(b)(6)); Husband and Wife were 46 and 47 years old, respectively (FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(7)); Husband had no significant health concerns, but Wife suffered from both physical and mental health problems (FL \u00a7 ll-106(b)(8)); Husband\u2019s high income was currently overwhelmed by the mortgage and other financial obligations, and both parties would \u201cneed to make serious adjustments in their spending habits\u201d (FL \u00a7 11-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>106(b)(9)); Husband had agreed to pay for the children\u2019s ongoing medical expenses (FL \u00a7 ll-106(b)(10)); and the parties had few assets aside from equity in the marital home and Husband\u2019s retirement savings, which the court would divide evenly (FL \u00a7 ll-106(b)(ll)).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In its discussion of \u201cthe ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting\u201d (FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(1)), the court found that Wife was currently capable of earning $20,800 in annual income, the equivalent of $1,733.33 in monthly income. Yet the court did not explicitly compare that level of income with Wife\u2019s reasonable needs. Hence, the opinion included no express statement about whether Wife would be either \u201cwholly\u201d or \u201cpartly\u201d self-supporting with that amount of imputed income. The court\u2019s analysis \u201cseemed to suggest\u201d that Wife would not be fully self-supporting at that imputed income level, but then it \u201cfail[ed] to make that finding.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Brewer, </em>156 Md.App. 77, 101, 846 A.2d 1 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">A spouse is not necessarily \u201cself-supporting\u201d under the alimony statute merely because the spouse has enough income \u201cto hold body and soul together.\u201d <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 392, 614 A.2d 590. In general, a party is self-supporting if the party\u2019s income exceeds the party\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d expenses, as determined by the court. <em>See id. </em>at 390, 614 A.2d 590; <em>Reynolds, </em>216 Md.App. at 221-22, 85 A.3d 350; <em>Lee v.

The court determines the appropriate level of reasonable need based on all of the statutory alimony factors, including the standard of living established during the marriage. <em>See Reynolds, </em>216 Md.App. at 226, 85 A.3d 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The court discussed Wife\u2019s financial needs elsewhere in its opinion. Wife had submitted a financial statement in which she claimed monthly expenses of $6,244 for herself and $4,309 for her children. The court identified a total of $2,525 of those expense items that Wife had either agreed to eliminate or that the court believed were inflated. The court commented that the apparent exaggerations tended to \u201cdraw her entire ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>pense sheet into question[ ] and make it difficult to accurately assess her needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">It is \u201can unfortunate fact that expenses are sometimes exaggerated when financial statements are prepared for use in domestic relations cases,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe trial court is not required to set forth its exact thought process in arriving at conclusions\u201d regarding a spouse\u2019s reasonable expenses. <em>Allison, </em>160 Md.App. at 345, 864 A.2d 191. Yet despite the court\u2019s effort to give a realistic evaluation of Wife\u2019s expenses, the opinion still left the parties and this Court without any clear statement about her reasonable needs. As a consequence, we cannot determine whether she would be wholly self-supporting with her imputed income, or even -with her imputed income plus a monthly alimony payment. A calculation of the recipient spouse\u2019s future expenses and income \u201cis obviously an important component to any finding of self-sufficiency\u201d <em>(see Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 353-54, 664 A.2d 453 (1995)), and without those findings it is \u201cunclear whether, and if so the degree to which, [the recipient spouse] will be able to become self-supporting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 864 A.2d 191; <em>see also Brewer, </em>156 Md.App. at 101, 846 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The circuit court went on to decry the dearth of evidence regarding the time necessary for Wife to improve her employ-ability, under FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(2). This Court has characterized \u201cthe mandatory factor in section 11-106(b)(2)\u201d as an element that \u201cgoes to the heart\u201d of Maryland\u2019s rehabilitation-based alimony scheme. <em>Long, </em>129 Md.App. at 582, 743 A.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The court observed that Wife had offered \u201cno anecdotal or current experience testimony to shed light on this issue\u201d and had produced no \u201cvocational expert to discuss her potential income.\u201d For his part, Husband merely asserted that she would be wholly self-supporting within two years, without any evidence or even an argument to justify that time frame. The court found that the evidence supported the inference that Wife\u2019s income would grow over the years, but the court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>not (at that time) hazard a guess as to how much growth could be expected over any period of time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">Wife does not present as any shrinking violet, but rather as a very strong personality, and given her education, past work experience (although dated) and her personality, this Court would expect her to progress quickly beyond that starting level. As indicated before, there was a lack- of evidence on what her earning growth could be expected to be, and it seems that both parties want the Court to speculate about wife\u2019s earning potential or lack thereof. This Court will not do that. While wife should be able to gain employment at an entry level, it would be expected to take some time for her income to grow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Although the court\u2019s refusal to speculate is perfectly understandable <em>(see Walter v. Walter, </em>181 Md.App. 273, 288, 956 A.2d 255 (2008)), the problem is that the law still requires the court to \u201cproject[ ] forward in time to the point when the requesting spouse will have made maximum financial progress, and compar[e] the relative standards of living of the parties at that future time.\u201d <em>Whittington, </em>172 Md.App. at 338, 914 A.2d 212 (citations and quotation marks omitted). In other words, the law puts the trial court in a conundrum: it cannot speculate, but it must project. The conundrum is particularly acute in a case like this, where the recipient spouse has taken the position that she is unable to work and has refused to put on evidence about the financial progress that she is likely to make. Nevertheless, by making an inconclusive finding on the issue of when Wife \u201cwill have made maximum financial progress,\u201d the court compounded the earlier difficulty that arose from the lack of a clear finding regarding the income Wife needed to become self-sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The core considerations of FL \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(1) and (b)(2) are closely connected to the issue of whether to grant alimony for a fixed or indefinite period. The statute authorizes the court to award alimony for an indefinite period if it finds that, \u201cdue to age, illness, infirmity, or disability, the party seeking alimony cannot reasonably be expected to make substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>progress toward becoming self-supporting[.]\u201d FL \u00a7 11-106(c)(1). Consistent with its other findings, the circuit court concluded that Wife had not proven any \u201cage, illness, infirmity, or disability\u201d that would preclude her from working. As discussed previously, we agree that the evidence supported a finding that Wife could currently earn an annual income of $20,800. Earning such a salary and increasing it over time would be, at the very least, \u201cprogress toward becoming self-supporting[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u201c[S]elf-sufficiency per se does not bar an award of indefinite alimony[.]\u201d <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 392, 614 A.2d 590. The court may award indefinite alimony if it finds that \u201ceven after the party seeking alimony will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.\u201d FL \u00a7 ll-106(c)(2). \u201cA trial court must evaluate and compare\u201d the parties\u2019 respective post-divorce standards of living \u201cas a separate step in making its judgment\u201d on a claim for indefinite alimony. <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 393, 614 A.2d 590. \u201cIn this context, \u2018standards of living\u2019 means how well the respective parties can live based on their respective financial means.\u201d <em>Boemio v. Boemio, </em>414 Md. 118, 144, 994 A.2d 911 (2010). To make the necessary comparison, the court \u201cshould project those standards for the future, based on all of the available evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144 n. 18, 994 A.2d 911; <em>see also Blaine v. Blaine, </em>336 Md. 49, 64, 646 A.2d 413 (1994) (\u201cthe language of \u00a7 11-106 is prospective, in effect requiring that the court make a prediction as to the success of the dependent spouse\u2019s efforts to become self-sufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">A comparison of the parties\u2019 predicted future incomes is not the sole component of the comparison of future living standards, but it is necessary. \u201c[I]n analyzing whether indefinite alimony should be granted under FL [\u00a7] ll-106(c)(2), it is of paramount importance to know what future income (of the dependent spouse) is being projected.\u201d <em>Allison, </em>160 Md.App. at 342-43, 864 A.2d 191. If a reviewing court is \u201cin the dark ... as to what future income the trial judge thought [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>dependent spouse] would have[,]\u201d the court is unable to determine whether the trial judge abused his or her discretion in the alimony ruling. <em>Freedenburg v.

Hart, </em>169 Md.App. 151, 167-70, 899 A.2d 965 (2006); <em>Simonds v.

[W]ife\u2019s evidence on this issue was quite lacking, and she is the party with the burden of proof. There has been no effort on wife\u2019s part, no anecdotal history available and no vocational opinion on this issue. She merely insists on an award of indefinite alimony[,] requiring the Court to speculate about her earning capacity or lack thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">Wife was successful in the past, and having hear[d] the testimony and observed her in Court, there is no reason to doubt her future success. Obviously, it is ridiculous to expect her to walk out the door after 19 years and earn any substantial income, but it would not be unreasonable to expect her to progress in her chosen occupation, once she does re-engage in the workforce. Husband has achieved a high level of income while wife tended the children and the marital home. She moved around to accommodate husband\u2019s job opportunities. She also should be afforded time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>to refresh her vocational marketability and to grow in the field/job that she chooses. Like husband\u2019s career, that also will take time. The questions are how long will it take and how far can she be expected to progress. There was little evidence of any attempt, any strategy or any prognosis. Wife has thrown up her hands and has left this Court to speculate, which this Court is not permitted to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">Accordingly, this Court finds that wife has not met her burden of proof for indefinite alimony, but the Court also finds that husband\u2019s recommendation of two years is unsupported by common sense. The Court shall set the term of alimony for a period of 15 years, which will take wife to the age of 62, and which will give her time to find a field of work and to grow in it to a level where the standards of living of the parties will not be unconscionably disparate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Wife contends that the circuit court failed to \u201cproject!] forward the parties!\u2019] future standards of living after maximum rehabilitation has occurred.\u201d As a related point, she argues that \u201cthe duration of rehabilitative alimony for a period of 15 years was arbitrary!.]\u201d She likens the present case to <em>Long v. Long, </em>129 Md.App. 554, 743 A.2d 281 (2000), and <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>148 Md.App. 432, 812 A.2d 1089 (2002). These comparisons are apt.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In <em>Long, </em>129 Md.App. at 579-85, 743 A.2d 281, this Court held that a trial court had abused its discretion in awarding rehabilitative alimony for a fixed term that was not adequately explained by the evidence. In support of a claim for indefinite alimony, a wife had presented evidence that she had not worked for several years and that she suffered from mental health issues that prevented her from working. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 743 A.2d 281. The circuit court discounted that evidence and concluded, based on the wife\u2019s employment history, that she was capable of supporting herself at least in part. <em>Id. </em>at 580-81, 743 A.2d 281. Because the court ordered four years of rehabilitative alimony -without reaching any conclusion as to the time necessary for the wife to gain suitable employment, it was impossible for this Court to \u201cascertain from whence [the] determination on duration of alimony came[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 743 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>A.2d 281. We concluded that the court abused its discretion by failing \u201cto draw a solid line between the facts and the remedy, explaining fully how the former justifies the latter[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582-83, 743 A.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Similarly, in <em>Lee, </em>this Court vacated a three-year alimony award where the trial judge \u201cfailed to explain adequately his reasons for the duration of the rehabilitative alimony award in relation to the disparity of income he found to currently existCJ\u201d <em>Lee, </em>148 Md.App. at 444, 812 A.2d 1089. In that case, the evidence showed that the spouse seeking alimony was employed but not self-supporting and that she had potential to earn a slightly higher salary. <em>See id. </em>at 435-37, 812 A.2d 1089. The trial judge believed that the wife could take courses that would enhance her income, but he nonetheless \u201cgave no clue as to why he believed Mrs. Lee could be self-supporting in three years (assuming he did have that belief) or what line of work he thought she could engage in to allow her to become self-supporting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 812 A.2d 1089. In other words, \u201cthe duration of the rehabilitative alimony appeared] to have been pulled out of \u2018thin air.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 812 A.2d 1089. Even though the court made vague predictions that the wife would increase her income over time, the court erred by failing to make a \u201cprediction of what Mrs. Lee would be earning when the rehabilitative period was concluded[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 812 A.2d 1089. On remand, we instructed the court to take additional evidence if necessary, to re-evaluate the award, and to explain its \u201cthought process\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 456, 812 A.2d 1089) in regard to FL \u00a7 ll-106(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As the case law illustrates, making the type of prediction required by FL \u00a7 ll-106(c)(2) is sometimes an exceptionally difficult task. In the present case, the trial court made a commendable attempt to reach an equitable result despite the gulf between the analysis dictated by the statute and the evidence offered by the parties. The evidence conclusively showed that, even after imputing income to Wife, she was entitled to alimony at least in the 2015 and 2016 calendar years. Husband conceded as much in his closing argument, and rightly so. <em>See Rogers v. Rogers, </em>80 Md.App. 575, 591-92, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>565 A.2d 361 (1989) (holding that court abused discretion in denying alimony where highest salary ever earned by wife was small fraction of husband\u2019s current salary). The court evidently agreed that Wife had satisfied at least that initial burden of showing her entitlement to alimony in some amount for some period.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The court refused to credit the only direct evidence from the parties regarding Wife\u2019s future income prospects \u2014 her own testimony that she expected herself to earn no meaningful income. The court concluded that she was capable of working full-time in an entry-level job and increasing her income over time. As the court correctly observed, the trial record did not answer the questions of \u201chow long [it would] take\u201d for her to become self-sufficient and \u201chow far she c[ould] be expected to progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Essentially, the court concluded that it lacked enough evidence at that time to make any meaningful prediction about Wife\u2019s future prospects for self-sufficiency. On this point, we agree. But the court went on to award a specific amount of alimony for a specific duration. On that matter, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In his brief, Husband does not explain how the 15-year term is \u201crehabilitative.\u201d The court\u2019s only stated justification for this period was that Wife needed \u201ctime to find a field of work and grow in it to a level where the standards of living of the parties will not be unconscionably disparate.\u201d To the extent that the court attempted to make a projection, it appears to have focused on the wrong goal. In the words of the statute, the relevant point in time is when \u201cthe party seeking alimony will have made as much <em>progress toward becoming self-supporting </em>as can reasonably be expectedf.]\u201d FL \u00a7 ll-106(e)(2) (emphasis added); <em>see Francz v. Francz, </em>157 Md.App. 676, 701, 853 A.2d 839 (2004) (\u201c[t]he comparison to be made is between [the payor\u2019s] post-divorce standard of living and [the recipient\u2019s] post-divorce standard of living upon making as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as reasonably can be expected\u201d). The court focused not on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>rehabilitative goal of self-sufficiency but on Wife\u2019s ultimate progress towards alleviating the income disparity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Husband does not argue that the trial court completed the type of analysis dictated by statute and precedent. Instead, he focuses on the court\u2019s statements that Wife had failed to satisfy her burden of proving that she was entitled to indefinite alimony. He suggests that, because Wife offered no credible evidence on her future prognosis, the court did not need to make findings as to her rehabilitation period and future standard of living. He concludes by characterizing the 15-year term as \u201cvery generous\u201d in light of her failure of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">As the circuit court correctly recognized, a spouse seeking indefinite alimony normally bears the burden of proving the statutory prerequisites to such an award. <em>See Reynolds, </em>216 Md.App. at 221, 85 A.3d 350; <em>Francz, </em>157 Md.App. at 692, 853 A.2d 839; <em>Turner, </em>147 Md.App. at 389, 809 A.2d 18; <em>Crabill, </em>119 Md.App. at 260-61, 704 A.2d 532; <em>Doser, </em>106 Md.App. at 353, 664 A.2d 453; <em>Thomasian v. Thomasian, </em>79 Md.App. 188, 195, 556 A.2d 675 (1989). Still, a court may not grant rehabilitative alimony in a particular duration without the requisite findings and predictions. Rather, \u201can award of temporary alimony must be grounded in a finding that the recipient spouse is not self-supporting and needs training, education, or other steps to help that spouse achieve financial self-reliance.\u201d <em>Karmand, </em>145 Md.App. at 328, 802 A.2d 1106 (citing <em>Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. at 229, 649 A.2d 24). More specifically, \u201cthere must be some relation between the length of the award and the conclusion of fact as to the income disparity made by the court.\u201d <em>Benkin v. Benkin, </em>71 Md.App. 191, 204, 524 A.2d 789 (1987). From our perspective, it makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>no difference that the 15-year rehabilitation term was \u201cgenerous\u201d or not. We cannot uphold an alimony determination that is not based on sound legal principles and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The existing record may not have been sufficient for the court to make findings about the time necessary for Wife to gain sufficient education or training to enable her to find suitable employment, under FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(2), and whether the parties\u2019 respective standards of living will be unconscionably disparate even after she will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, under FL \u00a7 ll-106(c)(2). In conducting further proceedings, the court may accept additional evidence on those issues. <em>See Hiltz, </em>218 Md.App. at 346, 73 A.3d 1199; <em>Lee, </em>148 Md. App. at 456, 812 A.2d 1089. Both parties \u201cmay introduce additional evidence on the issue of both of their earnings, past and present, including evidence that is up-to-date.\u201d <em>Walter, </em>181 Md.App. at 288, 956 A.2d 255; <em>see also Digges, </em>126 Md.App. at 370, 730 A.2d 202. Wife shall continue to bear the burden of proving her entitlement to indefinite alimony. \u201c[S]he must show that, projecting into the future <em>from the present (not from the time of the merits trial), </em>even after she will have made as much progress toward self-sufficiency as reasonably can be expected, there will be an unconscionable disparity between her standard of living\u201d and that of her former husband. <em>Francz, </em>157 Md.App. at 701, 853 A.2d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">When the court receives \u201cfresh evidence as to the current incomes and needs of both parties[,]\u201d it may become possible \u201cto produce evidence relative to [Wife\u2019s] prospects for future earnings.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>80 Md.App. at 594-95, 565 A.2d 361. For instance, Wife might be able to offer the type of \u201canecdotal\u201d or other testimony that the court lacked at the time of the original judgment. If the court believes that it still lacks sufficient credible evidence to make the necessary findings, it might appoint a neutral expert under Md. Rule 5-706 to assess Wife\u2019s earning capacity. <em>E.g. Solomon, </em>383 Md. at 183, 857 A.2d 1109; <em>Baer v. Baer, </em>128 Md.App. 469, 490, 738 A.2d 923 (1999). Even though expert testimony is not usually required for predicting whether a party will become self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>sufficient <em>(see Doser, </em>106 Md.App. at 353 n. 7, 664 A.2d 453; <em>Blake, </em>81 Md.App. at 728, 569 A.2d 724), testimony from a court-appointed expert, whose fees are paid by the parties (perhaps from the proceeds of the sale of the house), may be a practical method for making an alimony determination here.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In her brief, Wife asks this Court to do more than simply vacate the alimony award. She contends that, even accepting the court\u2019s findings of potential income, the alimony award was inadequate as a matter of law. Her argument focuses on the gross disparity between her potential monthly income of $1,733 and her husband\u2019s actual monthly income of $18,614. She observes that an alimony transfer of $1,800 would increase her gross income to only $3,533 per month, leaving her husband with $16,814 in gross income. In other words, her post-alimony, pre-tax income would be about 21 percent of that of her husband in the near future. She argues that, in light of that disparity, her contributions to the family that allowed her husband to increase his earning capacity during the 19-year marriage, and the court\u2019s decision to grant the divorce on the grounds of the husband\u2019s adultery, the court was required to grant indefinite alimony in an amount greater than $1,800 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In cases involving dramatic income disparities after long marriages, this Court has found an abuse of discretion in a trial court\u2019s failure to award indefinite alimony. <em>See Wassif v. Wassif, </em>77 Md.App. 750, 754-58, 551 A.2d 935 (1989); <em>Holston v. Holston, </em>58 Md.App. 308, 320-24, 473 A.2d 459 (1984); <em>see also Lee, </em>148 Md.App. at 448-49, 812 A.2d 1089; <em>Long, </em>129 Md.App. at 584-85, 743 A.2d 281; <em>Rogers, </em>80 Md.App. at 588-92, 565 A.2d 361. Even in cases where indefinite alimony is granted, a court abuses its discretion if the amount of indefinite alimony does not alleviate the remaining disparity. <em>See Solomon, </em>383 Md. at 197-201, 857 A.2d 1109; <em>Turner, </em>147 Md.App. at 392, 809 A.2d 18. Nevertheless, there is no single test for indefinite alimony based on a raw income percentage differential or the length of a marriage. <em>See Boemio, </em>414 Md. at 140-43 <em>&amp; </em>n. 17, 994 A.2d 911; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Whittington, </em>172 Md.App. at 339-40, 914 A.2d 212. The court must still \u201cconsider all the factors necessary for a fair and equitable award\u201d (FL \u00a7 ll-106(b)) and exercise its discretion based on the individual facts of the case. In this case, the \u201cmissing ingredient\u201d <em>(Lee, </em>148 Md.App. at 456, 812 A.2d 1089) is still the court\u2019s future prognosis for the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The most relevant point of comparison under FL \u00a7 11\u2014 106(c)(2) is not the parties\u2019 respective incomes in the year after the divorce, as Wife suggests. The statute requires a comparison of the disparity in the parties\u2019 future standards of living at the hypothetical point in time when Wife will have made as much progress towards becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected. Depending on the court\u2019s projections for the two parties, the initial percentage comparison might not reflect the ratio at the end of a rehabilitation period. At this point, it would be premature to hold that the alimony amount was insufficient or that the trial court erred by failing to find an unconscionable disparity under FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Our decision to vacate the alimony award does not affect only that portion of the judgment. Maryland\u2019s child support statute requires a court to account for alimony transfers between parents before calculating the parents\u2019 child support obligations. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 12 \u2014 204(a)(2); <em>see also </em>FL \u00a7 12-201(b)(3)(xv) (parent\u2019s income for child support guidelines includes \u201calimony or maintenance received\u201d). More broadly, a court\u2019s determinations as to alimony, child support, monetary awards, and counsel fees involve overlapping evaluations of the parties\u2019 financial circumstances. The factors underlying such awards \u201care so interrelated that, when a trial court considers a claim for any one of them, it must weigh the award of any other.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>147 Md.App. at 400, 809 A.2d 18. \u201cTherefore, when this Court vacates one such award, we often vacate the remaining awards for reevaluation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 809 A.2d 18 (collecting cases); <em>see also Hiltz, </em>213 Md. App. at 322 n. 3, 73 A.3d 1199 (citing <em>Doser, </em>106 Md.App. at 335, 664 A.2d 453); <em>Murray v. Murray, </em>190 Md.App. 553, 572, 989 A.2d 771 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Because we are remanding this case for a re-evaluation of the amount and duration of alimony, we will also vacate the interrelated orders regarding child support, the monetary award, and counsel fees. Until the circuit court completes the proceedings required by this opinion, the existing orders for alimony and child support will continue to have \u201cthe force and effect of a <em>pendente lite </em>award.\u201d <em>Simonds, </em>165 Md.App. at 613, 886 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">As the final issue in this appeal, Wife contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it granted her use and possession of the family home and required Husband to bear financial responsibility for the home until February 1, 2016, approximately 11 months after the court issued its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In connection with divorce and related proceedings, the court may \u201cexercise its power to \u2018enable any child of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the family to continue to live in the environment and community that are familiar to the child\u2019 and \u2018to provide for the continued occupancy of the family home ... by a party with custody of a child who has a need to live in that home.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>153 Md.App. 260, 268-69, 836 A.2d 695 (2003) (quoting FL \u00a7 8-206). For a period of up to three years after the date of the divorce (FL \u00a7 8-210(a)), the court may grant a party the sole use and possession of the family home. FL \u00a7 8-208(a)(l)(i). In addition, \u201cthe trial court may order one or both of the parents to contribute to the mortgage on the family home, insurance, and taxes.\u201d <em>Knott v. Knott, </em>146 Md.App. 232, 250, 806 A.2d 768 (2002) (citing FL \u00a7 8-208(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">To evaluate a claim for use and possession of the family home, the court must consider: \u201c(1) the best interests of any child; (2) the interest of each party in continuing (i) to ... use the family home or any part of it as a dwelling place; or (ii) to ... occupy or use the family home or any part of it for the production of income; and (3) any hardship imposed on the party whose interest in the family home ... is infringed\u201d by a use and possession order. FL \u00a7 8-208(b). The trial court\u2019s decision \u201cin awarding possession and use of a family home will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a showing that it was exercised in an arbitrary manner or a showing that [the trial court\u2019s] judgment was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Court v. Court, </em>67 Md.App. 676, 684, 509 A.2d 693 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The circuit court\u2019s opinion included a thorough analysis of these statutory factors as applied to the facts of the case. The court noted that the family\u2019s four-bedroom home was located \u201cin the C. Milton Wright High School district where [the parties\u2019 two minor children] attend as a senior and sophomore, respectively.\u201d The court recounted that the family lost roughly $100,000 of equity as part of the 2005 transaction to avoid foreclosure, and then avoided a second foreclosure threat in 2010 by renegotiating a mortgage with a graduated interest schedule. The court explained that this history demonstrated that the parties had placed great importance on having their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>children live in that house, even though \u201cthe cost of th[at] particular house exceeded the family\u2019s budget and financial resources\u201d and even though Wife was consistently unwilling to work \u201ceven with the family\u2019s home on the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In considering the best interests of the children under FL \u00a7 8 \u2014 208(b)(1), the court concluded that both minor children would benefit if they finished high school in their current school. The court noted that even if the use and possession period terminated before the graduation of their son in 2017, he could still finish his final year at that school through his father\u2019s continued residence in the same district or through his mother\u2019s acquisition of more affordable housing in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Addressing the second consideration, <em>see </em>FL \u00a7 8 \u2014 208(b)(2), the court recognized that Wife also had an interest in continuing to use the family home as her residence. The court noted that it seemed appropriate to afford her \u201csome transitional time[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In addressing the third consideration, <em>see </em>FL \u00a7 8-208(b)(3), the court found that an extended use and possession term would result in a \u201csevere hardship\u201d to Husband, who bore sole financial responsibility for the property. Husband\u2019s 2010 loan modification had granted him the temporary reprieve of a two percent interest rate, followed by increases to three percent in March 2015, four percent in March 2016, and over five percent in March 2017. Each increase resulted in hundreds of dollars in additional monthly payments. The court determined that Husband was \u201cin no realistic position to maintain the home\u201d on those terms while also meeting his post-divorce support obligations and his own reasonable living expenses. Furthermore, the court reasoned that \u201c[m]aintaining this level of financial obligation ... could lead to a stressful situation which could impact\u201d the couple\u2019s son. The court also reasoned that, because \u201cthe parties ha[d] no other liquid assets that could be used to satisfy creditors,\u201d both parties might benefit from an earlier sale of the home. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Accordingly, laying out all of the factors and considerations, the Court will order use and possession of the family home and family use personal property to wife until February 1, 2016. That term allows [the parties\u2019 minor daughter] to graduate, [the parties\u2019 son] to get halfway through his junior year, and wife almost a year to transition to a new home without having major changes occur over the holidays at the end of 2015.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In her brief, Wife complains that the court could have chosen other \u201c[m]ore palatable options[.]\u201d She asserts that \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s award appears entirely focused on the needs of Husband[J\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Upon any fair reading of the circuit court\u2019s actual opinion, it does not \u201cappear[]\u201d that way at all. The court struck a reasonable balance between, on one hand, the best interests of the children and Wife\u2019s interest in using the home as her dwelling, and, on the other hand, the hardship that would be imposed on Husband, as the party with financial responsibility for the home. Nothing in this well-reasoned ruling can be described as anything remotely resembling an abuse of judicial discretion. <em>See Bussell v. Bussell, </em>194 Md.App. 137, 159, 3 A.3d 480 (2010).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Our central conclusion in this opinion is that we cannot uphold the court\u2019s award of rehabilitative alimony in the amount of $1,800 per month for 15 years. Further proceedings are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The court may accept additional evidence about each party\u2019s actual or potential income, including evidence about their incomes since the original trial. The parties should supplement the record with enough additional information for the court to evaluate all of the considerations under FL \u00a7 11-106(b) and (c). Specifically, the evidence must address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>unresolved issues about whether Wife is currently self-supporting, what level of income she would need to become self-supporting, whether she needs any period of additional training or education to gain suitable employment, how much she can reasonably be expected to earn in her progress toward becoming self-supporting, and how much time she would need to achieve that progress. If necessary, the court should exercise its power under Md. Rule 5-706 to appoint a vocational rehabilitation expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">After resolving the factual issues, the court should examine all necessary factors and exercise its independent judgment to determine the appropriate amount and period of an award under FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) and (c). If the court determines that a fixed term is appropriate, it should explain the duration based on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Even if the court expects Wife to become self-supporting in the near future, the court should fully analyze whether indefinite alimony is appropriate under FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c)(2). Based on all of the evidence, the court should predict the parties\u2019 future incomes and standards of living at the time when Wife will have made maximum progress toward becoming self-supporting and then compare their living standards at that time. If the court finds that their respective standards of the parties will be unconscionably disparate, then the court should award indefinite alimony in an amount sufficient to alleviate the remaining disparity. <em>See Solomon, </em>383 Md. at 197-201, 857 A.2d 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">After resolving Wife\u2019s alimony claim consistent with this opinion, the court should re-assess the parties\u2019 child support obligations. In light of any revised findings and rulings on alimony, the court should also re-assess (as needed) its rulings on the related issues of monetary award and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HAR-FORD COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.

The minimum wage increased to $8.25 per hour on July 1, 2015. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl.VoI., 2015 Supp.), \u00a7 3-413(c) of the Labor and Employment Article.

A person may become self-supporting before that person reaches a maximum income potential. It is probably more difficult to project a person's entire career arc than it is to predict when a person can be expected to attain a particular threshold of self-sufficiency. Future expectations of income growth after self-sufficiency are still relevant, but only for evaluating whether the remaining disparity is unconscionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\">. To guide the proceedings on remand, an additional comment is appropriate. The court emphasized that a \u201cmajor problem with the family\u2019s financial picture [wajs the $2,814 mortgage for the marital home[.]\u201d The court permitted Wife to occupy the home until February 2016 and ordered Husband to assume financial responsibility for the home until that time. When the trial court calculated child support, it accounted for the large financial shift at the end of the use and possession period. For reasons not fully explained in the opinion, however, the court does not appear to have accounted for that event in its alimony award. Before February 2016, Wife\u2019s standard of living would be temporarily enhanced by living rent-free in a four-bedroom home worth nearly a half a million dollars. After February 2016, however, she would need to pay for her own housing, in addition to paying for her other basic living expenses (and possibly her own health insurance), her minimum support obligations to her minor son, and taxes on her wages and alimony received. On the other hand, Husband will gain several thousand dollars in extra funds each month once the house was sold. In sum, Wife's standard of living will plunge and her financial needs will increase at the end of the use and possession period, while Husband\u2019s financial obligations will decrease and his ability to pay alimony will increase. The family home was so central to the parties\u2019 relative positions that the court should consider and explain the amount of alimony in light of the orders as to use and possession of the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\">. On remand, the court should account for the disposition of the family home when making its alimony and child support rulings. <em>See supra </em>note 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
