(Retired, Specially Assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Appellant, 1st Team Fitness, LLC (1st Team) brought this action, directly and derivatively, on behalf of Pozzuoli, LLC (Pozzuoli), against the appellee, Francesco Illiano (Illiano).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Each of these parties was a fifty percent member in Pozzuoli. On counts charging intentional misrepresentation-concealment or non-disclosure, constructive fraud, breach of contract and conversion-embezzlement, the Circuit Court for Carroll County, at a bench trial, awarded Pozzuoli, LLC (hereinafter sometimes called the Gym) compensatory damages of $527,831, of which $263,915 were awarded directly to 1st Team. Appellant is aggrieved because the circuit court did not award punitive damages or counsel fees or litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The circuit court also appointed a receiver for Pozzuoli, LLC. By a separate brief, Pozzuoli, through its receiver, joins in requesting a reversal and remand on the punitive damages issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Illiano has cross-appealed and asserts that the circuit court abused its discretion in failing to find a discovery violation by 1st Team, arising out of its allegedly untimely disclosure of the opinion expressed by the accounting expert called by 1st Team at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Illiano, through BAIA, LLC, owned the premises located at 1311 South Main Street in Mt. Airy. In March 2009, Illiano, through his then solely owned LLC, Pozzuoli, acquired a franchise from SNAP Fitness, Inc. (SNAP Fitness) to operate a SNAP fitness center on the lower level of those premises. The facility opened in September 2009. One Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars in startup costs were loaned to the Gym by Illiano from funds obtained from other business entities that he owned, wholly or partially. The Gym hired a manager and engaged Donald Caparotti (Don) and Diane Caparotti (Diane), who are husband and wife, to be fitness trainers. The Caparottis rendered those services through their LLC, 1st Team. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>initially was paid 75% of the training fees with the remaining 25% retained by the Gym.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The original manager\u2019s services, however, proved unsatisfactory and, effective January 1, 2010, the Caparottis and Illiano entered into the agreement that underlies this litigation, namely, the operating agreement for Pozzuoli, LLC by and between Illiano and 1st Team. Its relevant features included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u2022 Illiano and 1st Team each had 50% interests in the Gym. The operating agreement recited initial cash capital contributions of $100 per member, but those amounts were not actually paid. 1st Team paid no monetary consideration for its 50% interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u2022 Don and Diane would manage the fitness center, ordinarily working no less than a combined 50 hours per week, for which they would retain 100% of the personal training fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">\u2022 Illiano would be the managing member. In his sole discretion, he would determine the amount of cash available for distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u2022 Illiano had \u201cfull, exclusive and complete discretion, power and authority in operating the [Gym\u2019s] business,\u201d including \u201cdetermining] the accounting methods and procedures of the [Gym].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">\u2022 Illiano was to \u201ckeep ... full and true books of account, in which shall be entered fully and accurately each transaction of the [Gym].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">\u2022 The books of account were to be open to inspection by members during regular business hours and were to be available online if the Managing Member maintained the books in a manner allowing that access.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">\u2022 There was no restriction on members engaging in other businesses and the Gym was unrestricted in dealing with businesses owned by or affiliated with a member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">\u2022 Each member had a right of first refusal in the event of a sale of the other member\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u2022 The members agreed that Illiano had loaned $140,000 to the Gym prior to the date of the Operating Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">After several months of operations, the Caparottis began fielding complaints from vendors and employees that they had not been paid. Nor was the couple receiving payment for personal training. In April 2010, they first received financials for the Gym and thereafter received them sporadically. None of the reports had supporting details. After repeated requests for a meeting, the Caparottis met with Illiano in early 2011, but the same circumstances continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">For some eighteen months after June 2011, 1st Team received no financials, despite repeated requests. Personal training fees were received only intermittently.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In November 2012, Illiano met with Don and Diane and advised that he was discussing selling the Gym to SNAP Fitness. The couple objected and asserted that they would exercise the right of first refusal that 1st Team had under the Operating Agreement. Illiano agreed that he would not sell and he broke off the negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">On Sunday, March 3, 2013, Illiano asked Don to meet in the former\u2019s office. Illiano told Don that he had sold the Gym to SNAP Fitness. The circuit court found as a fact that Illiano told Don that \u201cit\u2019s nothing personal, I can\u2019t afford to lose my empire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The \u201cEmpire\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">English is not Illiano\u2019s first language. He testified with a \u201cheavy accent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since coming to the Mt. Airy area, he has acquired numerous business interests. Interests held by Illiano as of January 1, 2010, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">\u2022 BAIA, LLC, owning real estate assessed in excess of $13,000,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">\u2022 Ridgewill, LLC, owning interests in two commercial properties that are leased;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u2022 The Mt. Airy Inn, a restaurant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u2022 Napoli, Inc., a pizza restaurant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u2022 Lenanos, LLC, owning the Mt. Airy Green Turtle, a restaurant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u2022 Germantown Green Turtle, a restaurant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Illiano has \u201csilent partners\u201d in BAIA, Lenanos, the German-town Green Turtle and the Mt. Airy Inn, but he controls each of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Illiano views each component of the \u201cempire\u201d as a company owned by him. Illiano testified that if there were bills to be paid by one company, but it did not have cash to pay the bill, he would take the money from another company and put it back later. From a bookkeeping standpoint, this was recorded through an account that was added to the QuickBooks computerized accounting system utilized by the companies. That account was labeled \u201cDue to/from Frank.\u201d The bookkeeper employed by Illiano Properties, which was the management corporation for the \u201cempire,\u201d testified that there were twenty entities wholly or partially owned by Illiano. That witness also testified that she did not handle the intra-company transfers of funds and explained, \u201cFrank would take care of those kinds of transactions himself.\u201d She would cut checks at his direction. The \u201cDue to/from Frank\u201d account had been used for at least ten years since the QuickBooks system was initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The Empire In Peril</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">On direct examination, Illiano had testified that the reason for the sale of the Gym was its lack of profitability. On cross-examination, he was impeached by certified copies of court records of creditors\u2019 suits against businesses in the empire. Illiano\u2019s lender, on February 14, 2013, entered a confessed judgment against him, his wife and various of his companies for roughly three-quarters of a million dollars. Illiano acknowledged that immediately after those judgments were entered, he contacted SNAP Fitness to sell the Gym. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>also sued by at least one other bank. In addition, the federal and state governments imposed tax liens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The Sale</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The sale of the Gym closed Friday, March 1, 2013, pursuant to documents executed that day. It was a sale of the assets of Pozzuoli. The purchase price was $410,000. After deductions for the payoff of leases on equipment ($144,211.55) and for a holdback, Pozzuoli netted a total of $260,958.45 that was wired by SNAP Fitness to the Gym\u2019s account at Damascus Community Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">At the meeting between Illiano and Don on Sunday, March 3, following the sale, the former told the latter that one-half of the net proceeds from the sale, after expenses and liabilities, was approximately $55,000. Illiano requested that Don execute a release on behalf of 1st Team, before paying 1st Team\u2019s share of the net proceeds. Don refused, and the share was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">After this matter was in litigation, Illiano produced four statements that purported to account for the $410,000 paid for the assets of Pozzuoli. In addition to the payoff of $144,211.55 on the equipment lease and holdback offsets of $4,830, the statements claimed expenses for legal fees, property taxes, a $63,667 balance on \u201cLoan to Frank,\u201d reconciliations with the landlord (BAIA, LLC), a brokerage/consulting fee of 10% (to an Illiano company) and \u201cunbilled\u201d startup costs for the Gym claimed to have been paid by Illiano Properties. The 1st Team share of the net, after expenses, per these statements, ranged from $61,352.76 to a loss of $21,407.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The damages theory adopted by the court did not require addressing the legal enforceability of these offsets, claimed by Illiano, against the amounts wired to Pozzuoli by SNAP Fitness, as we explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The Damages Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The Caparottis engaged a forensic accountant, Andrew Runge, to analyze the accounting for the sale proceeds. This ultimately led him to the \u201cDue to/from Frank\u201d bookkeeping account and to the Pozzuoli checking account at Damascus Community Bank. The buyer had wired $255,788.45 on March 1, 2013, to the Pozzuoli checking account. That same day, Pozzuoli purchased, for eight dollars, a Treasurer\u2019s check for $200,000 payable to BAJA, LLC. The net of $5,170 from the asset purchase holdback was wired to Pozzuoli\u2019s bank account no later than May 13, 2013. On May 30, 2013, a Treasurer\u2019s check was purchased from that account for $5,000, payable to \u201cIlliano Property, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Mr. Runge analyzed the Pozzuoli checking account for the period beginning with 1st Team\u2019s acquisition of a 50% interest in the Gym, <em>i.e., </em>from January 1, 2009. In the three years between March 2010 and March 2013, there were sixteen checks drawn, totaling $422,612, for which a Pozzuoli business purpose was not noted in the records. Of these, fifteen were payable to Damascus Community Bank, almost all of which were to purchase Treasurer\u2019s checks. The Treasurer\u2019s checks, in turn, were payable to entities in the \u201cempire.\u201d Mr. Runge was \u201cunclear as to why [Treasurer\u2019s checks] would be employed other than to potentially obviscate [obfuscate] the source of these funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Runge\u2019s analysis of the \u201cDue to/from Frank\u201d account on the books of Pozzuoli, for a comparable period, lists, in small, single-spaced print, over three 8 pages, transactions that are classified as \u201cWithdrawals\u201d or \u201cInfusions.\u201d There was a total of $567,949.97 in withdrawals. \u201c[B]ased on what [he] was able to verify or look at,\u201d Runge opined that \u201cthat $567,949.97 went out of the account and there was not documentation provided to demonstrate that that was in fact a valid expense of Pozzuoli.\u201d Runge\u2019s analysis totaled the infusions at $282,702.04. These had been deposited to the Pozzuoli account \u201cand looked like [they were] not revenue attributable to Pozzuoli.\u201d Runge also opined that additional credits against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the excess of withdrawals over infusions should be given for one-half of Pozzuoli\u2019s net income shown on its tax returns for 2010-2012 and for the $140,000 agreed upon in the operating agreement statement as Illiano\u2019s startup loans. Thus, the net claim against Illiano on the transactions processed through the \u201cDue to/from Frank\u201d account on the books of Pozzuoli was $105,219.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Thus, the judgment awarded to 1st Team was $422,612 + $105,219 x 1/2 = $263,915.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Fact Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The circuit court decided this case in a fifty-two page opinion. It found that Illiano\u2019s \u201cbreaches and misrepresentations\u201d included the following (exhibit references omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201c1) Failure to keep and maintain full and true books of account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\u201c2) Extreme mismanagement of company funds, books and records in violation of common law fiduciary duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">\u201c3) Failure to provide 1st Team Fitness access to the Pozzuoli online QuickBooks account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">\u201c4) Failure to provide 1st Team Fitness access to the financial and accounting records of Pozzuoli, despite many repeated requests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">\u201c5) Failure to deposit or invest all Pozzuoli funds in the company name;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">\u201c6) Taking $105,219 in excess withdrawals from the Pozzuoli bank account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">\u201c7) Causing $422,612 in funds to be removed from the Pozzuoli bank account, which transactions were not entered into the Pozzuoli accounting records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">\u201c8) Causing $422,612 in Pozzuoli funds to be deposited into not fewer than nine (9) other companies owned by Defendant, most of which Defendant testified had no business relationship with Pozzuoli LLC;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-16\">\u201c9) Intentionally commingling Pozzuoli funds with his other business entities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u201c10) Treating business funds as his own personal funds, including treating the Pozzuoli bank account as his own;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201c11) Failing to disclose his actions, much less seek majority or supermajority consent, with regard to the sale of the Pozzuoli assets to SNAP Corporate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\u201c12) Causing all or substantially all of the Pozzuoli assets to be sold to SNAP Corporate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\u201c13) Failing to disclose to SNAP Corporate during deal discussions of the existence of 1st Team Fitness as a member in Pozzuoli; (Defendant testified that he always treated 1st Team Fitness as a member and at his deposition, claimed he didn\u2019t realize 1st Team Fitness was not a member until the lawsuit was initiated, some four (4) months after [representing to SNAP] that he was the sole member);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">\u201c14) Creating unsubstantiated expenses to be subtracted from the sale proceeds in an effort to increase his share of the proceeds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\u201c15) Creating more unsubstantiated expenses to drive the Sales Price Less Expenses values down as the litigation continued;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">\u201c16) Taking a guaranteed payment in the amount of $45,799 in 2011 not also paid to 1st Team Fitness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">\u201c17) Refusing to turn over any money from sales proceeds to 1st Team Fitness until the release was signed; (Defendant testified he did require the Caparottis to sign the release before he would give them any money from the sale);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">\u201c18) Failing to pay any portion of the sales proceeds from the March 1, 2013 asset sale to 1st Team Fitness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">\u201c19) Causing substantially all of the sales proceeds from the asset sale to be transferred to his company BAIA, LLC;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">\u201c20) Causing the sales proceeds to be further transferred from BAIA, LLC\u2019s bank account to eight (8) other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>entities owned by Defendant, most of which Defendant testified had no business relationship with Pozzuoli LLC.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Nevertheless, with respect to 1st Team\u2019s claim of fraud, in the sense of intentional misrepresentation, concealment or non-disclosure, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201cThe Court also concludes that, however ill-advised Illiano\u2019s actions were, Plaintiffs have not proven that they were done with the knowledge that the representations were false. Rather, the Court concludes that Illiano acted under the woefully misguided belief that he or his entities were entitled to withdraw funds from Pozzuoli as he saw fit, that he was entitled to sell all of Pozzuoli\u2019s assets, and that he was further entitled to create expenses of sale to justify that which he believed would result in a proper distribution of the sale proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Specifically relating to its conclusion not to award any punitive damages, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201cThe Court declines to find that Illiano acted with actual malice, and thus declines to award punitive damages in this case. A party seeking punitive damages must prove actual malice by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>150 Md.App. 18, 43-[5]3[, 818 A.2d 1159, 1173-1179] (2003), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>379 Md. 249[, 841 A.2d 828] (2004). An award of punitive damages must be based upon actual malice, in the sense of evil or wrongful motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud. <em>Tierco Md., Inc. v. Williams, </em>381 Md. 378, 849 A.2d 504 (2004). A breach of fiduciary duty alone does not establish actual malice. <em>Bresnahan v. Bresnahan, </em>115 Md.App. 226, 693 A .2d 1 (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">\u201cIt is true that the Court found that Illiano breached his fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs, and that such breach of fiduciary duty constituted intentional misrepresentation toward the Plaintiffs. Those findings alone are not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. A finding of fraud or deceit based on a defendant\u2019s <em>actual knowledge </em>that his represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tations were false coupled with an intent to deceive can and normally will justify an award of punitive damages. <em>Ellerin [v. Fairfax Sav., F.S.B., </em>337 Md. 216,] 240-41[, 652 A.2d 1117, 1129 (1995) ]. However, where a defendant\u2019s fraud or deceit is premised not on his actual knowledge o[f] falsity, but on his reckless disregard or indifference as to the truth of his representations, punitive damages are generally not recoverable. <em>Id., </em>at 235[, 652 A.2d at 1126]. Similarly, other conduct, recognized by the law and sometimes labeled \u2018fraud,\u2019 falls short of the act of deliberate deception required for actual malice in this context, and is not sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award. <em>[Id.] </em>at 235-36[, 652 A.2d at 1126]. For example while \u2018constructive fraud\u2019 has been recognized for certain purposes in Maryland, it does not necessarily involve the type of dishonest or immoral conduct that is required to support an award of punitive damages. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cAs indicated above, the Court finds that Illiano\u2019s actions, while done with an intent to deceive, where carried out with reckless indifference to and not actual knowledge that his representations were false. Accordingly, the Court declines to award punitive damages to the Plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Additional facts will be set forth in the discussion of particular issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"ARK\">Appellant, 1st Team, asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cI. Did the Circuit Court commit error by holding the record did not support a finding of actual malice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMm\">\u201cII. Did the Circuit Court commit error by failing to award attorneys\u2019 fees under the common fund doctrine?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Appellant Pozzuoli asks if the court applied the correct legal standard for awarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">On his cross-appeal, Illiano asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\u201cDid the trial court abuse its discretion in refusing a continuance and allowing the testimony of the Appellant\u2019s expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to opinions which were never disclosed in pre-trial discovery?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Appellants seek a remand, with directions to hold a hearing on, <em>inter alia, </em>punitive damages. 1st Team\u2019s argument focuses on two counts of the complaint, Count IX, Conversion/Embezzlement, and Count VI, Breach of Fiduciary Duty. As to Count IX, the court found that \u201cIlliano\u2019s actions, while done with an intent to deceive, [were] carried out with reckless indifference to and not actual knowledge that his representations were false.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">On the alleged claim for breach of fiduciary duty, as Count VI was labeled, the court held, citing <em>Kann v. Kann, </em>344 Md. 689, 690 A.2d 509 (1997), that that claim did not constitute a stand-alone cause of action, at .least where only monetary damages were sought as the remedy. Thus, no damages, compensatory or punitive, were awarded on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">There must be an award of compensatory damages, however, on each count that is sought to be the basis for an award of punitive damages. <em>See Caldor, Inc. v. Bowden, </em>330 Md. 632, 662-63, 625 A.2d 959, 973-74 (1993); <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Keulemans, </em>275 Md. 441, 340 A.2d 705 (1975); <em>Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Smith, </em>79 Md.App. 591, 639-40, 558 A.2d 768, 792-93 (1989) (holding that award of funeral expenses in personal representative\u2019s action satisfied the compensatory damage predicate for a punitive damage award on survival claim), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 620 A.2d 905 (1993). Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>we consider only appellant\u2019s argument based on the conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The principles controlling the award of punitive damages were set forth in <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992), where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he purposes of punitive damages relate entirely to the nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019 <em>Schaefer v. Miller, </em>322 Md. [297,] 321, 587 A.2d [491,] 503 [ (1990) ]. Whether the tort occurred before or after the formation of a contractual relationship should not determine whether actual or implied malice is required for allowing an award of punitive damages. Rather, the availability of a punitive damages award ought to depend upon the heinous nature of the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cAwarding punitive damages based upon the heinous nature of the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct furthers the historical purposes of punitive damages \u2014 punishment and deterrence. Thus, punitive damages are awarded in an attempt to punish a defendant whose conduct is characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, or fraud, and to warn others contemplating similar conduct of the serious risk of monetary liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 454, 601 A.2d at 649-50 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The Court also addressed the standard of proof.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">\u201cUse of a clear and convincing standard of proof will help to insure that punitive damages are properly awarded. We hold that this heightened standard is appropriate in the assessment of punitive damages because of their penal nature and potential for debilitating harm. Consequently, in <em>any </em>tort case a plaintiff must establish by clear and convincing evidence[,] the basis for an award of punitive damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 469, 601 A.2d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">In <em>Scott v. Jenkins, </em>345 Md. 21, 690 A.2d 1000 (1997), Judge Karwacki, writing for the Court some five years after <em>Zenobia, </em>in a case in which punitive damages were awarded by a jury that found the defendant liable for battery and false imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ment, said: \u201cLest there be any remaining doubt, in order to recover punitive damages in <em>any </em>tort action in the State of Maryland, facts sufficient to show <em>actual malice </em>must be pleaded and proven by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 345 Md. at 29, 690 A.2d at 1004. The punitive damage award in that case was stricken for failure to have plead sufficient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">1st Team\u2019s argument emphasizes that the court\u2019s finding of Illiano\u2019s liability for conversion included the net proceeds of the sale. There was no contract authorizing a ten percent broker\u2019s fee as a cost of sale and no documentation for certain other charges. The court found that \u201c[b]y creating false expenses, Illiano intentionally appropriated the sales proceeds and paid them to himself or nine (9) of his other business entities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Illiano refers us to the litigation culminating in <em>Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>379 Md. 249, 841 A.2d 828 (2004), a conversion case tried to a jury, in which an award of punitive damages was affirmed. There, the Court said, \u201cWhere the defendant converts property with a consciousness of the wrongfulness of that conversion, he or she possesses the requisite improper motive to justify the imposition of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 841 A.2d at 838. But, in <em>Beall v. Holloway-Johnson, </em>446 Md. 48, 72, 130 A.3d 406, 420 (2016), the Court said, \u201cReliance on an embedded \u2018malice implicit\u2019 in the elements of the intentional torts of the battery and Article 24 violations claims pushes our jurisprudence on punitive damages too far.\u201d And further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u201cBecause we have restricted punitive damage awards to cases where the conduct is \u2018characterized by knowing and deliberate wrongdoing,\u2019 a standard of \u2018malice implicit\u2019 would expose inappropriately defendants to punitive damages without requiring a plaintiff to prove actual malice and the required specific intent to injure by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 73, 130 A.3d at 420. This rationale applies to the intent satisfying a <em>prima facie </em>case of conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the record in this case was sufficient to permit a trier of fact to find the requisite improper motive \u201cto support awarding punitive damages,\u201d the trier of fact did not award punitive damages. In his exposition for this Court on inferred malice in conversion cases, <em>Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>150 Md.App. 18, 818 A.2d 1159 (2003), Judge Moylan explained that \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the conversion and the manner in which it was committed frequently provide a factual predicate from which actual malice can be, <em>though it need not be, </em>inferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 818 A.2d at 1168 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The Court of Appeals relied upon the same principle as an alternative ground of decision in <em>Adams v. Coates, </em>331 Md. 1, 626 A.2d 36 (1993). That case presented what was in essence an action for accounting between partners. The Court, assuming that breach of fiduciary duty could be treated as a tort that could be the springboard for punitive damages, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACQ\">\u201cIn any event, the trier of fact has discretion to deny punitive damages even where the record otherwise would support their award. <em>See Nast v. Lockett, </em>312 Md. 343, 349, 539 A.2d 1113, 1116 (1988), <em>overruled on other grounds, Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 460, 601 A.2d at 652; <em>Dennis v.

[losses] he suffered, you may, <em>but are not required to, </em>award him an additional amount as punitive damages.\u2019 (Emphasis added)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, 626 A.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The <em>Darcars Motors </em>litigation also made plain that, even if the case for punitive damages may be considered by the trier of fact, the trier of fact must be convinced to the level of clear and convincing persuasion that actual malice motivated the tort. 379 Md. at 267, 841 A.2d at 839. \u201cAs a function of persuasion, the juror must feel that the circumstances of the tort were so egregious or the motivation of the tortfeasor so outrageous as to call for the sterner sanction.\u201d <em>Holloway-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Johnson v. Beall, </em>220 Md.App. 195, 223, 103 A.3d 720, 739 (2014), <em>aff'd in part and rev. in part on other grounds, </em>446 Md. 48, 130 A.3d 406 (2016). Here, 1st Team was unable to convince the trier of fact to that level of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The receiver for Pozzuoli attempts to cast an entirely different light on the record. That appellant\u2019s position is that the court committed an error of law. The argument is that the fifty-plus page opinion erroneously explains why the court could not award punitive damages, even though the court may have been desperately straining to do so. The court\u2019s opinion undercuts the receiver\u2019s position. The portion of the opinion that directly addresses punitive damages opens: \u201cThe Court declines to find that Illiano acted with actual malice[.]\u201d To \u201cdecline\u201d connotes the rejection of that which is offered or available. Further, the court cited to <em>Darcars Motors </em>from both appellate courts, so the court was well aware that its ultimate verdict must be by clear and convincing persuasion. But, as the court fully explained, it was not persuaded that Illiano acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We note, moreover, that there was evidence tending to prove that Illiano\u2019s conversion of 1st Team\u2019s property was not motivated by actual malice against it, Don or Diane. Don testified that, at the March 3, 2013 meeting, Illiano told him that the sale of the Gym assets was \u201cnothing personal\u201d but was done to save the \u201cempire.\u201d In addition, Illiano offered $55,000 in payment of 1st Team\u2019s share of the net proceeds, upon execution of a release, but Don declined. It was only after the relationship was in litigation that Illiano began asserting setoffs. Even then, the four accountings of the net sale proceeds consistently presented a $63,667 item, labeled, \u201cBalance on Loan to Frank,\u201d as a setoff against 1st Team\u2019s share. Illiano explained that that setoff was the balance, after partial payments by Pozzuoli of $76,333, on the $140,000 loan by (or through) Illiano to start the Gym. Thus, the argument that the four accountings present spurious setoffs and thereby evil motive is ambiguous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>There was no error or abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s declining to award punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Ordinarily, under the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d on attorney\u2019s fees, each party pays its own counsel fees and expenses. <em>Accubid Excavation, Inc. v. Kennedy Contractors, Inc., </em>188 Md.App. 214, 230, 981 A.2d 727, 737 (2009). 1st Team\u2019s other contention, however, is that the legal fees and litigation expenses incurred by it should be paid out of the common fund created by the litigation. Dobbs, Law of Remedies, \u00a7 3.10(2), at 393 (1993), explains the common fund rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\u201cWhen a prevailing plaintiffs litigation produces or preserves a fund in which others share, those who share in the fund must share as well in the cost of producing it. They are therefore responsible for a proportionate part of the attorney fee and other reasonable costs of the litigation. This burden is imposed by deducting the fee from the fund itself and then distributing the fund to those entitled to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ann\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The issue arises procedurally out of the following facts. 1st Team sued in its own right and derivatively on behalf of Pozzuoli. In its written closing argument, 1st Team submitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201cPlaintiffs request!, <em>inter </em>alia,] this Court enter judgment as follows: (1) compensatory damages in the amount of $527,831, entered against Defendant and in favor of Pozzuoli, LLC, AND half of that amount, $263,915, awarded against Defendant and in favor of 1st Team Fitness, LLC; [and] attorneys\u2019 fees based upon 1st Team Fitness, LLC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>derivative actions on behalf of Pozzuoli, LLC under the common-fund doctrine, amount to be determined upon further application to this court[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Illiano did not respond to the attorneys\u2019 fee issue because the court had stated that it would reserve on those issues \u201cuntil after it had decided the substantive claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The court ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d and awarded compensatory damages \u201cto the Plaintiff, Pozzuoli, LLC in the amount of $527,831, and half of that amount, $263,915 is awarded against Defendant and in favor of 1st Team Fitness, LLC.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One interpretation of the court\u2019s order is that 1st Team could proceed either under a derivative judgment or a direct judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The order did not mention counsel fees but stated that \u201cany other relief not expressly granted herein is denied.\u201d 1st Team sought reconsideration, which was denied. Appellant also sought the appointment of a receiver, which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">These two motions by 1st Team reveal that there were no assets of Pozzuoli to be administered; thus, no bond was required. 1st Team requested \u201cthat the receiver be directed to compensate Plaintiff 1st Team Fitness, on a priority basis, only behind the administrative claim of the receiver himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees expended to obtain the award.\u201d These fees would be paid from \u201cany funds recovered by the receiver for the estate of Pozzuoli as a result of the legal efforts ... to obtain the award derivatively on behalf of Pozzuoli LLC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In other words, 1st Team wants to pass through Pozzuoli all of the payments on the judgment, to the full principal amount of $527,831. Because 1st Team has opted to act under the derivative alternative of the order for judgment, presumably the contention is that 100% of the fee is to be deducted from the collections for Pozzuoli before any distribution would be made to 1st Team and before Illiano could assert that the distribution to him is a wash, because he would be the source of the funds and would be paying himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">1st Team\u2019s gambit is not an appropriate use of the common fund exception to the American rule. The common fund exception \u201cawards expenses when a plaintiff has successfully maintained a suit, usually on behalf of a class, that benefits a group of others in the same manner as the plaintiff.\u201d W.M. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations, \u00a7 6045, at 312 (2004 rev. ed). The rule \u201cis grounded in restitutionary considerations. Those who share the fund would be unjustly enriched if they could take the benefit without the burden.\u201d Dobbs, Laws of Remedies, \u00a7 3.10(2), at 395 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Here, this litigation resulted in a liability, not a benefit to Illiano. Nor can the result be viewed as a benefit to Pozzuoli in which Illiano would share. Pozzuoli is defunct. It has no assets. 1st Team does not propose to use any recovery from Illiano to reinvest it in Pozzuoli and revive the Gym.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Unlike a case in which a third party is the source of the fund, here the fund is the result of Illiano\u2019s liability. Certainly with respect to the counsel fee, to which 1st Team would accord priority in distribution, the two members of Pozzuoli are not a class that receives the same benefit. 1st Team would have its share of the fee and expenses incurred by the attorneys whom it engaged paid by Illiano, its adversary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>through the conduit of the receivership. But, Illiano is subject to the American rule on counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Nor are the members of the supposed class treated the same with respect to the distribution to members. Assume that y = the derivative judgment principal amount of $527,831, plus post judgment interest; and x = the allowed amount of counsel fees and costs. Then: (y-x) 2 = the theoretical distribution to each member of Pozzuoli. But, 1st Team would receive its distribution in cash, paid by Illiano, while Illiano would not receive any cash distribution, because he would be the source of the cash to begin with.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Professor Dobbs succinctly dispatches 1st Team\u2019s contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">\u201cRecovery of fees under the common fund rule is special because it is a recovery against allies, not adversaries. It is not fee shifting but fee sharing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.10(2), at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">1st Team refers us to <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>73 Md. 530, 21 A. 712 (1891), for the proposition that the common fund rule can apply where a shareholder suffers a detriment, namely, restoring to the corporation an asset wrongly diverted by him. <em>Davis </em>is distinguishable from the instant matter, because the corporation continued in business, all of the shareholders, including the disloyal officer who had appropriated a corporate opportunity, shared equally in the benefit of the recovery, and, under the peculiar facts of that case, the fee was for counsel engaged by the disloyal officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">In <em>Davis, </em>North Branch Company operated a coal mine. It had three shareholders, William A. Brydon, the majority owner, Thomas Gemmell, and Malcolm Sinclair. Brydon, for his own account, sold $75,000 worth of coal to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. He had to sue to obtain a judgment for that amount, which he assigned to Henry G. Davis &amp; Co. The minority shareholders in North Branch then sued, contending that the judgment belonged to North Branch, and seeking other relief. The B <em>&amp; </em>O paid the money into court. After an appeal that sustained an injunction, <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>70 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>356, 17 A. 259 (1889), the minority shareholders amended their complaint to request, <em>inter alia, </em>that a receiver be appointed and North Branch be wound up. The defendants, Brydon and Henry G. Davis <em>&amp; </em>Co., as well as the corporation, North Branch, \u201cvigorously resisted the appointment of a receiver and the winding up of the corporation.\u201d <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>73 Md. at 535, 21 A. at 713. The circuit court found that the judgment was North Branch\u2019s property and referred the matter to an auditor to state an account distributing the amount of the judgment. The Court declined to order dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The attorneys who had represented Brydon in the original litigation were allowed a fee out of the fund. The Court reasoned that the minority \u201cstood by and saw the work done, ... and they cannot now be heard in a court of equity to except to that work being paid for out of the fund realized by the labor of these gentlemen, especially when they themselves, these exceptants, are seeking to reap the benefit of that very work and labor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 21 A. at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">After addressing the claims of other creditors of North Branch, the Court directed that the balance \u201cbelongs to the stockholders of the North Branch Company, and must be audited to them ratably, according to their respective holdings of the stock of the company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 21 A. at 718. Thus, Brydon shared in the net recovery in proportion to his stock-holdings in North Branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Unlike in <em>Davis, </em>it is unclear how Illiano could derive any benefit from the funds procured by 1st Team on behalf of Pozzuoli \u2014 a company with no assets and no ongoing operations. The award is purely a liability insofar as Illiano is concerned. Consequently, in the case before us the common fund theory is not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Illiano\u2019s cross-appeal focuses on the \u201coff-the-books\u201d component of the damage calculation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He says that 1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Team\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion at trial should have been limited to a figure opined by that witness at his deposition. On deposition, Runge said that 1st Team\u2019s share of the net proceeds of sale should have been roughly $190,000.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Illiano compares $190,000 to the half of $422,612 that Runge used at trial in his damage calculation of the off-the-books transactions. Illiano says that there was a discovery violation because 1st Team did not supplement its discovery and that he was prejudiced thereby. His requested relief is a remand and further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The trial was conducted on four days, October 27 through October 30, 2014. On the second day of trial, Runge began his testimony. On direct, 1st Team introduced Exhibit 127, a list of checks drawn on the Pozzuoli account, payable to Damascus Community Bank, and totaling $422,612. Runge explained that he had asked for source documentation but had not received \u201csource documentation that would allow [him] to determine what they were actually for and if they were in fact for valid expenses of Pozzuoli LLC.\u201d There was no objection to Exhibit 127 or to this testimony. Fifty-seven pages of transcript later, on the third page of Runge\u2019s cross-examination, he testified \u201cthat what [he] believe[d] that what [1st Team] would be entitled to from the sale <em>is in </em>what I have opined about which is <em>the off book transactions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Illiano then asked for a continuance, claiming surprise because, on deposition, Runge had testified $190,000 was due 1st Team from the proceeds of sale. 1st Team explained that the sale proceeds had been included in a list of off-the-books checks that had been presented as early as June 2014 at a show cause hearing. Illiano said that that list contained checks written after the Gym had closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The court refused a continuance and directed that cross-examination proceed. It ruled that \u201cif the Court believes at the conclusion of Mr. Runge\u2019s testimony that the Court should limit his opinions to those which were given in his deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>then I will make a determination that that time.\u201d The plaintiffs case concluded on the third trial day with the balance of Runge\u2019s testimony. Illiano did not move to limit Runge\u2019s damage figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Illiano presented the alleged discovery violation in his written post-trial argument. The Court did not explicitly address limiting Runge\u2019s evidence and thereby rejected it, per the last paragraph of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Runge\u2019s deposition had been taken July 14, 2014. Quoted in Illiano\u2019s post-trial argument in the circuit court is the question put to Runge on deposition that produced the response on which the discovery violation argument rests. Counsel asked: \u201c \u2018If the trial in this case were to occur <em>today, </em>what is the amount that you contend <em>is owed </em>to the Caparottis?\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">There is no discovery violation. Runge was deposed about one month before 1st Team took the deposition of a representative of Damascus Community Bank. Documents produced by the bank revealed that the checks payable to the bank were used to buy Treasurer\u2019s checks made payable to various entities in the \u201cempire.\u201d At trial, Runge explained, \u201cAnd now, looking at all of this, with all these company transfers, now you need to go back to each one of these individual companies.\u201d \u201c[Yjou\u2019re still stymied because you have to go further and further.\u201d The expert was also waiting for the source documents from Illiano that would explain the legitimacy of the off book transactions. He said \u201cdocuments were not turned over until a week before trial, a couple of days before trial.\u201d But, he \u201cnever received the source documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Even if there were a discovery violation, there is no prejudice to Illiano. Runge tacked into the accounting engagement from the standpoint of investigating the distribution due to Pozzuoli members from the sale proceeds. At trial, he presented those proceeds as part of the larger claim involving disbursements that were paid to Damascus Community Bank without recording in the books of Pozzuoli any purpose, much less one related to that LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>There was no surprise or sandbagging. A listing of Pozzuoli checks to Damascus Community Bank was furnished by 1st Team in discovery (Bates No. \u201cFitness 1765\u201d). 1st Team represents, without contradiction, that that list was produced at a show cause hearing held on June 5, 2014, apparently on alleged discovery violations. That list (Ex. 66 at trial) totaled $451,910.50.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">A listing of Pozzuoli checks to Damascus Community Bank was also produced by 1st Team (Ex. 67 at trial) at Runge\u2019s deposition on July 14, 2004. That listing totaled $558,958.50 (and included checks written to Damascus as late as January 9, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">At trial, 1st Team <em>reduced </em>the claim on unsubstantiated disbursements to the bank to $422,612, principally by eliminating a number of checks dated March 2013 and later from the earlier lists (Ex. 127 at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">There is no difference, as a matter of Illiano\u2019s liability, between unsubstantiated disbursements from Pozzuoli recorded in the books of the LLC as \u201cDue to/from Frank\u201d and unsubstantiated disbursements from Pozzuoli to Damascus Community Bank. The former disappeared somewhere into the \u201cempire\u201d while, in the latter form of disbursement, we know which province of the \u201cempire\u201d was the destination of each Treasurer\u2019s check. Neither type of transaction informed the court on the business purpose, <em>vis-d-vis </em>Pozzuoli. Illiano could hardly have been prejudiced by 1st Team\u2019s treating, at trial, the \u201coff-the-books\u201d checks as subject to the same legal principles as the \u201cDue to/from Frank\u201d entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">For all these reasons, we affirm all appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY ON THE APPEALS OF 1ST TEAM FITNESS, LLC AND OF THE RECEIVER FOR POZZUOLI, LLC, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY ON THE CROSS-APPEAL OF FRANCESCO ILLIANO AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">COSTS TO BE PAID 2/3 BY THE APPELLANTS AND 1/3 BY THE CROSS-APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-12\">.
