W.Y. (\u201cW\u201d) was a juvenile (he\u2019s now over 18) who pled involved to his most recent set of charges and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>was adjudicated delinquent. Using a form order edited by hand, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County ordered W placed in a facility in Pennsylvania; he contends on appeal that the process and findings underlying the placement decision failed to comply with FL \u00a7 5-607. In the time since the court entered its order, W completed the out-of-state program, and we agree with both parties that the case is moot. Nevertheless, there are no reported Maryland appellate opinions to guide the juvenile courts in their application of this statute, and because the issues are important and likely to evade review, we find this an appropriate case to exercise our discretion to address the merits of W\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">W has a long history with the juvenile justice system. He was first adjudicated delinquent on March 13, 2012, also by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, after pleading involved to a count of robbery. While wearing a black ski mask and wielding what the victim believed to be a handgun (later found to be a BB gun), W demanded the victim\u2019s book bag and laptop. The victim recognized W from prior encounters, and even called W by name during the robbery. When police officers stopped him shortly after the incident, W admitted to the robbery and consented to a search of his home, during which the victim\u2019s property was recovered. The court, sitting as a juvenile court, committed W to the Department of Juvenile Services (\u201cDJS\u201d) and recommended a Level B placement, which in Prince George\u2019s County meant a staff-secured, non-community residential facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DJS placed W at the Victor Cullen Center<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Sabillasville, Frederick County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Maryland, where he remained from May 2, 2012 until he was successfully discharged on October 17, 2012. Upon discharge, the juvenile court rescinded the commitment order and placed W on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">W was arrested again in the early hours of May 26, 2014. Police found W sitting on the steps of a townhome in Land-over, Maryland, and approached him because he matched the description of the suspect in a nearby robbery. As they neared, W stood up, drew a .38 caliber handgun (containing three live rounds) from the waistband of his pants, threw the gun to the ground, and began to walk away. When questioned by the officers, W said the weapon was his, but \u201c[he] wasn\u2019t going to do anything with it\u201d and further stated that he had no knowledge of or involvement in the robbery. He was indicted as an adult, but his case was waived to the juvenile court. W again admitted to his actions, and again pled involved, this time to possession of a regulated firearm by a person under age 21. The court also found W in violation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The court held a hearing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on October 20, 2014 to review W\u2019s detention status; W was present with his attorney. The judge told W\u2019s attorney to \u201clet [W] know he may not be going home.\u201d W then interjected: \u201cAnd I\u2019m getting a lot better, out of the prison.\u201d The court turned its attention to the attorneys to schedule a hearing for the following month, then adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">At an adjudicatory hearing on November 18, 2014, the court accepted W\u2019s plea of involved, and asked him to explain his actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Young man, why did you do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">[W]: It was an honest mistake, Your Honor. I really - shouldn\u2019t have done this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">THE COURT: Okay. So, why did you do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>[W]: There is no explanation for why I did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">THE COURT: Okay. So, why did you do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">[W]: I just \u2014 I made an honest mistake. I tell you the reason why I did it would be an excuse ... and there is no excuse for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">THE COURT: So, why did you do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">[W]: I was being a bonehead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">THE COURT: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">[W]: I was being a knucklehead, thinking that I could get away with things I can\u2019t get away with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">THE COURT: Well, so why did you do it? You already had a robbery with a deadly weapon charge.... Now you [have] possession of a gun. Another one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">[THE STATE]: There was not a gun in the prior\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">[W]: I understand, Sir. I understand what I done. I apologize for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">THE COURT: No, I am just asking why did you do it. Because you are going to \u2014 you went to a placement, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-14\">[W]: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-15\">THE COURT: How can I release you back into the community?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-17\">THE COURT: No, let me stop you. I just asked \u2014 because if you don\u2019t change your lifestyle in what you are doing, you will end up dead out here____Or you going to end up killing somebody____ [L]ast time I asked you the same thing, why you walking around with a ski mask in the middle of the summer ... with a deadly weapon. I am just saying \u2014 you got to change. Would I give you a break and put you back in the community\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-21\">[W]: If I could say one thing on my behalf is that this charge and that I went to [detention] and understand that I could have faced even wors[e] charges and time for it. I[\u2019m] really mature, and my age and I know that it\u2019s time to stop playing games and do something with my life or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>I\u2019m going to throw it away. And I really don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not ready for my life \u2014 I got dreams and goals and things that I need to do. And with the support from my family that \u2014 I can\u2019t keep doing this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The judge then scheduled a December hearing with counsel and ordered W\u2019s detention in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">W\u2019s disposition hearing \u2014 the purpose of which was to determine W\u2019s level of placement, <em>ie., </em>whether he should remain in a level B facility or move to level A \u2014 took place on December 11, 2014. After an inaudible bench conversation, the State and W\u2019s attorney agreed that W should maintain his level B placement, while DJS requested a level A commitment. The judge questioned W about the incident, again emphasizing the similarities between his two arrests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">THE COURT: I am asking him a question because when is he going to learn his lesson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">[W]: I mean I can\u2019t make you believe me but \u2014 I honestly feel like that the lesson I learned when I was up in [detention] facing that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">THE COURT: Wait, whoa, whoa, wait, how long were you gone the other time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">[W]: Eight months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">THE COURT: And you didn\u2019t learn you lesson then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">[W]: I did. I just \u2014 I am telling you \u2014 I made a mistake, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">THE COURT: No, no, no. It is not a mistake when you ... put a gun in your hand. That\u2019s not a mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">[W]: It wasn\u2019t a mistake, it was more of a defense. But I should have went about it differently than what I did. And I can\u2019t really take it back now, I mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">THE COURT: So, what am I supposed to do with \u2014 the mistakes that you keep making?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">[W]: I accept any consequences, Sir. (Inaudible) on behalf of the mistakes that I know that (Inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-17\">THE COURT: You have any \u2014 the problem is you are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>[W]: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">THE COURT: I am not asking for a response. I am just\u2014 this is ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">[W]: I am ashamed of myself, too, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">THE COURT: Madam Clerk, the Court will in fact commit [W] to Level A. I agree, you got to stop this, young man. You are going to wind up getting yourself killed out here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">And since he has already been at Victor [Cullen Center] he is not going back to Victor [Cullen Center].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, can we have a review [hearing] for placement, it is just today \u2014 I am sorry, I just realized that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">THE COURT: No problem. You got [January 13, 2015].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">After the hearing, the court issued a written Disposition Order, dated December 11, 2015, which ordered that W \u201cbe and hereby is placed in Level A____\u201d The Order consisted of a template that stated the three classification levels for placement facilities \u2014 level A, B, and C \u2014 into which the judge inserted an additional limitation (which we have italicized):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlKn\">A \u2014 Secured <em>Facility </em>\u2014 [W] <em>is not be placed at Victor Cullen because he was placed there in 2012.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">* ^Equivalent facilities for the juvenile are not available in the State of Maryland; and institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the juvenile and will not produce undue hardship.* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">At the follow-up hearing on January 13, 2015, in a broken and mostly inaudible transcript, the court confirmed that DJS had not yet placed W, and the case was continued until January 20, 2015. On January 16, W filed a Motion to Modify Court Order and Request for a Hearing pursuant to Md. Rule 11-116, asking the court to strike the language italicized above from the Disposition Order. In this sixteen-page Motion, W asked the court to place him at the Victor Cullen Center, disputed the findings in the juvenile judge\u2019s Disposition Order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>and asked to be heard regarding his placement. We will discuss the facts and arguments set forth in this Motion in greater detail in the Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">At the January 20 hearing, counsel for W obtained a continuance to provide the juvenile judge an opportunity to review the January 16 motion. After agreeing on a hearing date, counsel for the State initiated another broken and inaudible\u2014 yet seemingly important \u2014 conversation regarding W\u2019s placement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, may I ask a quick question. It is about, [W] is likely to be placed at Mid-Atlantic prior to that, would he need to appear for [the next] hearing or if he can\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">THE COURT: If he is placed, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">[THE STATE]: So, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">THE COURT: Counsel, would you approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">(Whereupon, a Bench Conference [begins].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">THE COURT: Well, frankly I (Inaudible) placement. Anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">MS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">THE COURT: I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">MS.: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">THE COURT: Yes. I will probably rule on it some time this week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">MS.: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">THE COURT: Yes. And that (Inaudible) do whatever they want to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">[THE STATE]: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-20\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>[THE STATE]: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">MS.: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">THE COURT: No, (Inaudible). Somebody, it looked like it was filed late Friday, yes. Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">MS.: (Inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">(Whereupon, the Bench Conference was concluded.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">THE COURT: I am going to have it sent to Chambers today, [counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">[COUNSEL FOR W]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">(Whereupon, the hearing was concluded.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">At the conclusion of this January 20 hearing: (1) W had yet to be placed; (2) the juvenile judge had not reviewed W\u2019s Motion, nor addressed the requested hearing; (3) the parties agreed to return on February 2, 2015; and (4) the State indicated that W would be placed prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">On January 28, 2015, W was placed by DJS at the Mid-Atlantic Youth Service\u2019s Secure Male Program (\u201cMAYS\u201d) in Pittston Township, Pennsylvania. Two days later, the juvenile judge ruled on W\u2019s Motion to Modify Court Order and Request for a Hearing. When W filed the Motion on January 16, he had included a proposed order; the judge used the proposed order as a template, but modified it by crossing out portions shown below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">Having reviewed Respondent\u2019s Motion to Modify Court Order and Request For A Hearing and that Motion having merit, Respondent\u2019s Motion is hereby GRANTED. The following language shall be stricken from this Court\u2019s [Disposition Order]: \u201cRespondent not to be placed in Victor Cullen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The court signed the area indicated by the gray circle and at the bottom of the page, then dated the order January 30, 2015; it was entered on the docket on February 5, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">As directed, the parties reconvened on February 2. By this point, W was in Pennsylvania, but his counsel was present. After the State disclosed that W had been placed at MAYS, the court reset the case for October 15, 2015 for a permanency hearing. W filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Then, on October 7, 2015, the court rescinded the December 11, 2014 commitment order and placed W on probation, with conditions, and ordered him released on electronic monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">W does not dispute the finding of delinquency. Instead, he challenges his out-of-state placement, and specifically whether the disposition proceedings complied with FL \u00a7 5-607 and afforded him due process before the court placed him out of state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>W argues that he was denied due process because the court failed to notify him or his parents that it was contemplating an out-of-state placement, and thus denied him and his parents a meaningful opportunity to be heard on whether the contemplated placement was in his best interest or would pose an undue hardship on his family. <em>Second, </em>W claims that the juvenile court ignored the requirements of FL \u00a7 5-607 when it did not hear evidence or consider any facts before concluding that there was no equivalent facility in Maryland, that the MAYS placement was in his best interest, and that sending him to MAYS would not cause any undue hardship for his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision in a juvenile delinquency matter, \u201c[w]e review any conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>but apply the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact.\u201d <em>In re Elrich S., </em>416 Md. 15, 30, 5 A.3d 27 (2010). A decision regarding disposition is committed to the discretion of the trial judge and will be reversed only if there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Hamill, </em>10 Md.App. 586, 592, 271 A.2d 762 (1970). An abuse of discretion occurs \u201c \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pickett v. State, </em>222 Md.App. 322, 331, 112 A.3d 1078 (2015) (quoting <em>Nash v. State, </em>439 Md. 53, 67, 94 A.3d 23 (2014)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">A. This Appeal Is Moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Initially, though, we have to confront the ongoing justiciability of the case in light of the fact that the order from which W appeals is no longer in force. The State filed its brief in this Court on October 13, 2015, six days after the circuit court rescinded the commitment order, and argues that this development mooted W\u2019s appeal. W acknowledges that the appeal is moot, but urges us to \u201caddress the merits of the issues raised because they are unresolved issues of important public concern on which guidance would be helpful,\u201d and because the error he asserts \u201cis not merely capable of repetition; it has been repeated in numerous cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Courts decide live disputes, and we normally should decline to address the merits of a moot case. <em>Lloyd v. Bd. of Sup\u2019rs of Elections of Balt. Cty., </em>206 Md. 36, 41, 111 A.2d 379 (1954) (citations omitted). \u201cA case is moot when there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties at the time it is before the court so that the court cannot provide an effective remedy.\u201d <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 250, 674 A.2d 951 (1996). And that is the case here: the juvenile court\u2019s partial denial of W\u2019s motion to modify that Order was effectively granted at the time of rescission, so there is no relief for us to grant him.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In rare instances, however, courts can decide to address the merits of a moot case when the issues concern matters of great importance, the public interest will be affected, or there is a likelihood that the wrongdoing will soon be repeated if not immediately resolved. <em>Lloyd, </em>206 Md. at 42-43, 111 A.2d 379 (requiring a \u201cconcurrence in sufficient weight of the[se] factors which together add up to the exception\u201d). And this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>First, </em>this case raises matters of great public importance. \u201cThis Court ... may address the merits of a moot case if we are convinced that the case presents unresolved issues in matters of important public concern that, if decided, will establish a rule for future conduct.\u201d <em>Coburn, </em>342 Md. at 250, 674 A.2d 951 (citing <em>State v. Peterson, </em>315 Md. 73, 82-83, 553 A.2d 672 (1989)). Section 5-607 involves critical due process and liberty interests for juvenile defendants and their families. Although the language of FL \u00a7 5-607 seems straightforward, no Maryland appellate court has interpreted or applied it. And the allegations underlying this case \u2014 that the mandatory findings required by FL \u00a7 5-607 are being inserted <em>verbatim </em>into form orders and juveniles placed out-of-state without the required findings \u2014 are serious. W argues that \u201cthe effect of these boilerplate findings is that they pave the way for DJS to place a child out-of-state, even though the issue was never raised in the hearing.\u201d If true, such a practice raises due process concerns that deserve appellate attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><em>Second, </em>this issue is likely to recur, but will escape appellate review due to the limited duration of most juvenile commitments and the continuing jurisdiction of the juvenile court to modify or rescind commitment orders. Secure residential treatment programs, including the programs at Victor Cullen Center and MAYS, typically last six to nine months. <em>See </em>DJS: Victor Cullen Center, www.djs.maryland.gov/victor-cullen. asp; MAYS: Secure Residential Treatment, www.mid atlanticyouth.com/programs/ residentialshtml. We agree with W that \u201c[bjetween the time it takes for the record to be compiled and transmitted, the time involved in briefing and argument, and the time necessary for the Court to generate its opinion and mandate, the appellate process will often last longer than the juvenile commitment.\u201d We have, in fact, seen this issue present itself repeatedly in recent months, and we are persuaded it is worthy of a reported appellate opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>B. The Juvenile Court Abused Its Discretion By Limiting The Commitment Beyond The <em>Type </em>Of Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">W does not challenge his level A placement, a decision grounded in and supported by the evidence and testimony the court considered during the December 11, 2014 hearing. Both W and the State accepted a level B commitment, but DJS pressed for a level A commitment, not least because W had previously completed a level B commitment at Victor Cullen for eight months. The court gave W an opportunity to speak about the incident underlying these charges and his prior commitment, and concluded that W had been insufficiently rehabilitated after eight months in a level B commitment at Victor Cullen and should be sent to a level A facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">That\u2019s fine as far as it went. But accompanying the level A indication on the Disposition Order was a direction that W was \u201cnot to be placed at Victor Cullen because he was placed there in 2012.\u201d Relying on <em>In re Demetrius </em>J., 321 Md. 468, 583 A.2d 258 (1991), W argues that the juvenile court \u201cexceeded its authority and interfered with a prerogative of DJS when it prohibited placing [him] at the Victor Cullen facility.\u201d The State does not address this contention. We agree with W that the juvenile court abused its discretion by limiting the commitment beyond the type of facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Pursuant to the Juvenile Cases subtitle of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), a juvenile court may place a child on probation, under supervision in his own home, or in custody or care outside of his home \u201cupon terms the court deems appropriate____\u201d Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.), \u00a7 3-8A-19(d)(l)(i) of the CJP Article. If committing the child to custody or guardianship outside of his own home, the court may assign the child to DJS, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d), or an agency \u201cto meet the priorities set forth in CJP \u00a7 3-8A-02<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>subtitle, including designation of the type of facility<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the child is to be accommodated.... \u201d <em>Id., </em>(d)(1)(h). But the precise scope of the juvenile court\u2019s authority under this subtitle has received little appellate attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In the consolidated appeal of <em>In re Demetrius J., </em>321 Md. 468, 583 A.2d 258 (1991), a juvenile court committed three delinquent juveniles to DJS, and further directed that they be placed at a specific private Pennsylvania facility. At the bottom of each disposition order was a handwritten command: \u201cRespondent to be placed at the Glen Mills School.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 583 A.2d 258. In the lead case, the court was expressly aware that it did not have the authority to direct placement in a specific facility. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 583 A.2d 258. Nevertheless, the court reasoned that it was not actually directing DJS to place the juveniles in that particular facility, but rather named that facility as an <em>example </em>of the \u201ctype of facility\u201d where DJS was to place the juvenile:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">[I]t\u2019s always been my understanding as a juvenile judge and as the administrative judge of this court that I had the authority to designate the type of institution that a juvenile was to be committed to and the statute confirmed that and that\u2019s all I have done here. By using the key words, Glen Mills, I have designated a bundle of characteristics of an institution, which I felt, after everyone agreed, had the appropriate characteristics for Demetrius, for his well-being, his best interest, for society\u2019s best interest, for Juvenile Services\u2019 best interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">DJS noted that \u201c[t]he court, however, neither described nor made any findings of fact as to this \u2018bundle of characteris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>tics.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>And after analyzing the text of the statute and the legislative intent, the Court of Appeals concluded that the juvenile court lacked authority to order placement of a committed child at a specific facility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">The question concerning the authority to designate a specific facility resulted in a compromise reflected in the present statute. The statute, as we have seen, permits the court to name the type of facility but generally bestows no authority on the court to specify a particular facility. The compromise was encouraged in significant part by the hope that it would avoid [separation of powers] considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 476, 583 A.2d 258. Accordingly, the Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>at 481, 583 A.2d 258. <em>Cf. In re Appeal No. 653, </em>277 Md. 212, 219, 352 A.2d 845 (1976), <em>superseded by statute, </em>CJP 3-8A-19, <em>as recognized in Demetrius, </em>321 Md. at 476, 583 A.2d 258 (affirming a juvenile court\u2019s commitment to DHMH but reversing the court\u2019s command to place the child in a treatment facility \u201cseparate from adult patients\u201d because mandating separation was the prerogative of DHMH); <em>In re George G., </em>64 Md.App. 70, 81-82, 494 A.2d 247 (1985) (reversing a disposition order that sentenced the juvenile to a \u201ccourt-controlled commitment\u201d and further specified that the child was not to receive leave of any kind for six months); <em>Md. DHMH v. Prince George\u2019s Cty. DSS, </em>47 Md.App. 436, 445, 423 A.2d 589 (1980) (reversing juvenile court\u2019s order that DHMH pay the cost of a child\u2019s placement, stating that our disposition statute \u201cempowers the court to commit a child to the custody of DHMH; it does not confer upon the court any right to mandate the specific terms of the commitment\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">This separation of powers concern re-emerges in a later provision of the Juvenile Cases subtitle that addresses the transfer of juveniles already committed to D JS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(1) When necessary to appropriately administer the commitment of the child, the [DJS], on approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Director of Behavioral Health, may transfer a child committed for residential placement from one facility to another facility that is operated, licensed, or contracted by [DJS].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">(2) A facility to which a child is transferred under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">(i) Consistent with the type of facility designated by the court under subsection (d)(l)(ii) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">(ii) More secure than the type of facility designated by the court under subsection (d)(l)(ii) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">CJP \u00a7 3 \u2014 8A\u201419(Z )(1) \u2014 (2). Again, DJS controls the specific placement of delinquent juveniles and the constraints on the court\u2019s authority: the court may designate the type of facility, but DJS handles the details. And once the court designates the type of facility, that disposition serves as a starting point, or floor, from which DJS assumes monitoring and control\u2014 DJS can, by statutory design, increase the restrictiveness of the child\u2019s placement without consulting the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\"><em>Demetrius </em>compels the conclusion that the juvenile court abused its discretion when it ordered that \u201c[W] is not to be placed at Victor Cullen because he was placed there in 2012.\u201d We see no principled distinction between a court that designates a particular <em>facility </em>\u2014 e.g., ordering a juvenile to Glen Mills School \u2014 and a court that excludes a particular <em>facility </em>\u2014 e.g., precluding a juvenile from going to Victor Cullen Center. As the Court of Appeals held in <em>Demetrius </em>and we restated in <em>In re Julianna B., </em>juvenile courts may only designate the type of facility; the specific assignment within that type remains the prerogative of DJS. 179 Md.App. 512, 562, 947 A.2d 90 (2008), <em>vacated as moot, </em>407 Md. 657, 967 A.2d 776 (2009) (citing <em>Demetrius, </em>321 Md. at 475-76, 583 A.2d 258) (explaining that the General Assembly intended that the particular facility in which a delinquent child may be placed is \u2022within the exclusive discretion of DJS). The court was well within its authority to commit W to a level A, or hardware-secure, placement, but exceeded its statutory authority in excluding him from the Victor Cullen Center. The court is, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>course, free to offer recommendations, and the suggestion that W would be better off not returning to the site of his last placement could be a sensible one. But the statute gives DJS, not the court, the ultimate authority to place the child so long as the facility was of the same (or more restrictive) type of placement as the judge ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">C. The Disposition Proceedings And Order Did Not Comply With FL \u00a7 5-607.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">FL \u00a7 5-607 is part of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (\u201cICPC\u201d), which was enacted in Maryland by Chapter 266 of the Acts of 1975 and is codified now in Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. VoL), \u00a7\u00a7 5-601 to 5-611 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The ICPC is a platform for \u201cthe party states to cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children,\u201d such that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">(1) Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">(2) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">(3) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">FL \u00a7 5-602. The juvenile court\u2019s authority to place delinquent children outside of Maryland arises from FL \u00a7 5-601(7): \u201cAny court having jurisdiction to place delinquent children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>may place such a child in an institution of or in another state pursuant to \u00a7 5-607 of the [ICPC].\u201d And FL \u00a7 5-607 defines the procedural safeguards and factual findings that must be satisfied before ordering such a placement. These lie at the substantive heart of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">FL \u00a7 5-607 contains a notice requirement and a findings requirement, discrete prerequisites separated by the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to [the ICPC] but <em>no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian ivith opportunity to be heard, prior to the child being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care </em>and the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">(1) equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency\u2019s jurisdiction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">(2) institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">We review a court\u2019s factual findings as to the \u00a7 5-607 factors for clear error, <em>In re Shirley B., </em>419 Md. 1, 11, 18, 18 A.3d 40 (2011), and \u201cif there is any competent, material evidence to support the factual findings below, we cannot hold those findings to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Cannon v. Cannon, </em>156 Md.App. 387, 404, 846 A.2d 1127 (2004) (internal citations and quotations omitted), <em>aff'd </em>384 Md. 537, 865 A.2d 563 (2005). W argues that the juvenile court failed to comply both with the notice and the findings requirements, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The requirement that the juvenile and his parent must have notice <em>and </em>an opportunity to be heard is rooted in the principle that out-of-state placements of delinquent children \u201care similar to probation or parole supervision,\u201d and thus a restriction on liberty that cannot be imposed without due process. <em>Sinhogar v. Parry, </em>98 Misc.2d 28, 412 N.Y.S.2d 966, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>973 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1979) (in decisions separating the parent and child, \u201cthere is a legally recognizable interest to which the due process requirement of the Constitution attaches\u201d). The State maintains that \u201c[W] and his counsel and family were apprised ... of the time of his various adjudicatory, disposition and review hearings,\u201d and that they \u201chad an opportunity to appear and be heard\u201d at each of his proceedings. The State also refers to the (mostly inaudible) bench conference at the January 20 hearing, and contends that no one opposed W\u2019s potential commitment to MAYS. But the record contains no evidence that W or his family were notified of the potential out-of-state placement in advance of the hearing, and the State cites no authority for the proposition that being told <em>at the hearing </em>satisfies due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">At the December 11, 2014 disposition hearing, the judge discussed with W the reasons for his delinquent actions and asked whether he had learned his lesson. But that was the extent of W\u2019s communication with the court regarding his disposition. After hearing from W, the judge ordered level A placement and announced that Victor Cullen could not be an option, after which the State requested a subsequent hearing to discuss W\u2019s placement. The court set the review hearing for January 13, but that was continued to January 20, and then that hearing was postponed to February 2, by which time W was at MAYS. This left no opportunity for W or his family to be heard on this issue before the placement occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Although the judge stated in open court during the December 11 hearing that W was committed to a level A placement other than Victor Cullen, this declaration could not serve as notice to W and his family because that information doesn\u2019t mean to them what it does to the court: W\u2019s family can\u2019t be charged with knowing that the only in-state level A facility is Victor Cullen. And nothing in the record prior to the December 11 hearing put W or his family on notice that W might be sent to another state \u2014 to the contrary, at his November 18, 2014 adjudication hearing, W signed an \u201cAdmission (Plea) Under Rule 11-107\u201d agreement, which stated, \u201cI fully understand that the worst the Court can do to me is send me to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>State juvenile institution until I turn 21.\u201d Merely apprising the family of the hearing dates does not provide notice of the possibility that a juvenile faces an out-of-state placement, nor does it afford the juvenile or his family an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Tr. Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950) (due process requires adjudication \u201cpreceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case\u201d). The record in this case reflects that neither W nor his family was given an opportunity to address his exclusion from Victor Cullen or the appropriateness of the intended out-of-state placement because he was placed at MAYS before the scheduled hearing, and this lack of notice failed to comply with FL \u00a7 5-607.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">From there, the commitment decision itself suffers from a lack of evidence bearing on the issues one way or the other. The commitment hearing addressed only W\u2019s delinquent act, and the commitment order consists of a form list that includes the statutory language for Type A, B, and C commitments and inserts only language designating Level A. The record contains nothing relating to the presence or absence of equivalent facilities, W\u2019s best interests, or the potential hardship to him or his family from an out-of-state placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We are not saying that an out-of-state placement in this case was <em>per se </em>improper, nor are we saying that Victor Cullen Center <em>was </em>the best placement for W, nor are we saying that MAYS was an inappropriate placement \u2014 the record contains no facts or testimony to support any of these possible conclusions. Nor are we saying that courts cannot use form orders to streamline the process of documenting its decisions. We <em>are </em>saying, however, that a juvenile court must establish an affirmative factual record that supports the FL \u00a7 5-607 findings that justify an out-of-state placement for the particular juvenile, <em>and </em>that the court\u2019s order, however generated, must reflect those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">. Level B and level A placements are non-community residential facilities, with level B being staff-secure and level A hardware-secure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\">. At the time of W's first disposition, Victor Cullen only provided level B services; by the time W was adjudicated delinquent in the case before us, Victor Cullen offered both level B and level A facilities. In fact, Victor Cullen is the only level A facility for boys in Maryland. <em>See </em>http://www.oag.state.md.us/JJMU/reports/15_Quarter2.pdf; http://www. djs.maryland.gov/victor-cullen.asp.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-11\">. Many hearings were scheduled between May and October. Most of these were short hearings to address W's needs for the period between his arrest and DJS placement, such as establishing GPS monitoring, placing him in a community support program, and confirming his detention status. The rest of the hearings were postponed, bringing us to October 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-21\">. There is no name for the inaudible speaker in the transcript; it appears here just as it does in the record. The only females present (according to the record) at this hearing were W\u2019s co-counsel. Both of his attorneys spoke on the record and are referred to earlier in the transcript by name. We suspect that one of W\u2019s attorneys was inquiring as to the status of his Motion to Modify Court Order and Request for a Hearing, which was filed on a Friday.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b629-13\">. In his Notice of Appeal, W refers to the January 30 Order as granting in part and denying in part the January 16 Motion. In his brief, W interprets the blue pen marks as denying his requests to strike the language regarding the availability of equivalent facilities in Maryland and to schedule a hearing, but granting his first request, <em>i.e., </em>to strike the limitation on placement at the Victor Cullen Center. W takes the position that the partial denial creates a final, appealable order, and the State does not contest this interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\">. W phrased his Questions Presented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">1. Did the juvenile court violate Family Law Article \u00a7 5-607 and due process of law by failing to notify [W.Y.] and his parents that it was considering authorizing out-of-state placement and to give them a meaningful opportunity to be heard before finding in its December 11, 2014 disposition order that \"[e]quivalent facilities for the juvenile are not available in the State of Maryland; and institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the juvenile and will not produce undue hardship\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">2.

The \"type of facility\u201d refers to its level of security. Although the labels vary by county (e.g., levels I, II, II or levels A, B, C), DJS defines hardware-secure, staff-secure, and community detention as the three most restrictive types of out-of-home commitments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-20\">Hardware Secure Facility: A facility that relies primarily on the use of construction and hardware such as locks, bars, and fences to restrict freedom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-21\">Staff Secure Facility: Programs where a youth\u2019s movement is controlled by staff supervision rather than by restrictive architectural features.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-22\">Community Detention (CD): The supervision and guidance of juveniles under court ordered placement to the DJS Community Detention Program. DJS ensures youth compliance with the terms and conditions of community detention through supervision, field visits, surveillance, and electronic monitoring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-23\">The State has at least one facility available within each classification type. For example, Victor Cullen Center is the only state-operated hardware-secure facility for males. Males sent to hardware-secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>facilities are usually repeat and/or violent offenders. There are at least five State-operated staff-secure facilities that house non-violent or non-chronic offenders. Secure facilities also feature addiction programs, behavioral programs, and group homes with schools on-site. Community detention encompasses many less restrictive community-based placements, including foster care, group homes, and independent living programs.
