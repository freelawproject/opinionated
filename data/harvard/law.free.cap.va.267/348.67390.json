Kingsbur contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the handgun he possessed qualified as a firearm under the statute. Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual determination that the handgun was a firearm was not plainly wrong or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>evidence to support it, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On the evening of October 1, 2001, two officers of the Portsmouth Police Department saw Kingsbur outside Swanson Homes, a Portsmouth housing project. One of the officers saw a white grocery bag \u201cwrapped up\u201d in Kingsbur\u2019s hand. When the officers approached, Kingsbur put the bag down next to a trash can. The officers told Kingsbur that he was under arrest for trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Suspecting that Kingsbur had a weapon or drugs, the officers retrieved the white bag and found a handgun inside. Kingsbur told the officers he had found the gun in a park earlier and was \u201ctrying to find somewhere to throw it down.\u201d Kingsbur testified that he wanted to dispose of the handgun because he did not want it to fall into a child\u2019s hands and that he knew the gun did not work because the \u201cchambers . . . fell off\u201d when he picked up the gun. He also testified that he put the gun down by the trash can because he did not want to get caught with it. There were no bullets in the gun. Kingsbur was charged with a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The certificate of analysis admitted as an exhibit at Kingsbur\u2019s bench trial stated that the gun was a Davis Industries, Model P-32, .32 caliber automatic pistol. The certificate also stated that the pistol \u201cdoes not function and could not be test fired\u201d because there were ten missing parts. Kingsbur argued that the handgun\u2019s state of disrepair rendered it inoperable and, therefore, that the Commonwealth failed to show that the handgun he possessed was a firearm within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The trial court applied the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>36 Va. App. 312, 549 S.E.2d 641 (2001) (en banc). In that opinion, the Court of Appeals held that for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 a \u201cfirearm\u201d was an instrument \u201cmade with the purpose to expel a projectile by gunpowder or other explosion\u201d and that proof of present operability was not required. <em>Id. </em>at 321-22, 549 S.E.2d at 645-46. Accordingly, the trial court rejected Kingsbur\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence based on the inoperability of the handgun. Kingsbur was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and sentenced to five years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The Court of Appeals affirmed Kingsbur\u2019s conviction based on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>584, 562 S.E.2d 139, 145 (2002). <em>Kingsbur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>40 Va. App. 307, 311, 579 S.E.2d 357, 359 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Kingsbur argues here, as he did in the Court of Appeals, that the trial court should have granted his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence because the evidence failed to show that Kingsbur possessed a firearm within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Kingsbur asserts that, under this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Armstrong, </em>a firearm that has lost the characteristic of firing a projectile by means of an explosion is no longer a firearm for purposes of the statute. Here the evidence showed that the handgun at issue could not be test fired, did not function, was missing parts, and \u201ccame apart\u201d in Kingsbur\u2019s hands when he first picked it up. These facts, Kingsbur asserts, show that the handgun was in such a state of disrepair that it ceased to function as a firearm within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Kingsbur also asserted that it was the burden of the Commonwealth to prove that the handgun had not lost its characteristics as a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In <em>Armstrong, </em>we approved the holding of the Court of Appeals that a firearm is an instrument which was \u201cdesigned, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d 263 Va. at 585, 562 S.E.2d at 146. In a footnote we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Common sense and experience leave no room for doubt that an instrument originally designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by force of an explosion can lose this characteristic in many ways such that it would no longer be fairly considered a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 584 n.6, 562 S.E.2d at 145 n.6. This statement, upon which Kingsbur relies, refers to exceptional circumstances and not simply a showing of disrepair that might preclude expelling a projectile by explosion at a particular point in time. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Contrary to Kingsbur\u2019s assertions, the Commonwealth did not have the burden of disproving that the handgun lost its characteristics as a firearm. The Commonwealth had the burden of presenting <em>prima facie </em>evidence on all elements of the crime charged and, once the Commonwealth met that burden, Kingsbur had the option of presenting evidence raising a reasonable doubt regarding one or more of those elements. However, the ultimate burden of persuasion always remained on the Commonwealth and if, considering the evidence as a whole, both for the Commonwealth and Kingsbur, there existed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>reasonable doubt of his guilt, he was entitled to be acquitted of the offense. <em>See Dobson v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 71, 74-75, 531 S.E.2d 569, 571 (2000); <em>Hodge v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 338, 342, 228 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">We therefore turn to Kingsbur\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Applying well-known principles of appellate review, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and will not set aside the verdict unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Beavers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 268, 281-82, 427 S.E.2d 411, 421 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Here, the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the handgun in Kingsbur\u2019s possession was designed, made, and intended to fire or expel a projectile by means of an explosion. It was not obligated to prove that the handgun was operable. <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 145. The certificate of analysis identified the specific model of the handgun. Kingsbur considered it a handgun because he did not want a child to \u201c[get] ahold of it\u201d and, as a convicted felon, he knew he should not get caught with it. This evidence supports a finding that the handgun Kingsbur possessed was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The evidence Kingsbur cites to support his position falls far short of the exceptional circumstance identified in <em>Armstrong. </em>The evidence of inoperability because of the missing parts indicates in this case, as it did in <em>Armstrong, </em>that the handgun could have been repaired. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 146. Kingsbur\u2019s testimony that the chambers of the handgun \u201cjust fell off of it\u201d is insufficient to support a finding that the handgun in question lost its characteristic as a firearm. Furthermore, the arresting officer testified that the handgun appeared to be \u201cintact,\u201d and the certificate of analysis did not reflect that the handgun was in more than one piece.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">For the above reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that the handgun in issue was a firearm for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and in refusing to grant Kingsbur\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Accordingly the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
