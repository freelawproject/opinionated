Const, art. VI, \u00a7 1, Rule 5:42, and answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>If the defendant-owner of an apartment building is negligent per se because the protective railing on its apartment balcony does not comply with the height requirements of a municipal building code, and if that negligence is a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s fall from the balcony and her resulting injuries, is the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence available to the defendant as a complete defense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Resolving the issue will determine the outcome of the proceeding in the Court of Appeals. We accepted the certified question by order entered October 28, 2003. For the reasons stated below, we answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The order of certification from the Court of Appeals sets forth the following facts. Kaney F. O\u2019Neill became a quadriplegic when she fell backward over a second-story balcony railing at an apartment complex in Newport News, Virginia, on September 15, 1999. When the apartment was built in 1963, the Newport News Building Code required such balcony railings to be forty-eight (48) inches high. <em>See </em>Code of City of Newport News \u00a7 10-3 (1962) (incorporating the National Building Code); Nat\u2019l Bldg. Code \u00a7 605.4 (1955). The balcony railing at issue here, however, was only thirty-two (32) inches high.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">O\u2019Neill filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, asserting that the owner of the apartment complex, Windshire-Copeland Associates, L.P.; its general partner, Robert Copeland; and the management company for the apartment complex, Hercules Real Estate Services, Inc., (collectively \u201cWind-shire\u201d) were negligent because the balcony\u2019s height did not comply with the requirements of the Newport News Building Code at the time the apartment complex was built and that such negligence was a proximate cause of her injuries. At trial, testimony was admitted showing that O\u2019Neill was familiar with the balcony and that she had consumed alcohol prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">At the close of the evidence, the trial court held Windshire negligent <em>per se </em>because its balcony violated the height requirement of the Newport News Building Code. The trial court also held that Wind-shire\u2019s negligence did not bar its defense of contributory negligence and, accordingly, submitted that issue to the jury. The jury found O\u2019Neill contributorily negligent. Based on that finding, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>entered judgment in favor of Windshire, and O\u2019Neill appealed that judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The discussion by the Court of Appeals, in its certification order, and the arguments the parties advanced focused primarily on whether Virginia has adopted \u00a7 483 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965). That section provides that, when a defendant\u2019s negligence consists of the violation of a statute, a plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence bars his recovery for injuries caused by the negligence of the defendant \u201cunless the effect of the statute is to place the entire responsibility for such harm as has occurred upon the defendant.\u201d Comment (c) to \u00a7 483 explains that a statute places the entire responsibility for harm on the defendant \u201cwhere it is enacted in order to protect a certain class of persons against their own inability to protect themselves.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 483, cmt. c, at p. 539 (1965). Comment (d) goes on to state that even though \u201cthose for whose benefit the statute is enacted may be expected to be, and are in fact, fully able to protect themselves,\u201d the statute may nevertheless relieve such persons from doing so and place on the defendant the entire responsibility for avoiding the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">O\u2019Neill maintains that the concept embodied in \u00a7 483 is one \u201cfirmly entrenched in the common law\u201d and \u201cembraced for nearly a century by this Court.\u201d Applying that concept here, O\u2019Neill argues that the building code is one of those statutes that places on the defendant the responsibility for injury resulting from a violation of its provisions and, thus, O\u2019Neill\u2019s negligence should not defeat her recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">As O\u2019Neill acknowledges, the cases upon which she primarily relies for the proposition that Virginia has adopted the concepts embodied in \u00a7 483 of the Restatement, <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Bell, </em>149 Va. 720, 141 S.E. 838 (1928), <em>Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Hawkins, </em>130 Va. 698, 108 S.E. 704 (1921), and <em>Carter Coal Co. v. Bates, </em>127 Va. 586, 105 S.E. 76 (1920), addressed whether a defendant could plead the assumption of the risk defense when the defendant\u2019s violation of a statutory requirement was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The theory of the defendants advanced in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>cases was that the plaintiffs had known that the defendants had not complied with the statutory requirement and, therefore, the plaintiffs had assumed the risk of harm resulting from such lack of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The seminal case in this Commonwealth rejecting an attempt by a defendant to raise the assumption of the risk defense under these circumstances involved a coal company\u2019s failure to provide for a \u201cconspicuous light\u201d on the front and rear of coal hauling machinery as required by statute. <em>Carter Coal, </em>127 Va. at 598-99, 105 S.E. at 80. The Court\u2019s decision in that case was based on the principle that, if the mining-safety legislation at issue had not abrogated this common law defense, the \u201csystematic violation\u201d of the statute through the purported risk-assumption by the plaintiff would defeat the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 601-02, 105 S.E. at 81. As we later stated in <em>Atlantic Coastline:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[I] f the employer may avail himself of the defense that the employee agreed in advance that the statute should be disregarded, the court would be measuring the rights of the persons whom the law makers intended to protect by the common law standard of the reasonably prudent person, and not by the definite standard set up by the legislature. This would be practically a judicial repeal of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">149 Va. at 735, 141 S.E. at 842, <em>citing </em>18 R.C.L. \u00a7 169 at 680-81 (1917) (quoting <em>D.H. Davis Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Polland, </em>62 N.E. 492, 496 (Ind. 1902)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">O\u2019Neill argues that because assumption of the risk and contributory negligence are \u201cdoctrinally related\u201d and \u201c \u2018often overlap,\u2019 \u201d the rationale precluding the defense of assumption of the risk in these cases \u201capplies with equal force to the defense of contributory negligence.\u201d However, the rationale we utilized in <em>Bell </em>and its predecessors for excluding assumption of the risk cannot extend to the defense of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The difference between assumption of the risk and contributory negligence as they relate to a defendant\u2019s negligence <em>per se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>stemming from a statutory violation was explained in <em>Pocahontas Consolidated Collieries Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>244 F. 368 (4th Cir. 1917), the case upon which <em>Carter Coal </em>relied in rejecting the defense of assumption of the risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Assumption of risk and contributory negligence stand in a different legal relation to the violation of a . . . statute. Assumption of risk imports no delict on the part of an employe[e] .... Contributory negligence ... is a delict or neglect of duty by the employe[e], and hence he cannot recover for the delict of the employer, ... if his own delict has contributed to his injury as a proximate cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">This fundamental difference between the effect of the assumption of the risk and contributory negligence defenses negates the proposition that our jurisprudence precluding the use of assumption of the risk defense also precludes the use of the contributory negligence defense that \u00a7 483 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Nevertheless, we recognize that there are circumstances in which a legislative body may determine that, because of the nature of the regulation or the class of persons the regulation was intended to protect, the defendant should bear the entire responsibility for harm that the failure to comply with the regulation causes. For example, the General Assembly has specifically made such a determination in Code \u00a7 8.01-58 by providing that contributory negligence \u201cshall not bar a recovery\u201d in actions brought by employees against a common carrier where death resulted from the common carrier\u2019s violation of \u201cany statute enacted for the safety of employees.\u201d <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-932.1, -934, 56-416, and former Code \u00a7 56-417.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">We need not decide here whether application of that principle can be implied in statutes that do not specifically state that the defense is not available. In this case, nothing in the Newport News <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Building Code indicates that the purpose of the code was to place the entire responsibility for injuries stemming from a code violation on the defendant building owner. Unlike Code \u00a7 8.01-58, nothing in the Newport News Building Code allows recovery regardless of a plaintiff\u2019s negligence. The code protects no specific class; it is the public in general that benefits from its provisions. Indeed, a person who never entered a building but only stood outside could be injured as a result of a building code violation. Nor would allowing the defense of contributory negligence in this case defeat the building code\u2019s purpose of height requirements and \u201c \u2018work a judicial repeal of the Act\u2019 \u201d as O\u2019Neill asserts. Only if a combination of a defendant\u2019s code violation <em>and </em>a plaintiff\u2019s independent negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury would the plaintiff be unable to recover. Under these circumstances, allowing a contributory negligence defense neither compromises nor subverts the policy advancing compliance with the building code.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 483 of the Restatement (Second) has not been adopted in this state and hold that the defense of contributory negligence is available when the defendant\u2019s violation of a municipal building code is negligence <em>per se </em>and a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\n<em>Certified question answered in the affirmative.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\"> Virginia adopted a statewide building code in 1973 that requires balcony railings to be at least forty-two (42) inches high.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\"> O\u2019Neill also relies upon <em>Gallagher v. Stathis, </em>186 Va. 444, 43 S.E.2d 33 (1947), for her position that Virginia has recognized and adopted \u00a7 483. In <em>Gallagher, </em>the trial court refused a jury instruction that the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent because they agreed to live in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>house with only one staircase in violation of the building code. This Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s action because there was no evidence to support the granting of an instruction on the theory of contributory negligence, <em>id. </em>at 451, 44 S.E.2d at 37, and any implication to be drawn from the citation to foreign authority on the issue of the availability of contributory fault as a defense was therefore, at most, dicta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\"> Violations of the child labor laws are also not subject to the defense of contributory negligence because children under the age of 14 are presumed incapable of contributory negligence, <em>Virginia Electric and Power Co. v. Dungee, </em>258 Va. 235, 246-47, 520 S.E.2d 164, 171 (1999), and, regardless of any violation of such laws, child employees are subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 65.2-100, <em>et seq., </em>which does not allow the defenses of assumption of the risk or contributory negligence. <em>Roller v. Basic Constr. Co., </em>238 Va. 321, 327, 384 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1989); <em>Rasnick </em>v. <em>The Pittston Co., </em>237 Va. 658, 660, 379 S.E.2d 353, 354 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
