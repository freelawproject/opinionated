However, Petitioner acknowledges in his petition that \u201cthis is not an appropriate claim to raise in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\u201d and that the \u201cinstant petition is prophylactic. Orbe has filed it to provide an alternative mechanism for relief.\u201d He further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">The reason why this is not an appropriate habeas corpus claim is that Orbe does not challenge either the fact or duration of his imprisonment, does not challenge his death sentence, and does not seek a determination that he is entitled to immediate or speedier release. These are the distinguishing hallmarks of a habeas claim, as the Court spelled out in <em>Preiser v. </em>Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973). Virginia law similarly confines the scope of habeas corpus actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>We agree with Orbe. Consequently, we hold that this Court does not have original jurisdiction to consider his petition. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">A Copy,</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">Teste:</p>\n<p id=\"pAB99\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Patricia H.
