The provisions of Code \u00a7 22.1-308 require the Board of Education to prescribe one of the grievance procedures, which we shall call the \u201cState Grievance Procedure.\u201d Another statute, Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6), directs a school board to establish the other grievance procedure, which we shall call the \u201cLocal Grievance Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">The dispositive question is which one of these grievance procedures applies to a school principal who is suspended. Because we conclude that a principal is covered by the State Grievance Procedure even though a dispute involving a suspension is not a grievable matter under that procedure, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court finding that the principal in this case was covered by the Local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Grievance Procedure and that he presented a grievable matter under that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">I. MATERIAL FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">George Brown was employed as the principal of Richlands High School located in Tazewell County. By a letter dated November 16, 2001, the division superintendent, Donald W. Hodock, suspended Brown with pay from his position as principal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a subsequent letter dated November 28, 2001, Hodock informed Brown of his right to a hearing before the Tazewell County School Board (\u201cSchool Board\u201d) and suggested that the hearing could be arranged for the December 3, 2001, meeting of the School Board if Brown so requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Brown did not ask for that hearing before the School Board but instead requested a hearing before an advisory fact-finding panel pursuant to Step 4 of Part II of the State Grievance Procedure. He was subsequently told that he needed to file the appropriate grievance form in accordance with Step 2 of Part II of the State Grievance Procedure. On December 7, 2001, Brown filed a statement of his grievance on the specified form. He identified the action being grieved as his \u201c[suspension from job duties\u201d and requested \u201c[ijmmediate reinstatement to position as [principal of Richlands High School.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">After a series of letters between the parties and their respective counsel, exchange of information, and a meeting between Hodock and Brown, Hodock advised Brown by letter dated February 7, 2002, that he was adjusting the grievance and would recommend to the School Board that Brown be reassigned to another administrative position. In two subsequent letters, Hodock also notified Brown of his intention to recommend to the School Board that Brown be reassigned to a classroom teaching position for the 2002-03 school year. In two other letters, both dated February 8, 2002, Hodock ruled that Brown\u2019s December 7 grievance did not state a grievable matter because suspension with pay could not be the subject of a grievance. In one of the letters, Hodock again informed Brown that he would recommend to the School Board at its next meeting that Brown be reassigned as principal at a different school in the Tazewell County school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Hodock subsequently requested the School Board to determine whether Brown\u2019s December 7 statement of grievance presented a grievable matter. After requesting written arguments from both parties on the issue, the School Board ruled at its meeting on March 11, 2002, that suspension with pay is not a grievable matter. The School Board also accepted Hodock\u2019s recommendation to reassign Brown to a classroom teaching position and to reduce his salary accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Brown then filed with the School Board a notice of appeal to circuit court, challenging the School Board\u2019s determination that his suspension with pay was not a grievable matter. In accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 22.1-314, the School Board transmitted the notice of appeal, exhibits, and other relevant documents to the circuit court. Upon considering argument of counsel, the parties\u2019 memoranda, and the record from the School Board, the court issued a letter opinion, finding that Brown\u2019s suspension presented a grievable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The circuit court reasoned in a letter opinion and subsequent order that Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) requires a school board to establish a grievance procedure for all its employees except a division superintendent and those employees covered under Articles 2 and 3 of Chapter 15, Title 22.1 of the Code. Interpreting the reference to employees covered under Articles 2 and 3 to mean \u201ccoverage under a grievance procedure specifically provided under either Article 2 or Article 3,\u201d the court concluded that Brown was not such an employee. Instead, the court found that the only class of employees, other than superintendents, that falls within the coverage exception provided in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) consists of teachers. Stated differently, the court concluded that neither Article 2 nor Article 3 of Chapter 15, Title 22.1 creates a grievance procedure for principals and that, therefore, Brown did not come within the coverage exception set out in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The court also found that this section requires the grievance procedure to include a method to resolve disputes between a school board and covered employees regarding, among other things, a \u201csuspension.\u201d Therefore, the court decided that Brown could pursue his grievance under the procedure established by the School Board pursuant to Code \u00a722.1-79(6) and that he had presented a grievable matter. Finally, the court rejected the School Board\u2019s argument that Brown\u2019s grievance was moot because he had been reinstated as a principal and then reassigned to a classroom. In a final order, the court directed the School Board to afford Brown \u201ca timely and fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>method of resolution of [his] grievance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The School Board appeals from the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">H. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In this appeal, the School Board presents several assignments of error that challenge the circuit court\u2019s findings and its interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. Specifically, the School Board asserts that the court erred by holding that Brown is covered by the grievance procedure mandated by Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) and that Brown\u2019s grievance was grievable under that procedure, by refusing to affirm the School Board\u2019s determination that Brown\u2019s grievance was not a grievable matter, and by refusing to dismiss Brown\u2019s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The School Board also assigns error to the court\u2019s refusal to dismiss Brown\u2019s appeal as moot. Since this last assignment of error presents a threshold question, we will address it first.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">(A) MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The School Board argues that, once Brown\u2019s suspension was lifted and he was reinstated to the position of principal at an elementary school, his grievance concerning his suspension became moot. While this appeal was pending, the School Board also filed a motion to remand the case to the circuit court with instructions that it be dismissed as moot because Brown resigned his position as an employee of the School Board and the Tazewell County public school system effective August 7, 2003. We do not agree that the issues presented are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">As the circuit court noted in addressing the question of mootness, Brown has been \u201cadversely affected in his professional reputation by the actions of the Tazewell County School Board, and those actions are not undone by his later reinstatement and reassignment.\u201d Nor are they \u201cundone\u201d by his subsequent resignation. The fact of and reasons for his suspension are contained in his personnel file and will remain there unless removed based upon a determination that the information therein was unfounded. <em>See </em>Code \u00a722.1-295.1. Thus, the question whether Brown presented a grievable issue that he could pursue through a grievance procedure to establish that information in his personnel file was unfounded is not moot. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Story v. Commonwealth, </em>175 Va. 615, 616-17, 9 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1940) (because nature of evidence admitted bore upon appellant\u2019s fitness to be granted a certificate of registration, issues were not moot merely because certificates of registration had expired). In other words, if Brown prevailed in this appeal, there is relief, other than reinstatement to his former position, that could be afforded to him under the circuit court\u2019s judgment directing the School Board to resolve his grievance. <em>See RF &amp; P Corp. v. Little, </em>247 Va. 309, 315, 440 S.E.2d 908, 912 (1994) (where relief can be provided, issue is not moot); <em>Hankins </em>v. <em>Town of Virginia Beach, </em>182 Va. 642, 643-44, 29 S.E.2d 831, 832 (1944) (same). Thus, this appeal and the issues presented are not moot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">(B) BROWN\u2019S GRIEVANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The remaining issues raised in this appeal require the Court to address the statutory provisions regarding grievance procedures for public school employees and suspensions of those employees. We begin by surveying the two grievance procedures that are mandated by the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-308 and -79(6). Our examination of those statutory provisions and the grievance procedures created thereunder will illustrate certain inconsistencies that give rise to the issues before us. We also include in our analysis the separate statutory provision dealing with suspension of public school employees, Code \u00a7 22.1-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We turn first to the State Grievance Procedure mandated by the provisions of Code \u00a7 22.1-308. That statute requires the Board of Education to prescribe a grievance procedure, which shall include certain elements enumerated in the statute. Pursuant to that mandate and its authority in Code \u00a7 22.1-16 to \u201cpromulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out its powers and duties and the provisions of\u201d Title 22.1, the Board of Education established a \u201cProcedure For Adjusting Grievances,\u201d 8 VAC 20-90-10 <em>et seq. </em>(the State Grievance Procedure). The School Board adopted this grievance procedure \u201cin accordance with the Standards of Quality for the statutory mandate of Chapters 13.2 and 15, Article 3, Title 22.1\u201d of the Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The State Grievance Procedure contains three parts. Part I consists of definitions, Part II governs employment disputes other than dismissals or probation, and Part III controls disputes involving dismissals or probation. Each of these parts has some bearing on the resolution of the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The relevant definitions in Part I are for the terms \u201c \u2018[grievance,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018[t]eacher,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[supervisory employee.\u2019 \u201d In pertinent part, the term \u201c \u2018[grievance\u2019 means, for the purpose of Part III, a complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to his or her employment involving dismissal or placing on probation. The term \u2018grievance\u2019 shall not include a complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to . . . suspension of a teacher . . . .\u201d The exclusion of a dispute involving a suspension is consistent with the statutory definition of the term \u201c <em>\u2018[gjrievance.\u2019 </em>\u201d The definition of that term in Code \u00a722.1-306 expressly excludes \u201ca complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to . . . suspension of a teacher . . . .\u201d Next, the term</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201c[tjeacher\u201d or \u201cteachers\u201d means, for the purpose of Part II, all employees of the school division involved in classroom instruction and all other full-time employees of the school division except those employees classified as supervising employees. \u201cTeacher\u201d means, for the purpose of Part III, all regularly certified/licensed professional public school personnel employed under a written contract as provided by \u00a7 22.1-302 of the Code of Virginia by any school division as a teacher or supervisor of classroom teachers but excluding all superintendents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Finally, in pertinent part, the term \u201c \u2018[supervisory employee\u2019 means any person having authority in the interest of the board . . . (ii) to direct other employees; or (iii) to adjust the grievance of other employees . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Based on these definitions, the parties agree on two points, and we concur. First, if a principal such as Brown is covered by the State Grievance Procedure, such coverage is created only in Part III since he is a supervisory employee. Second, for the purposes of Part III, a dispute involving a suspension is not included within the definition of the term \u201c \u2018[gjrievance.\u2019 \u201d Thus, if the State Grievance Procedure applies to Brown, a point he disputes, his suspension was not a grievable matter and the circuit court erred in finding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The other grievance procedure at issue, the Local Grievance Procedure, is mandated by Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6). That statute requires a school board</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[i]n instances in which no grievance procedure has been adopted prior to January 1, 1991, [to] establish and administer by July 1, 1992, a grievance procedure for all school board employees, except the division superintendent and those employees covered under the provisions of Article 2 (\u00a7 22.1-293 et seq.) and Article 3 (\u00a7 22.1-306 et seq.) of Chapter 15 of this title, who have completed such probationary period as may be required by the school board, not to exceed eighteen months. The grievance procedure shall afford a timely and fair method of the resolution of disputes arising between the school board and such employees regarding dismissal, suspension, or other disciplinary actions and shall be consistent with the provisions of the Board of Education\u2019s procedures for adjusting grievances except that there shall be no right to a hearing before a fact-finding panel[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In 1993, the School Board adopted the Local Grievance Procedure for \u201c[supervisory and [classified [e]mployees\u201d in accordance with this statutory mandate. That grievance procedure defines the term \u201c[supervisory employees\u201d to include \u201cprincipals.\u201d However, it also provides that the dismissal or probation of a supervisory employee is governed by Part III of the State Grievance Procedure. The term \u201c \u2018[classified employees\u2019 is defined as that group of those school board\u2019s employees whose members do not hold certificates as promulgated by the Virginia Board of Education.\u201d According to its express terms, the Local Grievance Procedure provides that <em>\u201c[a]ll full-time classified employees, </em>including those assigned to the administrative salary schedule, who have successfully completed a probationary period, <em>shall have access to the </em>. . . <em>grievance procedures </em>[created therein] for matters specified as grievable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, the procedures created in the Local Grievance Procedure do not cover \u201c[supervisory employees,\u201d such as \u201cprincipals.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The grievable matters enumerated in the Local Griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>anee Procedure do, however, include a dispute involving a suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">This summary of the two grievance procedures brings us to the question whether the circuit court erred in finding that Brown was covered by the Local Grievance Procedure mandated by Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) and not the State Grievance Procedure. Brown argues, and the circuit court concluded, that the exception in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) for \u201cemployees covered under the provisions of Article 2 . . . and Article 3 ... of Chapter 15 of this title [22.1]\u201d excepts employees covered <em>\u201cunder a grievance procedure </em>specified under either Article 2 or Article 3.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To hold otherwise, argues Brown, would render the provisions of Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) and the grievance procedure mandated therein meaningless because all school board employees, not just teachers and principals, are covered by some of the Code sections in Article 2 and would therefore fall in that statute\u2019s coverage exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Brown is correct in that certain sections of Article 2 are applicable to most, if not all, public school employees. <em>See e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-295.1 (unfounded information shall not be maintained in any employee personnel file); -296(B) (providing reimbursement for private transportation to all school board employees); -296.1 (requiring as a condition of employment certification that an applicant has not been convicted of a felony or other specified crimes); -296.2 (requiring all applicants for employment to submit to fingerprinting). However, Brown\u2019s position, as well as the circuit court\u2019s conclusion, ignores the word \u201cand\u201d in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6). The grievance procedure required by that statute applies to all school board employees except \u201cthose employees covered under the provisions of Article 2 . . . <em>and </em>Article 3.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6). (Emphasis added.) Brown and the circuit court interpret this phrase as though it excepted those employees covered under the provisions of Article 2 <em>or </em>Article 3. While many public school employees are covered in some respects by certain sections in Article 2, the same cannot be said about Article 3. For the exception in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) to apply, a public school employee must be covered by both articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Thus, we hold that the language of Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) is plain and unambiguous. It is not necessary to add language to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>statute as the circuit court did in order to ascertain its meaning and applicability. \u201cWhere the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u201d <em>City of Winchester v. American Woodmark Corp., </em>250 Va. 451, 457, 464 S.E.2d 148, 152 (1995). A court \u201ccannot change or amend a statute under the guise of construing it.\u201d <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Roanoke, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Botetourt, </em>259 Va. 559, 565, 526 S.E.2d 746, 750 (2000). We also note that to insert the phrase covered by a grievance procedure under Article 2 or Article 3 is illogical because there is no grievance procedure established in Article 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Nevertheless, Brown asserts that he was not a school board employee covered under Article 3 and that, therefore, he does not fall within the exception set forth in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6). He argues that Article 3 applies only to teachers and not to principals because the term \u201cprincipal\u201d is not mentioned in that article. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lee-Warren v. School Bd. of Cumberland County, </em>241 Va. 442, 445, 403 S.E.2d 691, 692 (1991), Brown contends that principals and teachers are not the same and that the term \u201cteacher\u201d as used in Article 3 cannot be interpreted to include the position of principal. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As already explained, the Board of Education promulgated the State Grievance Procedure pursuant to the directive set forth in Code \u00a7 22.1-308. It is true that the term \u201c[grievance\u201d is defined in Code \u00a7 22.1-306 to mean \u201ca complaint or dispute by a teacher\u201d and that the term \u201cprincipal\u201d is not used in the various provisions pertaining to the State Grievance Procedure set out in Article 3. However, the term \u201cteacher\u201d is not defined for the purposes of Article 3. Consequently, under its rule-making authority, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 22.1-16, the Board of Education defined that term in Part I of the State Grievance Procedure. 8 VAC 20-90-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The definition of the term \u201cteacher\u201d for purposes of Part III of the State Grievance Procedure includes \u201call regularly certified/ licensed professional public school personnel employed under a written contract... as a teacher or supervisor of classroom teachers.\u201d A principal is required to \u201chold licenses as prescribed by the Board of Education,\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-293, and to have a written contract, <em>see </em>8 VAC 20-440-10 and 8 VAC 20-440-30. And, a principal is clearly a supervisor of classroom teachers. Thus, a principal such as Brown fell within the definition of the term \u201cteacher\u201d for purposes of Part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>III of the State Grievance Procedure. Accordingly, he was an employee covered by both Article 2, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 22.1-293, and Article 3 of Chapter 15, Title 22.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The fact that a suspension is specifically excluded as a grievable matter under the State Grievance Procedure does not change that result. The provisions of Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) creating the coverage exception at issue require only that the employee be covered under both articles, not that any specific type of employee dispute be covered. Nor does the fact that the authority for the Board of Education to define the term \u201cteacher\u201d derives from Code \u00a7 22.1-16 rather than Article 3 change our conclusion. In other words, Brown was covered by Articles 2 and 3 and therefore was not entitled to utilize the Local Grievance Procedure established pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6). Thus, we hold that the circuit court erred in finding that Brown did not come within the exception carved out in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">This conclusion is consistent with an opinion of the Attorney General. Noting the definition of the term \u201cteacher\u201d adopted by the Board of Education for purposes of Part III of the State Grievance Procedure, the Attorney General opined \u201cthat principals and supervisors who meet the State Board\u2019s . . . definition of \u2018teacher,\u2019 have the same grievance procedure rights with regard to <em>disciplinary </em>probation, dismissal or suspension as outlined for teachers in [Code] \u00a7 22.1-308.\u201d 1983-84 Op. Atty. Gen. 309. \u201c[W]e have repeatedly held that the General Assembly is presumed to have knowledge of the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of statutes, and the General Assembly\u2019s failure to make corrective amendments evinces legislative acquiescence in the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>American Woodmark, </em>250 Va. at 458, 464 S.E.2d at 153. The General Assembly has taken no legislative action to change the statutory interpretation set forth in this opinion of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Additionally, the Board of Education promulgated the definition of the term \u201cteacher\u201d in order to implement the grievance procedure mandated by Code \u00a722.1-308. An \u201celementary rule of statutory interpretation is that the construction accorded a statute by public officials charged with its administration and enforcement is entitled to be given weight by the court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>202 Va. 13, 19, 116 S.E.2d 44, 48 (1960). We presume that the General Assembly is cognizant of the construction of the term \u201cteacher\u201d adopted by the Board of Education and, since that construction has continued for a long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>period without any change by the General Assembly, we further presume that it has acquiesced in the particular construction of that term. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Contrary to Brown\u2019s argument, our decision in <em>Lee-Warren </em>does not compel a different result. There, the issue was \u201c \u2018[w]hether under Virginia law, a school principal with continuing contract status retains that status upon accepting a job as principal in another school division within Virginia[.]\u2019 \u201d 241 Va. at 443, 403 S.E.2d at 691. To resolve that question, we had to compare two statutory provisions, Code \u00a7 22.1-294 dealing with continuing contract status for a principal, assistant principal or supervisor, and Code \u00a7 22.1-303 addressing continuing contract status for a teacher. Because the former provision dealt only with principals, assistant principals, and supervisors while the latter statute addressed only teachers, we concluded that certain transfer provisions found only in Code \u00a7 22.1-303 applied solely to teachers. 241 Va. at 446, 403 S.E.2d at 693. In the present case, we do not have statutory provisions dealing with teachers and principals in separate and distinct ways. And, the definition of the term \u201cteacher\u201d promulgated by the Board of Education does not conflict with any statutory definition of that term since the General Assembly did not include one.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">This brings us to the last step of our analysis. The circuit court found that Brown had presented a grievable issue and remanded his grievance to the School Board for resolution. The court\u2019s jurisdiction to review a school board\u2019s determination of grievability is found in Code \u00a7 22.1-314, which is part of Article 3 and the State Grievance Procedure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That statute allows a decision of a school board regarding grievability to be appealed to the circuit court \u201chaving jurisdiction in the school division for a hearing on the issue of grievability.\u201d However, the definition of the term \u201cgrievance\u201d in Code \u00a7 22.1-306 and in the Part I of the State Grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Procedure specifically excludes a dispute involving a suspension as a grievable matter. Thus, the circuit court erred in finding that Brown had presented a grievable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">This result does not mean that Brown had no remedy. The provisions of Code \u00a7 22.1-315, which are contained in Article 4 of Chapter 15, Title 22.1, afford \u201c[a] teacher or other public school employee\u201d who has been suspended \u201can opportunity for a hearing before the school board in accordance with [Code] \u00a7\u00a722.1-311 and 22.1-313, if applicable.\u201d In fact, Hodock advised Brown of his right to such a hearing by letter dated November 28, 2001, but Brown never requested that hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the circuit court erred in finding that Brown\u2019s December 7, 2001, grievance regarding his \u201c[suspension from job duties\u201d presented a grievable matter. Thus, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and enter final judgment here for the School Board. We will also deny the School Board\u2019s motion to remand this case with directions to dismiss it as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\"> It is not necessary to summarize the stated reasons for Brown\u2019s suspension in order to resolve the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-10\"> The circuit court vacated its final order pending resolution of the School Board\u2019s motion to reconsider. The court subsequently denied the motion and reinstated its final order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\"> Accordingly, we will deny the School Board\u2019s motion to remand and dismiss this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\"> The version adopted by the School Board is identical to the version promulgated by the Board of Education, except in some aspects that do not have any bearing on the issues presented here. Thus, when we refer to the State Grievance Procedure, we mean the version adopted by the School Board unless we specifically cite 8 VAC 20-90-10 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> In finding that Brown could utilize the Local Grievance Procedure required by Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6), the circuit court never explained how Brown fell within the definition of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201c[classified employees.\u201d Nor does Brown address that issue or the anomaly created by saying that he could utilize a grievance procedure that, by definition, does not apply to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\"> Although not relevant to our discussion, Code \u00a722.1-79(6) also excepts a division superintendent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> In light of our holding that Brown was covered by Part III of the State Grievance Procedure, it is not necessary to decide whether the right to appeal a school board\u2019s determination of grievability to the circuit court is also part of the Local Grievance Procedure. Brown argues that it is because of the language in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6), providing that \u201c[t]he grievance procedure shall ... be consistent with the provisions of the Board of Education\u2019s procedures for adjusting grievances except that there shall be no right to a hearing before a fact-finding panel.\u201d The School Board disagrees with that position. If the right to appeal a school board\u2019s determination regarding grievability is not required by Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) and thus not part of the Local Grievance Procedure, then a circuit court would <em>not have </em>subject <em>matter </em>jurisdiction to hear a grievability issue on appeal when the grievant was proceeding under the Local Grievance Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> Given our holding that Brown was covered by Part III of the State Grievance Procedure which excludes a dispute involving a suspension, it also is not necessary to decide whether Code \u00a7 22.1-315 provides the exclusive remedy for a public school employee who has been suspended, irrespective of which grievance procedure would otherwise cover the employee. Brown argues that it does not because of the provision in Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) stating that the grievance procedure shall afford a method of resolving disputes concerning, among other things, a suspension. The School Board, however, claims that the 1996 amendment of Code \u00a7 22.1-315 adding the phrase \u201cother public school employee\u201d implicitly repealed that portion of Code \u00a7 22.1-79(6) dealing with a suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
