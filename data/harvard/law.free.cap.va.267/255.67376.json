She was sentenced to five years in prison with three years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">On appeal, Alger does not dispute that she was a convicted felon or that she possessed a firearm in her home on the date of the offense. Instead, Alger contends, as she did in the trial court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Court of Appeals, that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, as amended and reenacted by the General Assembly, permitted her to possess a firearm within her residence. The Commonwealth responds that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 allowed Alger to possess a stun weapon or taser in her residence, but not a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The issue before the Court is whether, at the time of the offense, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 permitted Alger to possess a firearm in her home. For the reasons that follow, we answer that inquiry in the negative and will therefore affirm Alger\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In the 2001 session of the General Assembly, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 was amended by adding a subclause (b) to the first sentence of subsection A. As amended in 2001 and in force on the date of the offense, the statute provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any <em>(a) </em>firearm <em>or (b) stun weapon or taser as defined in \u00a7 18.2-308.1 except in such person\u2019s residence or the curtilage thereof </em>or to knowingly and intentionally carry about his person, hidden from common observation, any weapon described in <em>subsection </em>A of \u00a7 18.2-308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) (as amended 2001) (emphasis on amended language).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>It is uncontested that on September 7, 2001, Alger was a convicted felon and intentionally possessed a shotgun inside her home. The trial court determined that the clause \u201cexcept in such person\u2019s residence or the curtilage thereof\u201d (the \u201cexcept\u201d clause) only modified \u201cstun weapon or taser as defined by \u00a7 18.2-308.1,\u201d and not \u201cfirearm.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rejected Alger\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause modified \u201cfirearm\u201d so as to permit a convicted felon to possess a firearm in her residence. Alger was then convicted of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">On review, the Court of Appeals, citing <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001), reviewed the statute \u201cin its entirety, rather than by isolating particular words or phrases.\u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va. App. 89, 93, 578 S.E.2d 51, 53 (2003). The Court of Appeals rejected Alger\u2019s interpretation of the statute finding that it would \u201cyield an absurd result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We granted Alger this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Alger argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 \u201cappears on its face to permit a convicted felon to possess firearms and stun weapons/tasers, within her own residence.\u201d In support of this interpretation of the statute, Alger asserts that conventions of legal drafting require items tabulated in an enumeration to be of the same class and that words preceding or following the enumeration shall apply to each item in the series. Therefore, in Alger\u2019s view, the \u201cexcept\u201d clause modifies both \u201c(a) firearm or (b) stun weapon or taser.\u201d Alternatively, Alger asserts that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, as a penal statute, must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in her favor to resolve any ambiguity. Further, Alger argues the Court of Appeals improperly considered the legislative history of the statute without expressly finding the statute to be ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Commonwealth disagrees with Alger\u2019s interpretation of the amended language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and argues the \u201cexcept\u201d clause only modifies subclause (b) concerning stun weapons and tasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Although our analysis differs from that of the Court of Appeals, we reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In reviewing the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, we adhere to the familiar principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">[u]nder basic rules of statutory construction, we determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words contained in the statute. When the language of a statute is unambiguous, courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language and may not assign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\"><em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 268, 271, 576 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2003) (citations omitted). Prior to the 2001 amendments to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, it is clear the obvious intent of that statute was to prohibit persons convicted of felonies from possessing firearms. <em>See e.g., Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 583, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (\u201cthe legislative intent of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is to prohibit convicted felons from possessing \u2018any firearm\u2019 \u201d). The General Assembly added language to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 in 2001 that expanded the proscription against possessing firearms by a convicted felon to include stun guns or tasers. <em>See </em>Acts, 2001 cc. 811 and 854. Concurrently with the addition of this language, the General Assembly also added the exemption for possession in the home or surrounding curtilage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">While it is true that penal statutes must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth in criminal cases, \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 581, 562 S.E.2d at 144. To avoid an \u201cunreasonably restrictive\u201d interpretation of the statute, we may employ established rules of statutory construction. One such rule, sometimes referred to as the last antecedent doctrine, is particularly applicable here and can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. The last antecedent is \u2018the last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tence.\u2019 Thus a proviso usually is construed to apply to the provision or clause immediately preceding it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.33 (6th rev. ed. 2000); <em>see also Barnhart </em>v. Thomas,_U.S._,_, 124 S.Ct. 376, 380 (2003) (explaining and applying \u201cthe grammatical \u2018rule of the last antecedent,\u2019 according to which a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows . . . .\u201d); <em>Nobelman </em>v. <em>American Savings Bank, </em>508 U.S. 324, 330 (1993) (noting that construction of a statute according to the last antecedent rule is \u201cquite sensible as a matter of grammar\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">In the case at bar, the phrase \u201cstun weapon or taser as defined in \u00a7 18.2-308.1\u201d is the last antecedent before the \u201cexcept clause.\u201d As such, \u201cstun weapon or taser\u201d is the referential and qualifying phrase. Thus, according to the last antecedent rule of construction, the \u201cexcept\u201d clause modifies only \u201cstun weapon or taser\u201d and not \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>See e.g., Keene </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois, </em>73 F. Supp. 2d 638, 641 (W.D. Va. 1999) (employing the last antecedent doctrine to interpret an insurance contract); <em>Sun Valley Foods Co. v. Ward, </em>596 N.W.2d 119, 123 (Mich. 1999) (employing last antecedent doctrine to interpret a statute). The wording of the amendment to the statute further reinforces this reading because the General Assembly differentiated between \u201cfirearms\u201d and \u201cstun weapons or taser\u201d by inserting the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d designations before those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Alger argues that \u201c[w]hen items are tabulated in an enumeration, the conventions of legal drafting provide that the enumerated items must all be of the same class and that the words preceding and following the enumeration shall apply to each item in the series.\u201d Inspection of the source material Alger cites for this proposition, however, makes clear that the statutory language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is not what is contemplated as items \u201ctabulated in an enumeration.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Reed Dickerson, <em>The Fundamentals of Legal Drafting </em>\u00a7 6.3 (1965); <em>see e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.7 (items tabulated in an enumeration).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Moreover, had the General Assembly intended to permit convicted felons to possess a firearm in their residence it would have done so. We \u201cassume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute.\u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">For these reasons it is evident that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 did not permit Alger, as a convicted felon, to possess a firearm within her home, the curtilage thereof or anywhere else. We will therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\"> For reasons unknown, when the 2001 version of the Code of Virginia was printed by the contract publisher, Michie Law Publishers, a comma appeared in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) between the first reference to \u201c\u00a7 18.2-308.1\u201d and the word \u201cexcept.\u201d The publisher subsequently issued an errata sheet which corrected the error by removing the erroneous comma and showing the statute in conformity with the Acts of Assembly. <em>See </em>Acts, 2001, cc. 811, 854 (showing enactment by the General Assembly with no comma). However, on September 7, 2001, the date of the charged offense, the publisher\u2019s version of the cumulative supplement to the Code of Virginia reflected the erroneous comma in the text of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Alger does not contend on appeal that the uncorrected cumulative supplement pamphlet for 2001, erroneously published with a comma before the \u201cexcept\u201d clause, has any legal efficacy. We consider only the language actually adopted by the General Assembly, which did not have a comma before the \u201cexcept\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">The General Assembly subsequently amended Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 in 2002 and 2003. The most recent version of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) states in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm or stun weapon or taser as defined by \u00a7 18.2-308.1 or to knowingly and intentionally carry about his person, hid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>den from common observation, any weapon described in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-308.
