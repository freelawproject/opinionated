(\u201cAcordia\u201d), for negligence and breach of an oral contract by failing to include NHBC as a named insured on a policy of builders risk insurance. The trial court granted Acordia\u2019s motion to strike NHBC\u2019s evidence for failure to prove \u201ca covered cause of loss,\u201d even though it found that Acordia was negligent in failing to list NHBC as a named insured on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On appeal, NHBC asserts ten assignments of error, all of which revolve around the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow recovery for expenses incurred in \u201cmitigating\u201d defects in the construction covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Madison Ridge, L.R (\u201cMadison Ridge\u201d) hired NHBC as a general contractor to build the Madison Ridge apartment complex in Harrisonburg, Virginia, (the \u201cProject\u201d). National Housing Corporation (\u201cNHC\u201d), as agent for NHBC, negotiated with Acordia to procure a builders risk insurance policy covering NHBC and other entities for work on several construction projects, including the Project. Acordia obtained a builders risk insurance policy from Security Insurance of Hartford (\u201cSecurity\u201d) and intended that NHBC be an insured under that policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d). Acordia admitted, however, that it never asked Security to list NHBC as a named insured and, in fact, NHBC was not a named insured under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The Project was built on a steep slope that required the construction of multiple retaining walls. The retaining walls constrained the earth behind them which, in turn, supported apartment buildings further up the slope from the walls. NHBC does not dispute that it defectively designed and built the retaining walls because its specifications failed to properly consider the steep incline of the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">In the early months of 1998 NHBC requested that a civil engineer examine one of the retaining walls (Wall 1-2) that had moved forward approximately eight feet so that it was no longer straight. This condition concerned NHBC and its engineer because the soils retained by Wall 1-2 supported the other walls and the foundations of the apartment buildings uphill. Due to his concern about the structural collapse of Wall 1-2, the engineer recommended taking reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>dial measures to ensure the stability of the foundations for the uphill apartment buildings. NHBC instituted the suggested remedial measures and eventually replaced Wall 1-2 with one designed to properly accommodate the topography of the project. Although the other walls had not failed and the apartment buildings suffered no physical damage, NHBC adopted the engineer\u2019s suggested remedial measures to underpin the foundations of those structures so as to prevent any loss or damage. No loss or damage occurred to the apartment buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">NHBC notified Acordia of its claimed loss for the remedial measures, and on May 5, 1998, NHBC formally requested that Acordia submit a claim under the Policy to Security. On several occasions executives at Acordia notified NHBC of its duty to mitigate any loss, but did not affirm a coverage determination had been made. Security initially denied NHBC\u2019s claim based on an exclusion in the Policy for loss \u201ccaused by or resulting from any of the following: . . . . error, omission or deficiency in designs, plans or specifications,\u201d due to the defective wall design. Subsequent to its first denial of NHBC\u2019s claim and the filing of a suit by NHBC to recover insurance proceeds, Security notified NHBC that it \u201cwas not and never had been a named insured under the policy claimed and sued upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">NHBC then filed a motion for judgment claiming breach of contract and negligence by Acordia for the failure to include NHBC as a named insured under the Policy. NHBC claimed damages from Acordia \u201cfor engineering, repairing, and stabilizing the affected walls, and underpinning buildings whose structural integrity and safety had been compromised\u201d (the \u201cremediation expenses\u201d). NHBC alleged these \u201closses would have been covered by the policy if it had been a named insured thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">At trial, Acordia questioned whether NHBC was the proper party to bring suit since Madison Ridge paid the remediation expenses. Acordia asserted that NHBC was not obligated to cover the remediation expenses because Madison Ridge incurred the expenses and failed to \u201cpurchase or maintain\u201d all-risk insurance covering NHBC as required by the contract between NHBC and Madison Ridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, Acordia renewed a motion to strike NHBC\u2019s evidence. The trial court found that NHBC had sustained damages in the amount of $518,690.25 for the remediation expenses and that Acordia was negligent as a matter of law in failing to include NHBC as a named insured on the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The trial court then determined that NHBC could not recover against Acordia because even if NHBC had been a named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>insured under the Policy, its \u201closs\u201d was not covered by the Policy. Since NHBC could not have recovered under the Policy, then it could not recover against Acordia. The trial court then granted Acordia\u2019s motion to strike because NHBC failed \u201cto prove a covered cause of loss.\u201d We granted NHBC this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">[A] court must adhere to the terms of a contract of insurance as written, if they are plain and clear and not in violation of law or inconsistent with public policy. It is not our function to \u201cmake a new contract for the parties different from that plainly intended and thus create a liability not assumed by the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield v. Keller, </em>248 Va. 618, 626, 450 S.E.2d 136, 140 (1994) (quoting <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Crosswhite, </em>206 Va. 558, 561, 145 S.E.2d 143, 145 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">NHBC\u2019s claim against Acordia rests on the premise that had Acordia properly fulfilled its duty as an insurance broker and caused NHBC to be listed on the Policy, then NHBC would have recovered from the insurer the remediation expenses caused by the defective wall. In other words, if NHBC could have recovered under the Policy, it could recover against Acordia.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In sustaining Acordia\u2019s motion to strike, the trial court opined from the bench.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">I don\u2019t want to substitute my judgment for the jury, but the Court is making a legal finding that it doesn\u2019t fall within the policy, and that if the jury did come back and award $518,690.25, quite frankly I would have to take it away. . . . But the facts are what the facts are. It\u2019s true that Acordia screwed up. They didn\u2019t list [NHBC] as a named insured. If they had listed them as a named insured then the result would have been the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">We agree with the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The Policy provides coverage \u201cfor \u2018loss\u2019 to Covered Property from any of the Covered Causes of Loss.\u201d The term \u201cCovered Causes of Loss\u201d is then defined as \u201cRisks of Direct Physical \u2018Loss\u2019 to Covered Property <em>except those causes of \u2018loss\u2019 listed in the exclusions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The Exclusions provision of the Policy then plainly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">2. We will not pay for a \u201closs\u201d caused by or resulting from any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">e. Defective materials or poor workmanship; error, omission or deficiency in designs, plans or specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">This exclusion does not apply to resultant \u201closs\u201d to other Covered Property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">There is no dispute about, and NHBC does not assign error to, the trial court\u2019s finding that Wall 1-2 was defectively designed and the activities NHBC undertook in anticipation of the prospect that Wall 1-2 would fail are the basis of the remediation expenses. Despite the Policy\u2019s plain language excluding loss caused by defective design from coverage under the Policy, NHBC nonetheless claims its remediation expenses are compensable under the \u201cDuties in the Event of Loss\u201d section of the Policy, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">C. DUTIES IN THE EVENT OF LOSS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">You must see that the following are done in the event of \u201closs\u201d to Covered Property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">4. Take all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim. This will not increase the Limit of Insurance. However, we will not pay for the subsequent \u201closs\u201d resulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Essentially, NHBC claims it would have been under a contractual duty, had it been listed as a named insured, to have undertaken the mitigation resulting in the remediation expenses in order to prevent loss to the uphill apartment buildings, which are \u201cCovered Property\u201d under the Policy. That duty, if it existed, does not afford a right to compensation to NHBC under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">No damage occurred to the apartment buildings or other Covered Property. Therefore, as the trial court noted, there was no \u201closs\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>to Covered Property. Such loss is a condition precedent to any compensation under the \u201cDuties in the Event of Loss\u201d section. A \u201c \u2018loss\u2019 to Covered Property\u201d, the Policy\u2019s predicate to mandatory mitigation, did not occur, and therefore no obligation to compensate NHBC arose under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Moreover, subparagraph 4 of the \u201cDuties in the Event of Loss\u201d section further limits any obligation of the insurer because the contractor\u2019s expenses to protect Covered Property are to be considered \u201cin the settlement of the claim.\u201d The claim, under the facts of this case and policy, would be \u201cresulting from a cause of loss that is not a Covered Cause of Loss\u201d and therefore not compensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In effect, NHBC attempts to bootstrap its remediation expenses into a covered claim through the \u201cDuties in the Event of Loss\u201d provision, despite the clear exclusion from coverage for loss caused by NHBC\u2019s defective design. We agree with the trial court that the Policy\u2019s plain language does not permit NHBC to circumvent the exclusion from coverage in this manner and recoup its remediation expenses. <em>See Southern Cal. Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co., </em>83 Cal. App. 3d 747, 759-60 (1978) (\u201cThe duty of an insured to prevent and mitigate insurable loss and the obligation of the insurer to reimburse for expenses so incurred are separate questions. The fulfillment of the duty to mitigate does not necessarily give rise to the obligation of reimbursement . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Even if the Policy does not permit NHBC to recover its remediation expenses, NHBC claims that its common law duty to mitigate damages allows recovery of the remediation expenses from Acordia. Usually, the failure to mitigate damages is an affirmative defense and, therefore, on that point the breaching party, not the injured party, has the burden to produce evidence. <em>Marefield Meadows, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lorenz, </em>245 Va. 255, 266, 427 S.E.2d 363, 369 (1993). However, this case does not involve a <em>failure </em>to mitigate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In a case such as this, where the injured party asserts as part of his recovery the expense of taking corrective measures to mitigate the potential liability of the defendant, the cost of mitigation is simply another element of his damages. It is axiomatic that where \u201cthere is no liability, . . . there can be no recovery.\u201d <em>Southern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>113 Va. 117, 120, 73 S.E. 469, 470 (1912). NHBC\u2019s theory of liability is that but for Acordia\u2019s negligence, its damages, including the cost of mitigation, would have been recoverable under the insurance contract. As we have demonstrated, however, those losses were not a liability covered by the policy and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Acordia\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of NHBC\u2019s losses. Regardless of whether NHBC premises its theory of recovery on contract law or common law, it cannot recover damages where there is no liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">For the reasons stated above, we find that even if NHBC had been a named insured on the Policy, the Policy did not provide coverage for the remediation expenses it now seeks against Acordia. Consequently, NHBC has no cognizable claim against Acordia either in contract or tort. The trial court did not err in granting Acordia\u2019s motion to strike NHBC\u2019s evidence. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> Having resolved NHBC\u2019s assignments of error in favor of Acordia, we do not address any of Acordia\u2019s assignments of cross-error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
