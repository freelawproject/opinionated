The Warden argues that the verdict form the jury considered was proper under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 160, 178, 510 S.E.2d 445, 456 (1999), and that trial counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to anticipate this Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 512, 545, 552 S.E.2d 344, 363 (2001), requiring that the jury receive a verdict form that specifically states that a life sentence may be imposed even after finding one or both aggravating circumstances. The Warden is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">In <em>Atkins </em>the jury was not given a verdict form that allowed it to impose a life sentence if the Commonwealth proved <em>neither </em>of the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. 257 Va. at 178-79, 510 S.E.2d at 456-57. The defense had offered the statutory verdict form, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4, that allowed this sentencing option, but the trial court refused that form. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 510 S.E.2d at 452. We held that the total absence of any jury verdict form allowing imposition of a life sentence if neither of the aggravating factors was proven was reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 179, 510 S.E.2d at 457. We noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>that, had the trial judge selected the statutory verdict form Atkins\u2019 counsel offered, the missing sentencing option would have been submitted to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 510 S.E.2d at 456. That issue is not present in this case, however, because the jury received the statutory verdict form absent in <em>Atkins.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The issue petitioner raises here is whether the verdict form must specifically provide the option of imposing a sentence of life when the Commonwealth has established <em>one or both </em>aggravating factors. We addressed that issue for the first time in <em>Powell. </em>261 Va. at 542, 552 S.E.2d at 361. <em>Powell </em>was not decided until after petitioner\u2019s capital murder trial concluded. Therefore, trial counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to anticipate this Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Powell, Kornahrens </em>v. <em>Evatt, 66 </em>F.3d 1350, 1360 (4th Cir. 1995), and petitioner is not entitled to a new sentencing hearing on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In light of this holding, we must address the claims in petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus relating to the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These claims are allegations of improper jury contacts and communications in connection with his sentencing hearing, Claims I and II, and various allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel in the sentencing proceeding, Claim VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>CLAIMS I AND II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">In Claim I, petitioner asserted that the bailiff in his trial provided <em>ex parte </em>answers to jurors\u2019 questions about the court\u2019s sentencing instructions and, in Claim II, that Juror Anita J. Durrett was improperly seated and that one or more jurors consulted a Bible in the jury room during sentencing deliberations. We referred Claims I and II to the Circuit Court of Augusta County for an evidentiary hearing by order entered June 17, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Following the evidentiary hearing on August 9, 2002, the circuit court issued a letter opinion stating its findings of fact, conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>of law, and recommendations. The circuit court recommended rejecting both claims, finding that the petitioner did not carry his burden of proof to establish that the jury had asked the bailiff questions concerning their sentencing instructions, that there was no evidence that Juror Durrett was biased in favor of the death penalty, and that there was \u201cno reasonable possibility that the jury verdict was influenced by an improper communication in the form of a quotation from the Bible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Petitioner filed a brief with this Court raising a number of objections to the findings and conclusions of the circuit court. The Commonwealth filed a brief responding to petitioner\u2019s arguments and supporting the circuit court\u2019s conclusions. Petitioner filed a reply brief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We begin by addressing two preliminary matters: the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that Claims I and II are procedurally barred by the rule in <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Parrigan, </em>215 Va. 27, 205 S.E.2d 680 (1974), and petitioner\u2019s complaint that the circuit court erred by limiting the evidentiary value of affidavits submitted in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">A. Procedural Bar</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that <em>Slayton </em>precludes consideration of petitioner\u2019s Claims I and II in this habeas corpus proceeding because petitioner did not raise those claims at trial and on direct appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\"><em>Slayton </em>holds that one may not use a habeas corpus proceeding as a substitute for appeal. 215 Va. at 29, 205 S.E.2d at 682. <em>Slayton </em>makes clear, however, that this procedural bar operates when the petitioner \u201chas been afforded a fair and full opportunity to raise and have adjudicated\u201d the constitutional issue at trial and on appeal. <em>Id. </em>If the petitioner did not have that \u201cfair and full opportunity\u201d during his criminal trial and direct appeal, the rule in <em>Slayton </em>does not apply. <em>See DiPaola v. Riddle, </em>581 F.2d 1111, 1113-14 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">In this case, the Commonwealth asserts that the <em>Slayton </em>bar operates because the petitioner could have procured information from the jurors regarding communications with the bailiff and the presence and use of the Bible during sentence deliberations \u201csooner - immediately after trial, in fact.\u201d Adopting the Commonwealth\u2019s rationale for applying the <em>Slayton </em>bar in this case would in effect impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>requirement on defense counsel to poll jurors and any other persons involved with the criminal trial immediately following the trial, often at the same time that counsel is involved in filing post-trial motions and preparing for appeal. Failure to conduct such a poll or investigation in every case would then subject counsel to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a habeas corpus proceeding. We decline to impose such a requirement. Absent any indication that counsel or petitioner knew or should have known of the complained of conduct at a time when the trial court could address the misconduct allegations, the procedural bar in <em>Slayton </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In this case there is no evidence that trial counsel or petitioner had any information indicating that counsel should have interviewed the jury members or the bailiff, and the Commonwealth suggests none. Accordingly, we conclude that <em>Slayton </em>does not bar petitioner\u2019s Claims I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">B. Affidavits</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In its opinion letter, the circuit court stated that it based its findings on the testimony of the witnesses at the hearing and that it relied on the affidavits the petitioner and respondent filed only as they affected the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Petitioner asserts that the trial court erred in not considering the affidavits as substantive evidence. He suggests that because Code \u00a7 8.01-660 allows the use of affidavits as evidence in a habeas corpus proceeding and because at least some of the affiants did testify, the circuit court should have either found that the affidavits were credible testimony or resolved any credibility questions he had through cross-examination of the testifying affiants.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-660 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">In the discretion of the court or judge before whom the petitioner is brought, the affidavits of witnesses taken by either party, on reasonable notice to the other, may be read as evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">This statute makes consideration of affidavits as substantive evidence a matter in the court\u2019s discretion. Accordingly, we apply an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision regarding the use of the affidavits in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">The circuit court identified a number of reasons why it did not consider the affidavits as substantive evidence, including that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>they had no indicia of inherent credibility, were taken without benefit of a transcript, and were taken a significant time after the events occurred. Based on this record, we cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in refusing to consider the affidavits as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">We now turn to the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the claims that were the subject of the evidentiary hearing. When we refer a petition for a writ of habeas corpus involving a capital murder case to a circuit court for an evidentiary hearing, we give deference to the circuit court\u2019s factual findings and consider those findings binding upon this Court unless they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>Hedrick v. Warden, </em>264 Va. 486, 496, 570 S.E.2d 840, 847 (2002). We review <em>de novo </em>any questions of law or mixed questions of fact and law that the circuit court addressed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">C. Improper Communications with the Bailiff</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Responding to jury inquiries regarding sentencing instructions without notifying defendant or his counsel violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>422 U.S. 35, 39-40 (1975); <em>Remington v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 333, 360, 551 S.E.2d 620, 636-37 (2001); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>143 Va. 592, 605, 130 S.E. 398, 402 (1925). Petitioner claimed that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right because the bailiff provided <em>ex parte </em>responses to juror questions regarding the instructions the jurors received in the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial. Petitioner has the burden to establish that such improper contact occurred. <em>Stockton v. Virginia, </em>852 F.2d 740, 743 (4th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">As recited above, the circuit court found no credible evidence to support petitioner\u2019s allegations of improper contact and rejected petitioner\u2019s misconduct claim. Petitioner challenges these findings, asserting that the \u201cmost credible evidence\u201d shows that the jurors had questions about the sentencing instructions during deliberations and the bailiff answered some of their questions. Petitioner\u2019s attack on the sufficiency of the evidence relies wholly on statements in petitioner\u2019s affidavits; however, as we stated above, the circuit court did not and was not required to consider those affidavits as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">A review of the record shows that some of the jurors and the bailiff could not recall whether the bailiff was asked any questions at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>all; other jurors recalled that they asked the bailiff some questions. No juror testified that any of the questions that may have been asked related to the trial court\u2019s instructions. Thus, the circuit court\u2019s factual findings are neither plainly wrong nor without evidence to support them and therefore are binding on us. <em>Hedrick, </em>264 Va. at 496, 570 S.E.2d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Accordingly, we find that petitioner failed to carry his burden to show that an improper contact occurred, and we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">D. Extraneous Influence</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The second claim we referred to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing was that petitioner was denied his rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because jurors read from and relied upon passages in the Bible in making their sentencing determination. The United States Supreme Court set out the following standard for evaluating a claim of extraneous jury contact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">In a criminal case, any private communication, contact or tampering, directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial, if not made in pursuance of known rules of the court and the instructions and directions of the court made during the trial, with full knowledge of the parties. The presumption is not conclusive, but the burden rests heavily upon the Government to establish, after notice to and hearing of the defendant, that such contact with the juror was harmless to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\"><em>Remmer v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 227, 229 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The circuit court found as a matter of fact that one juror \u201chad at least one Bible and perhaps a \u2018Woman\u2019s Devotional\u2019 with her in the jury room during the deliberations in the penalty phase of the trial.\u201d The circuit court also found that the Bible was open during deliberations, that one juror read from it, and that other jurors looked at it. The circuit court assumed that those jurors who looked at the Bible did read from it but found that there was no evidence showing what Bible passage or passages were read.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The circuit court, applying <em>Remmer, Burch </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>273 F. 3d 577 (4th Cir. 2001), and <em>Stockton, </em>concluded that, absent any probative evidence that a juror relied on the contents of a passage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the Bible in making the sentencing decision, there was \u201cno reasonable possibility that the jury verdict was influenced by an improper communication in the form of a quotation from the Bible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Petitioner asserts that the circuit court erred in a number of particulars in finding that there was no indication that the \u201cjury verdict was influenced by an improper communication in the form of a quotation from the Bible.\u201d The petitioner first complains that the circuit court\u2019s factual findings ignore various jurors\u2019 testimony that the Bible was read aloud and was consulted for purposes of determining what punishment was appropriate for the crime of murder. As with his complaints regarding the factual findings regarding communications with the bailiff, the petitioner bases this challenge on statements in the petitioner\u2019s affidavits, not on testimony at the evidentiary hearing. As we have previously stated, the trial court was not required to credit the statements in the affidavits. Our review of the record shows that the circuit court\u2019s factual findings are consistent with the hearing testimony and are not plainly wrong. Thus, those factual findings are binding upon us. Hedrick, 264 Va. at 496, 570 S.E.2d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The petitioner also complains that the circuit court improperly misallocated the burden of proof in his claim of extraneous jury contact. The <em>Remmer </em>presumption of prejudice arises upon a showing of two elements: that an extraneous contact with or by a member of the jury took place and that such contact was \u201cabout the matter pending before the jury.\u201d <em>Remmer, </em>347 U.S. at 229. The character of the extraneous contact must \u201creasonably draw into question the integrity of the verdict.\u201d <em>Stockton, </em>852 F.2d at 743. Once the petitioner shows both elements, the presumption arises, the petitioner is relieved of proving actual prejudice, and the burden shifts to the government to establish that the potentially prejudicial contact was harmless. <em>Remmer, </em>347 U.S. at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In this case, the petitioner established the first element but did not establish the second: the relevance of the contact to the pending matter. The circuit court found that extraneous material, the Bible, was present in the jury room during deliberations, but the circuit court also found that there was no evidence of what Bible passages were read. Implicit in this finding is a determination that no evidence showed that jurors read Bible passages relating to the sentencing decision. Thus, petitioner did not establish that the \u201ccontact\u201d with the Bible was \u201cabout the matter pending before the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Petitioner concedes that no evidence shows which Bible passages were read. Nevertheless, petitioner argued strenuously to this Court that \u201cthe evidence clearly established that several of the jurors read passages regarding the appropriate punishment for murder.\u201d Our review of the record indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">At the evidentiary hearing, petitioner read Juror Durrett a portion of the affidavit she gave to the petitioner in which she stated that she had a Bible with her during the trial and that while deliberating on the sentence \u201csome jurors were able to point to passages in the Bible that support the death penalty for anyone who kills another person.\u201d In response to petitioner\u2019s questions about these statements, Juror Durrett testified that she could not recall which jurors had asked about the Bible, that another juror had identified a book of the Bible which contained information about death, that jurors had referred to the location of passages in the Bible from memory, that she had her Bible in the room but did not think that she had it open during deliberations, and that no one had \u201cread out loud\u201d from the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Juror Sallie Zirkle testified that a \u201cfemale juror\u201d did read from the Bible, but Juror Zirkle could not remember which juror did the reading, what verse was read, why it was read, or if the reading occurred during the jury\u2019s deliberations regarding guilt or sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Juror Barbara Pack testified that, while a Bible was on the table in the jury room, she did not know if anyone other than the owner of the Bible read or looked at the Bible. Juror Pack \u201cassumed\u201d the owner of the Bible was reading it when she \u201clooked\u201d at it.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Juror John M. Harmon testified that nothing was read aloud from the Bible. He did not know what the owner of the Bible read, if anything, when \u201clooking through\u201d it. Juror Joan Lafferty testified that the Bible was a Women\u2019s Devotional Bible and that neither the owner nor any other juror read from this book.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The only reference to a matter related to the sentencing decision was Juror Durrett\u2019s testimony that a juror recited, by memory, the location of a Bible passage relating to the appropriate punishment for murder. This is not evidence that the jury consulted, read aloud, or discussed the referenced passage or any other Bible passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The circuit court\u2019s implicit and explicit factual findings - that there was no evidence establishing that the jurors\u2019 contact with extraneous material involved the \u201csubject matter\u201d before the jury - are supported by the record and not plainly wrong. Based on these factual findings, we agree that the petitioner failed to carry his burden of showing an extraneous contact with the jury about the pend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ing sentencing decision such that the integrity of the jury\u2019s verdict was reasonably drawn into question. Therefore, petitioner has not made the threshold showing entitling him to the presumption of prejudice. <em>See </em>Burch, 273 F.3d at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Petitioner also challenged the seating of Juror Durrett based on the statement in her affidavit that the \u201cBible says that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment for murder.\u201d This statement, he asserts, shows that seating her violated the principles set forth in <em>Morgan </em>v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 729 (1992), because she would automatically vote for the death penalty in every case. The circuit court rejected this claim. After reviewing Juror Durrett\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>testimony during the capital murder trial, the circuit court found that she \u201cwas specifically asked whether she would consider both alternatives available to her, either life without parole or death, and that she answered she would.\u201d Based on this finding, the circuit court concluded that there was no support for the proposition that Juror Durrett was biased in support of the death penalty and recommended that this claim be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We also reject petitioner\u2019s claim that Juror Durrett was biased in support of the death penalty. The record supports the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact. The single statement in her affidavit regarding an \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d is insufficient evidence upon which to find that Juror Durrett herself concurred with the statement and that she would automatically apply this \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d in every capital murder case. During <em>voir </em>dire, Juror Durrett was specifically asked whether she had any religious, philosophical, or moral beliefs that would prevent her from imposing the death sentence and she responded \u201cno.\u201d She was also asked if she would consider both life imprisonment without parole and death as alternative penalties and she responded that she would. Accordingly, we conclude that seating Juror Durrett did not violate the requirements of <em>Morgan v. Illinois.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Accordingly, we reject Claim II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>CLAIM VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In Claim VII, petitioner asserted that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial because counsel failed to investigate and present the circumstances of the offense, evidence regarding petitioner\u2019s religion, and evidence regarding petitioner\u2019s background; failed to develop relevant evidence regarding petitioner\u2019s mental illness, to investigate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>implications of petitioner\u2019s medications, and to obtain the assistance of an independent expert; and unreasonably failed to seek additional time to investigate, all of which individually and collectively prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">To prevail on these claims, petitioner bears the burden of showing that his counsel\u2019s performance was objectively deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). In applying the performance prong of this test, the issue is whether counsel\u2019s acts or omissions were unreasonable in light of all the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 688. That determination begins with a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions fall within the wide range of adequate professional assistance, and this presumption bars an inadequate assistance claim if the complained of conduct might have been the result of tactics or strategy. <em>Id. </em>at 689; <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, 477 </em>U.S. 168, 185-86 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The \u201cprejudice\u201d prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires the petitioner to show that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d 466 U.S. at 694. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is more than a \u201cpossibility\u201d of prejudice; it is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The errors must have \u201cactually had an adverse effect on the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Further, in applying this two-prong test, we need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before addressing the prejudice prong. If the petitioner fails to show the requisite prejudice, we need not scrutinize counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Id. </em>at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">A. Failure to Seek Additional Time to Investigate</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">On April 17, 2000, counsel for petitioner requested a continuance based on difficulties they were experiencing in meeting with petitioner and contacting other potential witnesses. The trial court granted a two-month continuance. Counsel did not seek a second continuance. Petitioner asserts that his counsel should have sought a second continuance because of difficulties in obtaining information and testing regarding petitioner\u2019s background. We reject this claim. Petitioner recites that \u201cthe trial court would have likely granted\u201d a second continuance if counsel had sought one and that without the continuance counsel \u201cwere . . . unable to investigate and present all relevant evidence\u201d regarding petitioner\u2019s background, religion, and mental health history. The evidence petitioner proffers in support of this claim is that some experts were not appointed until shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>before trial, and affidavits from his trial counsel and mitigation specialist explaining difficulties in meeting with petitioner and expressing the opinion that \u201c[e]veryone . . . could have used\u201d more time.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Many of the difficulties the mitigation expert experienced in meeting with petitioner were the result of her schedule and location. Even in light of those difficulties, the mitigation expert affirmed counsel\u2019s mitigation strategy. There is no evidence that any of petitioner\u2019s experts told his counsel that they needed more time. Under these circumstances we cannot say that counsel\u2019s failure to seek a second continuance was unreasonable under the circumstances and, accordingly, we reject this claim. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">B. Failure to Investigate and Present Circumstances of the Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Citing affidavits his fellow inmates submitted, petitioner asserts that his trial counsel should have investigated and introduced evidence regarding petitioner\u2019s dedication to the Asatru religion, including his belief in, and fear of, \u201clife-threatening black magic,\u201d which the victim, Brent H. Parker, allegedly was using against petitioner. Such evidence, petitioner claims, would have demonstrated to the jury that he did not kill Parker because of a depraved mind but because he feared for his life.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">We reject this claim. First, the petitioner presented this evidence to the jury through his own testimony. Petitioner testified about the nature of the Asatru religion and his dedication to it as well as his relationship with the victim and the threats the victim made toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Petitioner also asserts that the inmate\u2019s testimony would have shown that the killing was not related to petitioner\u2019s depravity of mind, one of the grounds for establishing the vileness aggravating factor. However, this assertion does not address the other grounds supporting a finding of vileness - torture and aggravated battery. The evidence that the victim was stabbed 68 times supports a finding of vileness based on torture or aggravated battery. Furthermore, the jury also found that petitioner would be a future danger to society. Nothing in the alleged missing testimony would have affected that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Accordingly, we reject petitioner\u2019s claim because he failed to show that, had the additional testimony he cites been presented to the jury, there would have been a reasonable probability of a different result. <em>Strickland, 466 U.S. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">C. Failure to Investigate and Present Relevant Evidence Regarding Petitioner\u2019s Religion</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Petitioner claims that presenting evidence of the Asatru religion and his immersion in it solely through his own testimony was insufficient to inform the jury of the true nature of the religion and its significance in his life. Without receiving this information from other witnesses such as fellow inmates or acquiring an understanding of prison dynamics from an expert in prison life, petitioner asserts, the jury was left with the \u201csole impression that Lenz\u2019s religion was nothing more than a dangerous and scary cult.\u201d If the jury had such information, petitioner concludes, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that the jury would not have sentenced Lenz to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">We reject this claim. Nothing in the record suggests that the prison life expert petitioner asserts counsel should have called, James E. Aiken, had any knowledge of the Asatru religion or of petitioner\u2019s involvement in it. The record shows only that Aiken had qualified as an expert in \u201cprison operations and classifications\u201d and would have testified regarding the probability of petitioner\u2019s future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The record does show that petitioner called as a witness the prison psychologist who had interviewed him following the murder. The witness described some of the tenets of the Asatru religion. The witness testified that he believed petitioner was sincere in his dedication to this religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The record shows that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did attempt to put on the dynamics of the prison atmosphere and religious groups through the prison psychologist. Counsel ceased that line of questioning when the witness\u2019 answer indicated a lack of violence connected with the Asatru religious group and when the trial court barred further inquiries regarding violent acts by other religious groups in the prison. Counsel\u2019s decision to end this line of questioning apparently was a strategic decision based on the court\u2019s ruling and the testimony of the prison psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Similarly, the inmate testimony petitioner asserts that the jury should have heard did not involve the substance of the Asatru religion. That testimony described the contrast between petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>immersion in his religion and the victim\u2019s aggressive, bullying, nonreligious character, as well as the relationship between petitioner and his victim. Petitioner himself testified to this evidence, and as previously stated, other testimony related to the sincerity of petitioner\u2019s religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">This record does not support a finding that petitioner\u2019s counsel acted unreasonably in light of all the circumstances or that the failure to present testimony of other inmates and James Aiken raises a reasonable probability that the result of the sentencing proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">D. Failure to Properly Investigate and Present Relevant Evidence Regarding Petitioner\u2019s Background</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Petitioner complains, in part, that trial counsel were ineffective because they failed to investigate and develop information about petitioner\u2019s family history of alcoholism, drug abuse, and mental illness. We reject this part of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Petitioner obtained an affidavit from trial counsel stating that efforts were made to locate petitioner\u2019s biological father but that they \u201cnever located [petitioner\u2019s] biological father, or any other members of his biological paternal family.\u201d Counsel did not make a decision that finding these persons was unnecessary, <em>compare Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510 (2003); rather their investigation of these matters was unsuccessful. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that counsel\u2019s actions \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Petitioner also complains that his trial counsel were ineffective because they did not present detailed information regarding his psychiatric institutionalizations, diagnoses, and treatments. We reject this claim also.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">First, petitioner does not assert that counsel were deficient in failing to investigate his background. Petitioner acknowledges that counsel had obtained the records relevant to the evidence he now asserts should have been presented to the jury. \u201c[Cjounsel had . . . stacks of records regarding Lenz\u2019s treatment and diagnoses.\u201d He also acknowledges that both petitioner and his mother testified regarding his childhood and institutionalizations. That testimony provided the jury with the following information.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Petitioner\u2019s mother met his biological father, Michael W. Stagenga, while Stagenga was a student at the United States Naval Academy, and they married upon Stagenga\u2019s graduation. When peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>tioner was bom in 1964, Stagenga was stationed in Vietnam. Petitioner\u2019s parents divorced in 1967, in part because his mother was concerned that his father had a drinking problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Petitioner and his mother returned to Virginia. His mother married Bill Lenz, a Navy helicopter pilot, in April 1968. Bill Lenz wanted to and eventually did adopt petitioner. Mrs. Lenz testified that Bill Lenz never told petitioner that \u201che loved him\u201d and was intense and strict with petitioner. Bill Lenz told Mrs. Lenz not to \u201chug\u201d petitioner all the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The Lenz family moved a number of times as Bill Lenz\u2019s station assignments changed. In first grade, Mrs. Lenz was told that her son was \u201crough on the play ground\u201d and \u201cfidgety in class.\u201d When he was in second grade, petitioner\u2019s brother Lance was bom.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">When petitioner was in fourth grade, his parents sent him to San Diego Children\u2019s Home, a day school, because he was having trouble controlling his anger. The family went to counseling although Bill Lenz \u201cdidn\u2019t like it.\u201d The next year the family returned to Virginia when Bill Lenz left the Navy and joined the Secret Service. Petitioner attended public schools in Woodbridge and needed no special help. He was involved in scouting, soccer, and church activities. Mrs. Lenz testified that petitioner and Bill Lenz had no close father-son relationship and that Bill Lenz disciplined petitioner by making him go to his room for long periods of time. There was no physical abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">When petitioner was 14 years-of-age, his mother was looking after a neighbor\u2019s house and car while the neighbor was away. Petitioner and a friend took the car keys and drove the car around. When confronted, petitioner was \u201cscared\u201d, and, according to Mrs. Lenz, held a kitchen knife and threatened to take his own life. As a result of this incident, petitioner\u2019s parents admitted him to Potomac Hospital, a crisis center, in Woodbridge, Virginia. He was transferred to Dominion Psychiatric Treatment Center (Dominion) in Falls Church, Virginia, a few weeks later because he was showing depression and repressing anger. The family participated in counseling, although Bill Lenz was embarrassed \u201cabout it\u201d and didn\u2019t like doing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">A few months after petitioner was released from Dominion, he and a boy he had met at Dominion burglarized a home and stole some jewelry. Petitioner was returned to Potomac Crisis Center at the insistence of Bill Lenz. At the hearing on the burglary charges, the juvenile court judge sent petitioner to Commonwealth Psychiatric Hospital (Commonwealth) in Richmond as an alternative to jail. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>family participated in counseling while petitioner was at Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">When released from Commonwealth, petitioner was enrolled in Gladden School, a school for boys with behavioral problems. That school closed. Petitioner again got \u201cinto trouble\u201d and this time was sent to Beaumont Learning Center. He acquired his general equivalency diploma while at Beaumont. After one trip home from Beaumont, petitioner did not return to Beaumont as required. He went to Virginia Beach for two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">When petitioner was released from Beaumont, his parents had moved to New Jersey. He went to New Jersey and enrolled in a small college. After a \u201cshort time,\u201d petitioner was in \u201ctrouble\u201d again and sentenced to jail in New Jersey. When released, his mother, who had moved to Iowa, returned to New Jersey and helped him find a place to stay there. Eventually petitioner returned to Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Petitioner complains that this evidence is inadequate because it does not recite the specific diagnoses and treatments he underwent in the various institutions. However, those records show that at age 14 petitioner tested at or above grade level in all tested areas but spelling, had a verbal IQ of 112, a performance IQ of 117 and a full scale IQ of 116. He was classified in the bright to normal range. His psychological evaluations showed that he had poor impulse control, exhibited destructive behavior, had been using \u201cpot\u201d for over a year, had used LSD, and had used cocaine for five months before he was placed in Dominion. Petitioner also admitted he was \u201cdealing\u201d to finance his drug supply. He was evaluated as not psychotic but \u201cdemanding, infantile, depressed and angry.\u201d The evaluator recommended help in improving his self-esteem and controlling his anger. Later evaluations reinforced the notion that petitioner was \u201cabove average\u201d in intelligence but continued to abuse drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In light of the information contained in the reports and evaluations from the various institutions in which petitioner received treatment, counsel\u2019s decision not to present more detail regarding those reports was not unreasonable. The particulars of those reports would have represented a \u201ctwo edged sword\u201d that counsel often confront when constructing the strategy most likely to assist rather than harm a client. <em>Barnes v. Thompson, </em>58 F.3d 971, 980-81 (4th Cir. 1995) (cross-purpose evidence capable of aggravation and mitigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Finally, petitioner has failed to show what the jury could have heard that would have had a reasonable probability of changing the sentencing result. The jury heard about petitioner\u2019s unloving and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>demanding step-father, his natural father\u2019s drinking problem, his suicidal tendencies, his low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness, and his own extensive drug and alcohol use. The possibility that description of these facts could have been presented in more detail does not support a finding of a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different result. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">E. Failure to Develop Relevant Evidence Regarding Petitioner\u2019s Mental Illness</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Petitioner claims that his social and psychiatric history indicates that he suffers from a \u201ccognitive dysfunction\u201d and that this dysfunction leads to low self-esteem, suspiciousness, paranoia, and eccentric behavior - actions that were documented by prior evaluations of petitioner. Such dysfunction, petitioner asserts, \u201chelps explain\u201d petitioner\u2019s loss of control and extreme reaction to the victim\u2019s behavior. Thus, petitioner concludes, his counsel were ineffective because they did not sufficiently develop this information regarding his mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Again we reject this claim. We note that petitioner is not asserting that counsel failed to engage in any investigation of petitioner\u2019s mental state; rather, petitioner\u2019s complaint is that counsel\u2019s development and presentation of the evidence was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Petitioner\u2019s argument relies primarily on the affidavit of a clinical neuropsychologist who tested petitioner and reviewed his records years after the capital murder trial. At the time of trial, petitioner had never been diagnosed with a mental illness of any type. Petitioner\u2019s psychiatric evaluations had identified psychological problems but never suggested a mental illness or \u201ccognitive dysfunction\u201d amounting to a mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Counsel cannot be considered ineffective for failing to develop a \u201cmental illness\u201d theory to use in mitigation when such a condition had not even been suggested by any expert or individual who had evaluated petitioner. <em>See Poyner </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>964 F.2d 1404, 1418-19 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">F. Failure to Obtain Assistance of an Independent Expert</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">At trial, petitioner sought the assistance of James Aiken as an expert witness on the operation and classification of inmates in the Virginia prison system. The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to appoint this expert, saying that the services of the expert were \u201cexpensive\u201d and that the information petitioner sought was available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>from persons who were in Virginia and who could \u201ctell you better how it\u2019s done.\u201d Counsel for petitioner noted his objection but made no further argument. At trial, petitioner called the Virginia Department of Corrections Director of Operations and the Assistant Warden of Operations at Red Onion Prison to testify on the system of prisoner classification and security.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">Petitioner argues that under <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68 (1985), he was entitled to an independent expert and that the expert petitioner sought could have assisted in \u201cpreparing a defense to the Commonwealth\u2019s case for future dangerousness\u201d in the context of a prison environment. Such assistance, petitioner argues, would not have been forthcoming from employees of the Commonwealth\u2019s prison system. Counsel\u2019s failure to advise the trial court of the need for this independent expert constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, according to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We reject this claim. Trial counsel appealed the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for the appointment of the expert at issue on direct appeal. This Court resolved the issue, holding that <em>Ake </em>did not require the trial court to appoint the expert. <em>Lenz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 451, 462, 544 S.E.2d 299, 305 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">To the extent petitioner is complaining that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is based on their failure to make the argument that the expert would be testifying not only to prison classifications and operation but also opining on petitioner\u2019s future dangerousness in the context of a prison setting, we also reject the claim. We have held that Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 does not limit the consideration of whether the defendant would pose a continuing threat to society to a \u201cprison society\u201d because a defendant would be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. <em>Lovitt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 497, 517, 537 S.E.2d 866, 879 (2000). While <em>Lovitt </em>was decided one month after petitioner\u2019s sentencing proceeding, we cannot conclude that counsel was ineffective for failing to advance an argument that we have subsequently rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">G. Failure to Investigate Implications of Petitioner\u2019s Medications</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Petitioner asserts that he was being treated with the steroid prednisone and the antihistamine Benadryl at the time of the murder and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek expert assistance to determine if these medications negatively affected petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>We reject this claim. Petitioner\u2019s mitigation theory revolved around the sincerity of his religious beliefs and his feelings of low esteem and repressed anger stemming from his relationship with his step-father. Petitioner never suggested that he was not in control of his actions when he stabbed and killed Parker or that the sincerity of his religious beliefs was the product of some adverse reaction to medication. Decisions regarding trial strategy often require rejection of other potential strategies. The course of actions petitioner suggests in this habeas proceeding is inconsistent with the trial strategy his trial counsel elected. We cannot conclude that trial counsel\u2019s actions were deficient for failing to make the argument petitioner suggests. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">H. Cumulative Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Lastly, petitioner complains that the cumulative effect of trial counsel\u2019s actions and omissions during the sentencing phase \u201cindividually and cumulatively, prejudiced Lenz.\u201d We reject this claim. Having rejected each of petitioner\u2019s individual claims, there is no support for the proposition that such actions when considered collectively have deprived petitioner of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Mueller v. Angelone, </em>181 F.3d 557, 586 n.22 (4th Cir. 1999), <em>Fisher v. Angelone, </em>163 F.3d 835, 852 (4th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">For these reasons, we deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\"> The verdict form before the jury in the sentencing phase of petitioner\u2019s capital murder trial comports with the language contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">We, the Jury, on the issue joined, having found the defendant guilty of Capital Murder, as charged in the indictment, and having considered the evidence in aggravation and mitigation of the offense, fix his punishment at imprisonment for life.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-11\"> Petitioner raised ten claims in his petition for writ of habeas corpus.

At its core, the issue that Michael W. Lenz raises in this habeas corpus case ultimately evolves from our recent consideration of a defendant\u2019s rights in view of the awesome responsibility statutorily entrusted to the jury in a capital murder case to determine whether a defendant shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. The jury\u2019s determination is aided by two fundamental and pertinent principles. A death sentence may not be imposed unless the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or both of the so-called aggravating factors of future dangerousness or vileness have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>been proven. However, the jury may fix the defendant\u2019s punishment at life imprisonment even when it finds that one or both of these aggravating factors have been proven. Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and 19.2-264.4. In this context, our decision in <em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 160, 178, 510 S.E.2d 445, 456 (1999), was premised upon the well established rule that \u201cit is materially vital to the defendant in a criminal case that the jury have a proper verdict form\u201d reflecting all of its sentencing options. In my view, the majority either ignores the rationale of <em>Atkins </em>or unduly limits that rationale to the specific facts of that case. Our subsequent decision in <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 512, 552 S.E.2d 344 (2001), illustrates the point that it is reversible error when the jury is not given complete or adequate verdict forms that comport with the correct statement of the law given to the jury by the trial court in its sentencing instructions regarding the sentencing options available to the jury, regardless of the specific manner in which those forms are incomplete or inadequate. For the reasons that follow, I would vacate Lenz\u2019s death sentence and remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Beyond question, the jury in Lenz\u2019s case was not given a verdict form that specifically reflected the jury\u2019s option of imposing a life sentence, or a life sentence and a fine of not more than $100,000, even if the jury found that the Commonwealth had proven beyond a reasonable doubt one or both of the aggravating factors necessary for imposing a sentence of death. The trial court was required to provide the jury with a verdict form expressly providing this sentencing option, and we expressly so held in <em>Powell, </em>261 Va. at 545, 552 S.E.2d at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The Warden in this case misses the mark when arguing essentially that there is no <em>\u201cAtkins </em>error\u201d in the verdict forms given to Lenz\u2019s jury because unlike <em>Atkins </em>the jury in Lenz\u2019s case was given the statutory verdict form provided by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4. That statutory verdict form was also given to the jury in <em>Powell </em>and there we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">The issue is not whether the jury was provided with the means to discharge its obligation. If that were the only goal, it could be achieved by providing the jury with a generic verdict form and advising the jury to fill in the particulars of the sentence from the instructions. Rather, the issue is whether the jury is likely to be confused where it is instructed that it may impose a sentence other than death if it finds one or both of the aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>vating factors have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but receives verdict forms that do not expressly state that the jury is allowed to fix a sentence of life imprisonment even though one or both aggravating factors are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 545, 552 S.E.2d at 363. We applied the rationale of <em>Atkins </em>in <em>Powell </em>and the specific deficiency in the verdict forms given to the jury in the former case was not material to our analysis in the latter case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The majority does not dispute that, in the absence of the procedural differences in the two cases, <em>Powell </em>would control the verdict form issue raised by Lenz in this case. In <em>Powell, </em>the inadequacy of the jury verdict forms was an issue raised at trial and preserved for appeal. <em>Id. </em>In Lenz\u2019s case, the very same issue was not raised at trial and preserved for appeal. In Lenz\u2019s direct appeal we raised the issue, <em>sua sponte, </em>and asked the parties to address it in view of our decision in <em>Atkins. </em>We ultimately held, however, that the issue was procedurally defaulted under Rule 5:25 because Lenz had neither raised the issue in the trial court nor assigned error to the verdict forms before this Court. <em>Lenz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 451, 472, 544 S.E.2d 299, 311 (2001). The issue is now before this Court on Lenz\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective in not preserving the issue of the inadequate jury verdict forms used in his capital murder trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Adopting the position asserted by the Warden in Lenz\u2019s habeas corpus case, the majority concludes that Lenz\u2019s counsel was not ineffective because \u201ctrial counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to anticipate this Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Powell.\u201d I agree, but counsel did not need to anticipate our decision in <em>Powell. </em>In my view, trial counsel was ineffective in not recognizing after our decision in <em>Atkins, </em>which was rendered one and one half years prior to Lenz\u2019s trial, that it was materially vital to Lenz that the jury be given a proper verdict form reflecting all of its sentencing options. Specifically, any reasonably effective counsel would have recognized after <em>Atkins </em>that a jury form that did not specifically reflect the jury\u2019s option of imposing a life sentence, or a life sentence and a fine of not more than $100,000, even if the jury found that the Commonwealth had proven beyond a reasonable doubt one or both of the aggravating factors necessary for imposing the death sentence, would not comport with the correct statement of law given to the jury by the trial court in its sentencing instructions. In such a case, die jury would be presented \u201cwith a confusing situation in which the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>court\u2019s instructions and the form the jury was given to use in discharging its obligations [would be] in conflict.\u201d <em>Atkins, </em>257 Va. at 179, 510 S.E.2d at 457. Indeed, that was the reason we raised this issue <em>sua sponte </em>in Lenz\u2019s direct appeal. Our concern was the application of the rationale of <em>Atkins, </em>not the specific manner in which the verdict forms were inadequate in that case, and not the decision we would render in <em>Powell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In short, in view of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Atkins, </em>Lenz\u2019s counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the inadequate verdict form given to the jury at Lenz\u2019s capital murder trial. That failure precluded Lenz from having his sentence determined by a jury with verdict forms that reflected all of its sentencing options under the law or receiving relief on direct appeal. Lenz obviously was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure. Accordingly, I would vacate Lenz\u2019s death sentence and remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-5\"> Because I would remand the case for a new sentencing hearing based upon the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the failure to object to the improper verdict form, I would not reach the other issues addressed by the majority and express no opinion thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
