We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to sever the charges because evidence of the other crimes was not relevant to the only contested issue, whether each victim did or did not consent to sexual intercourse. We will therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">The defendant, Kurvyn Darnell Minor, was charged with 14 offenses that arose out of three separate incidents involving three different victims. First, he was charged with the April 3, 2000, abduction of C.M. and use of a firearm in the commission of that felony. Second, he was charged with the April 13, 2000 abduction, rape, robbery, oral sodomy, attempted anal sodomy, credit card theft, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, all against W.S. Third, the defendant was charged with the September 30, 2000, abduction, rape, robbery, oral sodomy, and anal sodomy of G.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Minor filed a motion to sever the charges, asking that he be tried separately for the offenses related to each victim. He asserted that evidence admissible in the trial of the charges involving one victim would not be relevant to the other offenses involving different victims. The Commonwealth opposed the defendant\u2019s motion and moved for joinder of the charges in a single trial. In a memorandum in support of its motion for joinder, the Commonwealth stated that, \u201c[ijn the present case, <em>modus operandi, </em>opportunity, relationship to the victims, absence of mistake or accident and interconnection of the offenses are all relevant to the trial of these three cases.\u201d The Commonwealth also stated that \u201c[t]he place of attack, the type of victim, the method of transportation, the topics of conversation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>other factors are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit an inference of pattern or purpose for proof showing a common predator or common <em>modus </em>operandi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">At a hearing on the parties\u2019 motions, the Commonwealth admitted that there was no dispute regarding the identity of the perpetrator in the charged offenses. Despite that admission, the Commonwealth stated that the evidence of other crimes was admissible \u201cto show that the defendant\u2019s modus operandi was the same.\u201d The defendant, however, suggested that the only contested issue was whether the victims consented to sexual intercourse. Defense counsel acknowledged that Minor had admitted, in a statement to the police, that he knew these women and had contact with them, including sexual intercourse. Defense counsel then stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be the Commonwealth\u2019s position necessarily that on the issue of whether it was consensual or not that there was - there\u2019s something so unique that occurred between the women that [the Commonwealth] would need to try all the cases on the same day in order to present that issue.\u201d The Commonwealth did not disagree with that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder of the indictments for trial, finding that joinder was proper under Rule 3 A: 10(c). At trial, Minor did not testify. The court instructed the jury on the issue of consent only with regard to the victim identified as W.S. That instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">Consent by [W.S.] is an absolute bar to a conviction of rape. However, consent, once given, may be withdrawn prior to sexual intercourse. If after consideration of all of the evidence you have a reasonable doubt as to whether [W.S.] consented to have intercourse with the defendant, then you shall find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The jury convicted Minor of three counts of abduction; two counts each of rape, oral sodomy, and robbery; and one count each of anal sodomy, attempted anal sodomy, credit card theft, and use of a firearm in the commission of abduction. The jury fixed Minor\u2019s total punishment for these convictions at two life sentences plus 113 years imprisonment. The trial court, however, struck the charge of attempted anal sodomy and reduced the defendant\u2019s sentence to 108 years plus two life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Minor appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Court of Appeals. In an unpublished opinion reversing the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>trial court, the Court of Appeals held that, under Rule 3A: 10(c), justice required separate trials because \u201c[njeither the number of alleged victims nor the strength of similarities between or among the offenses has any bearing on the admissibility of evidence of other offenses where, as here, the only issue genuinely in dispute is whether the acts were consensual or forcible.\u201d <em>Minor v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 3105-01-2, slip op. at 11 (Dec. 31, 2002). The Commonwealth appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">MATERIAL FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The three incidents at issue occurred in the late evening to early morning hours on the respective dates alleged in the indictments. Minor approached each pedestrian victim within the same relative area on the north side of the City of Richmond and identified himself as \u201cKevin Wilkinson\u201d to C.M. and as \u201cKevin\u201d to W.S. He offered each one a ride in his vehicle, which C.M. and W.S. willingly accepted by getting into Minor\u2019s vehicle. Although G.C. initially accepted Minor\u2019s offer of a ride to her home, she refused to get into his car when Minor told her that he wanted to take her to his house. At that point, Minor pulled out a knife, held it to G.C.\u2019s throat, made her get into his vehicle, and told her that he was going to rape her.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">After each victim got into his vehicle, whether willingly or otherwise, Minor drove along Interstate 95, taking each victim to a secluded area in Hanover County. Minor took C.M. and W.S. to a location near a church, and he took G.C. to a wooded area about a mile away from the same church.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">C.M. testified that, as she and Minor traveled to Hanover County, they discussed \u201cgetting together, having sexual performance or act, and I, you know, didn\u2019t mind at that particular time.\u201d She further testified that she and Minor agreed to stop at a gasoline station, where she purchased a condom using Minor\u2019s money. According to C.M., Minor then told her \u201cthat he wanted anal sex.\u201d At that point, C.M. objected, \u201cI said no, that\u2019s okay. I change my mind. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d C.M. testified that Minor\u2019s \u201cwhole tone and attitude just change[dj\u201d then and \u201chis voice [got] real harsh and nasty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">When Minor stopped his vehicle near the church, he took the keys out of the ignition and went back to the trunk of the vehicle. As he started to reenter the vehicle, C.M. \u201cjumped out\u201d and went over by the church. Minor then drove away \u201creal fast\u201d but suddenly stopped, backed up, and told C.M. that he was not going to leave her there. He ordered C.M. to get back into the vehicle, but she refused. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Minor pointed an \u201cobject out of the car that look[ed] like a gun,\u201d and C.M. started running behind the church. As she ran, C.M. heard a sound \u201c[ljike a firecracker or a pop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">When W.S. got in Minor\u2019s car, he offered her $100 \u201c[t]o have some sex.\u201d W.S. agreed and testified that, as they were driving along, Minor was \u201ca very nice, very nice guy.\u201d However, W.S. stated that \u201call of a sudden on the interstate, he started getting - attitude start[ed] changing, ... he really was getting very forceful . . . .\u201d According to W.S., Minor forced her to perform oral sodomy on him while he was driving on the interstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Minor stopped his vehicle in the middle of a road near the church. W.S. testified that they had vaginal sexual intercourse in the front seat of the vehicle and that she did so because she was scared. Minor also attempted to have anal sodomy with W.S. Eventually, Minor drove to another location where he pulled out a gun and pointed it at W.S.\u2019s head, telling her not to scream. W.S. then opened the passenger door, and as she was trying to exit the vehicle, Minor grabbed her purse, which contained her identification and a credit card. He then drove away. In the early morning hours of April 13, 2000, Minor attempted to use that credit card three times at two different automatic teller machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">After Minor made G.C. get into his car, he drove along Interstate 95 and stopped in a wooded area. According to G.C., Minor dragged her out of his vehicle with a knife held to her throat and then took her back to the vehicle where he started removing her clothes. G.C. testified that Minor forced her to engage in acts of vaginal intercourse, oral sodomy, and anal sodomy, while \u201cpoking\u201d her with the knife or \u201cbang[ingj\u201d her head on the vehicle. Minor drove off, leaving G.C. in the woods and taking most of her clothes, her cellular telephone, a pager, and approximately $40 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Evidence established that, during a traffic stop in May 2000, a police officer seized a handgun from Minor. That seizure took place after the first two incidents at issue had transpired but before the third one occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">It is well established in our jurisprudence that evidence of other offenses is generally not admissible to prove guilt of the crime for which a defendant is presently on trial. <em>See Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 142, 314 S.E.2d 371, 383 (1984); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 72, 76, 278 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1981); <em>Eccles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 20, 22, 197 S.E.2d 332, 333 (1973). This is so because \u201c[s]uch evidence implicating an accused in other crimes unrelated to the charged offense . . . may confuse the issues being tried and cause undue prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998). There are, however, some recognized exceptions to this general principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">\u201cEvidence of other offenses is admitted if it shows the conduct and feeling of the accused toward [the] victim ... or if it tends to prove any relevant element of the offense charged. Such evidence is permissible in cases where the motive, intent or knowledge of the accused is involved, or where the evidence is connected with or leads up to the offense for which the accused is on trial. Also, testimony of other crimes is admissible where the other crimes constitute a part of the general scheme of which the crime charged is a part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><em>Satcher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 230, 421 S.E.2d 821, 828 (1992) (quoting <em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970)); <em>accord Scates v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 757, 761, 553 S.E.2d 756, 759 (2001); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 645, 651, 529 S.E.2d 787, 790-91 (2000). For such evidence to be admissible under one of these exceptions, the legitimate probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. <em>Guill, </em>255 Va. at 139, 495 S.E.2d at 491-92; <em>Satcher, </em>244 Va. at 231, 421 S.E.2d at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The question whether an accused, pursuant to Rule 3A:10(c), can be tried in a single trial for all offenses then pending against that defendant is a matter resting within a trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 33, 393 S.E.2d 599, 603 (1990) (citing <em>Fincher v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 552, 553, 186 S.E.2d 75, 76 (1972); <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 310, 315, 53 S.E.2d 54, 56 (1949)). Thus, on appeal, a trial court\u2019s decision to join different offenses for trial will not be reversed absent a showing that the court abused its discretion. <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 33-34, 393 S.E.2d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The issue in this appeal is whether \u201cjustice\u201d required separate trials under Rule 3A: 10(c). To resolve that issue, we must determine whether evidence showing the defendant\u2019s rape of one victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>was relevant to prove that a different victim did not consent to sexual intercourse. The only contested issue identified at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to sever the charges was whether the victims consented. Similarly, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201cthe only issue genuinely in dispute [was] whether the acts were consensual or forcible.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Minor, </em>No. 3105-01-2, slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Before answering that evidentiary question, we must clarify one matter with regard to a defendant\u2019s intent to commit the crime of rape vis-\u00e1-vis a victim\u2019s lack of consent to sexual intercourse. The Commonwealth never articulated at trial exactly to what relevant issues the evidence of other crimes pertained. However, the Commonwealth maintains on appeal that such evidence was admissible to show the defendant\u2019s intent and thus the victims\u2019 lack of consent to sexual intercourse. In its argument, the Commonwealth seems to equate those two issues. For example, the Commonwealth states on brief, \u201cSimply put, the other crimes evidence here showed the defendant\u2019s intent, in each instance, to force the victim to submit to sexual contacts of various sorts, regardless of the victim\u2019s wishes.\u201d In discussing the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, the Commonwealth asserts that \u201cthe Court of Appeals has established a rule of law that prohibits the introduction of other crimes evidence in rape cases when the principal issue to be resolved is whether the sexual act was consensual.\u201d But, in the same paragraph, the Commonwealth states that the decision in <em>Moore </em>\u201cclearly holds that other crimes evidence is admissible on the issue of intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">However, a defendant\u2019s intent to commit the crime of rape is not the same issue as whether a victim consented to sexual intercourse. Those two issues are distinct and should not be blurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">Although proof of rape requires proof of intent, <em>the required intent is established upon proof that the accused knowingly and intentionally committed the acts constituting the elements of rape. </em>The elements of rape . . . consist of engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim, against her will, by force, threat, or intimidation. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\"><em>Clifton v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va. App. 178, 184, 468 S.E.2d 155, 158 (1996); <em>see also, People </em>v. <em>Mangiaracina, </em>424 N.E.2d 860, 863 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981) (\u201c[W]hether the defendant intended to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the offenses without the victim\u2019s consent is not relevant, the critical question being whether the victim did, in fact, consent. This involves her mental state, not the defendant\u2019s.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>464 N.E.2d 33, 36 (Mass. 1984) (the crime of rape does not require proof that the defendant harbored a \u201cspecific intent that the intercourse be without consent\u201d); <em>State v. Ayer, </em>612 A.2d 923, 925 (N.H. 1992) (Rape is generally considered to be \u201ca general intent, rather than a specific intent, crime. . . . [T]he general intent requirement for rape means that \u2018no intent is requisite other than that evidenced by the doing of the acts constituting the offense.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). The issue of a victim\u2019s consent pertains to the element of rape requiring proof that sexual intercourse was against the victim\u2019s will, not to whether a defendant \u201cknowingly and intentionally committed\u201d the acts constituting rape. <em>Clifton, </em>22 Va. App. at 184, 468 S.E.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We now turn to the dispositive evidentiary question. In doing so, we recognize that evidence showing that a defendant committed similar sexual offenses against an individual other than the victim in a particular case is, on occasion, admissible to prove certain contested matters, such as a defendant\u2019s identity or the attitude of a defendant toward a victim, provided the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. <em>See Satcher, </em>244 Va. at 231, 421 S.E.2d at 828. Indeed, if the evidence of other similar offenses had been offered as proof on a contested issue about the defendant\u2019s identity in these offenses, that evidence would likely have been admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In fact, this Court reached that exact result in <em>Satcher, </em>a case in which the defendant denied committing the crimes and identity was an issue. Satcher was convicted in one trial of the robbery, assault and battery, and attempted rape of Deborah Abel; and the robbery, rape, and capital murder of Ann Elizabeth Borghesani. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 421 S.E.2d at 824. We upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of Satcher\u2019s motion for separate trials. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 421 S.E.2d at 827. We stated that the evidence of the Abel offenses would have been admissible in a separate trial for the Borghesani offenses because that evidence established Satcher as the assailant in both crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 229-30, 421 S.E.2d at 827; <em>see also Turner, </em>259 Va. at 651, 529 S.E.2d at 790-91 (evidence of similar offenses involving different victims was admissible to prove a common perpetrator); <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 89, 393 S.E.2d 609, 616 (1990) (same); <em>Hewston v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 409, 412, 444 S.E.2d 267, 268-69 (1994) (same); <em>cf. Herron </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 326, 327-28, 157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>S.E.2d 195, 196-97 (1967) (evidence of other incidents of sexual intercourse with the <em>same </em>victim was admissible to show the defendant\u2019s disposition with respect to the particular act charged).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Also, in <em>Moore, </em>a case discussed at length by the Commonwealth on brief, we approved the admission of evidence concerning a sexual offense against a third party but not for the purpose of proving the victim\u2019s lack of consent. There, the defendant was charged both with enticing a male child under the age of 14 to enter a house for the purpose of fondling or feeling the sexual or genital parts of the child and with the actual fondling of that child. 222 Va. at 73, 278 S.E.2d at 823. The challenged testimony concerned the defendant\u2019s subsequent attempted homosexual act upon the third party, also a teenager. That subsequent offense occurred at the defendant\u2019s office when the victim and the third party were both present. During that encounter, the defendant described homosexual acts he had performed with other boys, offered the victim and the third party money to engage in similar acts with him, pulled down the third party\u2019s pants, told the victim to hold the third party, and attempted to perform a sexual act upon the third party. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 278 S.E.2d at 824. Although the evidence involved an offense against a third party, we noted that it also concerned the victim and \u201cshowed the conduct or attitude of the defendant toward [the victim], indicated the ongoing nature of their relationship, and negated the possibility that the defendant\u2019s touching of [the victim] in the [prior] incident was accidental or for a purpose misunderstood by [the victim].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 278 S.E.2d at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In our view, evidence showing that a defendant raped one or more individuals other than the victim in the crime charged is generally not relevant to the question whether that victim did or did not consent to sexual intercourse with the defendant. This is so because \u201c[t]he fact that one woman was raped . . . has no tendency to prove that another woman did not consent.\u201d <em>Lovely </em>v. <em>United States, </em>169 F.2d 386, 390 (4th Cir. 1948); <em>accord Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 316, 320, 362 S.E.2d 745, 747 (Va. Ct. App. 1987); <em>see also Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>459 N.E.2d 376, 379 (Ind. 1984) (where the only issue was consent of the prosecutrix, evidence of prior rapes was not admissible because the fact that one woman was raped did not tend to prove that another woman did not consent); <em>State </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>414 N.W.2d 843, 847 (Iowa Ct. App. 1987) (\u201c[n]either . . . does one woman\u2019s lack of consent to intercourse with a man imply a different woman\u2019s lack of consent to intercourse with the same man\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hatcher, </em>372 So.2d 1024, 1034 n.1 (La. 1979) (in a prosecution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>rape where the only issue is consent, \u201c[t]he lack of consent by other victims is not probative of lack of consent by the complainant of the charged offense\u201d); <em>State v. Alsteen, </em>324 N.W.2d 426, 429-30 (Wis. 1982) (evidence of defendant\u2019s prior acts had no probative value on the issue of the complainant\u2019s consent because \u201c[c]onsent is unique to the individual\u201d); <em>cf. Winfield </em>v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 211, 218, 301 S.E.2d 15, 19 (1983) (\u201cthere is no logical connection between a woman\u2019s willingness to submit to the defendant accused of raping her, and her willingness to share intimacies with another man with whom she might have had a special relationship\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">As the court in <em>Lovely </em>explained, \u201cevidence of other similar offenses is held admissible for the purpose of establishing intent in cases of assault with the intent to commit rape . . . , and evidence of other offenses of like character is admissible in prosecutions for crime involving a depraved sexual instinct.\u201d 169 F.2d at 390. However, the court observed that \u201cthe overwhelming weight of authority is that such evidence is not admissible in prosecution for rape\u201d for obvious reasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cOther attempts to ravish have a tendency to show that an assault under investigation was made with like intent. Acts showing a perverted sexual instinct are circumstances which with other circumstances may have a tendency to connect an accused with a crime of that character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, as already noted, the issue of consent concerns a victim\u2019s state of mind and is unique with regard to each individual victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Based on the specific circumstances presented in this case, we hold, as did the Court of Appeals, that \u201cthe testimony of each victim . . . was inadmissible at the trial for the offenses allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>committed against each of the other victims.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Minor, </em>No. 3105-01-2, slip op. at 11. For that reason, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to sever the charges and will therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\"> On appeal to this Court, neither party challenged the scope of the contested issue addressed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> We recognize that the decision in <em>Lovely </em>predates the adoption of Fed.
