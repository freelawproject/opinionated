BACKGROUND AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Peggy Vegosen (\u201cVegosen\u201d) filed a motion for judgment against Lifestar Ambulance Service, Inc. alleging personal injuries sustained during her transport in an ambulance. Lifestar Ambulance Service, Inc., entered a special appearance claiming it was not the proper defendant. With leave of court, Vegosen filed an amended motion for judgment against Lifestar Response of Maryland, Inc. (\u201cLifestar\u201d). Lifestar Ambulance Service, Inc. was dismissed as a defendant. A private process server then served the amended motion for judgment on the registered agent for Lifestar. According to the affidavit of service, a \u201cSummons, Complaint, and Attachments\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were included in the service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Lifestar did not make an appearance or file a responsive pleading. Vegosen filed a motion for default judgment which it served upon Lifestar. The trial court granted Vegosen\u2019s motion for default judgment and, after an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, awarded damages in the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>of $100,000. Subsequently, Lifestar moved to vacate the default judgment pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In support of its motion Lifestar argued that it had not been served with a notice of motion for judgment as required by Rule 3:3 and therefore the trial court did not have jurisdiction over it to enter the default judgment. Lifestar contended that the default judgment was thus void and should be set aside under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(A)(ii). Vegosen responded that Lifestar had failed to prove no notice of motion for judgment had been served and that, even if that allegation was true, the saving provision of Code \u00a7 8.01-288 cured any defective service because Lifestar had actual notice of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AHd\">The trial court ruled by letter opinion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">that the mere absence of a Notice of Motion for Judgment does not automatically render a default judgment void where the defendant has been served with an Amended Motion for Judgment and has actual notice of the litigation. While [Lifestar] is correct that Rule 3:3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia provides that the Notice of Motion for Judgment is the process required to give notice to the defendant of a lawsuit, the saving provision of Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-288 cures a defect of service where process is shown to have actually \u201creached the person to whom it is directed within the time proscribed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The trial court found that while Lifestar had been served with an amended motion for judgment, the required Rule 3:3(c) notice prepared by the clerk was not served or otherwise received by Lifestar. The trial court also found Vegosen\u2019s counsel had communicated by telephone to Lifestar\u2019s registered agent on the date the amended motion of judgment was served that Lifestar had three weeks to file a responsive pleading. Concluding that Lifestar \u201chad actual notice of the lawsuit and of the time for filing a responsive pleading,\u201d the trial court ruled Code \u00a7 8.01-288 cured any defect in service of process because actual notice cures \u201cany defect whatsoever.\u201d The trial court denied Lifestar\u2019s motion to vacate the default judgment. We awarded Lifestar this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Under Rule 3:3(a), \u201c[a]n action shall be commenced by filing in the clerk\u2019s office a motion for judgment.\u201d Rule 3:3(c) sets out the proper form of \u201c[t]he notice to be given of the motion for judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ment,\u201d which is issued by the clerk and notifies the party being sued that unless a responsive pleading is filed in the clerk\u2019s office within twenty-one days after service of the notice of motion for judgment, default judgment for the plaintiff may be entered. Rule 3:3(c) then provides that \u201c[t]he clerk shall issue the notice and attach it to a copy of the motion for judgment, <em>and the combined papers shall constitute the notice of motion for judgment to be served as a single paper.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>Rule 3:3(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The plain language of Rule 3:3(c) mandates that the notice of motion for judgment to be served on the defendant has two constituent parts, both of which are required to constitute \u201cprocess\u201d: a copy of the motion for judgment <em>and </em>the notice issued by the clerk. <em>See Bendele v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va. App. 395, 398, 512 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1999) (in equity, \u201cprocess\u201d is the \u201csubpoena in chancery, which the clerk would have attached to a copy of the filing\u201d). Rule 3:3(c) then underscores that these two documents, \u201cserved as a single paper,\u201d constitute \u201cprocess\u201d because \u201c[n]o judgment shall be entered against a defendant who was served <em>with process </em>more than one year after commencement of the action against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The trial court held that failure to serve the defendant with the \u201cnotice\u201d portion of the notice of motion for judgment does not void a default judgment when the defendant has been served with an amended motion for judgment and has actual notice of the suit. We disagree. Receiving a notice of motion for judgment is the <em>sine qua non </em>to having been served with process. Indeed, under the plain language of Rule 3:3(c), \u201cprocess\u201d is the notice of motion for judgment which must consist of \u201cthe combined papers ... to be served as a single paper.\u201d Without either the notice prepared by the clerk or the copy of the motion for judgment, there is no notice of motion for judgment and no \u201cprocess.\u201d It is the \u201cprocess\u201d which must reach the defendant to vest the court with jurisdiction. Without service of the \u201cprocess,\u201d the court acquires no jurisdiction. A plaintiff who fails to serve a notice of motion for judgment on the defendant has failed to serve process and cannot benefit from the entry of a default judgment because the trial court never acquired jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Nonetheless, Vegosen argues that the saving provision of Code \u00a7 8.01-288 cures any defect of service so as to give the court jurisdiction. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, it will be construed according to its plain meaning. <em>Smith Mt. Lake </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>Yacht Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ramaker, </em>261 Va. 240, 247, 542 S.E.2d 392, 396 (2001); <em>Earley </em>v. <em>Landsidle, </em>257 Va. 365, 370, 514 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1999). Code \u00a7 8.01-288 states, in pertinent part, that <em>\u201cprocess </em>which has reached the person to whom it is directed within the time prescribed by law, if any, shall be sufficient although not served or accepted as provided in this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added). By its plain language the statute applies only when \u201cprocess\u201d has reached \u201cthe person to whom it is directed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cProcess\u201d under Code \u00a7 8.01-288 is the same \u201cprocess\u201d as defined under Rule 3:3(c). In the case at bar, \u201cprocess\u201d never reached Lifestar because the papers served on it did not constitute a notice of motion for judgment under Rule 3:3.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Under its clear terms, Code \u00a7 8.01-288 is designed to cure defects in the <em>manner </em>in which \u201cprocess\u201d is served. It cannot cure defects in the \u201cprocess\u201d itself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since Lifestar never received \u201cprocess,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-288 does not apply. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Vegosen\u2019s failure to serve Lifestar with a notice of motion for judgment pursuant to Rule 3:3 meant Lifestar never received process and was not properly before the trial court. Since the process was defective, as distinguished from the manner of service, the saving provision of Code \u00a7 8.01-288 does not apply. Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction over Lifestar, it erred in entering a default judgment. Since the default judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction, the trial court also erred in failing to grant Lifestar\u2019s motion to set that judgment aside under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(A)(ii). We will therefore vacate the default judgment entered May 17, 2002, reverse the trial court\u2019s final judgment order entered June 10, 2002, and remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\n<em>Reversed, vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-12\"> While the affidavit makes the recital quoted in the text that a \u201cSummons\u201d was served as part of the papers delivered to the defendant\u2019s registered agent, the record is clear in this case that no summons or notice of any kind was affixed to the motion for judgment delivered to defendant\u2019s registered agent. Hence we do not address in this opinion the issue whether a notice that is improperly titled is valid. See Rule 3:3(c) (\u201cThe notice to be given of the motion for judgment shall be <em>substantially in this form\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\"> Vegosen also argues that even if the trial court\u2019s determination that the saving provision Code \u00a7 8.01-288 cured the defective service of process is in error, Lifestar\u2019s subsequent receipt of notice of default judgment under Code \u00a7 8.01-296(2)(b) cures any defect in service. The trial court rejected this argument, as do we. Nothing in Code \u00a7 8.01-296(2)(b) purports to validate jurisdiction to a court for entry of default judgment when the court has not otherwise acquired jurisdiction over the defendant. Further, Rule 3:17 states that \u201c[a] defendant who fails to plead <em>to a notice of motion for judgment </em>within the required time is in default.\u201d (Emphasis added). Lifestar did not receive a notice of motion for judgment and therefore could not have been in default.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
