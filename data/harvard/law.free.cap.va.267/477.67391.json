Heath and Spero were never married and ended their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>relationship in 2001, before Ella\u2019s birth. Also before Ella\u2019s birth, Spero told Heath that he was not Ella\u2019s father. Consequently, Ella received the surname \u201cSpero.\u201d A paternity test, completed in January 2002, confirmed that Ella was Heath\u2019s child.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Heath filed a petition to change Ella\u2019s surname. At the hearing on the petition, Heath and Spero contradicted one another concerning the amount, type, and quality of support provided by Heath for Ella\u2019s care. Spero alleged that Heath was a drug dealer and was planning to move to Amsterdam, which Heath denied. Heath produced evidence that Spero had been convicted of \u201cdriving under the influence of alcohol within one year\u201d of Ella\u2019s birth. Finally, both Heath\u2019s and Spero\u2019s mothers testified about the effect, as they experienced it, of having a different surname than their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court found \u201cthat it is in the best interest of the child that she have the last name of the petitioner, David Todd Heath.\u201d Spero filed a motion to reconsider. The trial court heard argument on the motion but reaffirmed the prior judgment changing Ella\u2019s surname to \u201cHeath.\u201d The trial court suspended \u201cthe effect\u201d of the order until resolution of the expected appeal to this Court. Spero appeals the adverse judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">We will consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the respondent, Heath, the prevailing party below. In Virginia, Code \u00a7 8.01-217 delineates the method for changing the name of a minor. It requires that the person seeking the name change \u201capply ... to the circuit court of the county or city in which the person whose name is to be changed resides.\u201d It further requires reasonable notice to the parent who does not seek the name change and a hearing to determine whether the name change is in the best interest of the minor. Code \u00a7 8.01-217.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The parent petitioning to change the surname of the minor bears the burden of proving that the change is in the minor\u2019s best interest. <em>See May v. Grandy, </em>259 Va. 629, 632, 528 S.E.2d 105, 106 (2000); <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Shurbutt, </em>259 Va. 305, 308, 525 S.E.2d 917, 919 (2000); <em>Beyah v. </em>Shelton, 231 Va. 432, 434, 344 S.E.2d 909, 911 (1986); <em>Flowers v. </em>Cain, 218 Va. 234, 237, 237 S.E.2d 111, 113 (1977). The petitioning parent may prove that the name change is in the best interest of the minor by showing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">1) The parent sharing his or her surname with the minor has \u201cabandoned the natural ties ordinarily existing between parent and child,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>2) The parent sharing his or her surname with the minor \u201chas engaged in misconduct sufficient to embarrass the [minor] in the continued use\u201d of the parent\u2019s name,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">3) The minor \u201cotherwise will suffer substantial detriment\u201d by bearing the surname he or she currently bears, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">4) The minor \u201cis of sufficient age and discretion to make an intelligent choice and . . . desires that [his or her] name be changed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>See, e.g., Flowers, </em>218 Va. at 236-37, 237 S.E.2d at 113. A \u201cchange of name will not be authorized . . . merely to save . . . minor inconvenience or embarrassment\u201d to the parent or the minor. <em>Id. </em>at 237, 237 S.E.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Although our previous cases often use gender specific terms in enunciating the test for determining whether a name change is in the best interest of a child, that language should not be read to mean that there is a presumption that a child should have the father\u2019s surname or that the mother always bears the burden of proof for or against a petition for name change. Nothing in the language of the statute suggests such a presumption. Under the statute, a petition for changing a child\u2019s name must be considered on the particular facts of the case before the court. The burden is upon the petitioning party to \u201cprove by satisfactory evidence that the change is in the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d <em>Rowland, </em>259 Va. at 308, 525 S.E.2d at 919; <em>May, 259 </em>Va. at 632, 528 S.E.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In this case, Heath, the parent petitioning to change Ella\u2019s surname, did not offer evidence tending to show any of the criteria required by <em>Flowers. </em>Spero\u2019s DUI conviction within a year of Ella\u2019s birth does not rise to the level of misconduct sufficient to embarrass the child in the continued use of the parent\u2019s surname. The record does not reflect that Ella will suffer any form of detriment by continuing to use the surname \u201cSpero.\u201d The record does not reflect that Spero has failed to care for Ella, nor that she has engaged in misconduct sufficient to embarrass Ella in the continued use of the surname \u201cSpero.\u201d The testimony of Ella\u2019s grandmothers fails to rise beyond a catalogue of minor inconveniences and embarrassment. Based on the record before us, Heath has not satisfied his burden of proof as the petitioning parent because he has not offered sufficient evidence to show that a name change is in Ella\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">We hold that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering the change in Ella\u2019s surname. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of the trial court. The trial court\u2019s order of December 12, 2002 will be vacated and the petition for name change will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\n<em>Reversed, vacated, and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
