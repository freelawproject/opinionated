In light of the plain terms of Code \u00a7 46.2-924(B), we answer that question in the affirmative and thus conclude that the circuit court erred in granting the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">Howell Russ, the appellant, filed a motion for judgment against James Destival, the appellee, claiming damages for personal injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>allegedly sustained as a result of an accident that occurred at the intersection between Braddock Road and Prestwick Drive in Fairfax County. Russ was riding a bicycle westbound along a path that runs adjacent to Braddock Road and, as he proceeded across Prestwick Drive, he was struck by an automobile driven by Destival.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Braddock Road is a four-lane highway divided by a median strip. Prestwick Drive is a two-lane street that provides ingress and egress to a residential neighborhood and has a posted speed limit, according to Russ, of 25 miles per hour. As Destival traveled along Prestwick Drive and approached the intersection between these two roads, he came to a stop sign and white \u201cstop line\u201d at the end of Prestwick Drive. According to his trial testimony, Destival stopped his vehicle behind the white line but then \u201ceased\u201d his vehicle forward, beyond the white line, to within six to eight feet of the eastbound lanes of Braddock Road in order to see oncoming traffic more clearly. He intended to turn left and proceed westbound on Braddock Road. When he accelerated forward to cross the eastbound lanes to the median, he heard a yell and a \u201clarge thud.\u201d Destival admitted that he never saw Russ before the impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Russ testified that, as he approached the intersection in question, he saw Destival\u2019s vehicle come to a stop beyond the white line \u201cbut not in the path of the bike path.\u201d He stated that Destival\u2019s vehicle \u201croll[ed] through the stop sign and stop[ped] just before the end of the bike path.\u201d Russ admitted that he never stopped his bicycle before crossing Prestwick Drive in front of Destival\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">During argument on jury instructions, Destival offered Jury Instruction Q, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">A bicyclist has a duty to use ordinary care when he is riding on or crossing the hard surface of a highway:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">(1) to keep a lookout for motor vehicles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">(2) to refrain from entering or crossing an intersection or the hard surface of a highway in disregard of traffic which is close or approaching in such a manner that a reasonable person would not attempt to enter or cross; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">(3) to step or move from his course into a place of safety if it reasonably appears to him that he is in danger of being struck by a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>If a bicyclist fails to perform any one or more of these duties, then he is negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Destival had modified the instruction from its original version to include the word \u201cclose\u201d in subsection 2. The circuit court granted the jury instruction over Russ\u2019 objection, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Destival.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Russ filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict and enter judgment in his favor, or in the alternative, to grant him a new trial. The circuit court denied Russ\u2019 motion. This Court granted Russ an appeal limited to the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">The court erred in its rulings regarding the jury instructions on the appropriate law, and further in failing to grant the plaintiff judgment notwithstanding the verdict on these grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">A. The court erred when it approved defendant\u2019s Instruction Q, as modified by the defendant, as it was an inaccurate and misleading statement of Virginia law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">As Destival correctly argues, the sole issue before us is whether Instruction Q was a correct statement of Virginia law. Any question about whether that instruction was applicable to the facts of this case is not encompassed within the assignment of error. Thus, we will confine this opinion to the narrow issue raised by Russ\u2019 assignment of error. <em>See Wolfe v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>260 Va. 7, 14-15, 532 S.E.2d 621, 624-25 (2000) (we do not consider arguments that are not the subject of an assignment of error).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Russ\u2019 contention that Instruction Q was an inaccurate statement of law focuses on the insertion of the word \u201cclose\u201d in subsection 2. He contends that the instruction as modified altered the provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-924 establishing a pedestrian\u2019s right-of-way and that the jury was thus presented with an inaccurate legal standard regarding his duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The relevant provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-904 state that \u201c[a] person riding a bicycle ... on a sidewalk, shared-use path, or across a roadway on a crosswalk, shall have all the rights and duties of a pedestrian under the same circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A pedestrian\u2019s right-of-way vis-\u00e1-vis a vehicle is set forth in Code \u00a7 46.2-924(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>A. The driver of any vehicle on a highway shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian crossing such highway:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">1. At any clearly marked crosswalk, whether at mid-block or at the end of any block; [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">2. At any regular pedestrian crossing included in the prolongation of the lateral boundary lines of the adjacent sidewalk at the end of a block;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">3. At any intersection when the driver is approaching on a highway or street where the legal maximum speed does not exceed thirty-five miles per hour.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">However, Code \u00a7 46.2-924(B) states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[njo pedestrian shall enter or cross an intersection in disregard of approaching traffic.\u201d This latter provision is determinant of the issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Subsection 2 of Instruction Q informed the jury that a bicyclist has a duty to refrain from entering or crossing an intersection in disregard of traffic that is either \u201cclose or approaching.\u201d The addition of the word \u201cclose\u201d altered the statutory duty of a bicyclist. The provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-924(B) require a bicyclist to refrain from entering or crossing an intersection in disregard of \u201capproaching traffic.\u201d The statute does not include traffic that is \u201cclose.\u201d To state in a jury instruction that a bicyclist must refrain from entering or crossing an intersection in disregard of traffic that is \u201cclose,\u201d i.e., stopped, runs afoul of the plain terms of Code \u00a7 46.2-924(B) and a pedestrian\u2019s right-of-way established in subsection A of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Contrary to Destival\u2019s argument, this Court\u2019s decisions in which we have used words such as \u201cnear,\u201d \u201cin close proximity,\u201d \u201cclose,\u201d or \u201cdangerously near\u201d in describing those vehicles that a pedestrian should see and heed do not support a different result. In <em>Hopson v. Goolsby, </em>196 Va. 832, 839, 86 S.E.2d 149, 153 (1955) (quoting <em>Hooker v. Hancock, </em>188 Va. 345, 356, 49 S.E.2d 711, 716 (1948)), we stated that \u201cif a person having a duty to look \u2018carelessly undertakes to cross without looking, or, if looking, fails to see or heed traffic that is obvious and in dangerous proximity and continues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>on into its path, he is guilty of negligence as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Accord Carson v. LeBlanc, </em>245 Va. 135, 140, 427 S.E.2d 189, 192 (1993); <em>Cofield </em>v. Nuckles, 239 Va. 186, 190, 387 S.E.2d 493, 495 (1990); <em>Straughan v. Nash, </em>215 Va. 627, 632, 212 S.E.2d 280, 283 (1975). Elaborating on a pedestrian\u2019s duty to keep a lookout for vehicles, we explained that \u201c[t]he duty of looking is based on the wisdom of seeing whether traffic is approaching, where and at what speed\u201d and \u201c[i]f looking discloses approaching traffic, then the right to proceed is to be tested by whether a person of ordinary prudence would attempt it.\u201d <em>Hopson, </em>196 Va. at 839, 86 S.E.2d at 153 (citing <em>Rhoades v. Meadows, </em>189 Va. 558, 562, 54 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1949)). These cases and the others cited by Destival emphasizing a pedestrian\u2019s duty to see and heed \u201capproaching\u201d traffic are consistent with the directive in Code \u00a7 46.2-924(B) requiring a pedestrian not to enter or cross an intersection in disregard of \u201capproaching traffic.\u201d They do not alter a pedestrian\u2019s duty in that instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Thus, we hold that Instruction Q was not an accurate statement of Virginia law and that the circuit court erred in giving the instruction to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-12\"> Russ was towing a trailer in which his three-year-old son was riding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-12\"> In light of the statute, we will use the terms \u201cbicyclist\u201d and \u201cpedestrian\u201d interchangeably.
