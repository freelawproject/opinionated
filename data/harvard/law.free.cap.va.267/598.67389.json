In order to develop the two parcels as a single apartment development, Richmeade requested that the City vacate certain streets within the proposed development. By ordinance adopted February 22, 1999, the City vacated the streets pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2006 and 15.2-2007.1. In April 1999, the City reconsidered its February 22, 1999 action and denied the request for vacating the streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">On September 10, 2002, Richmeade filed an inverse condemnation action pursuant to the declaratory judgment statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-184 <em>et seq., </em>seeking a declaration that the City\u2019s actions constituted a \u201ctaking and/or damaging\u201d of its property and property rights and a trial by jury \u201con the issue of taking and damaging of property rights and of just compensation.\u201d The City filed a plea of the statute of limitations asserting that Richmeade\u2019s action was time-barred because it was not filed within the three-year limitations period established for implied contracts by Code \u00a7 8.01-246. Richmeade argued that its action was an action for \u201cdamage to property\u201d and therefore was subject to the five-year limitations period in Code \u00a7 8.01-243. Following briefing and argument of counsel, the trial court, relying on <em>Prendergast v. Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority, </em>227 Va. 190, 313 S.E.2d 399 (1984), concluded that an action for inverse condemnation was subject to the three-year statute of limitations and entered an order dismissing Richmeade\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia confers on a property owner a right to just compensation from the govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>ment when the government takes or damages the owner\u2019s property for public use. Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 11; <em>State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Linsly, </em>223 Va. 437, 443, 490, 290 S.E.2d 834, 838 (1982); C. <em>&amp; O. Ry. Co. v. Ricks, </em>146 Va. 10, 18, 135 S.E. 685, 688 (1926). As early as 1919, this Court held that a landowner could enforce this right under a tort or contract theory of recovery; however, because the sovereign was not liable for injuries based on negligence, a landowner could waive recovery under the tort theory and sue on the contract between the landowner and the government that Article I, Section 11 implies. <em>Nelson County </em>v. <em>Loving, </em>126 Va. 283, 299-300, 101 S.E. 406, 411 (1919). Since 1919, this Court has consistently held that when the government failed to condemn private land taken for public purposes, the landowner\u2019s recourse was to file an action for inverse condemnation based on the implied contract between the government and the landowner. The terms of that implied contract require the government to pay the landowner \u201csuch amount as would have been awarded therefor, if the property had been condemned under the eminent domain statutes.\u201d <em>Nelson County v. Coleman, </em>126 Va. 275, 279, 101 S.E. 413, 414 (1919); <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>218 Va. 625, 627, 238 S.E.2d 823, 825 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">In <em>Prendergast, </em>the case relied upon by the trial court, water from restoration work conducted by the Park Authority leaked into the lower level of a building on an adjacent lot. The owner of the building filed a five-count motion for judgment against the Authority. In Count 5 of the motion for judgment, the building owner initially alleged that the government took or damaged his property \u201cwithout due process of law and without payment of just compensation.\u201d <em>Prendergast, </em>227 Va. at 192, 313 S.E.2d at 400. In repleading that Count, the building owner realleged a taking of property without due process and just compensation and asked that the trial court direct the Authority to file condemnation proceedings for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of just compensation due for the damaged building. <em>Id. </em>at 192-93; 313 S.E.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The building owner argued that Count 5 was subject to the five-year limitations period of Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B) (injury to property), while the Authority asserted that the three-year limitations period for implied contracts under Code \u00a7 8.01-246(4) applied. In concluding that the three-year period applied, this Court held that Count 5 \u201csounded in inverse condemnation,\u201d that inverse condemnation is based on an implied contract, and that \u201c[ojnce the trial court correctly concluded that the essence of Count 5 was an action based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>an implied contract it follows that application of the period of limitations contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-246(4) was proper.\u201d <em>Prendergast, </em>227 Va. at 195, 313 S.E.2d at 402 (citing <em>Burns, </em>218 Va. at 627, 238 S.E.2d at 825).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The facts of this case are indistinguishable from those in <em>Prendergast. </em>Here there is no dispute that Richmeade\u2019s action is an \u201caction for inverse condemnation\u201d seeking an \u201caward of damages for the condemnation of Plaintiffs\u2019 property and/or property rights.\u201d As we explained in <em>Burns, </em>an inverse condemnation action is based on an implied contract that the government will justly compensate landowners for land it has taken. 218 Va. at 627, 238 S.E.2d at 825. Therefore, the cause of action is subject to the three-year limitations period of Code \u00a7 8.01-246(4). <em>Prendergast, </em>227 Va. at 195, 313 S.E.2d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Richmeade asserts, however, that the decision in <em>Prendergast </em>is incompatible with the principle that the object of the litigation and not its form determines the applicability of a statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Peoples Serv. Drug Stores, </em>208 Va. 700, 703, 160 S.E.2d 563, 565 (1968); <em>Birmingham v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>98 Va. 548, 551, 37 S.E. 17, 17 (1900). According to Richmeade, if this principle is applied to an inverse condemnation case, the correct statute of limitations is the five-year limitations period of Code \u00a78.01-243(B) because the object of every inverse condemnation action is to recover for injury to property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The object of an inverse condemnation action, according to Richmeade, is to recover compensation for damage to private property. But an inverse condemnation action is a specific type of proceeding based on a constitutionally created right connected to the \u201ctaking\u201d or \u201cdamaging\u201d of property by the government. To take or damage property in the constitutional sense does not require that the sovereign actually invade or disturb the property. Taking or damaging property in the constitutional sense means that the governmental action adversely affects the landowner\u2019s ability to exercise a right connected to the property. <em>Prince William County </em>v. <em>Omni Homes, </em>253 Va. 59, 72, 481 S.E.2d 460, 467 (1997); <em>City of Lynchburg </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>156 Va. 40, 48-49, 157 S.E. 769, 772 (1931); <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>of Norfolk, </em>108 Va. 259, 265, 61 S.E. 776, 778 (1908). Thus, an action for inverse condemnation is an action seeking redress for the government\u2019s action in limiting property rights the landowner holds. In that regard, the act giving rise to the breach of implied contract is not an act aimed at the property, but rather an act that limits the landowner\u2019s ability to exercise his property rights without paying the landowner for that limitation. The mere fact that the measurement of that compensation may be based on a decline in the value of the subject property does not make the action one for injury to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">This conclusion is consistent with the result we reached in <em>Pigott v. Moran, </em>231 Va. 76, 341 S.E.2d 179 (1986), where the issue was whether an action for constructive fraud was an action for \u201cinjury to property\u201d subject to the five-year limitations period of Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B) or a \u201cpersonal action\u201d subject to the shorter limitations period then provided for by Code \u00a7 8.01-248. In that case, purchasers of a house sued their real estate agent for fraud, maintaining that the agent misrepresented to them that the property abutting the property they eventually purchased was zoned for residential purposes when in fact the property was zoned for commercial and industrial purposes. The purchasers identified their damage claim as a financial loss based on the difference between the value of the land if it abutted residential property and the actual value of the land abutting commercial and industrial property. <em>Id. </em>at 78-79, 341 S.E.2d at 180-81. The purchasers argued that even though they had filed an action for constructive fraud, the five-year limitations period of Code \u00a7 8.01-243(B) applied because the action was an \u201caction for injury to property.\u201d We rejected the purchaser\u2019s position, finding that the \u201cgist\u201d of the purchasers\u2019 claim was that the wrongful act was aimed at the purchasers \u201cpersonally and not their property\u201d even though the damages claimed involved a decrease - or injury - to the property\u2019s value. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 341 S.E.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The gist of Richmeade\u2019s claim in this case is that the wrongful act of the government was aimed at Richmeade and not at the property. The government\u2019s wrongful act in this case was the failure of the City of Richmond to pay Richmeade for the limitations the City placed on Richmeade\u2019s ability to exercise its rights over its property. Thus, as in <em>Pigott, </em>the object of this action is not injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>property. It is the injury suffered by Richmeade because the City breached its implied contract to pay just compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in applying the three-year limitations period of Code \u00a7 8.01-246(4) to this inverse compensation action and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">JUSTICE KOONTZ and JUSTICE LEMONS dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-10\"> The trial court decided the case without an evidentiary hearing on the City of Richmond\u2019s special plea to the statute of limitations. For purposes of this appeal, we recite the facts as alleged in the motion for declaratory judgment. While the City filed a demurrer asserting that the property was never taken or damaged, the facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> Richmeade also cites <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation District v. McDonnell, </em>234 Va. 235, 360 S.E.2d 841 (1987), in support of its position because the five-year limitations period was applied to an inverse condemnation count in that case. Both Richmeade and the City acknowledge, however, that unlike Prendergast, the proper limitations period was not at issue in <em>McDonnell, </em>and for that reason <em>McDonnell </em>does not control or affect the result in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> We also note that this result is consistent with the Revisers\u2019 Note to the 1977 revision of Title 8.01 explaining that the five-year limitations period for injury to property does not apply to actions resulting from a breach of contract. <em>See Revisers\u2019 </em>Note, Code \u00a7 8.01-243.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
