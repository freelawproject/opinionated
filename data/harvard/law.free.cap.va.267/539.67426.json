Washington, the claimant, worked in the Fredericksburg area as a \u201cpreloader\u201d for United Parcel Service of America, the employer, which was insured by Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">The claimant sustained injury to his right knee by accident during his employment on three separate occasions: June 18, 1997, August 4, 1998, and September 15, 1999. Although various aspects of the claims for benefits arising from these accidents were considered together by the Commission, this appeal directly involves only the September 1999 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">In the employer\u2019s First Report of Accident filed for the 1999 incident, the claimant\u2019s injury was described: \u201cWALKING DOWN STEEP DRIVEWAY IN RAIN &amp; SLIPPED. FELT RIGHT KNEE POP.\u201d In an Award Order dated May 16, 2000, the Commission approved an Agreement to Pay Benefits, and directed the payment of temporary total compensation of \u201c$469.91 weekly, during incapacity,\u201d beginning September 16, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">On May 10, 2001, the claimant, by counsel, notified the Commission that \u201cMr. Washington has not been paid compensation pursuant to the Award Order.\u201d Counsel, referring to the provisions of Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-524, asked that the carrier be ordered to pay the claimant \u201call compensation due and payable to him, along with a 20% penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">In a letter to the Commission on the next day, May 11, 2001, claimant\u2019s counsel wrote: \u201cPlease accept this letter as the Claimant\u2019s request for additional benefits based on a change in condition . . . The Claimant\u2019s doctor removed him from the work force on March 28, 2001.\u201d Also, counsel noted that the claimant was \u201cunder an open award\u201d and that \u201c[h]e is not receiving benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On June 4, 2001, the carrier filed with the Commission forms stating: \u201cThis claim is denied\u201d for the reasons that: \u201cAny disability is unrelated to compensable accident or disease\u201d and \u201c[t]he medical treatment is unrelated to the industrial injury or disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On June 7, 2001, the Commission, noting that it had been advised that payments pursuant to the \u201cMay 16, 200[0] Award\u201d had not been timely made (the Commission erroneously referred to 2001), entered an order assessing a 20% penalty on all compensation greater than two weeks in arrears to be paid \u201cimmediately\u201d along with the compensation owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On June 27, 2001, the Commission granted the claimant\u2019s request to consolidate for hearing the claims arising from the three accidents and set the hearing for September 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">On July 9, 2001, the Commission entered an order requiring the carrier to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the June 7, 2001 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In a July 18, 2001 letter, the carrier, by counsel, acknowledged receipt of the June 7 penalty order and the July 9 show cause order. It stated that its \u201crecords reflect that the claimant was paid temporary total disability compensation beginning September 17, 1999 through May 17, 2000 at a rate of $469.[9]1. At that time he obtained a full duty release and returned to his pre-injury employment. It appears that the carrier sent out agreement forms to the claimant which were never returned.\u201d Counsel asked \u201cthat any decision on whether a penalty is due be deferred until the carrier can obtain the necessary information from the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Responding in a July 23, 2001 letter to the parties, the Commission denied the carrier\u2019s request for a continuance of the September hearing date. The Commission also advised the claimant\u2019s attorney that the carrier \u201cwill soon file an application alleging that the claimant returned to work at his pre-injury wage\u201d and that if such application is filed timely, the Commission \u201cwould certainly consider hearing that issue simultaneously with the other pending claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In a Notice of Hearing to the parties for the September 4, 2001 hearing in the present claim (arising from the September 1999 accident), the Commission stated the \u201cSubject\u201d of the hearing to be the claimant\u2019s request for benefits filed in April 2001, \u201cto be heard with\u201d the claims arising from the accidents of June 1997 and August 1998,</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The Commission\u2019s reference to the April request was to a change in condition application dated April 6, 2001 seeking benefits, including temporary total disability, beginning March 28, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Following the typically informal hearing before a deputy commissioner, at which brief, disjointed testimony and comments from counsel were received, the deputy rendered a written opinion on September 27, 2001, which decided matters arising from all three accidents. In a separate section of the opinion, the deputy commissioner set forth the issue in the claim arising from the instant September 1999 accident as follows: \u201cWhether the May 16, 2000, award should be terminated because the claimant was released to return to full duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The deputy found a physician \u201creleased the claimant to full duty as of June 8, 2000,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[a]ny disability suffered by the claimant after that date is causally unrelated to the September 15, 1999, injury.\u201d The deputy terminated the May 16, 2000 Award Order, and denied the claimant\u2019s April 2001 change in condition application. In the award, the deputy also quashed the show cause order and stated \u201c[tjhere is no penalty owing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">In another section of the opinion, which dealt with the August 1998 injury, not the September 1999 injury, the deputy commissioner stated the second issue relating to that claim to be: \u201cWhether the carrier is hable for a 20% penalty for indemnity benefits pursuant to Va. Code 65.2-524 under the May 16, 2000, award of the Commission.\u201d Noting that on the date of the hearing the May 2000 award \u201cremained open,\u201d the deputy found that the claimant was released \u201cto full duty as of June 8, 2000. . . . Therefore, any disability which the claimant suffered after that date is causally unrelated to the August 4, 1998, injury.\u201d Continuing, the deputy ruled: \u201cWhile the defendants were woefully remiss in not terminating the May 16, 2000, award, the claimant was paid indemnity benefits until he returned to work. The claimant was not owed further benefits, therefore, no penalty is awarded because there were no benefits in arrears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Upon the claimant\u2019s application for review, the full Commission affirmed the deputy\u2019s opinion. On review, the Commission rejected the claimant\u2019s contention that the only issue properly before the deputy at the September 2001 hearing relating to the 1999 injury was whether a statutory penalty should be assessed against the carrier. Thus, the Commission, noting the deputy correctly ruled on the causal connection issue, determined \u201cthe Deputy Commissioner did not err in terminating the claimant\u2019s outstanding Award in [the file relating to the September 1999 accident]. Since the claimant is not entitled to compensation benefits after June 8, 2000, no penalty is owed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Upon further review, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>United Parcel Serv. of Am., </em>39 Va. App. 772, 576 S.E.2d 791 (2003). We awarded the claimant this appeal because the case involves a matter of significant precedential value. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-410(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the Court of Appeals, one of the questions the claimant presented was: \u201cThat the Commission erred as a matter of law in considering issues not properly before it and in granting relief not requested by the Defense.\u201d However, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cOn appeal, Washington contends only that the commission erred in refusing to grant him benefits under the open May 16, 2000 award and that the commission erred in refusing to assess the 20% penalty against [the carrier] for failing to pay him benefits consistent with the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 778, 576 S.E.2d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Because the Court of Appeals did not directly discuss the claimant\u2019s contention regarding just what issues properly were before the deputy commissioner, a contention raised throughout the proceedings below and in this Court, we shall address that question initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We hold that the issue of causation was not properly before the deputy, and should not have been decided given the procedural posture of the matter. Although there is some vague reference in the hearing transcript to an off-the-record discussion of \u201cthe posture of this case and what issues are properly before the Commission,\u201d we have found no concession in the record by the claimant that the causation issue was viable for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Indeed, the Notice of Hearing made no mention of the issue, or that the Commission was considering terminating the outstanding award based upon the claimant\u2019s change in condition application, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) (Commission, upon ground of change in condition, may end compensation previously awarded). In addition, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the Commission\u2019s warning to the claimant\u2019s attorney in the July 23, 2001 letter, the carrier did not file an employer\u2019s application alleging the claimant returned to work at his pre-injury wage, which would have enabled the deputy, with notice to the claimant, properly to consider the causation issue at the hearing. The carrier only relied upon a doctor\u2019s release to defend against Washington\u2019s claim, and the Commission relied on that release to deny the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">This procedural snafu prevented the claimant from preparing an adequate response on the causation question and from being prepared to resist termination of the award based on his change in condition application. He was not afforded the minimal due process to which he was entitled. This was materially unfair to him and constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Now, we shall address the only substantive issue properly before the Court, that is, the penalty question. Code \u00a7 65.2-524, dealing with payment of workers\u2019 compensation, provides, as pertinent, that \u201c[i]f any payment is not paid within two weeks after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to twenty percent thereof. ...\u201d Commission Rule 1.4(C)(1) requires compensation to be paid through the date an employer\u2019s application for a hearing is filed unless \u201c[t]he application alleges the employee returned to work, in which case payment shall be made to the date of the return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">As we have said, the carrier failed to file a change in condition application with the Commission alleging the claimant had returned to work and requesting termination of the May 16, 2000 open award. Rather, the carrier unilaterally terminated payment of benefits after it learned that the claimant had returned to work without restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In deciding the penalty issue, the Court of Appeals correctly stated that the relevant statutes do not give an employer or carrier the unilateral right to cease paying compensation benefits to a disabled employee under an outstanding award, when that employee returns to work and the employer or carrier does not file an application or agreed statement of facts along with a supplemental memorandum of agreement. <em>Washington, 39 </em>Va. App. at 779, 576 S.E.2d at 794. Indeed, the Court of Appeals noted the \u201claudable purpose\u201d of the foregoing Commission rule as a method of policing the tendency of employers and carriers to terminate first and litigate later. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals excused the carrier\u2019s unilateral action. Indicating that it did not \u201ccondone\u201d the carrier\u2019s fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ure to file an application to terminate the May 16, 2000 award, the Court of Appeals said that the Commission\u2019s equitable power, as exemplified in the doctrine of imposition, includes the power to render decisions based on justice as shown by the total circumstances of each case, even when no fraud, mistake or concealment has been shown. <em>Id. </em>at 780, 576 S.E.2d at 795. The doctrine of imposition grants the Commission \u201cjurisdiction to do full and complete justice in each case.\u201d <em>Harris v. Diamond Const. Co., </em>184 Va. 711, 720, 36 S.E.2d 573, 577 (1946). <em>Accord John Driggs Co. v. Somers, </em>228 Va. 729, 734, 324 S.E.2d 694, 697 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Noting the claimant returned to work in June 2000 without physical restrictions, the Court of Appeals stated he was not released from full-duty work again, by a physician, until March 28, 2001. On that date, a physician released him from work for a third arthroscopic surgery, \u201cwhich the commission found was causally unrelated to the injury upon which the May 16, 2000 award was based.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>39 Va. App. at 780, 576 S.E.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Also, the Court of Appeals said there was no evidence that the employer or carrier \u201cintentionally failed to file the appropriate paperwork requesting termination of the award, or that [the carrier] possessed any ill intent in failing to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780-81, 576 S.E.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Concluding, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cTherefore, as the commission found that Washington was no longer entitled to benefits under the award after June [8], 2000, we find no error in the commission\u2019s determination that no benefits or penalty should be awarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781, 576 S.E.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The Court of Appeals erred. As we already have said, the issue of causal connection should not properly have been before the Court of Appeals because that issue was not properly before the Commission. Without the finding of no causal connection between the September 1999 accident and the claimant\u2019s condition after March 28, 2001, there was no basis for the Commission or the Court of Appeals to find, as is implicit in the rulings below, that the claimant would be unjustly enriched because he may have received benefits to which he was not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Consequently, the May 16, 2000 award of benefits remains valid, and the refusal to assess a 20% penalty was error. The carrier violated the mandate of Code \u00a7 65.2-524 because benefits were not paid within two weeks after they became due. And, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>a finding of no causal connection, there is no basis to employ the doctrine of imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Therefore, the judgment from which this appeal was taken will be reversed and the case will be remanded to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals shall remand the case to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for further proceedings in connection with the claim arising from the September 1999 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Upon remand, the Commission shall enter an award of benefits to the claimant for the period from March 28, 2001 to September 27, 2001 (for the weeks when he was unable to work), as requested by the claimant in this Court, plus an additional 20% of the total amount due for that period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b565-8\">JUSTICE KEENAN, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE HASSELL joins,</author>\n<p id=\"Afn\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">I respectfully dissent. The sole assignment of error raised by the claimant in this appeal is: \u201cThe Court of Appeals erred in upholding the Commission\u2019s ruling that Mr. Washington\u2019s release to full-duty status in June 2000 served to terminate the May 2000 award.\u201d By restricting his appeal to this single assignment of error, the claimant has, of his own accord, limited the scope of the appeal before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The majority, however, reaches beyond this assigned error to review an additional question not before this Court, namely, whether the deputy commissioner properly considered the issue of causation. Despite the claimant\u2019s procedural abandonment of this issue, the majority\u2019s holding is predicated on a <em>sua sponte </em>resolution of that question. Thus, I must conclude that the majority has decided this appeal in contravention of Rule 5:17(c), which states in material part: \u201cOnly errors assigned in the petition for appeal will be noticed by this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Both the deputy commissioner and the Commission held that the claimant was not entitled to benefits for the period after March 28, 2001, because the claimant\u2019s surgery on that date was not related to the September 15, 1999 injury. Not only did the claimant fail to assign error on these grounds in this Court, the claimant also failed to challenge this holding of the Commission in the Court of Appeals. In his \u201cQuestions Presented\u201d before the Court of Appeals, the claimant asked, \u201cDid the Commission err as a matter of law in consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ing issues not properly before it and in granting relief not requested by UPS?\u201d However, in neither his opening brief nor in his reply brief before the Court of Appeals did the claimant argue that the deputy commissioner and the Commission improperly considered the issue of causation. Instead, the claimant merely asserted that the Commission lacked authority to terminate the claimant\u2019s benefits in the absence of an application from UPS. Thus, as asserted by UPS before this Court, the Commission\u2019s determination that the claimant\u2019s March 2001 surgery was not causally related to his compensable injury became the law of this case and is binding on appeal before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Given this binding determination, an analysis of the issue presented in this appeal must begin with the conceded fact that the complainant was seeking benefits for injuries that were unrelated to the open award of May 2000. Once that concession is placed into the framework of this appeal, the entire appeal collapses.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Examined in this context, the claimant\u2019s argument effectively is reduced to an assertion that a penalty should have been imposed on the employer for its failure to make payments that the claimant was not entitled to receive in the first place. Such a contention plainly amounts to no more than a request for unjust enrichment, which the Court of Appeals properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">I agree that the employer was required to file an application under Commission Rule 1.4(C) to terminate the open award upon the claimant\u2019s return to work in June 2000. Nevertheless, I would hold that the employer\u2019s failure to file that application does not entitle the complainant to receive payment of a penalty, when he was not entitled to the compensation payments on which such penalty would be based. Accordingly, I would further hold that, under the doctrine of imposition, which gives the Commission \u201cjurisdiction to do full and complete justice in each case,\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Diamond Construction Company, </em>184 Va. 711, 720, 36 S.E.2d 573, 577 (1946), the Commission did not err in declining to impose a penalty on the employer. On this basis, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
