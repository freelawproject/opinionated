For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">John Hams Hannah, Jr. (\u201cHannah\u201d), a minor who sues by his mother and next friend, Barbara Foster, now Barbara Ruffner (\u201cRuffner\u201d), and Ruffner, individually (collectively, \u201cthe Plaintiffs\u201d), instituted an action against the Frederick County School Board (\u201cthe School Board\u201d), seeking damages for personal injuries and other loss sustained by Hannah and Ruffner as a result of a school bus accident. The School Board admitted its negligence caused the accident, but contended damages were limited to $50,000 by Code \u00a7 22.1-194. Alternatively, the School Board asserted the Plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity if the $50,000 limit did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The School Board is a member of the Virginia School Board Association (\u201cVSBA\u201d) which operates a self-insurance pool (the \u201cPool\u201d), as authorized by Code \u00a7 15.2-2703. The School Board is a member of the Pool, which provides various lines of self-insurance to the School Board, including liability coverage of up to $1,000,000 for motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The School Board filed a motion to reduce the Plaintiffs\u2019 <em>ad damnum </em>clause to $50,000, arguing Code \u00a7 22.1-194 limited its liability in this case to $50,000 because the School Board met the self-insurance qualification of Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D). Even though the School Board admitted it had never obtained the certificate of self-insurance from the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles required by Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D), it contended members of the Pool were exempt from that requirement by Code \u00a7 15.2-2704.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The trial court disagreed and found the specific statutory provision of Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D) controlling. The trial court ruled that a certificate of self-insurance from the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles is required when the liability limit of Code \u00a722.1-194 is to be claimed by reference to Code \u00a7 22.1-190. The trial court therefore denied the motion to reduce the <em>ad damnum </em>and awarded Hannah damages of $74,500 and Ruffner damages of $4,510. We awarded the School Board this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The resolution of the issues on appeal depends on the statutory interpretation of three different Code sections which state in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>A. Every vehicle shall be covered in a policy of liability and property damage insurance issued by an insurance carrier authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, in the amounts of at least $50,000 for injury, including death, to 1 person, $200,000 for injury, including death, to all persons injured in any 1 accident, and $10,000 for damage, including destruction, to the property of any person, other than the insured ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">D. <em>This insurance shall not be required in cases where </em>pupils are transported in vehicles which are owned or operated by a . . . <em>school board which has qualified for and received a certificate of self-insurance </em>from the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles, following a certification of financial responsibility equal to that required under subsection A of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Code \u00a7 22.1-190(A) and (D) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">In case the locality or <em>the school board is the owner, </em>or operator through medium of a driver, <em>of, or otherwise is the insured under the policy upon, </em>a vehicle involved in an accident, the locality or school board shall be subject to action up to, but not beyond, the limits of valid and collectible insurance in force to cover the injury complained of <em>or, in cases set forth in subsection D of \u00a7 22.1-190, up to but not beyond the amounts of insurance required under subsection A of \u00a7 22.1-190 and the defense of governmental immunity shall not be a bar to action or recovery.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Code \u00a7 22.1-194 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">A group self-insurance pool shall be deemed a self-insurer for motor vehicle security under \u00a7 46.2-368. <em>Members of the pool participating in the motor vehicle self-insurance provided by the pool shall be deemed to meet the requirements of security as required and an application for a certificate of self-insurance under \u00a7 46.2-368 shall not be required.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-194, a school board is subject to a limited waiver of sovereign immunity when its vehicle is \u201cinvolved in an accident.\u201d Immunity is waived either to \u201cthe limits of valid and collectible insurance in force to cover the injury\u201d or the coverage set by Code \u00a7 22.1-190(A) when the certificate of self-insurance under Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D) has been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The School Board argues that it is entitled to the liability limit derived from Code \u00a7 22.1490(A), $50,000 in this case, although it has not obtained the certificate of self-insurance required by Code \u00a7 22.1490(D). The School Board avers that, as a member of the Pool, Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 exempts it from the self-insurance certificate requirement of Code \u00a7 22.1490(D), and thus, that it qualifies for the Code \u00a7 22.1490(A) limitation level.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The question to be answered is whether the School Board, without meeting the requirements of Code \u00a7 22.1490(D), may nonetheless qualify for the limited liability by virtue of Code \u00a7 15.2-2704. Application of accepted rules of statutory construction answer that inquiry in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u201c[W]hen one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two should be harmonized, if possible, and where they conflict, the latter prevails.\u201d <em>Virginia Nat\u2019l Bank v. </em>Harris, 220 Va. 336, 340, 257 S.E.2d 867, 870 (1979); <em>accord County of Fairfax </em>v. <em>Century Concrete Servs., </em>254 Va. 423, 427, 492 S.E.2d 648, 650 (1997); <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Potomac Mack Sales &amp; Service, </em>241 Va. 89, 94-95, 400 S.E.2d 178, 181 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Code \u00a7 15.2-2703 authorizes a variety of designated political subdivisions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to join self-insurance pools while Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 establishes the powers of those pools. Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 exempts all covered political subdivisions in such self-insurance pools from obtaining a certificate of self-insurance <em>under Code \u00a7 46.2-368.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Neither the self-insurance pool statutes nor Code \u00a7 46.2-368 reference the self-insurance certificate requirement set out in Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">By contrast, Code \u00a7 22.1-190 sets forth insurance requirements, specific only to school boards, that must be met with respect to vehicles used in the transportation of students. One of these requirements is that a school board obtain a certificate of self-insurance from the Department of Motor Vehicles, set out in Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D), in order to benefit from the lower statutory liability limits available in Code \u00a7 22.1-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Other noteworthy evidence exists demonstrating the General Assembly\u2019s intent to differentiate between the use of insurance pools by political subdivisions generally and by school boards specifically. For example, Code \u00a7 15.2-2704, the more general statute, exempts the Pool from providing uninsured motorist coverage otherwise mandated by Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. In comparison, Code \u00a7 22.1-190(A), the specific statute, sets a minimum required liability coverage of $50,000 for school boards and mandates that \u201cthe policy of insurance shall provide coverage for loss or damage caused by an uninsured motorist . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The School Board argues that Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 and Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D) \u201ccan be reasonably construed to give full force and effect to each.\u201d The School Board does so by reading the exemption for a certificate of self-insurance in Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 as an implied exemption to the Code \u00a722.1-190(D) certificate requirement. It is incongruous for the School Board to rely on Code \u00a7 15.2-2704, the statute of general application, to waive the certification requirement but then claim that Code \u00a7 22.1-190, the statute of specific application, establishes the <em>ad damnum </em>limitation of $50,000. As noted above, the School Board\u2019s reasoning creates a conundrum in the case of uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The School Board\u2019s proposed reading ignores the General Assembly\u2019s expressed intent to regulate the insurance requirements for motor vehicles used to transport students by a specific statutory framework as opposed to the general requirements of the Pool for all other permitted political subdivisions. The more specific statutory provisions must prevail. The General Assembly has specifically required school boards to meet different requirements regarding motor vehicle insurance than other political subdivisions. Among those requirements is obtaining a certificate of self-insurance where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the liability limit of Code \u00a7 22.1-194 is to be claimed by reference to Code \u00a7 22.1-190.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Construing the statutes in this manner \u201charmonizefs] Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D) and Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 so as to give full force and effect to both\u201d without undermining the important governmental purpose and benefit that self-insurance pools provide. Such a construction has no effect on any political subdivision, other than school boards, which is the evident intent of the General Assembly through its more specific statutes in Title 22.1. School boards who wish to join self-insurance pools and take advantage of the liability limit under Code \u00a7 22.1-194, as in this case, need only apply for a certificate of self-insurance from the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles as mandated by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The School Board alternatively argues that if it is not entitled to the $50,000 statutory liability cap, the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Initially, the School Board argues the reference to \u201cthe policy\u201d in the first sentence of Code \u00a7 22.1-194 means only a policy as set out in Code \u00a7 22.1-190(A) which must be \u201cissued by an insurance carrier authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth.\u201d In reliance upon Code \u00a7 15.2-2709, which provides group self-insurance pools are not an insurance company or an insurer, the School Board then reasons the Code \u00a7 22.1-194 provision for \u201cvalid and collectible insurance in force\u201d must come only from \u201cthe policy\u201d. In other words, since the Pool\u2019s self-insurance is not insurance in the form of \u201cthe policy\u201d, then Pool funds cannot be \u201cvalid and collectible insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The School Board, however, reads only part of the first sentence in Code \u00a7 22.1-194. The plain reading of the statute reflects that a school board is \u201csubject to action up to . . . the limits of valid and collectible insurance in force\u201d in two circumstances. The first instance is where \u201cthe school board is the owner ... of ... a vehicle involved in an accident . . . .\u201d The second instance is where the school board \u201cotherwise is the insured under <em>the policy </em>upon[] a vehicle involved in an accident . . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">By writing the statute in the disjunctive, the General Assembly has clearly provided that the School Board, solely by virtue of its ownership of \u201ca vehicle involved in an accident\u201d is liable up to \u201cthe limits of valid and collectible insurance.\u201d While a school board may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>also be liable when it \u201cotherwise is the insured under the policy,\u201d that circumstance is not a condition precedent for the School Board\u2019s liability when it owns \u201ca vehicle involved in an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">It is uncontested that the School Board owned the vehicles involved in the accident in this case. By the plain language of the statute, that is sufficient to subject the School Board to liability up to \u201cthe limits of valid and collectible insurance.\u201d While not the proceeds of an insurance \u201cpolicy,\u201d in the strictest sense of that term, the insurance protection provided by the Pool is nonetheless \u201cvalid and collectible insurance in force to cover the injury complained of.\u201d <em>See generally USAA Casualty Insurance v. The Hertz Corp. </em>265 Va. 450, 578 S.E.2d 775 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Finally, the School Board argues that since it did not satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D), it cannot be required to pay the judgment because Code \u00a7 22.1-194 prohibits using school funds to satisfy motor vehicle claims \u201cexcept where approved self-insurance has been provided pursuant to \u00a7 22.1-190 D.\u201d Requiring the School Board, via Pool payment, to pay the appellees\u2019 judgment does not violate Code \u00a7 22.1-194\u2019s prohibition against using school funds to satisfy motor vehicle claims. Payments from the assets of the Pool are no longer \u201cschool funds,\u201d but are Pool funds. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to holding that a school board\u2019s insurance premiums paid to an insurance company constitute \u201cschool funds,\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 22.1-194, when the insurance company pays a motor vehicle claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the School Board is not entitled to the $50,000 liability limit of Code \u00a7 22.1-190(A) as derived through Code \u00a7 22.1-194 because it failed to obtain a certificate of self-insurance from the Department of Motor Vehicles as required by Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D). Code \u00a7 22.1-194 abrogated the School Board\u2019s sovereign immunity up to the limits of its coverage through the Pool, which is sufficient to satisfy the Plaintiff\u2019s award in this case. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\"><em> </em>Political subdivision, for purposes of Code \u00a7 15.2-2703, \u201cmeans any county, city, or town, school board, Transportation District Commission, or any other local governmental authority or local agency or public service corporation owned, operated or controlled by a locality or local government authority, with power to enter into contractual undertakings.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.2-2701.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-10\"> A certificate of self-insurance under Code \u00a7 46.2-368 refers to Chapter 3 of Title 46.2, but does not address the particular requirements of insurance coverage for specific categories or functions of political subdivisions. By contrast, Code \u00a7 22.1-190 and Code \u00a7 22.1-194 are located in Chapter 12, Article 2 of Title 22.1, which deals specifically with insurance provisions for pupil transportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>SENIOR JUSTICE STEPHENSON, with whom JUSTICE LACY and JUSTICE KEENAN join,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">I respectfully dissent. It is well established that, when two statutes are in apparent conflict, a court, if reasonably possible, must give them such a construction as will give force and effect to both. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zamani, 256 </em>Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998); <em>Board of Supervisors v. Marshall, </em>215 Va. 756, 761, 214 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In the present case, it is reasonably possible to construe and harmonize Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D) and Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 so as to give full force and effect to both. Code \u00a7 22.1-190(D) reasonably can be read to govern school boards that are individually self-insured for school bus accidents, requiring such school boards to apply for and receive a certificate of self-insurance. However, when a school board is not individually self-insured but is a member of a self-insurance pool, Code \u00a7 15.2-2704 provides that it \u201cshall be deemed to meet the requirements of security as required and <em>an application for a certificate of self-insurance . . . shall not be required.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, the School Board qualified for the limit on liability despite its lack of a certificate of self-insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In reaching this conclusion, I have given weight to the intent of the General Assembly in approving self-insurance pools for political subdivisions such as school boards. That intent is expressed in Code \u00a7 15.2-2700 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">The General Assembly hereby finds and determines that insurance protection is essential to the proper functioning of political subdivisions; that the resources of political subdivisions are burdened by the high cost of and frequent inability to secure such protection through standard carriers; that proper risk management requires the spreading of risk so as to minimize fluctuation in insurance needs; and that, therefore, all contributions of financial and administrative resources made by a political subdivision pursuant to an intergovernmental contract as authorized by this chapter are made for a public and governmental purpose, and that such contributions benefit each contributing political subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The trial court\u2019s ruling and the holding of the majority in the present case undermine the important governmental purpose and benefit that self-insurance pools provide. School boards, without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>$50,000 limit on liability, would be reluctant to become members of and reap the benefit from a self-insurance pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">I would hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in denying the School Board\u2019s motion to reduce the Plaintiffs\u2019 <em>ad damnum </em>to $50,000 and in awarding damages in excess of the $50,000 limit. Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for a redetermination of damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
