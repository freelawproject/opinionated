The dispositive issue is whether the circuit court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s plea of sovereign immunity. We consider whether, at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s fall, the municipality was exercising a \u201cgovernmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>function\u201d during snow removal operations after a snowstorm and, therefore, was immune from liability for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. Daniell E. Gambrell was an employee of Bank of America (the Bank) at one of its offices in the City of Norfolk (the City). The Bank leased for its employees\u2019 use about 900 out of 1100 available parking spaces in a parking lot owned and operated by the City (the parking lot). The Bank paid the City $375,000 per year for the lease. The Bank\u2019s employees parked their vehicles in the parking lot and traveled to and from their place of employment in a \u201cshuttle\u201d bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On January 25, 2000, a snowstorm in the City resulted in an accumulation of 4.7 inches of snow. On January 26 and 27, 2000, the City closed the parking lot and instructed the Bank\u2019s employees to park their vehicles at a parking garage in a nearby shopping mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The following day, January 28, 2000, the City reopened the parking lot after informing the Bank that its employees could resume parking their vehicles there. On that date, as Gambrell was walking from her parked vehicle in the parking lot to the \u201cshuttle bus pick-up area,\u201d she allegedly \u201cslipped and fell\u201d on \u201csnow and ice\u201d and sustained \u201cserious and permanent injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Gambrell filed a motion for judgment against the City alleging that she was injured as a result of the City\u2019s negligent failure to remove snow and ice from the parking lot and its failure to place warning signs \u201caround said area.\u201d The City responded by filing, among other things, a \u201cSpecial Plea of Governmental Immunity.\u201d The City contended that it was Immune from liability for Gambrell\u2019s alleged injuries because they occurred during the City\u2019s exercise of its governmental function of \u201cemergency snow and ice removal activities necessitated by a severe snowstorm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The circuit court conducted a hearing and received evidence concerning the City\u2019s special plea. The City introduced into evidence meteorological records prepared by the National Climatic Data Center, which indicated that on January 25th, 2000, the high temperature in the City of Norfolk was 36 degrees Fahrenheit, the low temperature was 29 degrees Fahrenheit, and there was an accumulation of 4.7 inches of snow. From January 26 through January 27, 2000, the high temperatures ranged between 29 and 31 degrees Fahrenheit, and four inches of snow remained on the ground. On January 28, 2000, the high temperature was 33 degrees Fahrenheit, the low temperature was 19 degrees Fahrenheit, and there were three inches of snow on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>John D. Snowden, Jr., the operations manager for the Division of Streets and Bridges of the City\u2019s Department of Public Works, testified regarding the City\u2019s snow removal plan. He explained that the snow removal plan, found in the City\u2019s Emergency Operations Manual, is activated when there are snow accumulations between one and two inches or whenever there is a possibility that the surfaces of the City\u2019s roads and bridges may freeze. Snowden stated that the City activated the snow removal plan from January 25 through January 28, 2000, and that the City\u2019s work crews were assigned only to snow and ice removal tasks during that entire time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Snowden also testified that the work crews worked 24 hours per day in two 12-hour shifts through January 27, 2000. The length of the work crews\u2019 shifts was reduced on January 28, 2000, because the main arteries of the City\u2019s roadways were clear and the work crews had begun to remove snow from the secondary streets. Snowden stated that no personnel could be allocated to remove snow from the City\u2019s public parking lots on January 28, 2000, because the secondary streets still needed to be cleared and freezing temperatures had prevented the snow from melting on those streets. Snowden also stated that the City lacked sufficient snow removal equipment to clear all the City\u2019s streets within a few days after a \u201cmajor snowstorm,\u201d and that he considered a snowfall of 4.7 inches to be a \u201cmajor snowstorm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Linda C. Davis, administrator of the City\u2019s Division of Parking, also testified at the hearing on the special plea. She stated that the City and the Bank agreed to reopen the parking lot on January 28, 2000, with the \u201cstipulation that all employees were [to be] told [that] there [were] still icy spots on the lot and that they should exercise caution when parking there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Gambrell testified at the hearing that when she entered the parking lot in her vehicle on January 28, 2000, she observed that there was \u201cice and snow everywhere\u201d in the parking lot. Gambrell stated, \u201c[A]ll I saw was ice and snow. I didn\u2019t see any cleared areas whatsoever.\u201d Gambrell also stated that it was daylight outside and that she could see where she was walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The circuit court sustained the City\u2019s special plea. In explaining its ruling, the circuit court stated that the City\u2019s \u201ccontinued effort to dig out from the storm was a governmental function and subject to governmental immunity.\u201d Gambrell appeals from the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Gambrell argues that the circuit court erred in sustaining the special plea. She asserts that the City\u2019s lease of spaces in the parking lot for pecuniary benefit and the City\u2019s maintenance of the lot are proprietary functions that do not immunize the City from tort liability. Gambrell contends that the governmental function of snow and ice removal was not the proximate cause of her injuries because the City had failed to clear the parking lot of snow and ice at the time she was injured. Gambrell further contends that any emergency situation that may have existed was no longer present on January 28, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In response, the City argues that the circuit court correctly sustained the special plea because the emergency removal of snow from the City\u2019s streets and public parking lots is a governmental function. The City contends that emergency conditions still existed on January 28, 2000, because three inches of snow remained on the ground and temperatures remained at or below the point of freezing. The City also asserts that its lease of spaces in the parking lot for a fee did not affect the governmental character of its emergency snow removal activities. We agree with the City\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In considering the issue presented, we are guided by established principles. A plea of sovereign immunity presents distinct issues of fact that, if proved, create a bar to a party\u2019s alleged right of recovery. <em>Whitley v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 482, 493, 538 S.E.2d 296, 302 (2000); <em>Tomlin </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>251 Va. 478, 480, 468 S.E.2d 882, 884 (1996). The party advancing the sovereign immunity plea bears the burden of proving those issues of fact. <em>Whitley, </em>260 Va. at 493, 538 S.E.2d at 302; <em>Tomlin, </em>251 Va. at 480, 468 S.E.2d at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In Virginia, municipal corporations exercise two types of functions, governmental and proprietary. <em>Harrell v. City of Norfolk, </em>265 Va. 500, 502, 578 S.E.2d 756, 757 (2003); <em>Niese </em>v. <em>City of Alexandria, </em>264 Va. 230, 238, 564 S.E.2d 127, 132 (2002); <em>Fenon v. City of Norfolk, </em>203 Va. 551, 555, 125 S.E.2d 808, 811 (1962). A function is governmental in nature if it is directly related to the general health, safety, and welfare of the citizens. <em>Niese, </em>264 Va. at 239, 564 S.E.2d at 132; <em>Edwards v. City of Portsmouth, </em>237 Va. 167, 171, 375 S.E.2d 747, 750 (1989). In contrast, a function is proprietary in nature if it involves a privilege and power performed primarily for the benefit of the municipality. <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Carmichael Dev. Co., </em>259 Va. 493, 499, 527 S.E.2d 778, 782 (2000); <em>Hoggard </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>172 Va. 145, 147-48, 200 S.E. 610, 611 (1939). As a general rule, when an allegedly negligent act involves the routine maintenance or operation of a service being provided by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>municipality, the function is considered to be a proprietary one. <em>Carter v. Chesterfield County Health Comm\u2019n, </em>259 Va. 588, 592, 527 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2000); <em>Carmichael Dev. Co., </em>259 Va. at 499, 527 S.E.2d at 782; <em>Woods v. Town of Marion, </em>245 Va. 44, 45, 425 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">A municipality is immune from liability for negligence in the exercise of a governmental function, as well as for negligence in the failure to exercise a governmental function. <em>Harrell, 265 </em>Va. at 502, 578 S.E.2d at 757; <em>Carmichael Dev. Co., 259 </em>Va. at 499, 527 S.E.2d at 782; <em>Woods, </em>245 Va. at 45, 425 S.E.2d at 488. However, a municipality is liable, in the same manner as an individual or a private entity, for injuries resulting from negligence in the performance of proprietary functions. <em>Harrell, </em>265 Va. at 502, 578 S.E.2d at 757; <em>Woods, </em>245 Va. at 45, 425 S.E.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Gambrell alleged in her motion for judgment that the City \u201cnegligently allowed snow and ice to remain on the [parking] lot, and negligently failed to place any warning signs or markings around said area.\u201d At the hearing on the special plea, the City did not dispute Gambrell\u2019s contentions that at the time of the accident, the parking lot had not been plowed and warning signs had not been placed in the lot. Thus, our consideration of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on the special plea is limited to the question whether the removal of snow and ice from a municipal parking lot and the placement of warning signs at the location of such snow and ice are governmental or proprietary functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We previously have considered cases in which a municipality was engaged in emergency snow removal operations at the time a plaintiff sustained an alleged injury. In <em>Stanfield </em>v. <em>Peregoy, </em>245 Va. 339, 340, 429 S.E.2d 11, 11-12 (1993), the plaintiffs allegedly were injured when a bus in which they were riding collided with a city-owned truck that was engaged in spreading salt during a snowstorm. We held that the conduct of driving and spreading salt in a snowstorm was \u201can integral part of the governmental function of rendering the city streets safe for public travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 429 S.E.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Shortly before our decision in <em>Stanfield, </em>we reached the same conclusion in our holding in <em>Bialk </em>v. <em>City of Hampton, </em>242 Va. 56, 405 S.E.2d 619 (1991). There, a plaintiff allegedly was injured when he was struck by snow propelled from the blade of a snowplow that was being operated by an employee of a municipal corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 405 S.E.2d at 620. We concluded that because the municipality\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>snow removal operations were actions taken for the common good in coping with an emergency, those actions involved the exercise of a governmental function. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 405 S.E.2d at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The case before us also involves the actions of a municipality in the course of emergency snow removal operations. The evidence showed that the City activated its emergency snow removal plan after a major snowstorm occurred. Because freezing temperatures for three days after the snowstorm prevented the snow from melting, the City\u2019s work crews had to spend all their time clearing snow from the City\u2019s streets and were not able to remove snow from the City\u2019s public parking lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The City\u2019s decision to restrict its snow removal operations to its public streets, and its failure to place emergency warning signs in the parking lot, involved the City\u2019s exercise of a governmental, rather than a proprietary, function. We reach this conclusion because these actions and omissions occurred in the context of an extended period of snow emergency and dealt with the determination of priorities directly related to the general health, safety, and welfare of the citizens. <em>See Niese, </em>264 Va. at 239, 564 S.E.2d at 132; <em>Edwards, </em>237 Va. at 171, 375 S.E.2d at 750. Thus, those actions and omissions were functionally different and unrelated to the City\u2019s routine maintenance of municipal streets and parking lots, which involves the exercise of a proprietary function. <em>See Carter, </em>259 Va. at 592, 527 S.E.2d at 785; <em>Carmichael Dev. Co., </em>259 Va. at 499, 527 S.E.2d at 782; <em>Woods, </em>245 Va. at 45; 425 S.E.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Our conclusion that the City was exercising a governmental, rather than a proprietary, function at the time of Gambrell\u2019s fall is not changed by the fact that the City charged the Bank fees for use of parking spaces in the parking lot. The charging of fees did not alter the fundamental character of the municipal function at issue, because that function was not one of routine maintenance but one of implementation of an emergency snow removal plan for the general safety and welfare of the citizenry. Thus, the governmental nature of the City\u2019s actions following the snowstorm is controlling. <em>See Carter, </em>259 Va. at 593, 527 S.E.2d at 786; <em>Edwards, </em>237 Va. at 172, 375 S.E.2d at 750. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the circuit court\u2019s ruling sustaining the City\u2019s special plea of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>For these reasons, we will affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> Based on our determination that the City was immune from liability for the injuries alleged by Gambrell in her motion for judgment, we need not consider Gambrell\u2019s additional claim that the circuit court erred in sustaining the City\u2019s demurrer to the motion for judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
