Duncan was indicted for the criminal abuse and neglect of his son, Carlton W. Duncan, II (Carlton), in violation of what is now Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">Any parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the care of a child under the age of 18 whose willful act or omission in the care of such child was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Duncan was convicted of the offense after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of the City of Williamsburg and James City County. The circuit court sentenced Duncan to a term of five years\u2019 imprisonment, with four years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Duncan appealed from his conviction to the Court of Appeals. A panel of that Court reversed the circuit court\u2019s judgment and dismissed the indictment in an opinion that was withdrawn when the Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">On rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the Court reversed Duncan\u2019s conviction and dismissed the indictment in an unpublished memorandum opinion, <em>Duncan v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 1060-01-1 (April 8, 2003). The Court held that the \u201cevidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Duncan\u2019s willful acts and omissions in caring for his child were so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life.\u201d The Commonwealth appeals from the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We will state the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the circuit court, and will accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence. <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 384, 386, 585 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 570, 570 S.E.2d 836, 837 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>264 Va. 541, 543, 570 S.E.2d 805, 806 (2002). The evidence showed that Jennifer Dansby, Eliza L. Nemo, and Michelle Cribbs shared a residence in James City County. On June 11, 2000, the three housemates were introduced to Duncan and his six-month-old son, Carlton, through a mutual acquaintance.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The next day, about 3:30 p.m., Dansby returned home from work to find Cribbs and some other friends at the house. Although Carlton also was there, Duncan was not present. Dansby and the other adults took turns holding Carlton, but they did not feed him because there was no baby food or formula in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Nemo arrived at the house later that night and joined the other adults in caring for Carlton. An \u201cimpromptu party\u201d soon started as several more friends arrived and began drinking beer and using illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">About 10:30 p.m., Duncan arrived at the house with a small bag of marijuana. Duncan\u2019s eyes appeared to be \u201cglazed over,\u201d and the whites of his eyes were \u201cyellowed\u201d in appearance. After his arrival, Duncan did not feed Carlton or \u201ccare for the baby in any way,\u201d but began drinking beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Around midnight, Carlton became \u201cfussy\u201d and began to cry loudly. Duncan announced that he would \u201ctake care of the problem,\u201d and he took Carlton into a bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Nemo was concerned about Carlton\u2019s welfare because she perceived a negative tone in Duncan\u2019s voice when he said that he would \u201ctake care of the problem.\u201d After she entered the bedroom where Duncan and Carlton were located, Duncan went to the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Dansby, who was seated in the living room, saw Duncan enter the kitchen. Dansby heard the refrigerator door being opened and closed, which she thought was \u201codd\u201d because the refrigerator only contained beer and \u201cwine coolers.\u201d About five minutes later, Dansby saw Duncan leaving the kitchen carrying a baby bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Duncan returned to the bedroom and handed the baby bottle to Nemo. Duncan then left the room and joined some people on the porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Nemo began feeding the contents of the baby bottle to Carlton and returned with him to the living room. As Nemo, who was still holding Carlton, sat down on a couch, she noticed an unusual odor coming from the bottle. Both Nemo and Dansby, who were sitting together on the couch, thought that the odor \u201csmelled like alcohol.\u201d They also observed that the liquid in the bottle was a \u201cmilky pinkish color.\u201d A friend tasted the liquid inside the bottle and concluded that the liquid contained alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Dansby went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door. She saw that a bottle of \u201cwine cooler\u201d was missing from the refrigerator, and that an open bottle of \u201cwine cooler\u201d had been placed behind some \u201cbags of trash\u201d on the kitchen counter next to the refrigerator. The liquid inside the \u201cwine cooler\u201d bottle was pink in color and \u201cabout three inches\u201d of liquid had been removed from the bottle. Dansby became more concerned, telephoned the police, and placed the baby bottle in a safe location until the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Lieutenant Stout and Officer P.A. Nacastro of the James City County Police Department arrived at the house in response to Dansby\u2019s telephone call. Lieutenant Stout opened the baby bottle and observed that the liquid inside the bottle was a \u201cmilky color\u201d and \u201csmelled like an alcoholic beverage of some type.\u201d Officer Nacastro observed that the baby bottle contained a \u201cliquid substance\u201d that was of a \u201cwhitish, . . . pinkish color,\u201d and that the \u201cwine cooler\u201d bottle contained a liquid that was \u201cpinkish\u201d in color.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">According to Officer Nacastro, Duncan\u2019s eyes were \u201cvery bloodshot,\u201d his speech was \u201cslightly mumbled,\u201d and \u201c[tjhere was an odor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>of intoxicant about his person.\u201d The police officers placed Duncan under arrest and seized both the baby bottle and the bottle of \u201cwine cooler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">A certificate of analysis admitted into evidence indicated that the baby bottle contained a \u201c[cjloudy, pink-ish colored liquid\u201d that had an alcohol content of 2.8% ethyl alcohol by volume. The certificate also reflected test results from an examination of the contents of a 12-ounce bottle labeled \u201cSeagram\u2019s Wild Berries Flavored Cooler.\u201d These test results showed that the bottle of \u201cwine cooler\u201d contained a \u201c[cjlear, pink liquid\u201d that had an alcohol content of 3.2% ethyl alcohol by volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Duncan also testified at the trial. He maintained that Carlton was with him during the entire day of June 12th, 2000, and that earlier in the day, he had fed Carlton some cereal. Duncan testified that about 7:30 p.m., he took Carlton to a friend\u2019s house, which was located next to Dansby\u2019s residence. Duncan stated that Carlton ate part of a banana and drank some baby formula there. Duncan further testified that he and Carlton left the friend\u2019s house about 9:30 p.m., and went next door to Dansby\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Duncan admitted giving Nemo the baby bottle, but denied placing any \u201cwine cooler\u201d into the bottle, and said that he did not know that there was any substance other than milk in the bottle. Duncan conceded that he had drunk \u201cthree or four beers\u201d on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the circuit court found Duncan guilty of criminal abuse and neglect of his child, as charged in the indictment. In explaining its decision, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">I find that Mr. Duncan is not a believable witness. I reject his testimony as to the explanation. I find the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses ... to clearly show and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant took the baby back to the back bedroom . . . , he then is the one who goes to the kitchen area, he comes back with a bottle that has this clear pinkish substance in it, he gives the bottle to Ms. Nemo, then he walks out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">Feeding alcohol to a six-month[-old] baby is clear neglect. Coupled with all the other acts, omissions and commissions that he did, I find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the felony charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Duncan appealed to the Court of Appeals, which held that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The Court stated that although \u201cDuncan was negligent in caring for his child\u201d and that \u201c[h]is conduct was inexcusable and cannot be condoned,\u201d a finding of negligence was not sufficient to convict Duncan of the felony of child abuse and neglect for which he was indicted. The Court noted that although Duncan had just met the women at Dansby\u2019s residence the day before leaving his baby with them, there was no evidence to show that the women were irresponsible, incapable, or unwilling to care for Carlton. The Court further stated that there was no evidence that Carlton was hungry or otherwise in distress during the time that the women cared for him in Duncan\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The Court also observed that \u201cwhen the baby [later] became fussy and started to cry loudly,\u201d Duncan, in spite of his \u201capparent\u201d intoxicated state, \u201cresponded to him\u201d and \u201ctook steps to feed him, albeit with a bottle containing a liquid mixture, part of which was wine cooler.\u201d In further explaining its holding, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Plainly, at some quantitative level, based on the alcoholic content and volume of the liquid ingested, feeding a six-month-old child liquid that contains alcohol would . . . constitute a danger to the child\u2019s life. In this case, however, there was no evidence presented to show that feeding a six-month-old child up to eight ounces of a liquid that is 2.8% ethyl alcohol by volume endangers the child\u2019s life. Such a conclusion would, therefore, have to be based on pure conjecture and speculation, rather than on the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. Hence, we conclude the evidence did not support such a finding beyond a reasonable doubt by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">On appeal to this Court, the Commonwealth argues that the totality of Duncan\u2019s acts and omissions were so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for his son\u2019s life. The Commonwealth contends that while Duncan\u2019s most culpable act was placing an alcoholic beverage into Carlton\u2019s bottle, he also committed other \u201creckless\u201d acts, such as failing to feed his son for several hours, which demonstrated Duncan\u2019s \u201cdisregard for his infant son\u2019s life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY5\">In response, Duncan argues that the Commonwealth failed to establish that his acts or omissions were \u201cso gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life,\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1). He asserts that although his actions were \u201cirresponsible and less than what one expects of a parent,\u201d he did not endanger Carlton. Duncan also contends that the evidence was insufficient because there was no expert testimony concerning the amount of \u201cwine cooler\u201d necessary to endanger a child\u2019s life or health. Duncan asserts that without such evidence, any claim that Carlton\u2019s life was endangered rests on mere conjecture and suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We consider these arguments under an established standard of review. When a defendant contests the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, the reviewing court must give the judgment of the circuit court sitting without a jury the same weight as a jury verdict. <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 492, 545 S.E.2d 541, 547 (2001); <em>Tarpley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 251, 256, 542 S.E.2d 761, 763 (2001); <em>Hickson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 383, 387, 520 S.E.2d 643, 645 (1999). The appellate court has the duty to review the evidence that tends to support the conviction and to uphold the circuit court\u2019s judgment unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 178, 204, 590 S.E.2d 520, 535 (2004); <em>McCain, </em>261 Va. at 492-93, 545 S.E.2d at 547; <em>Tarpley, </em>261 Va. at 256, 542 S.E.2d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We have not previously had occasion to address the elements of the crime of child abuse and neglect set forth in the language of what is now Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1). Initially, we agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 observation that the statutory language does not apply to acts of simple negligence. We base our conclusion on the express language of the statute prohibiting \u201cwillful act[s] or omission[s] ... so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life.\u201d <em>Id., see also Cable </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 240, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 201, 206, 335 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1985); <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>170 Va. 597, 611-12, 195 S.E. 675, 681 (1938); <em>Ellis v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va. App. 548, 555, 513 S.E.2d 453, 457 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The statutory requirement that such conduct be \u201cwillful\u201d means that the conduct must be knowing or intentional, rather than accidental, and be done without justifiable excuse, without ground for believing the conduct is lawful, or with a bad purpose. <em>See Bryan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 191-92 (1998); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>290 U.S. 389, 394-95 (1933); <em>Ellis, </em>29 Va. App. at 554, 513 S.E.2d at 456. Thus, the term \u201cwillful,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>371.1(B)(1), contemplates an intentional, purposeful act or omission in the care of a child by one responsible for such child\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A), the plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1) does not require that a child actually suffer serious injury as a result of a defendant\u2019s acts or omissions. The absence of an injury requirement in subsection (B)(1) reflects the lesser nature of the offense, a Class 6 felony, and demonstrates a legislative intent to prohibit conduct that also has the potential of endangering a child\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Notably, subsection (B)(1) does not limit the prohibited conduct to acts and omissions that subject a child to an actual risk of death, but proscribes conduct that is so \u201cgross, wanton and culpable\u201d as to demonstrate a \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the child\u2019s life. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we hold that such \u201creckless disregard\u201d can be shown by conduct that subjects a child to a substantial risk of serious injury, as well as to a risk of death, because exposure to either type of risk can endanger the child\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Applying these principles, we disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to support Duncan\u2019s conviction. We examine the totality of the evidence, and do not limit our review of the record to Duncan\u2019s act of placing \u201cwine cooler\u201d in the baby bottle for Carlton\u2019s consumption. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, this evidence showed that Duncan left his infant son for several hours with people he barely knew, and that he did not give them any food or formula to ensure that the baby would be fed. As a result, Carlton did not receive any food or liquids for more than seven hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">After returning to the house, Duncan did not attend to Carlton but joined a group of people who were drinking alcohol and using illegal drugs. Duncan appeared impaired and his eyes were \u201cglazed over.\u201d When Carlton started crying, Duncan poured an alcoholic beverage into Carlton\u2019s bottle and handed the bottle to an acquaintance for her to feed to Carlton.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">In addition, the circuit court found that Duncan was not a \u201cbelievable witness,\u201d and directly rejected his explanation of the events in question. As finder of fact, the circuit court was entitled to infer that Duncan was lying to conceal his guilt. <em>See Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 196, 209, 547 S.E.2d 899, 907 (2001); <em>Dowden v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 459, 469, 536 S.E.2d 437, 442 (2000); <em>Phan v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 506, 511, 521 S.E.2d 282, 284 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The above record demonstrates a pattern of neglect over an extended period that ended in Duncan\u2019s knowing and reckless decision to feed an alcoholic beverage to his baby who had been deprived of food and hydration for several hours. Thus, we conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s determination that Duncan\u2019s acts and omissions were willful and, considered as a whole, were so gross, wanton, and culpable as to demonstrate a reckless disregard for Carlton\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Contrary to Duncan\u2019s contention, the Commonwealth was not required to produce expert testimony showing that consumption of alcohol by a six-month-old baby who had not had any food or liquids for at least seven hours presented a substantial risk of serious injury or risk of death to the baby. Based on the evidence presented, the dangers inherent in such a situation could be inferred by the fact finder as a matter of common knowledge. Therefore, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support Duncan\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">For these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate Duncan\u2019s conviction in accordance with the circuit court\u2019s judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-15\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1 was amended in 2003. Paragraph B of the former statute, under which Duncan was indicted, is now set forth in identical language as paragraph (B)(1) in the amended statute. We will use the current numbering in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
