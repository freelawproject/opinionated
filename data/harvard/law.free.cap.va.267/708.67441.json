Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Thomas N. Jones (\u201cThomas Jones\u201d) died in 1993. He was survived by his wife, Annie K. Jones (\u201cAnnie Jones\u201d) and five children, among them, Robert Vaiden Jones (\u201cVaiden Jones\u201d). In Thomas Jones\u2019s will, which was not admitted to probate until December 28, 2000, he left to Annie Jones \u201call of my real and personal estate for life, and, having full confidence in her, I authorize her to use and consume so much of the income, corpus and principal of my estate as she, in her sole discretion, deems necessary for her comfort, maintenance, welfare and support.\u201d He further specified that, \u201c[a]t my wife\u2019s death, I give, devise, and bequeath that all my property, real and personal, be equally divided between all my children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Vaiden Jones died on December 10, 2000. He was survived by his siblings; his mother, Annie Jones; and his wife, Virginia N. Jones (\u201cVirginia Jones\u201d). Virginia Jones was the sole beneficiary of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Annie Jones died on December 17, 2001. At that time, a parcel of real property in Brunswick County (\u201cthe parcel\u201d) remained from the property bequeathed by Thomas Jones. Virginia Jones and the surviving children of Annie and Thomas Jones sold the Brunswick County land on July 19, 2002 in order to divide the proceeds equally as instructed in the Thomas Jones will.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Tammie L. Hill (\u201cHill\u201d) had previously obtained a judgment against Vaiden Jones and had previously docketed the judgment in the Circuit Court of Brunswick County. The lien, docketed on August 29, 2000, was in the amount of $10,000 with eight percent interest from April 23, 1993 and costs. Hill sought to enforce her lien against the proceeds of sale from the parcel that was intended for distribution to Virginia Jones, Vaiden Jones\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The purchaser of the Brunswick County land, W. Curtis Outten (\u201cOutten\u201d), filed an interpleader action in the Circuit Court of Brunswick County on October 2, 2002. Outten asserted that both Jones and Hill claimed $12,528.86 of the purchase price of the land. He asked the trial court to determine the proper distribution of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The trial court held \u201cthat the interest of R. Vaiden Jones, in the real property of which Thomas N. Jones died seized, was a vested interest against which the judgment lien of Tammie Hill attached and accordingly Tammie L. Hill is entitled to the funds in dispute.\u201d Virginia Jones appeals the adverse judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">On appeal, Virginia Jones asserts that Hill\u2019s lien had not attached to the parcel because \u201cVaiden Jones never became possessed or entitled to the Brunswick Property.\u201d Hill maintains that her lien attached to Vaiden Jones\u2019s remainderman\u2019s interest in the parcel subject to divestment by Annie Jones during her lifetime. Because the parcel was not disposed of by Annie Jones there was no divestment and Hill asserts that her lien is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The trial court was correct in its characterization of Vaiden Jones\u2019s interest as a remainder subject to divestment. As noted in <em>Minor on Real Property:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">If the words importing contingency are a part of the description of the remainderman, the remainder is contingent. If, on the other hand, the words of contingency describe an event, the happening of which is to take away from the remainderman an interest, which in the absence of such event he would retain, the remainder is vested subject to be divested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\"><em>Frederick D.G. Ribble, Minor on Real Property </em>\u00a7 713, at 932 (2d ed. 1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">To determine when a remainder interest vests we apply the so-called \u201cearly vesting rule,\u201d which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">where a bequest or devise is made and the property is not to be enjoyed in possession until some future period or event, it will, where no special intent to the contrary is manifested in the will, be held to be vested in interest immediately on the death of the testator, rather than contingent upon the state of things which may happen to exist at the period when the legatees or devisees are entitled to the possession of the property given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-10\"><em>French </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>108 Va. 67, 69, 60 S.E. 622, 623 (1908). <em>See also Coleman </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>256 Va. 64, 66, 500 S.E.2d 507, 508 (1998); <em>Boyd v. Fanelli, </em>199 Va. 357, 360, 99 S.E.2d 619, 622 (1957). In this case, Virginia Jones conceded, both in her brief and at oral argument, that the trial court correctly applied the early vesting rule in its determination that Vaiden Jones had a vested remainder subject to divestment in the property bequeathed by Thomas Jones in his will. Vaiden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Jones\u2019s remainder interest vested immediately upon Thomas Jones\u2019s death in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">While Vaiden Jones had a vested remainder interest in the property left by his father, that interest was subject to divestment if his mother, Annie Jones, elected to dispose of the property during her life. However, Vaiden Jones\u2019s interest in the parcel was not divested because Annie Jones had not disposed of it at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-458 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">Every judgment for money rendered in this Commonwealth by any state or federal court or by confession of judgment, as provided by law, shall be a lien on all the real estate of or to which the defendant in the judgment is or becomes possessed or entitled, from the time such judgment is recorded on the judgment lien docket of the clerk\u2019s office of the county or city where such land is situated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">It is not disputed that Hill\u2019s judgment was properly recorded in Brunswick County. Therefore, beginning in August 2000, she had a lien on \u201call the real estate of or to which\u201d Vaiden Jones was or became possessed or entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">To be \u201centitled\u201d to something is to have some claim or legal right over it. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>758 (1993); <em>see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>532 (6th ed. 1990). Vaiden Jones\u2019s vested interest in the land was a legally cognizable right that was subject to his creditor\u2019s actions to satisfy legally enforceable debts. <em>See Scott v. </em>Patterson, 104 Va. 455, 456-57, 51 S.E. 848, 848-49 (1905) (a vested remainder may be held liable for the remainder-man\u2019s debts). Consequently, Hill had a lien on Vaiden Jones\u2019s remainder interest in the parcel when her judgment was docketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Vested interests in land may be sold or inherited. When Vaiden Jones died, his vested interest passed to Virginia Jones, his wife. However, her inheritance of Vaiden Jones\u2019s remainder interest in the parcel before the death of Annie Jones did not destroy Hill\u2019s lien because a lien attaches to property, not to the person against whom judgment is awarded. <em>Hardy v. Norfolk Mfg. Co., </em>80 Va. 404, 418 (1885). Consequently, Hill\u2019s lien remained attached to the parcel when it passed to Virginia Jones, and Hill is entitled to enforce her lien against that portion of the proceeds from the sale of the parcel intended for Virginia Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
