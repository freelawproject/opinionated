Dandridge filed a personal injury action against Albert R. Marshall seeking damages of $300,000. In this appeal, Dandridge asserts that due to the trial court\u2019s error in three of its evidentiary rulings, the jury awarded him only $15,000. For the reasons we state below, we will remand the case for a new trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>damages because the trial court erred in excluding certain testimony and allowing other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On December 5, 1999, Dandridge and Marshall were involved in an automobile accident. An ambulance service transported Dandridge, complaining of nausea, blurred vision, and a severe headache, to the Medical College of Virginia Hospital for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Dandridge filed a motion for judgment alleging that Marshall\u2019s negligence caused the accident. Prior to trial, Marshall admitted liability but contested the extent of Dandridge\u2019s injuries stemming from the accident. The case was submitted to the jury on the issue of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">At trial, Dandridge testified that he had suffered a concussion in a prior automobile accident two months before his accident with Marshall. According to Dandridge, the concussion from his prior accident forced him to withdraw from classes he was taking at Virginia Commonwealth University and left him with \u201cmoderate\u201d headaches, neck pain, and an inability to study due to medication. By the time of the second accident, Dandridge testified he \u201cstill had some residuals of neck pain and from [sic] minor headaches, but nothing that was debilitating,\u201d and that his health generally was improving.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Dr. Ross Bullock, a neurosurgeon and Dandridge\u2019s treating physician after his first accident, testified that in the first accident Dandridge had suffered whiplash and \u201cmild to moderate traumatic brain injury\u201d and that Dandridge would still have been feeling the effects of those injuries at the time of his second injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">After his second concussion, Dandridge\u2019s symptoms included significantly more severe headaches, blurred vision, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. Dr. David X. Cifu treated Dandridge after his second accident and diagnosed him with \u201cpost-concussive syndrome\u201d due to his two accidents. According to Dr. Cifu, 85-90% of those who suffer a single concussion make a full recovery within eighteen months, and patients rarely show any improvement beyond that time. While Dandridge was improving steadily before his accident with Marshall, in Dr. Cifu\u2019s opinion, the second concussion intensified his symptoms. Because Dandridge continued to suffer the effects of these concussions as of his last visit with Dr. Cifu on January 24, 2002, Dr. Cifu suggested that Dandridge seek treatment from a psychiatrist or a pain-management specialist. Another physician, Dr. Martin Stein, treated Dandridge with pain medication, but Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Stein\u2019s treatment of Dandridge ended when Dr. Stein\u2019s medical license was suspended on October 21, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Dr. Joel J. Silverman performed a psychiatric evaluation of Dandridge pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 4:10, and portions of his deposition were read at trial. Dr. Silverman testified that Dandridge suffered from chronic depression, and that his headaches were not caused by the second accident but by stress, depression, or a biological predisposition to headache. Dr. Silverman concluded that the intensification of Dandridge\u2019s headaches was not the result of the second accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In this appeal, Dandridge assigns error to three of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. Dandridge asserts first that the trial court erred in sustaining Marshall\u2019s objection to Dandridge\u2019s testimony regarding his treatment by Dr. Martin Stein. Dandridge also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s rulings that permitted certain testimony by Dr. Silverman, specifically, that Dandridge had admitted he hoped to meet financial obligations with proceeds of the lawsuit and that Dandridge had purchased an \u201cassault weapon\u201d rather than securing further medical treatment. We consider these issues in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Dr. Stein treated Dandridge in 2002 following termination of Dr. Cifu\u2019s treatment. Dandridge\u2019s treatment consisted primarily of prescriptions for pain medications. Dr. Stein\u2019s medical license was subsequently revoked. On the day of trial, Marshall filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude Dandridge from introducing any testimony regarding the treatment Dandridge received from Dr. Stein. Marshall\u2019s objection to this testimony was that Dr. Stein was not going to testify at trial and that, under <em>McMunn </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>237 Va. 558, 569, 379 S.E.2d 908, 914 (1989), only Dr. Stein could testify whether the treatment. Dandridge received was reasonable and related to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Marshall correctly recites the principle that only a physician can testify as to the reasonableness of treatment and its causal connection to an event. However, the testimony that Dandridge wished to present regarding Dr. Stein\u2019s treatment did not address those issues. As he argued at trial and reasserts here, Dandridge wanted to testify that when Dr. Cifu told Dandridge he could not provide any further helpful treatment and Dandridge should seek treatment with a psychiatrist or pain management specialist, Dandridge followed those instructions and secured treatment with Dr. Stein, a psychiatrist spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>cializing in pain management. Such testimony bears not on the medical necessity of Dr. Stein\u2019s treatment but on Dandridge\u2019s heeding of Dr. Cifu\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Based on this record, we conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining Marshall\u2019s objection to Dandridge\u2019s testimony that Dandridge followed the advice of Dr. Cifu and secured pain management treatment by Dr. Stein. This testimony was relevant in a number of particulars. It showed that Dandridge followed the recommendation of Dr. Cifu, his treating physician, that Dandridge spent money on further treatment - in contradiction to Dr. Silverman\u2019s testimony - and it also supported Dandridge\u2019s claim of a permanent injury, because Dandridge continued to seek medical treatment even though his treatment with Dr. Cifu ended over a year before the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Our conclusion requires that we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial on damages. Because the other issues Dandridge raises in this appeal may arise on retrial, we will address them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Dandridge complains that the trial court erroneously overruled his objection to the following exchange during Marshall\u2019s questioning of Dr. Silverman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">Q. Now, Doctor, did you discuss at any point the motivation for this lawsuit or the basis for this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">A. Mr. Dandridge volunteered that he had heavy financial obligations, and that he hoped that he could better meet some of those obligations as a result of the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Dr. Silverman\u2019s statement, according to Dandridge, improperly injects his financial standing into consideration of his damages. <em>Washington-Virginia Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Deahl, </em>126 Va. 141, 150, 100 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1919). Marshall counters that this statement is admissible as an admission that is probative on the issues of injuries and the extent of damages, citing <em>Breeden v. Roberts, </em>258 Va. 411, 518 S.E.2d 834 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">In <em>Breeden, </em>a personal injury action, the plaintiff denied making a statement to a third party \u201cabout how much money [he was] going to get out of th[e] lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 518 S.E.2d at 837. Unlike Dandridge, the plaintiff in Breeden neither objected to the question nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>sought to have the answer stricken. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, in considering whether the defendant could introduce further evidence to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, we observed that the plaintiff\u2019s statement regarding the money he would receive from the lawsuit \u201crelated to and tended to cast light upon the issue of his injuries and the extent of his damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416, 518 S.E.2d at 837. While this statement is dicta, we agree with Marshall that, like the statement in Breeden, Dandridge\u2019s statement here was relevant because it was not, as Dandridge argues, limited to his financial status but \u201ccast light\u201d on a matter contested at trial: Dandridge\u2019s credibility regarding the extent of his injuries. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting this statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Finally, Dandridge asserts that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Silverman to testify that Dandridge used his money to purchase an \u201cassault weapon\u201d and ammunition rather than seeking further medical treatment. This testimony occurred by deposition and in the context of Dr. Silverman\u2019s explanation that impulsive behavior and irrational decisions are relevant factors in the evaluation of a person who is depressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In determining whether evidence should be admitted, the trial court must apply a balancing test in assessing the probative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect. <em>Brugh </em>v. Jones, 265 Va. 136, 140, 574 S.E.2d 282, 284-85 (2003). This determination rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will be reversed on appeal only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Lombard v. Rohrbaugh, </em>262 Va. 484, 492, 551 S.E.2d 349, 353 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Dr. Silverman testified that irrational decisions including impulsive purchasing are relevant to the mental examination of a depressed person. However, an expert need not identify every act that person performed to offer an opinion on the mental condition of the person under examination. In this case, the prejudicial effect of identifying an assault weapon as one of Dandridge\u2019s impulse purchases substantially outweighs the probative value of identifying the object of an impulsive purchase. The mention of an assault weapon and ammunition distracts the jury from the matter at issue and prejudices Dandridge. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court committed error because it abused its discretion in allowing Dr. Silverman to testify that Dandridge purchased an assault weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Finally, we reject Marshall\u2019s suggestion that any error the trial court committed in the three evidentiary rulings at issue was harmless error. Well established principles require that error be presumed prejudicial unless the record clearly shows that the error could not have affected the result. <em>Spence v. </em>Miller, 197 Va. 477, 482, 90 S.E.2d 131, 135 (1955). \u201cThere is no presumption that error is harmless.\u201d <em>Breeding v. Johnson, </em>208 Va. 652, 659, 159 S.E.2d 836, 842 (1968). Marshall bases his argument primarily on his theory that the jury returned a verdict of only $15,000 because it did not find Dandridge credible. Nothing in the record of this case clearly shows that Dandridge\u2019s credibility alone was the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict or that the errors of the trial court did not affect Dandridge\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">For the reasons stated, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion on the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
