The decisions of the, California courts as to the extent of the wife\u2019s interest in the community income and her want of power to exercise proprietary rights over it are binding on the federal courts. A general review of the decisions of the California courts discloses that under the so-called community system applicable to the community property here involved, the wife during the existence of the community had no estate, title, or ownership in the community income, and the husband had absolute ownership and power of disposition of the income, restricted only by a prohibition against gifts. <em>Panaud </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>1 Cal. 488; <em>Chance </em>v. <em>Kobsted, </em>226 Pac. 632; <em>Van Maren </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>15 Cal. 308; <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Arellanes, </em>17 Cal. 525; <em>Directors of Fallbrook Irrigation Dist. </em>v. <em>Abila, </em>106 Cal. 355; <em>Spreckels </em>v. <em>Spreckels, </em>116 Cal. 339, 172 Cal. 775; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Wehmeyer, </em>191 Cal. 601; <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>5 Cal. 252; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>18 Cal. 291; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>29 Cal. 337; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>192 Cal. 71; <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>270 Fed. 309; <em>Rice v.

The husband has complete and absolute do-1 minion, possession, and control of the community prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>erty. Sec. 172, Civil Code of California; Yol. 5, \u201c California Jurisprudence,\u201d p. 335, \u00a7 27, and cases cited. The entire community property is subject to the husband\u2019s debts contracted before and after- marriage. <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kinzer, </em>12 Cal. 247; <em>Van Maren </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra; Schuyler v.

The husband may expend all of the community property and income as he pleases, wastefully and for his own pleasure, without infringing the wife\u2019s rights. <em>Spreckels </em>v. <em>Spreckels, </em>116 Cal. 339; <em>Garrozi v. Dastas, </em>204 U. S. 64. The only restrictions on the exercise of absolute ownership by the husband are a prohibition against gifts -without the wife\u2019s consent (which has been held to vest no interest in her) and a prohibition .(enacted in 1917 and not applicable to the property involved here) requiring the wife to join in a conveyance of community real estate. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Wehmeyer, supra; Spreckels </em>v. <em>Spreckels, </em>172 Cal. 775. During the community the wife has no right to expend or have expended for her benefit any part of the community property. The obligation of the husband to provide support and necessaries is a personal one arising out of the marital relation, having no relation to the community property, and is a charge upon him and his separate as well as the community estate, and not based on the theory that the wife owns an interest in. the community. <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>15 Cal.

Absolute ownership remains in the husband. She leaves no estate in the community subject, to administration, nor is it liable for her debts or expenses of administration, nor does the husband take by - succession or descent. California Civil Code, \u25a0 \u00a7 1401; <em>In re Rowland, </em>74 Cal-. 523; <em>In re Burdick, </em>112 Cal. 387. If she survives her husband, the. wife succeeds to one-half of whatever may then remain of the community property, subject to payment of his debts, and expenses of administration. The entire community property forms part of his estate and is administered as such. The wife takes as heir, and her succession is subject to imposition of inheritance taxes. The Act of 1917, reliev-' ing the interest of the surviving wife from inheritance tax is merely an exemption and does not alter the nature or extent of the wife\u2019s interest. <em>In re Moffitt\u2019s Estate, </em>153 Cal. 359; Civil Code \u00a7 1402; <em>In re Burdick, </em>112 Cal. 387; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Loupe, </em>120 Cal. 89; <em>Cunha </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>122 Cal. 111; <em>Moffitt </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>218 U.

It is liable for her debts contracted <em>dum sola, </em>not because of her ownership in the community property, but because her husband became liable for her debts on marriage, and only his separate estate is exempted by statute. The freedom of the community property from liability for the wife\u2019s debts would prevent the United States from satisfying a claim against the wife for income taxes out of the community property. The United States could not lawfully compel the wife to pay an income- tax on any share of the community income because it is not hers, but is the income and property of her husband. <em>Van Maren </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>15 Cal. 308; Civil Code, \u00a7 167; <em>Schuyler </em>v. <em>Broughton, </em>70 Cal. 282; <em>Svetinich </em>v. <em>Sheean, </em>124 Cal. 216.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">The case of <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>270 Fed. 309 and 276 Fed. 226, may be distinguished, because it dealt with the nature of the wife\u2019s interest in the community property after dissolution of the community and not with, her interest in the income during the community.. If not distinguished, it should be disapproved, because it .misconceived the nature of the Act of' 1917, exempting the wife\u2019s succession from state inheritance tax, and treated it as changing the wife\u2019s interest, although it merely exempted it. It also mistakenly applied the Act of 1917, requiring the wife to join in a conveyance of real estate, to property acquired prior to 1917.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">The amendments to the California laws affecting the. wife\u2019s interest in the community property adopted in 1917 and later are not pertinent here, because all the property here involved was acquired' prior to 1917, and under California decisions these amendments do not affect property acquired before their passage. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Wehmeyer, </em>191 Cal. 601; <em>Spreckels </em>v. <em>Spreckels, </em>116 Cal. 339. The opinions of the Attorney General hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>community income in California is taxable to the husband alone. 32 Ops. A. G. 298, 435; 34 Ops. A. G. 376, 395. Congressional inaction on the questions here involved is without particular significance. In the Philippine Islands the community income is held to be the income of the husband for Federal iricome tax purposes. <em>Madrigal and Paterno </em>v. <em>Rafferty, </em>38 Phil. 414. The decisions of this Court in <em>Warburton </em>v. <em>White, </em>176 U. S. 484, <em>Garrozi </em>v. <em>Dastas, </em>204 U. S. 64, and <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Reade, </em>220 U. S. 311, do not deal with the California system and the California court has held that <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Reade </em>does not describe the community system prevailing there. Opinions of text writers, including law writers from California law schools, completely refute the claim that in California the wife has any ownership in the community property and the claim that the system in California is like that in all the other States where a system of \u201c community \u201d property prevails. McKay, Cotnmunity Property; Pomeroy, in West Coast Rep. Vol. 4, p. 390; \u201cCalifornia Jurisprudence,\u201d Vol. 5, p. 330, (McMurray); 35 Harvard L.

The decisions of the courts have not been without conflict. The vested interest of the wife, in far the great number of decisions, from <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>5 Cal. 252, (1855,) to the last expression o\u2019f the .Supreme Court of the State, in <em>Estate of Jolly, </em>238 Pac. 353, has been sustained upon the firm ground that she was a co-partner and equal owner with her husband in the community estate, and that, upon his death, she took her half of the dissolved \u25a0 community, not as the heir of a husband who was exclusive owner, but in her own right, as survivor of the matrimonial partnership. There are conflicting cases, \u2014 in point of number a minority; and in point of authority, largely <em>dicta; </em>with perhaps a single exception, all <em>dicta. </em>These are the <em>dicta </em>which apply to the wife\u2019s interest the attenuating similitude of an \u201c expectancy \u201d \u2014 the expectancy of an heir apparent in the property of his ancestor. The remark fell primarily from Mr. Justice Field, <em>obiter, </em>in <em>Van Maren </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>15 Cal. 308, written in 1860.

If any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>thing may be deemed settled by the Supreme Court of California, in the law of community property, it is to be found in its latest decision as in its first; separated by an interval of seventy years, \u2014 that the community system rests dominatingly and basically on a matrimonial partnership, to the assets of which the wife conclusively contributes on an equality with her husband, and in which, from the moment of the marriage, she has a \u201c present, defined, certain interest,\u201d as co-owner and co-partner. The voluntary partnership, so familiar in everyday life, pays income tax on the just principle that taxation is correlated with ownership. One partner pays the tax on the share of the income which belongs to him, not on the share which belongs to his co-partner. If it be said that the husband, the managing partner, pays the tax of his. co-partner out of community funds, the discrimination is not redressed. The tax upon partnership income is not computed upon the aggregated revenue, with reference to the higher surtax bracket, and the larger exaction; it is computed, for each partner, upon his share. It would be so computed in the case of a brother and sister, succeeding , to the undivided ownership of an income-bearing property; it is so computed by the Treasury, it has been so computed by the Treasury for a period of years, in respect to seven out of eight community-property States. (Solicitor\u2019s Opinion, 121; T. B. 31-21-1845). Congress, in two general revisions of the Revenue Law, refused to alter the method of computation; once, at large, as to the community-property States, as well one as the other; again, in the specific case .of California. But the discrimination against California still persists, though the highest law officer of the Government has advised to the contrary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-6\">Mr. Justice Holmes</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">This is a suit to recover $6,788.03 income tax for the year 1918, paid by R. D. Robbins, late of California. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Robbins was married and the income taxed came from community property in California, acquired before 1917, when some changes were made in the law, and from the earnings of Mr. Robbins. He was required by the Treasury Department to return and pay the tax upon the whole income, against the effort of Mr. and Mrs. Robbins to file returns each of one-half. The result was that he had to pay the amount sued for, above what would have had to be paid if his contention had been allowed. The District Court found the facts as agreed by the parties and upon them ruled that the plaintiffs, the executors of Robbins, were entitled to recover as matter of law. 5 Fed. (2d) 690. A writ of error was taken by the United States, before the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, went into <em>effect. Greenport Basin &amp; Construction Company </em>v. <em>United States, </em>260 U. S. 512, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Elaborate argument was devoted to the question whether the interest of a wife in community property has the relatively substantial character in California that it has in some other States. That she has vested rights has been determined by this Court with reference to some jurisdictions, <em>Warburton </em>v. <em>White, </em>176 U. S. 484; <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Reade, </em>220 U. S. 311; and the Treasury Department has carried those rights to the point of allowing a division in the return of community income in other States where the community system prevails. Regulations 65 relating to the Income Tax under the Revenue Act of 1924, Art. 31. Its adoption of a different rule for California was based, we presume, upon the notion that in that State a wife had a mere expectancy while the husband was alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">If on the whole,this notion seems to us to be adopted by the California courts it is our duty to follow it, so far as material, even if contrary expressions should be found here or there in the books; and it is no concern of ours whether the prevailing decision is a legitimate descendant from its parent the Spanish law or otherwise. \u2014 We can see no sufficient reason to doubt that the settled opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the Supreme Court of California, at least with reference to the time before the later statutes, is that the wife had a mere expectancy while living with her husband. The latest decision that we have seen dealing directly with the matter explicitly takes that view, says that it is a rule of property that has been settled for more than sixty years, and shows that <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Reade, </em>220 U. S. 311, would not be followed in that State. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Wehmeyer, </em>191 Cal. 601, 611, 614. In so doing it accords with the intimations of earlier cases, and does no more than embody \u25a0 the commonly prevailing understanding with regard to California law as shown by commentators and the action of the Treasury Department, as well as by the declarations of the Court.

Treasury Regulations 65 relating to the Income Tax under the Revenue Act of 1924, Art. 31. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>(Cal. Ct. App.) 239 Pac. Rep. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">But the question before us is with regard to the power and intent of the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, Title II, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 210, 211; 40 Stat. 1057, 1062. Even if we are wrong as to the law of California and assume that the wife had an interest in the community income that Congress could tax if so minded, it does not follow that Congress could not tax the husband for the whole. Although restricted in the-matter of gifts, &amp;c., he alone has the disposition of the fund. He may spend it substantially as he chooses, and if he wastes it in debauchery the wife has no redress. See <em>Garrozi </em>v. <em>Dastas, </em>204 U. S. 64. His liability for his wife\u2019s support comes from a different source and exists whether there is community property or not. That he may be taxed for such a fund seems to us to need no argument. The same and further considerations lead to the conclusion that it was intended to tax him for the whole. . For not only should he who has all the power bear the burden, and not only is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>husband the most obvious target for the shaft, but the fund taxed, while liable to be taken for his debts, is not liable to be taken for the wife\u2019s, Civil Code, \u00a7 167, so that the remedy for her failure to pay might be hard to find. The reasons for holding him are at least as strong as those for holding trustees in the cases where they are liable under the law. \u00a7 219.
