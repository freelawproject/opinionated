That is admitted as true on the. motion to dismiss, and establishes the fact of insolvency in the bankruptcy sense required by \u00a7 3466, Rev. Stats. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>261 U. S. 253.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-14\">- The <em>\u201c </em>consent receivership \u201d was a \u201c voluntary assignment.\u201d What Congress had in mind was' to secure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>priority of payment when an insolvent debtor\u2019s property was subject to involuntary seizure, under the bankruptcy laws, or when the debtor voluntarily assigned it to another. The term\u2019 \u201c voluntary assignment \u201d \u2019 denotes not only , the instrument by which property is conveyed, but also the act of transfer; and in these different senses, i. e., means and results, it is variously applied in law. Burrill on Assignments, 6th Ed. \u00a7 1. There \u00e1re many cases where transactions have been held to be general assignments without the execution of a formal instrument. <em>In re </em>Green, 106 Fed. 313; <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Clinton Wire Cloth Co., 246 </em>Fed. 653; <em>In re Hersey, </em>171. Fed. 998; <em>In re Salmon &amp; Salmon, </em>143 Fed. 395; <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Farmers Bank, </em>189 Mo. App. 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-4\">The Company\u2019s action was voluntary, in every possible sense of the word. No receiver could have been appointed at the instance of a simple contract creditor. <em>Hollins </em>v. <em>Brierfield Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>150 U. S. 371. All that the company had to do, to secure a dismissal of the bill and prevent the receivership, was to move to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law. <em>Id; American Mills Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>260 U. S. 360. Instead of resisting the effort to transfer all of its property to receivers for application and distribution to the claims of creditors, the Company voluntarily waived its right to object, affirmatively consented to the receivership, and thereby voluntarily enabled the receivers to be appointed, without which acquiescence no court could or would have appointed, them. The appointment of the receivers divested the Company from the possession and control of all its property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">The modem \u201c consent receivership \u201d is the plan by which bank creditors and a failing corporation usually cooperate to accomplish the. following results, which could not be accomplished except by such cooperation and the voluntary consent of the debtor: (1) Avoidance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>bankruptcy proceedings. (2) Securing the benefit of an equity receivership under which there can be the broadest and most flexible operation of the business as a going concern, absolutely free from harassment or annoyance from' creditors seeking to collect their debts. (3) A protective bankruptcy proceeding (frequently).</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-4\">\u2022 It is a commonplace of corporate practice that an equity receivership, combined with a protective bankruptcy, enables a reorganization committee to delay indefinitely non-assenting creditors, to operate the property as a going concern, and to take their own time about the reorganization. This can only be done, however, when there is complete agreement between certain creditors. and the insolvent debtor. All this goes to show that the \u201c consent receivership \u201d is a \u201c voluntary assignment \u201d and. also an \u201c act of bankruptcy \u201d which it is attempted to camouflage, in order to prevent winding up in bankruptcy. The Government is the one creditor who suffers by this arrangement, as it gets neither (1) its priority, for taxes in the bankruptcy proceedings nor (2) its priority under \u00a7 3466.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-5\">Under the original Bankruptcy Act of 1898, a general assignment was an \u201c act of bankruptcy,\u201d even if' the debtor was solyent. Therefore, if a \u201c consent receivership \u201d had Ibeen held equivalent to a general assignment, such \u201c consent receivership \u201d would have been an act of bankruptcy, though the debtor were perfectly solvent, but only temporarily embarrassed; and solvent concerns could have been thrown into bankruptcy and wound up. Such a construction of the Bankruptcy Act would have stopped all \u201cconsent receiverships,\u201d and the courts frequently held that as the Bankruptcy Act was passed for the benefit of debtors,1 and was in derogation of the common law, it should be strictly construed and that \u201c consent receiver- . ships \u201d were not equivalent to a gen\u00e9ral assignment, and h\u00e9hce not acts of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>On the other hand, the priority statute was based on, public policy, was declaratory of the common law, and was passed for the benefit of the United States. It should be liberally construed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>State Bank of North Carolina, </em>6 Pet. 29. Under \u00a7 3466 it is necessary, not only that there sho\u00fcld be a \u201c voluntary assignment,\u201d i. e., a \u201c consent receivership,\u201d but there must be also insolvency in the bankruptcy sense. The courts should give a liberal construction to the phrase \u201c voluntary assignment,\u201d so as to hold that a. \u201c consent receivership \u201d is the equivalent to a \u201cvoluntary assignment.\u201d The Circuit Courts of Appeals of the First, Fifth and Ninth Circuits hold that a \u201c consent receivership \u201d is the equivalent of a \u201c voluntary assignment;\u201d and'the Fifth and Ninth Circuits hold that it also constitutes ah \u201cact of bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Pullen, </em>277 Fed. 650; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Miller-Link Lumber Co., </em>296 Fed. 649; <em>Bramwell </em>v. <em>U. S. F. &amp; G. Co., </em>299 Fed. 705; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>261 U. S. 253; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>120 U. S. 89; <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Conn. Brass &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>290 Fed. 712; <em>Davis v. Michigan Trust Co., </em>2 Fed. (2d) 194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">The \u201c consent receivership \u201d was an \u201c act of bankruptcy\u201d committed by the Company, and hence Rev. Stats. \u00a7 3466 became operative and the Government was entitled to a priority of payment. As. there was no national bankruptcy act in existence during the years 1790-1799, the repeated use of the phrase \u201c act of bankruptcy \u201d or \u201c act of legal bankruptcy \u201d in these priority statutes, referred, not to acts of bankruptcy under the English law <em>(Conard </em>v. <em>Nicoll, </em>4 Pet. 291; 1 Kent Com. 343, note 1,) but to acts of bankruptcy under.the then existing state statutes, or under any future bankruptcy laws that might be passed by Congress. <em>Davis v. Michigan Trust Co., </em>2 Fed. (2d) 194. Under the . original Bankruptcy Act of 1898, there was no provision by which the appointment of a receiver for a debtor could.be considered an \u201cact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>of bankruptcy.\u201d To remedy that situation, Congress amended the Bankruptcy Act in .1903 (32 Stat. 797) by adding to \u00a7 3a (4)' a provision defining it as an act of bankruptcy where a person, \u201c being insolvent, <em>applied </em>for a Receiver or Trustee for his property, or <em>because </em>of insolvency, a Receiver or Trustee <em>has been put in charge </em>of his property under the laws of a State, of a territory, or of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-6\">The operation of \u00a7 3466 is certainly defeated, if a debtor, insolvent in the bankruptcy sense, can, by agreement with a creditor, have the creditor file a suit for a receiver, with an allegation of a lesser, kind of insolvency, obtain the appointment of a receiver by consent and then successfully claim that no act of bankruptcy has been committed \u2014 when the only reason for the receivership was that the debtor was actually insolvent in the bankruptcy sense. The question presented is whether the Government\u2019s priority under \u00a7 3466 can be 'defeated by an agreement, between a creditor and a debtor, to call the debtor\u2019s financial condition one thing when the receiver is appointed, whereas, in point of fact, the debtor\u2019s condition is something very different; and if that different condition had been truthfully alleged, it would have been \u2019 ah act of bankruptcy and \u00a7 3466 would have come into play. The later authorities hold that if a receiver is appointed upon the ground that the debtor is simply unable to pay his debts in the ordinary course' of business, when it later develops that the debtor was in fact then insolvent .in the bankruptcy sense, such appointment constitutes an <em>\u201c </em>act of bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Hilb </em>v. <em>Am, Smelting &amp; Refining Co., </em>235 Fed. 384; <em>Re Sedalia Farmers Produce Co., </em>268 Fed. 898; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Trust Co., </em>2 Fed. (2d) 194. The theory, of those cases is that if it subsequently develops that, at the time of the application for a receiver, the debtor was insolvent in the bankruptcy sense, then it was insolvency, 'whether recognized at the time or not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>which brought about the receivership. The Bankruptcy-Act provides that an \u201c act of bankruptcy \u201d by any person shall consist of his having, \u201c being insolvent, <em>applied </em>for a receiver or trustee for his property.\u201d Although the Company did not, in one sense, apply for a receiver, yet, in substance, that is exactly what it did. The Court would never have appointed the receivers, if the debtor had objected on the ground that the creditor had an adequate remedy at law. It was only by their affirmative co-operation that the court appointed a receiver.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-4\"><em>Mr. H. G.

Stats, debts due the United\u2018States are not entitled to priority in consent receiverships.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-6\">Mr. Justice Butler</author>\n<p id=\"A3M\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">April 22, 1922, respondent, a New York corporation, was insolvent within the meaning of R. S. \u00a7 3466, and as defined by the Bankruptcy Act. Its debts amounted to approximately $3,000,000, and included $1,154,450 due to .the United States. The value of its assets was not in excess of $1,500,000. On that day, the Hay Foundry and Iron Works, a simple contract creditor, on behalf of itself and other creditors, brought suit against the respondent in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Among the facts alleged are these: Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>owed plaintiff $7,988.43 for labor and materials furnished, and was without money to pay its debts then due. The value of its property, if properly and prudently realized on, would be more than enough.to pay its obligations. Some of its creditors were threatening to bring suits on their claims; and resulting forced sales of the property would cause great loss to the creditors. Plaintiff believed that the property could be preserved for equitable distribution among those entitled thereto only upon the granting of equit\u00e1ble relief including the appointment of receivers, and that, unless the court would deal with the property as a trust fund for the- payment of creditors, it would be sacrificed to the great loss of creditors. More would be realized from a sale if the business was being carried bn. The prayer was for the appointment of receivers, and that when found to be just, and proper the properties be sold and the proceeds distributed among tho.se entitled thereto.. By its answer filed on the same day, respondent admitted all the allegations of the complaint, and, with its consent, the court thereupon made an crder appointing receivers. The order recited that it was necessary for the protection of the respective rights and equities of creditors that the property and business be administered through receivers, and gave to them the exclusive possession, custody and control; they were authorized to continue the .business until the further order of the court, to make disbursements necessary to preserve the' properfy, and to pay debts entitled to priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">September 1, 1922, the United States filed proof of the debt due from respondent and claimed priority under \u00a7 -3466, and later filed its intervening petition, setting forth the facts above stated, and prayed to be adjudged entitled to priority. Respondent moved to dismiss. The District Court granted' the motion. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case is here on certiorari under \u00a7 240, Judicial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The question is whether \u00a7 3466 applies. That section and \u00a7 3467, <em>in pan materia, </em>are quoted in <em>Bramwell </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company, ante, </em>p. 483. The intervening petition shows that respondent was insolvent when the creditor\u2019s suit was begun, and the question of priority is to be determined on that basis, notwithstanding the complaint, alleged and the answer admitted that respondent was solvent. Respondent\u2019s answer admitting the allegations of the complaint and its consent to the court\u2019s order constituted a necessary step in the proceedings for the appointment of receivers. <em>Re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, </em>208 U. S. 90, 109, 110; <em>Pusey </em>&amp; <em>Jones Co. </em>v. <em>Hanssen, </em>261 U. S. 491, 500. So, with the' consent and cooperation of the insolvent debtor, the possession and control of all its property were handed over to be administered by the court through the receivers for the benefit of those whom the court found entitled to it. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Sabin, </em>149 U. S. 473, 479. To induce the action taken by the court, the complaint represented that, if respondent\u2019s property was not dealt with as a trust' fund for the payment of creditors, they would suffer great loss. It is'established that, when a court of equity takes into its possession the assets of an insolvent corporation, it'will administer them on the theory that in equity they belong 'to the creditors and shareholders rather than to the corporation itself. See <em>Hollins </em>v. <em>Brierfield Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>150 U. S. 371, 383; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Railroad Company, </em>102 U. S. 148, 161. Here, the fund being less than the debts, the creditors are entitled to have all of it distributed among them according to their rights and priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">Taken in connection with its insolvency, now conceded, respondent\u2019s answer admitting the allegations of the complaint and its consent to the decree appointing receivers amounted to the handing over of all its property and busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ness to the receivers to be administered, under the direction of the court, as a trust fund to pay respondent\u2019s debts. \u25a0 In substance, the things done by respondent amounted to a .voluntary assignment of all its property within the meaning of \u00a7 3466. The United States is entitled to priority. <em>Bramwell </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company, supra, </em>affirming 299 Fed. 705; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Pullen, </em>277 Fed. 650; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Miller-Link Lumber Co., </em>296 Fed. 649.
