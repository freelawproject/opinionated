We do not review the averments of the petition, since, other questions aside, it is clear that this court is without original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Article III, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides that this court shall have original jurisdiction \u201c in all cases . affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.\u201d Manifestly, this refers to diplomatic and consular representatives accredited to the United States by foreign powers, not to those representing this country abroad. <em>Milward </em>v. <em>McSaul, </em>17 Fed. Cas. 425, 426, No. 9624. The \u2019provision, no doubt, was inserted in view of the important and sometimes delicate nature of our relation.*, and intercourse with foreign governments. It is a privilege, not of the official, but of the sovereign or government which' he represents, accorded from high considerations of public policy, considerations which plainly do not apply to the United States in its own territory.
