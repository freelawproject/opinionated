The state of Connecticut has filed an information alleging that Vincent engaged in delinquent acts when he was approximately ten years old. Through counsel, Vincent moved for, and the court granted, an evaluation of his competency to stand trial, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-56d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">After a hearing held pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (e), the court finds that the movant has failed to meet his burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of proving that he is not competent. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (b). Accordingly, Vincent is presumed competent to stand trial on the pending delinquency charges. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>291 Conn. 556, 969 A.2d 698 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Through its information filed August 11, 2010, the state alleges that on or about May 24, 2010, Vincent committed delinquent acts by way of sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, and sexual assault in the fourth degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Vincent, who was bom in March, 2000, first appeared before the juvenile court on August 18, 2010. On August 26, 2011, after the case had been pending for more than a year, Vincent\u2019s attorney moved for a competency evaluation. The court granted defense counsel\u2019s motion, and an examination was conducted as requested.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The competency hearing was conducted on November 3, 2011. Called by the moving party, Dr. Kathleen Rivera, the evaluator, was the sole witness; she was subject to direct examination and cross-examination, and the court inquired of this witness as authorized by \u00a7 54-56d (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 556, our Supreme Court specifically considered \u201cwhether General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (m), which governs the commitment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>release of criminal defendants who are not competent to stand trial, applies in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Id., <em>557-59.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Juan L. concluded that \u00a7 54-56d (m) does apply in juvenile delinquency proceedings, and confirmed that the statute provides lawful options for disposition of children examined and found to be not competent and not restorable in delinquency cases. Id., 559, 569. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Juan L. </em>court\u2019s examination of the legislative history and relevant amendments to \u00a7 54-56d in general, and \u00a7 54-56d (m) specifically, \u201celiminates any doubt that the legislature intended the [competency evaluation] statute to apply in juvenile delinquency proceedings.\u201d Id., 570-71. The Supreme Court thus held that \u201cthe relevant provisions of \u00a7 54-56d, and particularly subsection (m), govern competency questions arising in juvenile matters proceedings.\u201d Id., 574; see also <em>In re Jan Carlos D., </em>297 Conn. 16, 24 n.13, 997 A.2d 471 (2010) (use of \u00a7 54-56d competency protocol for children is \u201cconsistent with the goals of the juvenile system as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121h\u201d), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Accordingly, given the application of \u00a7 54-56d (b) to the present delinquency matter, Vincent is presumed to be competent. <em>In re Jan Carlos D., </em>supra, 297 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>24 n.13; <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 574. As the moving party, Vincent bears the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he is not competent because he is \u201cunable to understand the [juvenile] proceedings against him ... or to assist in his . . . own defense.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The court has assessed the issue of Vincent\u2019s competency to stand trial in juvenile court in the context of Connecticut\u2019s juvenile justice legislation as a whole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This statutory scheme both acknowledges that young children may commit delinquent acts, and provides consequences for such misconduct. Our legislation establishes the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters over the prosecution, conviction and imposition of dispositional consequences upon children, even of tender years, whose conduct offends the law. See chapter 815t of the General Statutes. For instance, the Division of Criminal Justice is statutorily obligated to investigate and prosecute offenses committed by juveniles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, legislation requires the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>branch, as further discussed herein, as well as the Department of Children and Families, to provide responsive services for juveniles who are found by the court to be delinquent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Connecticut law does not ascribe any minimum age that a child must have reached before he or she can be prosecuted and convicted for the commission of delinquent acts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (1), (2), (5) and (10), as amended. Effective as of January 1, 2010, and relevant to the date when he is alleged to have engaged in sexual assaults, Vincent was defined as a \u201cchild\u201d within the scope of our delinquency statutes, given his date of birth: \u00a7 46b-120 then provided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>in relevant part, that the term \u201c(1) \u2018Child\u2019 means any person under sixteen years of age, except that <em>for purposes of delinquency matters and proceedings, \u2018child\u2019 means any person . . . under eighteen years of age </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46b-120 (10) established that \u201c <em>\u2018delinquent act\u2019 </em>means the violation of any federal or state law, or the violation of any order of the Superior Court, other than the commission of (A) an infraction or violation by a youth [a person sixteen or seventeen years of age] under subsection (b) of section 51-164n [enumerating violations], or (B) a motor vehicle violation by a youth for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment may be imposed . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46b-120 (11) defined violation of \u00a7 53a-70 as a \u201c \u2018serious juvenile offense.\u2019 \u201d Without referencing any minimum age at which a child would be eligible for conviction as delinquent, \u00a7 46b-120 (5) provided that <em>\u201ca child may be convicted as \u2018delinquent\u2019 </em>who has violated (A) any federal or state law, other than the commission of (i) an infraction or violation by a youth under subsection (b) of 51-164n, or (ii) a motor vehicle violation by a youth for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment may be imposed, (B) any order of the Superior Court, except as provided in 46b-148 [no detention permitted for child violating Family With Service Needs orders], or (C) conditions of probation as ordered for the court [for delinquency matters] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (a) provided the protocol for the court\u2019s disposition of a delinquent child, without identifying any minimum age-eligibility for such consequences, as follows: \u201c(a) In determining the appropriate disposition of a child convicted as delinquent, the court shall consider: (1) The seriousness of the offense, including the existence of any aggravating factors such as the use of a firearm in the commission of the offense and the impact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>offense on any victim; (2) the child\u2019s records of delinquency; (3) the child\u2019s willingness to participate in available programs; (4) the existence of other mitigating factors; and (5) the culpability of the child in committing the offense including the level of the child\u2019s participation in the planning and carrying out of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Yet again, without specifying any minimum age, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (a) established the court\u2019s jurisdiction to order commitments for children who have been convicted as delinquent, in relevant part, as follows: \u201c[C]ommitment of children convicted as delinquent by the Superior Court to the Department of Children and Families shall be for (1) an indeterminate time up to a maximum of eighteen months, or (2) when so convicted for a serious juvenile offense, up to a maximum of four years at the discretion of the court, unless extended,\u201d as allowed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Accordingly, as with any \u201cchild\u201d as defined by \u00a7 46b-120 (1) (A), who, engages in conduct alleged to be sexual assaults, Vincent was eligible to be charged with delinquent acts as defined by \u00a7 46b-120 (10) or (11). The lack of any threshold age which a \u201cchild\u201d must have reached before he or she can be charged with a \u201cdelinquent act\u201d is fully consistent with the legislation creating and governing our juvenile justice scheme, which promotes the provision of clinical services and rehabilitation, not penalties, for juveniles upon conviction. See <em>In re Earl B., </em>121 Conn. App. 269, 288 n.5, 994 A.2d 713 (2010), quoting <em>In re Tyvonne M., </em>211 Conn. 151, 160, 558 A.2d 661 (1989).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>A review of the applicable legislation places in context the limited role of the age of a child, such as Vincent, who is subject to delinquency charges.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The goals of our state\u2019s juvenile justice system are codified at \u00a7 46b-121h. See <em>In re Jan Carlos D., </em>supra, 297 Conn. 24 n.13. Section 46b-121h explains that the juvenile justice system is designed to provide \u201cindividualized supervision, care, accountability and treatment in a manner consistent with public safety to those juveniles who violate the law\u201d without designating any threshold age that a child must achieve before becoming eligible to be charged with committing delinquent acts, or before receiving care, accountability and treatment in response. For those whose conduct and needs are addressed by the juvenile justice system, the goals established by \u00a7 46b-121h are to: \u201c(1) Hold juveniles accountable for their unlawful behavior; (2) Provide secure and therapeutic confinement to those juveniles who present a danger to the community; [and] (3) Adequately protect the community and juveniles . . . .\u201d Similarly, no minimum age limit for participation in programs and services to be implemented within the juvenile justice system is established either by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121i, which identifies the judicial branch\u2019s general obligation to provide such programs and services for delinquent children, or by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121j, which designates specific programs and probation treatment for juvenile offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>While \u00a7 46b-120 (1), (5), (10) and (11) establish no age a child must reach before he or she can be charged with delinquent acts, the age of a child so charged is a significant feature of the nature and extent of responsive services available through the Court Support Services Division (CSSD).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121k calls for the development of age-appropriate programs to prevent and reduce children\u2019s delinquent conduct. Section 46b-12 lk (a) (2) explains, in pertinent part: \u201cThe programs shall be tailored to the type of the juvenile, including the juvenile\u2019s offense history, age, maturity and social development, gender, mental health . . . and shall be culturally appropriate, trauma-informed and provided in the least restrictive environment possible in a manner consistent with public safety. . . .\u201d Relevant to Vincent\u2019s case, further fulfilling the legislative intention that such services be available to juveniles without designating a minimum age for eligibility, \u00a7 46b-121k (a) (2) also provides that \u201c[t]he Court Support Services Division shall develop programs that provide . . . (F) sexual offender treatment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">DR. RIVERA\u2019S EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">At the competency hearing, the court received evidence from a single witness, Dr. Kathleen Rivera, proffered by the defense. The court utilized the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>standards in assessing the weight of this evidence. \u201c \u2018It is well established that [i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. . . . The credibility and the weight of expert testimony is judged by the same standard, and the trial court is privileged to adopt whatever testimony [it] reasonably believes to be credible. <em>... It is the quintessential function of the fact finder to reject or accept certain evidence, and to believe or disbelieve any expert testimony. . . . The trier may accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony of an expert offered by one party or the other.\u2019\u2019 ... In re Carissa K., </em>55 Conn. App. 768, 781-82, 740 A.2d 896 (1999).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Jason R., </em>129 Conn. App. 746, 772-73, 23 A.3d 18 (2011). \u201c \u2018It is within the province of the trial court to find facts and draw proper inferences from the evidence presented.\u2019 . . . <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Delente, </em>123 Conn. App. 146, [166], 2 A.3d 38 (2010).\u201d <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>Lennon, </em>131 Conn. App. 585, 597, 27 A.3d 436, cert. denied, 303 Conn. 901, 31 A.3d 1178 (2011); see also <em>Adalberto S., </em>27 Conn. App. 49, 53, 604 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 903, 606 A.2d 1328 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In determining the credibility and weight of evidence presented through Dr. Rivera, the court has kept in mind that \u201c[n]o fact is . . . determined merely by the number of witnesses who testify for or against it; it is the quality and not the quantity of testimony that controls.\u201d Conn. Civil Jury Instructions 2.5-1, Credibility of Witnesses, available at http://www.jud. ct.gov/JFcivU/ part2/2.5-l.htm. The court has considered the witness\u2019 \u201cappearance on the stand and whether the witness has an interest of whatever sort in the outcome of the trial . . . [her] opportunity and ability to observe facts correctly and to remember them truly and accurately, and [has tested her evidence by its] own knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>human nature and the motives that influence and control human actions.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court has considered the reasonableness of what the witness has said and the consistency or inconsistency of her testimony. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In addition, the court acknowledges that expert witnesses, \u201cbecause of their training, education, and experience, have knowledge beyond that of the ordinary person. Because of that expertise in whatever field they happen to be in, expert witnesses are allowed to give their opinions. . . . <em>However, the fact that these witnesses may qualify as experts does not mean that [the court must] accept their </em>opinions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 2.5-3, Expert Witnesses. Thus, in deciding whether to believe some, or all, or none of Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion testimony, the court has considered her education, training and experience in the field of assessing children\u2019s competency to stand trial; the facts she had, and the documents and other information that was available to her; the witness\u2019 opportunity and ability to examine that data; the witness\u2019 ability to recollect the activity and facts that form the basis for her opinion; and her ability to tell the court accurately about the facts, her actions in conducting her evaluation, and the basis for her opinion. Id.; see also <em>In re Jason R., </em>supra, 129 Conn. App. 772-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Using the foregoing measures, the court finds that Dr. Rivera had acquired education, training and experience in the field of psychiatry before forming her opinion about Vincent\u2019s \u00a7 54-56d competency. Dr. Rivera had completed medical school in 2006; licensed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>physician by the state of Connecticut, she completed her residency in adult psychiatry in 2009 and became board certified in adult psychiatry. Dr. Rivera had completed a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry in June of 2011; she was board eligible in this subspecialty when she examined Vincent, although she will not take the child and adolescent psychiatry board certification exam until the summer of 2012. Now pursing a fellowship in forensic psychiatry, Dr. Rivera has been employed by Yale\u2019s department of Law and Psychiatry, affiliated with the New Haven Office of Court Evaluations, since July 1, 2011. When she testified on November 3, 2011, Dr. Rivera had performed a total of fifteen competency evaluations, and had testified on ten to twelve occasions. Approximately four of those competency evaluations had been for minors; she had testified on at least one other occasion concerning a minor\u2019s competency. With these credentials, the Office of Court Evaluations had assigned Dr. Rivera to assess young Vincent\u2019s competency to stand trial. (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Dr. Rivera met with Vincent on two occasions, providing a total of approximately two and one-half hours of contact with him in September, 2011; she also reviewed a significant number of records reflecting the child\u2019s status both before and after the alleged sexual assaults.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Dr. Rivera spoke to a psychiatrist who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>treated Vincent, to Vincent\u2019s lawyer, and, on two occasions, to Vincent\u2019s mother. (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Upon completing her evaluation, Dr. Rivera opined that Vincent is not competent to stand trial. She expressly concluded that as of September, 2011, \u201cVincent [M.] did not demonstrate a rational understanding of the legal proceedings against him. He did not exhibit the ability to assist in his defense.\u201d (Ex. A.) Among other things, she further found that \u201cVincent did not demonstrate the ability to follow testimony for contradictions and errors, to bring relevant information to his attorney\u2019s attention, be cross-examined, understand instructions and advice, or make rational decisions about the handling of his case.\u201d (Ex. A.) Dr. Rivera maintained this opinion throughout the competency hearing. (Tr. 11/3/11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">VINCENT\u2019S \u00a7 54-56d COMPETENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Given the effect of <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 556, upon juvenile court matters and applying the legal standards for assessing the quality of the evidence as described above, the court finds that there is inadequate basis for accepting Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion on the issue of Vincent\u2019s competency. As the court declines to credit the sole witness\u2019 conclusion that this child is not able to understand the delinquency proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense, Vincent cannot meet his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is not competent within the meaning of \u00a7 54-56d (a). Section 54-56d (b)\u2019s presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>competency therefore prevails insofar as Vincent\u2019s pending delinquency charges are concerned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion in this case lacks credibility for a number of reasons. In part, the court declines to credit her conclusion that Vincent is not competent because the opinion lacks an adequate foundation. Fundamentally, Dr. Rivera did not have sufficient experience or expertise upon which to rest her assessment of the 11.4 year old child\u2019s \u00a7 54-56d competency. As noted above, Dr. Rivera does have a high level of education, training and board certification in adult psychiatry; she had finished a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry just two months before examining Vincent, and is not yet board certified in the subspecialty dealing with children. Moreover, although she is presently a forensic fellow, Dr. Rivera has minimal experience conducting competency evaluations in general; she has scant experience in evaluating competency in juveniles. Even including Vincent, before rendering her opinion in this matter, Dr. Rivera had only done four competency evaluations for minors: one was age thirteen, and two were seventeen years of age.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Before this case, she had never evaluated a child of Vincent\u2019s age or stage of development, or any child under the age of thirteen, for \u00a7 54-56d puiposes. (Tr. 11/3/11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In the absence of specific experience or sufficient training in assessing competency for children of Vincent\u2019s age and stage of development, even though counsel may have agreed that she is an expert, the court finds that Dr. Rivera is not an authority on the issue of competency issues as to pre-teenagers in general or as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to children such as Vincent who are age 11.4 at the time of assessment. (Tr. 11/3/11.) Thus, her competency opinion lacked an adequate foundation. In reaching this conclusion, the court credits the witness\u2019 admission that she had never written nor published any articles in professional literature dealing with the subject of competency evaluations for minors. She had never lectured her peers, taught a seminar, or served as a member of a panel dealing with this subject; her methods for assessing child competency or her opinions on the same have never been cited by others as having professional validity outside the courtroom setting.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As Dr. Rivera lacks expertise upon which to support her opinion concerning young Vincent\u2019s competency, her opinion does not bear weight sufficient to enable the movant to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Other aspects of the evidence support the court\u2019s determination that Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion lacks an adequate foundation. Dr. Rivera candidly admitted that her method of forensic evaluation, while appropriate for adults, has not been validated for use in assessing competency for children of Vincent\u2019s age. She acknowledged that there is no professional literature to support the conclusion that the questions she presented to Vincent, in the course of attempting to \u201cprovide an insight as to how a person thinks,\u201d are rehable tools for use when performing a competency examination on a child of his age and stage of development. (Tr. 11/3/11.) While the witness\u2019 testimony emphasized what she perceived to be Vincent\u2019s apparent lack of capacity to engage in abstract reasoning, and while she used this ostensible deficit as part of her basis for determining that the child was not competent to stand trial on the pending juvenile delinquency charges, Dr. Rivera was not aware of any case law that would make abstraction a requirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>competency under \u00a7 54-56d. The methods of evaluation she employed in reaching her conclusions regarding Vincent\u2019s competency further lead the court to find that Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion was based upon an insufficient foundation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Similarly, the lack of foundation for Dr. Rivera\u2019s competency opinion is evident through its inconsistency with Vincent\u2019s acknowledged ability to explain what a plea bargain is; on cross-examination by the state, Dr. Rivera credibly conceded that the child gave a reasonable response to her inquiries on this procedural aspect of delinquency proceedings. (Tr. 11/3/11.) The reasonableness of Vincent\u2019s response on this subject is supported by Dr. Rivera\u2019s own conclusion that the child\u2019s mental status exam indicates that, upon evaluation, his \u201cperformance and presentation were consistent with his current age and developmental stage.\u201d (Ex. A.) Vincent\u2019s understanding of the plea bargaining process, within the limits of \u00a7 54-56d as applicable to this case pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 556, is further consistent with Dr. Rivera\u2019s concession that Vincent\u2019s responses to many of the questions she posed to him during the evaluation process were expected, rather than unexpected, for children of his age. (Tr. 11/ 3/11.) Dr. Rivera\u2019s report is replete with examples of Vincent\u2019s age-appropriate answers to specific questions, consistent with her credible conclusion that his <em>\u201cthought process was relevant, logical and coherent, </em>although concrete,\u201d during the competency examination. (Emphasis added.) (Ex. A.) Moreover, Dr. Rivera\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>conclusions about Vincent\u2019s understanding of the plea bargaining process, and her assessment of the quality of his personal thought process, are inconsistent with her opinion that this child lacks the degree of reasoning that is necessary to understand the ongoing juvenile delinquency proceedings, or to assist with his defense. (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.) This inconsistency leads the court to again find that there is insufficient foundation for Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that Vincent is not competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In deciding that there is insufficient basis upon which to accept Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion, the court has credited the fact that even though the child had received a relatively significant amount of mental health care both before and following the sexual assaults that led to his pending delinquency charges, the witness did not identify any treated or untreated psychiatric issues as the cause for concluding that Vincent lacks competency to stand trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.) The court further credits Dr. Rivera\u2019s findings that Vincent conducts himself at an age-appropriate level at school, socially and in sports activities. This evidence is consistent with the evaluator\u2019s conclusion that \u201cVincent\u2019s <em>intelligence and general fund of knowledge </em>were assessed as being in the <em>average to above average range of intellectualfunctioning.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) (Ex. A.) Together, these conclusions are sufficient to establish that notwithstanding his psychiatric status, Vincent has demonstrated the ability to learn and to follow rules, to follow them, to acquire new information and to make reasonable judgments in educational and social environments. As further discussed below, Dr. Rivera\u2019s credible acknowledgment of Vincent\u2019s age-appropriate cognitive assets and educational accomplishments, his normal social functioning outside the home, and the lack of any measurable impact from his psychiatric status have the effect of further diminishing any value of her conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>that this child lacks competency, given \u00a7 54-56d\u2019s application to children. <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The court is further unable to attribute sufficient weight to Dr. Rivera\u2019s competency opinion because her conclusions were apparently based, in part, upon an overly circumscribed perception of the practical, functional and legal role the child\u2019s mother would likely play in the course of the pretrial or intra-trial decision-making process.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Dr. Rivera noted, among other things, that Vincent \u201cconsistently identified his mother as the person to ask questions of even if they were legal in nature . . . .\u201d (Ex. A.) Incorporating this observation into her opinion that he was not competent, Dr. Rivera concluded that Vincent could not stand trial, in part, because he \u201cdid not demonstrate understanding of the autonomy he has over the decisions involving his case . . . .\u201d (Ex. A; see also Tr. 11/3/11.) Notwithstanding the child\u2019s confidential relationship with his attorney, the subject of any \u201cautonomy\u201d attached to a child involved in a delinquency proceeding, and his attendant due process rights, must be assessed in the light of his or her parent\u2019s requisite, legal role in those proceedings. Accordingly, in rejecting the adequacy of this ground for Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that Vincent is not competent, the court observes that a number of our statutes expressly require a child\u2019s parent or guardian to play a fundamental role when a juvenile is charged with violating the law; the parent or guardian is not a bystander to the legal proceedings related to such charges, but is, in prominent circumstances, a critical participant whose physical presence is mandated by law. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-199 and 46b-137;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>see also <em>In re Kevin K., </em>299 Conn. 107, 123-24, 7 A.3d 898 (2010) (because officers had properly provided a prearrest advisement to the child in the presence of his parent two days earlier, they were not required to readvise child and parent before renewed questioning about same event). Dr. Rivera\u2019s conclusion that Vincent is not competent to stand trial, in part, because he did not demonstrate the \u201cautonomy\u201d she feels to be inherent in the \u00a7 54-56d competency at issue in these delinquency proceedings, thus lacks weight because of its inconsistency with a child\u2019s parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s crucial role throughout the course of delinquency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Viewed in the context of the necessary involvement of a parent in a child\u2019s delinquency prosecution and subsequent court proceedings, Vincent\u2019s behavior in looking to his mother for guidance and support when confronted with questions related to the legal process is consistent with the law of this state, and also with the \u201cbest practices\u201d which engage a child\u2019s parent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>guardian in the court process.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 54-199. Under these circumstances, the court declines to accept Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that this aspect of Vincent\u2019s conduct, looking to his mother for guidance and support, provides adequate grounds for finding that the child is not competent within the meaning of \u00a7 54-56d (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The court also declines to credit Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that Vincent cannot stand trial because her conclusions with regard to the child\u2019s likely courtroom behavior were overtly inconsistent with the demeanor he exhibited during the competency hearing. After interviewing Vincent, Dr. Rivera concluded, among other things, that Vincent \u201cdemonstrated that he would have difficulty changing his behavior to adapt to what is needed in a court room. For instance continuing to raise his hand in court the way he is accustomed to doing in school.\u201d (Ex. A.) Dr. Rivera further based her opinion, in part, on her determination that Vincent \u201cis not able to separate the social expectations of other settings such as school and home from the expectations of the courtroom.\u201d (Ex. A.) The court was able to observe young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Vincent\u2019s demeanor and comportment during the hearing, which involved approximately an hour and one-half of questioning of and testimony from Dr. Rivera, followed by counsels\u2019 argument. For the great majority of that period, the child appeared focused and attentive, quietly seated near his lawyer and his mother. Near the very end of the hearing, Vincent did appear to be more restless than he had been earlier, consistent with the behavior any eleven year old child might demonstrate after sitting so long in a formal courtroom environment. However, the child did not engage in behaviors such as raising his hand to be heard, standing up or attempting to leave the courtroom; rather than being disruptive, under the circumstances, Vincent\u2019s conduct in the courtroom was very good, nearly a paradigm for any child in his position. Even Dr. Rivera conceded, on cross-examination by the state, that she did not observe Vincent fidgeting or engaging in distracting behaviors during the hearing; she admitted that the child appeared to be calm. (Tr. 11/3/11.) That Vincent\u2019s conduct in an adversarial environment was so markedly different from that predicted by the witness again leads the court to discredit Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion on the issue of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The court further declines to credit Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that Vincent is not statutorily competent to stand trial on his delinquency charges because this position is so inconsistent with her credible reports of the child\u2019s many age-appropriate social and academic accomplishments. As previously noted, the court credits the portions of Dr. Rivera\u2019s testimony and report that, implicitly, make it clear that Vincent has, in fact, the ability to use the degree of reasoning that is common to children of his age who are successful in school and sport-related activities, despite his history of witnessing traumatic events, and notwithstanding the aggressive and hostile behaviors that have historically led to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>hospitalizations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.) Vincent is reported to be doing very well in regular classes at school; he is an honor student; he has demonstrated sufficient educational and social proficiency so that his elementary school considered having him skip the third grade. Vincent\u2019s CT Mastery Test results show him to be operating at grade level, measured against other elementary school students in Connecticut. (Ex. A.; Tr. 11/3/11.) With these credible findings, the court accepts Dr. Rivera\u2019s conclusion that Vincent is functioning well at age eleven; she has credibly admitted that \u201c[although Vincent has required intensive psychiatric treatment from a very young age, he has been successful overall in other social settings such as school and organized sports.\u201d (Ex. A.) In concluding that Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion as to Vincent\u2019s competency lacks merit, the court considers that opinion to be too inconsistent with the logical inference that success in such settings as \u201cschool and organized sports\u201d requires a child to acquire and comprehend new information about rules and norms for reasoning, behavior and performance, and to follow and apply those rules and norms even in stressful, competitive settings such as the classroom and the playing fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Notwithstanding her findings concerning Vincent\u2019s overall success in regular classes at school, socially, and in sports activities, Dr. Rivera bases her competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>opinion, in part, upon limitations she has identified in Vincent\u2019s ability to engage in higher levels of abstract thinking. She remarks that he was unable to state the elements of the offense of sexual assault in the first degree; to \u201cidentify incongruences in the facts of the police reports\u201d; or to perform a series of particular mathematical calculations. (Ex. A.) Yet despite her reports of these ostensible restrictions in his ability to perform certain tasks during her testing, as previously noted, Dr. Rivera has reported, and the court has credited, the conclusion that insofar as the results of her \u201cMental Status Exam\u201d were concerned, \u201cVincent\u2019s performance and presentation were consistent with his current age and developmental stage.\u201d (Ex. A.) This aspect of Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion is consistent with her findings concerning Vincent\u2019s overall success in regular classes at school, socially, and in sports activities, and with her previously addressed conclusions regarding his \u201crelevant, logical and coherent, although concrete,\u201d thought process. (Ex. A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">However, despite having found that Vincent has an age-appropriate level of academic and social performance and presentation, Dr. Rivera is of the opinion that he is not competent to face his juvenile delinquency charges because he lacks the <em>\u201ccapacity to rationally understand </em>the legal proceedings against him or assist in his own defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Ex. A.) The court credits Dr. Rivera\u2019s testimony indicating that despite the child\u2019s recorded psychiatric diagnosis and the mental health treatment records she had reviewed in preparation of her report, she saw no evidence of any previously diagnosed symptomatology in the course of her forensic interviews. (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.) This credible aspect of the witness\u2019 opinion supports the inference that Vincent has not been rendered not competent by any feature of his psychiatric status.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Yet, in the context of opining on the subject of \u00a7 54-56d <em>competency, </em>Dr. Rivera concluded that \u201c[improvement of [Vincent\u2019s] <em>capacity </em>to understand his current charges and assist in his defense <em>requires a process of cognitive and social maturation that typically cannot be accelerated by educational or psychological pro</em>grams.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Ex. A.) Dr. Rivera admitted upon cross-examination by the state: \u201cusually the type of rational understanding that is required to understanding legal proceedings of this matter usually is acquired between the ages of 14 and 16; although there are some studies that say around 12 some kids can be able [to] understand rationally, sort of, these proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Tr. 11/3/11.) The court declines to credit this aspect of Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that Vincent is not competent to stand trial, as it is too intrinsically bound to his chronological age and attendant, normal stage of intellectual and social development. To adopt this aspect of the basis for her opinion that Vincent is not competent to stand trial, the court would have to impose a higher threshold for the element of \u00a7 54-56d (a) competency than that which is lawfully associated with children who are being assessed for the purposes described in <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 556. Using this aspect of Dr. Rivera\u2019s analysis, Vincent could not meet the criteria for competency because, under her analysis, he is too young, and too immature to stand trial in a juvenile court, even though his functioning was unaffected during her testing by his mental health issues, he does well in school, he participates in organized sports, his thought process is relevant and logical, and he generally functions as a well, eleven year old male.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In declining to credit Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that Vincent cannot be found competent to stand trial until he reaches a more mature stage of cognitive and social development, a feature of his chronological age, the court observes that such a standard is fundamentally inconsistent with the laws which govern our juvenile justice system. As discussed above, Connecticut\u2019s statutes allow prosecution of even young children, contemplate holding them responsible for delinquent conduct, and, through CSSD\u2019s services, enable them to access age-appropriate clinical and rehabilitative programs. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-121h, 46b-121i and 46b-121j.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In identifying the witness\u2019 demonstrated bias on the subject of competency in children, the court notes that Connecticut has not adopted an age-based standard for determining competency to stand trial, as contemplated by \u00a7 54-56d (a) or (b). Moreover, as previously discussed, in enabling the provision of age-appropriate rehabilitation services through the CSSD, the legislation establishing Connecticut\u2019s juvenile justice system clearly anticipates that some children against whom delinquency charges are brought will be older, and that some will be younger. This feature of our juvenile justice statutes is in accord with the fact that Connecticut does not automatically reject the validity of testimony provided by children who have not reached a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>level of chronological age or maturity, although a child witness may be the subject of a modified version of the adult oath, or may deliver testimony without the imposition of any oath at all in certain circumstances. See, e.g., Practice Book \u00a7 32a-4 (a); C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (4th Ed. 2008) \u00a7 6.9.1.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Given the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 556, notwithstanding the age of the child against whom delinquency charges are brought, \u00a7 54-56d\u2019s presumption of competency remains effective unless the child has been proved to be not competent by a preponderance of the evidence. General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a) and (b). In this context, considering the evidence in its entirety, the court is constrained to conclude that Dr. Rivera is biased in favor of a standard that would find that only minors older than Vincent are vested with the presumption of competency to stand trial that is intrinsic to \u00a7 54-56d (b); Vincent\u2019s relative infancy carried significant weight in her determination that he could not understand the proceedings against him, and that he could not assist his attorney in his defense.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Dr. Rivera retained this opinion even though she credibly reported that Vincent\u2019s \u201clong-term memory appeared intact as evidenced by his ability to recall important personal information that most people would normally recall\u201d and although his \u201cintelligence and general fund of knowledge were assessed as being in the average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>to above average range of intellectual functioning\u201d as measured against others of his age. (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.) Dr. Rivera\u2019s conclusion that the child is not competent to stand trial is consistent with her own age-bias for juvenile competency matters, but is inconsistent with her salient findings concerning Vincent\u2019s memory, intelligence, relevant, logical and coherent thought process, educational and social success, as described above, and with the implications of <em>State </em>v. <em>Juan L., </em>supra, 291 Conn. 556, for application of \u00a7 54-56d (a) and (b) in juvenile delinquency matters.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, the age-biased element of Dr. Rivera\u2019s evidence again causes the witness\u2019 competency opinion to carry little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the court declines to credit Dr. Rivera\u2019s opinion that Vincent is not competent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>stand trial on his pending delinquency charges. The witness\u2019 insufficient experience and foundation, the multiple inconsistencies in the evidence, and the age-bias element of the opinion tendered to the court, individually, in partial combination, or taken collectively, render the movant\u2019s evidence inadequate to overcome the presumption of competency established by \u00a7 54-56d (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">As Vincent has failed to meet his burden of proving that he is not competent by a preponderance of the evidence, he is presumed to be competent to stand trial on his juvenile delinquency charges, pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (b).

The evaluator\u2019s written report and testimony reflect her consultation with the child, his mother, the child\u2019s prior psychiatrist, and the child\u2019s lawyer; there is no indication, however, that she had collateral contact with the state\u2019s attorney or with a victim\u2019s representative.

For instance, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 explicates the fundamental role a parent or guardian plays in the extension of due process rights to children. That statute provides, in pertinent part that: \u201c(a) Any admission, confession or statement, written or oral, made by a child under the age of sixteen to a police officer or Juvenile Court official shall be inadmissible in any proceeding concerning the alleged delinquency of the child making such admission, confession or statement <em>unless made by such child in the presence of the child\u2019s parent or parents or guardian and after the parent or parents or guardian and child have been advised </em>(1) of the child\u2019s right to retain counsel, or if unable to afford counsel, to have counsel appointed on the child\u2019s behalf, (2) of the child\u2019s right to refuse to make any statements, and (3) that any statements the child makes may be introduced into evidence against the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137; see also <em>In re Kevin K, </em>299 Conn. 107, 123-24, 7 A.3d 898 (2010). General Statutes \u00a7 54-199 provides that \u201c[wjhenever any minor charged with the commission of an offense is to appear in any court, <em>he shall be accompanied by one of his parents . . . or by his legally appointed </em>guardian.... The judge of such court may, in his discretion and for good cause, waive the requirement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\"> The necessary role of a parent or guardian in delinquency matters is fully consistent with the \u201cbest practices\u201d followed by our juvenile courts when deciding whether to accept or reject a juvenile\u2019s admission and attendant disposition. This \u201cbest practices\u201d approach does not anticipate that the child, standing all alone, will decide about the progress or outcome of his or her pending delinquency charges. Rather, the \u201cbest practices\u201d protocol assumes that the child <em>and </em>his or her parent or guardian, as well as the child\u2019s lawyer, will all play a role in determining whether to enter an admission and thus forgo a trial, or whether to proceed to trial. The \u201cbest practices\u201d approach accordingly anticipates that the court will include the child and his or her parent or guardian in the plea canvass. In such circumstances, the court may directly ask the child\u2019s parent or guardian such questions as whether the parent or guardian has understood the inquiries presented to the child during the canvass; whether the parent or guardian understood the child\u2019s answers; whether the parent or guardian agreed with the child\u2019s decision to admit the delinquent act at issue; whether the parent or guardian agreed with the proposed disposition; and whether the parent or guardian found the outcome to serve the child\u2019s best interests, under all the circumstances then prevailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> Dr. Rivera reports that \u201cVincent has a history of witnessing domestic violence and of sexual abuse.\u201d (Ex. A.) She also noted the child\u2019s nocturnal enuresis, described difficulties with self-control in the classroom, and history of having fallen out of his mother\u2019s arms as an infant. (Ex. A.) She credibly reported that Vincent has been diagnosed with Mood Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and Adjustment Disorder, Mixed Disturbed Conduct, for which a variety of medications have been prescribed in addition to other mental health therapies; the regimen of psychotropic medications Vincent is now taking includes mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications. (Ex. A; Tr. 11/3/11.) The positive impact of those medications is evident in Dr. Rivera\u2019s credible conclusion that \u201cVincent is an overall healthy boy.\u201d (Ex. A; Tr. 11/ 3/11.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b317-5\"> Dr. Rivera\u2019s age-related bias in competency matters was evident in her agreement, upon cross-examination by the state, that most ten or eleven year olds would have difficulty understanding the legal term allegation, a term the evaluator used in the process of interviewing Vincent. (Tr. 11/3/ 11.) Her bias is further illustrated by her response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to how, despite her conclusion that Vincent is not competent to stand trial, he was able to provide well-reasoned answers to many of the questions posed during the forensic interviews. Dr. Rivera explained that this was not due to the child\u2019s random choice of appropriate answers: \u201cI attribute it moreso with the fact that our children and adolescents tend to make decisions based on the immediacy of the outcomes without necessarily taking into consideration what future outcomes or consequences might come with it. . . . [I]n children and adolescents in general, when given, let\u2019s say, you can go home but you\u2019ll have five years probation versus doing one month and having one year they might choose going home now just because they want to go home now without necessarily thinking that five years probation is a fairly long time of probation.\u201d (Tr. 11/3/11.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b319-6\"> As the commentators have observed, \u201cReported cases bear out the maxim that every child has differing abilities to comprehend and narrate facts.\u201d C.

(Tr. 11/3/11.) Dr. Grisso places the age at which \u201ckids might obtain abstract reasoning [to be] within the ages 13 to 16. He also talks about that ... at the age of 14, that\u2019s when . . . most adolescents are able to think in the same way as an adult would.

Fairly read, that opinion specifically dealt not with the question of whether the respondent, Manuel, was <em>competent </em>to stand trial, but whether he had the <em>capacity </em>to waive the right to counsel who could assist him with pending violation of juvenile probation charges. Id., 732-33. In <em>In re Manuel R., </em>our Supreme Court \u201crejected] the respondent\u2019s invitation to impose a per se rule of incompetency on all children\u201d for whom the issue of waiver of counsel arises in juvenile delinquency cases. Id., 736. That conclusion was, however, based on the court\u2019s express assessment in 1988 of the <em>capacity, </em>not \u00a7 54-56d competency, of children so involved: \u201cWe are not persuaded . . . that a per se rule based on the age of the child is an appropriate response to the admittedly delicate issue of juveniles\u2019 waiver of rights. The empirical evidence to date suggests that age, by itself, is not a rehable touchstone for determining a juvenile\u2019s <em>capacity </em>to exercise fundamental rights. A major study concluded that \u2018age itself is quite limited in its effectiveness as a guide for weighing decisions about juveniles\u2019 understanding.\u2019 T. Grisso, [Juveniles\u2019 Waiver of Rights: Legal and Psychological Competence (1981)], p. 90. It is true that, for all children below the age of fourteen, the available evidence suggests that comprehension of legal rights is elusive. Id., p. 202. With regard to children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, however, general intelligence level, as well as socioeconomic status and prior court experience, become increasingly significant factors in a child\u2019s ability to grasp and exercise legal rights. Id., p. 90. The empirical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>literature therefore fails definitively to identify age as a surrogate for <em>incapacity </em>for children below the age of sixteen.
