The principal question presented by the Motion To Dismiss now before the court is whether a water pollution control authority has the legal capacity to be sued. For the reasons stated below, the answer to this question is Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">For purposes of this motion, the factual assertions set forth in the Complaint are not contested. The plaintiff, Anna Zahrijczuk, owns a house in Branford. Her sewerage system is operated by the defendant, Branford Water Pollution Control Authority (\u201cAuthority\u201d). On October 10,2009, the Authority\u2019s sewerage system overflowed and damaged Zahrijczuk\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">On October 8, 2011, Zahrijczuk commenced this action against the Authority by service of process. She is the sole plaintiff, and the Authority is the sole defendant. Her Complaint consists of four counts, alleging various forms of negligence and nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">On December 15, 2011, the Authority filed the Motion To Dismiss now before the court. The Motion contends that, \u201cThis Court lacks jurisdiction because (1) the Branford Water Pollution Control Authority is not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>independent legal entity which can be sued; and (2) the writ/sununons lacks a proper recognizance.\u201d The Motion was argued on April 2,2012. Supplemental briefs were filed on April 9, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">THE AUTHORITY\u2019S CAPACITY TO BE SUED</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The Authority\u2019s principal contention is that it lacks the legal capacity to be sued. This claim requires a careful review of the complex statutory scheme governing water pollution control authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s description of water pollution control authorities as \u201cquasi-municipal corporations\u201d; <em>Forest Walk, LLC v. Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 281; while plainly establishing that such authorities have a legal status of some sort, does not clarify exactly what that status is. It would be better, as McQuillin explains, \u201cto confine the term \u2018quasi-corporation\u2019 to organizations not strictly corporations at all, and to designate as \u2018quasi-municipal\u2019 those organizations that are deemed corporations but which are held not municipal corporations . . . .\u201d 1 E. McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev. 2010) \u00a7 2:17, pp. 202-203. \u201cWhat is meant by the words <em>\u2018quasi </em>corporation,\u2019 as used in the authorities, is not always very clear. It is a phrase generally applied to a body which exercises certain functions of a corporate character, but which has not been created a corporation by any statute, general or special.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>School District </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>103 U.S. 707, 708, 26 L. Ed. 601 (1881).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The concept of legal capacity to sue or be sued is also the subject of confusion in the law. There is suiprisingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>little Connecticut jurisprudence on the subject at the appellate level. Superior Court decisions have largely considered two factors: (1) whether the entity in question is a distinct \u201cbody politic\u201d under state law, and (2) whether a specific statute enables the entity to sue and be sued. <em>Luysterborghs </em>v. <em>Pension &amp; Retirement Board, </em>50 Conn. Sup. 351, 355, 927 A.2d 385 (2007) (citing Superior Court authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Although the Superior Court authorities just cited are entitled to respect, their approach, thus summarized, raises three distinct problems. First, the cited factors will not necessarily point in the same direction in a given case. An entity could be a \u201cbody politic\u201d and yet not the subject of a \u201cspecific statute\u201d enabling it to sue and be sued. (As discussed below, this is arguably the case here.) Conversely, the legislature could, at least hypothetically, pass a statute specifically allowing an entity other than a \u201cbody politic\u201d to sue and be sued. Second, the existing approach is in tension with serious issues of public policy long articulated in the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court and the reviewing courts of sister states. Third, the cited approach overlooks General Statutes \u00a7 52-73 and the centuries of Connecticut jurisprudence construing that ancient statute. For these reasons, the legal issue of the capacity to sue and be sued must be examined more deeply.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The New York Court of Appeals has helpfully divided this concept into three separate analytical categories:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u201cCapacity, or the lack thereof, sometimes depends purely upon a litigant\u2019s status. A natural person\u2019s status as an infant, an adjudicated incompetent or, formerly, a felony prisoner, for example, could disqualify that individual from seeking relief in court ....</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u201cAnother category of capacity problems . . . arises in the context of suits brought by artificial entities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Business corporations, for example, are creatures of statute and, as such, require statutory authority to sue and be sued ....</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cGovernmental entities created by legislative enactment present similar capacity problems. Being artificial creatures of statute, such entities have neither an inherent nor a common-law right to sue. Rather, their right to sue, if it exists at all, must be derived from the relevant enabling legislation or some other concrete statutory predicate .... The principle is a well-known one, originating in the more general canon that \u2018a creature of the State . . . has no power other than that given it by the Legislature, either explicitly or by necessary implication\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Community Board </em>7 v. <em>Schaffer, </em>84 N.Y.2d 148, 155-56, 639 N.E.2d 1, 615 N.Y.S.2d 644 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Water pollution control authorities in Connecticut fall within the third <em>Community Board 7 </em>category. Although they are \u201cquasi-municipal corporations,\u201d and, as such, bodies politic within the confines of larger municipal corporations; <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Bontatibus, </em>145 Conn. 570, 576, 145 A.2d 133 (1958); they remain artificial creatures of statute. As such, their capacity to sue or be sued, if it exists at all, \u201cmust be derived from the relevant enabling legislation . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Community Board 7 </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>supra, 84 N.Y.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">This capacity \u201cdoes not require that in every instance there be express legislative authority .... Rather, the capacity to sue [and be sued] may also be inferred as a necessary implication from [the entity\u2019s] power[s] and responsibilities], provided, of course, that there is no clear legislative intent negating review . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The court must consequently conduct a careful review of the relevant legislation governing the Authority in the present case. The Authority is established by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Branford Code \u00a7 106-1, which gives it all of the powers set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 7-246 et seq. It is common ground that neither the Branford Code nor the Connecticut General Statutes <em>explicitly </em>grant the Authority the legal capacity to sue or be sued. The question is whether such capacity can fairly be implied from the relevant legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Section 7-246 (a) provides that any municipality may \u201ccreate a new board or commission to be designated, as the water pollution control authority for such municipality. ...\u201d As mentioned, the Town of Branford has chosen to create the Authority pursuant to this provision. Branford Code \u00a7 106-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The only <em>eacplicit </em>statutory provision addressing the capacity to sue or be sued grants the capacity to sue to the <em>municipality </em>rather than to the water pollution control authority. General Statutes \u00a7 7-258 (a) provides that, in the event of a delinquent charge for connection with or the use of a sewerage system, \u201cThe municipality may recover any such charges in a civil action against any person liable therefor. ...\u201d Section 7-258 (a) does not purport to address the question of capacity to sue or be sued in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-250 grants water pollution control authorities the capacity to be parties in legal actions in the narrow context of administrative appeals of assessments. A successful administrative appeal does not render the defendant authority liable for monetary damages, and it is difficult to generalize from this provision that the legislature has conferred on the authority the capacity to be sued in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The enabling legislation is silent on the capacity of water pollution control authorities to sue or be sued in tort actions. The tort action in the present case, however, plainly arises out of the <em>operation </em>of a sewerage system. The legislature has addressed this aspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of the function of water pollution control authorities in General Statutes \u00a7 7-247 (a). That statute provides in relevant part that, \u201cAny municipality by its water pollution control authority may acquire, construct and operate a sewerage system or systems . . . .\u201d The term \u201coperate a sewerage system\u201d is a term of art, statutorily defined as meaning \u201cown, use, equip, reequip, repair, maintain, supervise, manage, operate and perform any act pertinent to the collection, transportation and disposal of sewage . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-245 (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Section 7-247 (a) thus provides that the entity responsible for the operation of a sewerage system is \u201c[a]ny municipality by its water pollution control authority . . . .\u201d What exactly this Delphic phrase means must now be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The phrase \u201c[a]ny municipality by its water pollution control authority\u201d clearly means that the \u201cmunicipality\u201d may be viewed as the operator. Whatever a municipality\u2019s status may be with respect to questions of immunity, there is no doubt that it is an entity with the legal capacity to be sued. The \u201cmunicipality,\u201d however, acts through \u201cits water pollution control authority.\u201d This is, in essence, a relationship of principal and agent. It is a fair implication from this phraseology that the agent is also a recognizable legal entity with the legal capacity to sue and be sued. It would be anomalous for the legislature to create a principal with the capacity to sue and be sued and create an agent without that same capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Public policy issues of fundamental fairness must now be considered. The United States Supreme Court explained in the seminal case of <em>United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Coronado Coal Co., </em>259 U.S. 344, 42 S. Ct. 570, 66 L. Ed. 975 (1922), that the legal concept of capacity to sue and be sued cannot be determined by historical precedent and technical considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>alone. In holding that labor unions have the capacity to be sued under the Sherman Act, the Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u201cUndoubtedly at common law, an unincorporated association of persons was not recognized as having any other character than a partnership in whatever was done, and it could only sue or be sued in the names of its members, and their liability had to be enforced against each member. . . . But the growth and necessities of these great labor organizations have brought affirmative legal recognition of their existence and usefulness and provisions for their protection, which their members have found necessary. ... It would be unfortunate if an organization with as great power as this International Union has in the raising of large funds and in directing the conduct of 400,000 members in carrying on, in a wide territory, industrial controversies, and strikes out of which so much unlawful injury to private rights is possible, could assemble its assets to be used therein free from liability for injuries by torts committed in course of such strikes.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 385-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In determining the capacity of a party to sue and be sued in federal actions, the United States Supreme Court continues to follow the expansive approach of <em>Coronado Coal Co. </em>It has specifically explained that, for purposes of federal law, quasi-municipal corporations have the same capacity to be sued as full-fledged municipal corporations. \u201cWhile the liability of quasi corporations at common law may have differed from that of municipal corporations . . . both were treated equally as legal \u2018persons.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Cook County </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Chandler, </em>538 U.S. 119, 127 n.7, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 155 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The California Supreme Court has elaborated on the modem policy considerations underlying this development:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cWe must recognize that the society of today rests upon the foundation of group structures of all types, such as the corporation, the co-operative society, the public utility. Such groups must, of course, operate successfully within the society; one of the prerequisites to that functioning is, generally, liability to suit and opportunity for suit. To frustrate that viability by the imposition of outmoded concepts would be to impair the institutions as well as to impede the judicial process.\u201d <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Sanitarium Assn., Inc., </em>59 Cal. 2d 602, 608, 381 P.2d 652, 30 Cal. Rptr. 808 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">It is thus clear that, \u201c[o]n a national basis, the trend continues to assure legal status to organizations where in fairness it is appropriate.\u201d <em>Barr </em>v. <em>United Methodist Church, </em>90 Cal. App. 3d 259, 266, 153 Cal. Rptr. 322, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 973, 100 S. Ct. 468, 62 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1979). Although the Court\u2019s task in the present case is to determine whether the Authority\u2019s enabling legislation fairly implies the right to sue and be sued, this is a judicial task appropriately performed with reference to modem public policy. This Court draws a necessary implication, from the statutory scheme authorizing the Authority\u2019s creation and the fact that the Authority, by \u201coperating\u201d a sewerage system, has the ability to cause damage to the persons and property of our citizens, that the Authority should \u201cbe part of our legal fabric.\u201d <em>Beta Beta Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity </em>v. <em>May, </em>611 So. 2d 889, 894 (Miss. 1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">With these policy considerations in mind, a final provision of the Authority\u2019s enabling legislation must now be considered. Chapter 103 of the Connecticut General Statutes, establishing water pollution control authorities, contains a catchall provision, General Statutes \u00a7 7-271, which provides that, \u201cAny power granted by this chapter shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, any power granted to any municipality under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>provisions of any special act <em>or of any general </em>statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The emphasized words plainly empower the court to consider the attributes granted to water pollution control authorities by statutes outside the four comers of Chapter 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">One statute not contained in Chapter 103 is especially pertinent to the question presented here. Section 52-73 provides that, \u201cTowns, societies, communities and corporations may prosecute and defend civil actions, may appoint agents to appear in their behalf and may employ attorneys in such actions.\u201d This is an ancient statute, first enacted (in somewhat different form) in 1705. 4 Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut 500 (1868). It was given an expansive reading by our Supreme Court at an early date.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In <em>McLoud </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>10 Conn. 390 (1835), the Court considered a challenge to a judgment against a school district. The school district in that case had been successfully sued for breach of contract, and the prevailing party attempted to collect the judgment. The defendant argued that the school district had not had the capacity to be sued in the first place. Referring to the statute now codified at \u00a7 52-73, the Court resoundingly rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u201cIs a school district liable to be sued? Upon this point we entertain no doubt. That these corporations are capable of suing, and being sued, would seem to be strongly inferable, from the powers and privileges conferred upon them by the statute. They have power to erect school-houses, to purchase lands on which to erect them, to levy and collect taxes, to appoint treasurers and collectors, and to do all necessary acts, for the purpose of sustaining and regulating schools. They may, therefore, possess property, and may make contracts; and may not these contracts be enforced?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u201cIt has, however, been said, that these <em>quasi </em>corporations are not liable to be sued, unless the action is, expressly, given by statute; and in support of this proposition, a number of cases have been cited. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u201cIt may here be remarked, that the only principle involved in these cases, is, that a <em>quasis </em>corporation is not liable, at common law for the mere neglect of a corporate duty. But it does not therefore follow, that no action lies against them, unless it be given by statute. Let it once be admitted, (as, indeed, it must be admitted,) that these corporations have the power to make contracts, and there is an end of the question. For it, surely, would be a flagrant departure from all principle, to hold, that such contracts could not be enforced against them. A mechanic builds a school-house, in pursuance of a contract, entered into with the school-district. Could it be endured, that he might not sue on that contract, because an action was not given by statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u201cIt need only be added, that it has been the uniform practice, in this state, for individuals to enforce these contracts, by suits at common law against these <em>quasi </em>corporations.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 393-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The Supreme Court reaffirmed this expansive principle in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>County of Hartford, </em>12 Conn. 404 (1838). \u201c[Although the statute does not expressly authorize a suit by a <em>quasi </em>corporation, yet if the law of its creation imposes such duties and confers such privileges as require legal remedies for their enforcement and protection, it is fair to infer that those remedies are also granted. . . . This principle we believe to be a sound one.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 406-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Our Supreme Court has not revisited the question of the legal capacity of quasi-municipal corporations to sue and be sued in modem times. In practice, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>it has, in recent decades, decided the merits of a variety of actions brought by or against water pollution control authorities without questioning the capacity of such authorities to sue or be sued in the first place. See <em>Forest Walk, LLC </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 271 (administrative appeal brought against authority); <em>BUT General Corp. </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>265 Conn. 114, 826 A.2d 1109 (2003) (mandamus action brought against authority); <em>Water Pollution Control Authority </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>234 Conn. 488, 662 A.2d 124 (1995) (administrative appeal brought by authority); <em>Tower Business Park Associates No. 1 Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>213 Conn. 112, 566 A.2d 696 (1989) (administrative appeal brought against authority); <em>Zizka </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>195 Conn. 682, 490 A.2d 509 (1985) (action for injunctive and declaratory relief brought against authority); <em>Gaynor-Stafford Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>192 Conn. 638, 474 A.2d 752 (administrative appeal brought against authority), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 932, 105 S. Ct. 328, 83 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1984); see also <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sewer Commission, </em>270 Conn. 409, 853 A.2d 497 (2004) (mandamus action brought against sewer commission); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Woodridge Lake Sewer District, </em>218 Conn. 144, 588 A.2d 176 (1991) (action for declaratory judgment brought against sewer district); <em>Branford Sewer Authority </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>159 Conn. 421, 270 A.2d 546 (1970) (petition brought by sewer authority to assess damages for the taking of an easement).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><em>Third Taxing District </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>35 Conn. App. 795, 647 A.2d 32, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 936, 650 A.2d 173 (1994), relied upon by the Authority, is not in conflict with this case law. While the <em>named </em>plaintiff in <em>Third Taxing District </em>was indeed a \u201cquasi-municipal corporation\u201d; id.; the <em>actual </em>plaintiff \u201cconsisted] of a group of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>electors who reside[d] within the taxing district.\u201d Id., 796. <em>Third Taxing District </em>simply holds that the <em>actual </em>plaintiffs lack standing to bring what is, in essence, a taxpayer\u2019s suit in the name of the <em>named </em>plaintiff. It does not purport to discuss either \u00a7 52-73 or the capacity of quasi-municipal corporations to sue and be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">For reasons of precedent, policy, and practice \u00a7 52-73 is applicable to quasi-municipal corporations. By virtue of this statute, quasi-municipal corporations have the capacity to sue and be sued under Connecticut law. As mentioned, the same rule applies under federal law. <em>Cook County </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. </em>Chandler, supra, 538 U.S. 127 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">As mentioned, it is well established that water pollution control authorities are quasi-municipal corporations. <em>Forest Walk, LLC </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 281. The Authority is an entity of this description. As such, it has the capacity to be sued. The principal contention of the Motion To Dismiss must consequently fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">THE RECOGNIZANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The Authority\u2019s second (and admittedly secondary) contention is that \u201cthe writ/summons lacks a proper recognizance.\u201d This contention is based on the fact that the recognizance in the summons is neither filled out nor signed. Zahrijczuk concedes that the summons is defective in that it contains no recognizance. She relies, however, on <em>Franchi </em>v. <em>Farmholme, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 201, 207-208, 464 A.2d 35 (1983), for the proposition that a failure to provide recognizance does not render an action void ab initio. She notes that she voluntarily posted a cash bond by check in the amount of $250.00 prior to the return date. The Court agrees that, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Franchi, </em>it would be inappropriate to dismiss the action under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The Motion To Dismiss is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> The word \u201cquasi\u201d has been irreverently defined as, \u201cA word, used by lawyers when they cannot define their subject matter exactly; perhaps when they don\u2019t really know what they are talking about.\u201d J.
