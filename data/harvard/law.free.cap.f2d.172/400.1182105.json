The claim included sums representing compensation for earned but unused vacation time. The referee found that one-fourth of the amount claimed in lieu of vacation had been earned during the three months\u2019 period immediately preceding the bankruptcy, and to this extent he gave the claim a preferred position pursuant to \u00a7 64 sub. a (2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 104, sub. a(2). The remaining three-fourths of the amount representing earned vacation was allowed as a general claim only. This disposition was approved by the court on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-23\">The employees concerned were members of one or the other of two unions each of which had a collective bargaining agreement with the bankrupt. The vacation clause of one of these agreements provided that those who had been employed for one year or more were to receive a week\u2019s vacation with forty hours\u2019 pay, the vacation to be taken at a time mutually agreeable to the employee and the employer. The other bargaining agreement was substantially the same except that vacations were to be taken during July, August, or September, and except it provided that \u201cthere shall be no pro-rata vacation.\u201d While the record is sketchy and incomplete, it perhaps sufficiently discloses that the bankruptcy of the employer ensued shortly after the employees completed their year\u2019s eligibility period to qualify for vacation for the year 1946-47, and none had had his vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-24\">Section 64, sub. a (2) gives priority to \u201cwages, not to exceed $600 to each claimant, which have been earned within three months before the date of the commencement of the proceeding, due to workmen,\u201d etc. Appellant\u2019s contention is that the condition precedent to the earning of vacation pay by an employee under either collective bargaining agreement in effect here was the completion of a year\u2019s period of continuous service with the employer; and since the designated period of service was completed by each employee during the three months\u2019 period prior to bankruptcy, the entire vacation pay was then earned, hence the whole was entitled to priority status under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-25\">We think otherwise. Under the terms of the statute the compensation claimed must have been earned within the three months\u2019 period and also must be due.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>If any employee here had not, prior to bankruptcy, completed a year\u2019s continuous service no compensation for vacation time would have been due him, regard being had to the wage agreement. All having completed the required year\u2019s service prior to bankruptcy, vacation compensation may fairly be regarded as due even though the vacation was not to foe taken until some later time; but the vacation had been earned by the performance of the entire year\u2019s service, and only one-fourth of it earned during the three months preceding bankruptcy. We see no more justification for giving priority to vacation pay conditionally accruing prior to such three months\u2019 period than for giving priority to straight wages earned prior thereto. The proviso in one of the contracts (and the record does not show to which of the employees that contract pertains) that \u201cthere shall be no pro-rata vacation\u201d is of no help in determining how much of the vacation pay shall be allowed as a prior claim under the bankruptcy statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u25a0 The rule adopted below seems to us a fair principle to be followed. In re Public Ledger, 3 Cir., 161 F.2d 762; In re Wil-Low Cafeterias, Inc., 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 429; Kavanas v. Mead, 4 Cir., 171 F.2d 195. It approximates the wording and does no violence to the spirit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-14\"> In re Ko-Ed Tavern, 3 Cir, 129 F.2d 806, 810, 142 A.L.R, 357; In re Unit Lock Co., D.C., 49 F.2d 313, 315, 310; In re Caledonia Coal Co., D.C., 254 F. 742; In re McGowin Lumber Co,, D.C., 223 F. 553; In re Huntenburg, D.C., 153 F. 768; In re Dunn, D.C., 181 F. 701; In re Burton Bros.
