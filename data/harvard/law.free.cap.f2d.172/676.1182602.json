These were the facts. On April 13, 1943, bankrupt contracted with the War Department to build'a' number of ships; and on July 14, 1944, the Department cancelled the contract, leaving two ships uncompleted,' on which the bankrupt had\u2019 already received payments amounting to $126,468. On January 25, 1945, th\u00e9 bankrupt applied for a further payment of $50,000, and' certified that it had not received any \u201cprogress\u201d payments upon' the ships. The bankrupt received this sum, and on May 2, 1945, the parties settled for a total of $63,506.43, as \u201ctermination costs,\u201d which included the $50,000 already \u2019 paid. The balance \u2014 $13,-506.43 \u2014 the bankrupt received on'\u2019August 22, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-21\">\u2022 The\u2019 adjudication was on May 8, 1947, and on' May 20, 1947, the Assistant Comptroller General filed a claim for $117,587.85 made up of the overpayment of $126,468 less $8,880.15 conceded credits. To this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>claim the trastee objected on the ground that there were further credits which reduced it to $77,783.63, and that the United States owed, large sums to the bankrupt which should be set off against its claim. He also asked that the bankruptcy court should order the United States to, pay the balance after setoff. The claim came on before the referee for hearing at which the United States prayed leave to file an amended claim, and for leave to file a plenary suit against the bankrupt. It alleged that the settlement of the \u201ctermination claim\u201d had been fraudulent, because of the suppression of the earlier receipt of $126,468. It asked leave therefore to enlarge its claim by \u201cpenalties\u201d which had become due tmder \u00a7 231, of Title 31, aiid \u00a7 119, of Title 41 of the United States Code Annotated. The referee liquidated the original claim in accordance with two unexecuted agreements which had been prepared by officials of the War Department. He denied leave to the United States to file the proposed amended claim, because he held that the \u201cpenalties\u201d claimed were not provable -against the bankrupt under \u00a7 57, sub. j, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 93, sub. j, and because it was too late to amend the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">From this order the United States appealed, and the district judge reversed it, and sent hack the, proceeding with, directions to allow the United States to file the amended claim and to conduct a hearing upon it. Tt is from this order that the trustee has appealed. He only asks us to decide that the \u201cpenalties\u201d which the United States claims in its amended ..claim are in no part recoverable, because of \u00a7 57, sub. j. A majority of the court thinks it best not to pass upon that question on the present record, because, as it stands, it does not admit of a finding, one way or another, upon the issue of the bankrupt\u2019s fraud. Hence it may turn out that the question of law will prove moot, whether the \u201cpenalties\u201d in question are provable under \u00a7 57, sub. j, of the Bankruptcy Act. If the United States succeeds in proving the issue of fraud, that question is to be decided by the referee and after him by the district judge as a new question in disregard of anything heretofore decided either by- the bankruptcy court or by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
