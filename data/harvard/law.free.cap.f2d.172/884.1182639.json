There was testimony strongly tending to show that appellant was drunk when the acts were done. The court said in its charge to the jury: \u201cYou must find, before you can acquit the defendant Edwards, that the defendant was so intoxicated that she was incapable of forming an intent.\u201d We find no other language in the court\u2019s charge that seems to us to explain away the quoted statement. We think it erroneous. Incapacity need not be proved or found in order to entitle a defendant to an acquittal. It is true that no proof or finding of capacity is ordinarily necessary to support a conviction. But where a specific intent is essential to the crime charged, and evidence is introduced that might create a reasonable doubt whether the defendant was sober enough to be capable of forming this intent, the jury must be instructed to acquit if they have such a doubt.
