Bartkoski, brought suit under the Federal Safety Appliance Act and the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A. respectively \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. and 51 et seq., against The Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Company to recover damages resulting from, the death of her husband in the course of his employment by the defendant. The jury rendered a verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor in the sum of $100. She has appealed from an order of the court below denying her motion to set. aside the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">Bartkoski, an engineer, early on the morning of July 26, 1944 began a switching operation in the defendant\u2019s Pittsburgh yards, pushing a string of freight cars in an easterly direction, his engine, however, facing west and moving backward. The end car of Bartkoski\u2019s train collided with the nearest of a string of freight cars standing at rest in the yard. Bartkoski\u2019s train was moving at the rate of five f'o eight miles an hour and rebounded some feet from the point of collision. Sheridan, a yard helper, stated that the end car of Bartkoski\u2019s train was \u201c * * * damaged pretty bad <em>* * *\u201d by </em>the collision and that the train had rebounded \u201cabout two truck lengths\u201d, viz., about ten feet. Bartkoski had been sitting upon the engineer\u2019s box seat with his body twisted toward the rear of the locomotive so that he could see in the direction of the train\u2019s movement. Immediately after the collision Bernhardt, Bartkoski\u2019s fireman, saw him standing on the floor of the engine before the fire box with his face in his hands. He assisted Bartkoski to a seat on a ledge in the cab. Bartkoski complained about his nose. After the accident Bartkoski and Bernhardt continued to work for about seven hours until the end of their shift, 8:00 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">The plaintiff\u2019s theory as to how her husband had sustained the injuries which resulted in his death is as follows: Bartkoski\u2019s death resulted from abdominal injuries incurred when he was thrown by the impact of the collision against the valves and levers in his locomotive cab; that the blow to his abdomen excited a pre-existent nonmalignant tumor into cancer from which he died. The defendant admitted negligence but denied that Bartkoski\u2019s death resulted from the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">The primary dispute between the parties arises from certain offers of proof made by the administratrix. These fall into six categories: (1) an offer to prove by her own testimony statements made by her husband to her upon his return from work on the morning of the accident as to how he was injured; (2) an offer to prove the existence of bruises upon Bartkoski\u2019s body by her own testimony, by that of her son-in-law, by that of a doctor, and by that of a nurse at the South Side Hospital where Bartkoski died; (3) an offer to prove Bartkoski\u2019s antecedent good physical health by the testimony of the family physician'; (4) an offer to prove by another doctor, a cancer specialist, that on July 26, 1944 a nonmalignant tumor existed in Bartkoski\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>body near the site of the bruises on his abdomen, and that the trauma of the accident excited this tumor so that it became malignant causing Bartkoski\u2019s death; (5) an offer to show by records of the South Side Hospital Bartkoski\u2019s physical condition from the time of his admission until his death; and (6) the bills of the hospital and doctors during Bartkoski\u2019s last illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">The defendant objected to these offers on several grounds only two of which require discussion herein. The first objection was that all the testimony offered was irrelevant in that it would not tend to prove that Bartkoski\u2019s death had been caused by the accident. The second objection, going only to the administratrix\u2019 offer to prove by her husband\u2019s statements to her how the accident occurred ((1) supra), was that the proffered testimony was prohibited as hearsay. The plaintiff attempts' to meet the defendant\u2019s first objection by the assertion that the proof offered by her is relevant and material and therefore should have been admitted. She attempts to meet the second by asserting that Bartkoski\u2019s statements to his wife were sufficiently close in time to the accident and so intimately connected therewith as to be part of the res gestae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">The court below rejected all the offers in toto. The effect of these rulings was to put the plaintiff in such a position that she could claim damages only for the injuries to her husband\u2019s nose. The court so charged the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This accounts for the amount of the verdict. But under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act the defendant was liable in damages for Bartkoski\u2019s death if it resulted \u201cin whole or in part\u201d from the defendant\u2019s negligence. Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., 319 U.S. 350, 352-353, 63 S.Ct. 1062, 87 L.Ed. 1444; Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., 335 U.S. 520, 69 S.Ct. 275.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff was entitled to show facts from which the jury could infer that Bartkoski\u2019s death resulted from the bruise to his abdomen, resulting from the collision, which excited a previous non-malignant tumor into cancer. The offers of evidence, supra, (2) to (5) inclusive, were pertinent to the issue whether Bartkoski\u2019s death resulted in whole or in part from the accident and, in addition to the evidence already admitted, would have proved the plaintiff\u2019s case, if the jury found the evidence credible. See the Bailey case, supra, 319 U.S. at page 354, 63 S.Ct. at page 1064, 87 L.Ed. 1444. The hospital records, item (5), supra, clearly fell within the Federal Shop Book Act, \u00a7 695 of former Title 28 (now Section 1732 of Title 28 United States Code) and were relevant to the inquiry as to the cause of Bartkoski\u2019s death. Nor is there any doubt that evidence as to what a patient has told a doctor for the purposes of medical treatment is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. United States v. Calvey, 3 Cir., 110 F.2d 327, 330. If, as we conclude, the evidence offered with that already in the case was sufficient to enable the jury to find that Bartkoski\u2019s death resulted as the plaintiff contends, the physicians\u2019 and hospital bills designated as item (6) supra, were admissible to prove damage. The court below was in error in rejecting the offers designated as (2) to (6) inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">We agree with the court below that the testimony offered by the plaintiff, under item (1) supra, what Bartkoski said to his wife as to how he was injured, is inadmissible. The accident took place about 1:00 a. m. on July 26. Bartkoski\u2019s statements to his wife were made some seven or eight hours later. As was said in Lavender v. Kurn, 327 U.S. 645, 654, 66 S.Ct. 740, 744, 90 L.Ed. 916, \u201cRulings on the admissibility of evidence must normally be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge in actions under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act.\u201d Under the circumstances of the instant case we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting this offer. See Wigmore on Evidence, Volume VI, 3d Ed., \u00a7 1746.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">Since a new trial will be ordered the question raised by the affidavits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>plaintiff and her counsel respecting the report made by Bartkoski to the defendant at the close of his day\u2019s run, need not be passed on in this opinion. No other questions raised by the parties require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1057-7\"> Tiie court charged the jury in this regard as follows: \u201cYou are not to consider this ease from any standpoint as to injuries which resulted to this deceased except as to the broken nose. You will award damages to Mm for that amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1057-14\"> No. 54, October Term, 1948, decided January 3, 1949.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
