An arcuate clip formed of flat strip material is secured to the back of the frame, the clip extending through an arc of about three quarters of a circumference and being adapted to be clipped around a lipstick.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The design -patent to Hambaugh shows an ornament which is provided with a clasp in the form of two arcuate flat members extending from the back of the ornament and adapted to extend partially around the object to which the ornament is to be secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The patent to Zaldo discloses an octagonal vanity case designed to be secured about the wrist by a bracelet and having a mirror in its cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The patent to Wolfe shows a wrist mirror of approximately rectangular shape mounted in a frame. A flat strap extends from each of the two longer sides of the frame and is adapted to be placed around the wrist and secured together to hold the mirror in place, with the back of the frame against the wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The appealed claim was rejected' on the patent to Wolfe in view of the patent, to Hambaugh on the ground that it would not require invention to replace the wrist strap of the former patent by \u00e1 clasp of the type shown by the latter. Such a substitution clearly would not amount to invention since clasps and straps are recognized equivalents for securing various objects in place. The suggested substitution \u2022 would not produce the identical article shown by appellant, but the similarity would be so close that there would clearly be no patentable difference,</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">In order to warrant the issue of a design patent, the design must not only be new, original, and ornamental, but also must involve invention over the references. See In re Faustmann, 155 F.2d 388, 33 C.C. P.A., Patents., 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">The fact that appellant\u2019s article is applied to a lipstick, whereas the disclosure in the patent to Wolfe is applied to the wrist, is not material so far as the question of patentability of the design is concerned. Patentability of a design cannot be predicated on size or utility. See Tyler v. St. Amand, 17 App.D.C. 464, 1901 C. D. 301; In re Joseph Eifel, 35 F.2d 70, 17 C. C.P.A., Patents, 582; .and In re Patrick P. La Montagne, 55 F.2d 486, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents; 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">The record contains evidence of commercial success of appellant\u2019s article, but such evidence is of value only where the question of patentability is otherwise doubtful. If there \u2022 was any reasonable doubt as to the patentability of appellant\u2019s claim, commercial success of appellant\u2019s design would be of material consideration. Having no such doubt, commercial success should not be given such consideration. See In re Day, 118 F.2d 352, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1002, and In re Thayer, 159 F.2d 742, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">We have given careful consideration to the arguments presented by counsel for appellant but are of opinion that appellant\u2019s design does not involve invention in view of the disclosures in the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
