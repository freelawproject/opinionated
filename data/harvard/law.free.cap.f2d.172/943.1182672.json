The defendant \u2014 appellant herein \u2014 is the publisher of several newspapers in Springfield, Massachusetts. The complaints were consolidated in the district court and referred to a master. The master\u2019s report, one of exceptional thoroughness and clarity, was in all respects confirmed by the district judge, who filed only a brief memorandum. Judgments were entered for plaintiffs on June 22, 1948, .in accordance with the master\u2019s report. Republican Publishing Company appealed from these judgments, and this court ordered that the two appeals be docketed as a single case upon a consolidated transcript of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">The district judge pointed out that by agreement of the parties the testimony had not been stenographically reported. \u201cTherefore\u201d, he said, \u201cI am largely confined to considering whether the report is internally consistent -and whether there are errors of law. \u2022 It is not open to me to determine whether the evidence supports the findings.\u201d On appeal, the scope of review in this court is similarly restricted. We have examined the master\u2019s report, and have satisfied ourselves that his findings of fact fully support his conclusions of law respecting the points pressed by appellant on this appeal. In the proceedings below, reference was made to the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 84, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 251 et seq. However, at the ora! argument before us, appellant\u2019s counsel expressly disclaimed any reliance upon the provisions of this Act, and. we have accordingly not taken it into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">We think this appeal is lacking in substance. One point, relating to plaintiff Annette Doyle, is perhaps worthy of brief comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">Miss Doyle was originally hired as a proofreader. In September, 1941, she was promoted to the editorial staff as a reporter, covering social agencies and general assignments. Later, in April, 1942, \u201cshe took over the labor and industry beat, and on February 22, 1944 was assigned the job of theater editor in addition to her other duties.\u201d Originally she worked a basic 45-hour week, and after October 15, 1945, she went on a six-day 40-hour week. During all this period she was paid a flat weekly salary, which was $20 at the start, and was gradually increased to a top of $50 per week beginning August 8, 1946. The master found: \u201cThere is no doubt from the testimony of the defendant that she was considered one of the ablest and most conscientious reporters on the staff and that she could always be depended on to finish her job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">The responsibility of Miss Doyle as theater editor extended to seeing that new moving pictures and plays were covered by someone, not necessarily by her. In computing her hours worked, for the purpose of determining the amount of overtime pay due under the statute, the master included, in addition to her basic regular workweek, the hours spent by her in the theaters, seeing the pictures or plays which were personally reviewed by her for the newspaper. Appellant objects to the inclusion of these extra hours in the computation of 'hours actually worked by. Miss Doyle, because it was the policy of the paper not to pay for this work, well understood by Miss Doyle when she took the extra assignment of theater editor.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">On this point the master made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">\u201cWith reference to this aspect of Miss Doyle\u2019s overtime claim it should be added that the defendant had never compensated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>members of its staff for reviewing movies or legitimate stage productions. Indeed a specific proposal sometime during this period to pay $1 for each review was vetoed by the executive editor. Despite this policy the incidental benefits of free passes, parties, Christmas gifts from the theatres, etc., made the position of theatre editor so attractive that at least up until the war years there was active bidding for it among the staff. The evidence is strong that Miss Doyle\u2019s assignment to the job in 1944 was at her own request, although she was well aware of the practice of the paper with regard to compensation for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">\u201c * * * There is no doubt that the defendant considered the job as a plum to be handed out to deserving reporters rather than as an assignment to work. There is also no doubt that Miss Doyle was aware of this attitude. The defendant contends therefore that her assumption of the duties was a purely voluntary act and that there is no obligation on its part to pay her anything let alone time and a half. Section No. 203 of the Act defines \u2018to employ\u2019 as including to suffer or permit to work. Hence the crucial question is not whether the work was voluntary, but rather whether the plaintiff was in fact performing services for the benefit of the employer with the knowledge and approval of the employer. Under the circumstances here, to pose the question is to answer it. And a contract to pay nothing for work stands in no better light under the Act -than a contract to pay below the minimum wage. I conclude that the time she spent in the role of critic is working time under the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">We think that the master ruled correctly in this matter. The theater editor could not very well write a review of a picture or play without seeing it; and therefore her attendance at the theater for this purpose must be deemed physical or mental exertion ^whether burdensome or not) controlled cvr required by the employer, and \u201cpursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business.\u201d See Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Local No. 6167, 1945, 325 U.S. 161, 164-165, 65 S.Ct. 1063, 1066, 89 L.Ed. 1534. Consequently, these hours must be included in the workweek, and compensated at the statutory rate, despite any custom or understanding to the contrary. Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co. v. Muscoda Local, 1944, 321 U.S. 590, 602, 64 S.Ct. 698, 88 L.Ed. 949, 152 A.L.R. 1014. See also Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 1946, 328 U.S. 680, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., 1947, 330 U.S. 148, 67 S.Ct. 639, 91 L.Ed. 809; and Rogers v. Schenkel, 2 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 596, are in no way contrary to our conclusion in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The Portland Terminal case involved the question whether certain \u201ctrainees\u201d were \u201cemployees\u201d of the railroad within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 206, 207, and the court held they were not. In the footnote we quote a portion of the Court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In Rogers v. Schenkel, the plaintiff and defendant had been friends, and after the plaintiff had received a 4-F Selective Service classification he took a job as helper in defendant\u2019s plant so as to assist in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>some way in the war effort. He had independent means and intended to render his services without compensation. On several occasions when the defendant asked him to turn in a weekly report of time worked, the plaintiff stated that his services were voluntary and that he would not accept wages in any 'form. Plaintiff refused to be placed upon the defendant\u2019s payroll because he did not wish to be listed as an employee. Notwithstanding this, the plaintiff had a change of heart and eventually brought suit under the Fair Labor Standards Act for the statutory minimum wages and liquidated damages. He recovered judgment in the district court on the ground that he was an employee within th.\u00ab meaning of the Act, since the defendant had suffered or permitted him to work in defendant\u2019s business. The court of appeals reversed upon the authority of Walling v. Portland Terminal Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">By way of contrast with the cases just cited, Annette Doyle was undoubtedly an employee of appellant \u201cwhose employment contemplated compensation\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 7(a) of the Act, she was entitled\u2019to be compensated at one and one-half times her regular rate of pay for the hours worked in each workweek in excess of 40 hours. Miss Doyle\u2019s attendance at the theaters for the purpose stated fulfilled \u201call three of the essential elements of work\u201d as set forth in the Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co. and Jewell Ridge cases, supra, and the time so spent must be included in the computation of hours worked. The statute overrides any custom or \u2019understanding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Section 16(b) of the Act provides that, in addition to the recovery of unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation, the court in such action shall \u201callow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.\u201d The\u2019district court in the present case awarded a counsel fee of $3000 \u201cnot including any compensation for any future work on any appeal that may be taken.\" This court will, allow to the appellees as a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for the proceedings on appeal the sum of $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with the addition of $400 for attorney\u2019s fee in this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-6\"> 330 U.S. at page 152, 67 S.Ct. at page 641, 91 L.Ed. 809: \u201cSection 3(g) of the Act defines \u2018employ\u2019 as including \u2018to suffer or permit to work\u2019 and \u00a7 3(e) defines \u2018employee\u2019 as \u2018any individual employed by an employer.\u2019 The definition \u2018suffer or permit to work\u2019 was obviously not intended to stamp all persons as employees who, without any express or implied compensation agreement, might work for their own advantage on the premises of another. Otherwise, all students would be employees of the school or college they attended, and as such entitled to receive minimum wages. So also, such a construction would sweep under the Act each person who, without promise or ex-pectaci\u00f3n of compensation, but solely for liis personal purpose or pleasure, worked in activities carried on by other persons either for their pleasure or profit. But there is no indication from the legislation now before us that Congress intended to outlaw such relationships as these. \u2018File Act\u2019s purpose as to wages was to insure that every person whose employment contemplated eomiiensation should not be compelled to sell his services for less than the prescribed minimum wage. The definitions of \u2018employ\u2019 and of \u2018employee\u2019 are broad enough to accomplish this. But, broad as they are, they cannot be interpreted so as to make a person whose work serves only his own interest an employee of another person who gives him aid and instruction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b994-20\"> See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
