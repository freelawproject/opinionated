Imperiale v. Perkins, 62 App. D.C. 279, 66 F.2d 805; Kabadian v. Doak, 62 App.D.C. 114, 65 F.2d 202; Sibray v. United States, 3 Cir., 185 F. 401. Petitioner contends that \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009, authorizes review by means of this petition to review, even though he is not now in custody. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit so held in United States ex rel Trinler v. Carusi, 166 F.2d 457. But we need not decide this question, for, even if this form of review is permissible, the petition is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">Petitioner argues that the deportation proceeding was improper because \u201cthe only hearing accorded to petitioner was the hearing by the prosecuting inspector, contrary to the regulations as set forth.\u201d By this he means that the same inspector acted as both investigator and hearing examiner \u2014 examining petitioner on behalf of the Immigration Service and recommending deportation to the Commissioner. There was no independent presiding officer of the sort required where \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004(c) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">Assuming that the requirement of an independent presiding officer would otherwise apply, we find that there has been <em>no </em>violation of the Act in this case, for \u00a7 7(a) of the Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006(a), states: \u201cnothing in this act shall be deemed to supersede the conduct of specified classes of proceedings in whole or part by or be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>fore boards or other officers specially provided for by or designated pursuant to statute.\u201d We think this was such a proceeding, for the inspector is an officer \u201cspecially provided for by or designated pursuant to statute,\u201d that is, by \u00a7 16 of the Immigration Act of 1917, 39 Stat. 874, 885-886, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152. That statute declares : \u201cThe inspection * * * of aliens, including those seeking admission or readmission to or the privilege of passing through or residing in the United States, and the examination of aliens arrested within the United States under this Act, shall be conducted by immigrant inspectors * * inSpec|ors are empowered to administer oaths, take evidence and have books and records produced for inspection. Although \u00a7 16 deals primarily with exclusion, this provision applies to examination of all aliens arrested within the United States under the Act, which covers deportation as well as exclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The procedure in the case at bar corresponded to that required by \u00a7 16, and accordingly falls under the exception in \u00a7 7-(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, as \u201cspecially provided for by or designated pursuant to statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-31\"> Graham v.
