The Tax Court sustained the action of the Commissioner, and the taxpayer has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The taxpayer is a corporation of Wisconsin and claims to operate as a cooperative association under the laws of that state. It was engaged in the buying and selling of butter and in the buying and processing of butterfat. The taxpayer\u2019s patrons consisted of producers of butterfat, of whom some were stockholders of the association and some were not. Stock dividends not to exceed five per cent had previously been declared by the association but no consideration had been given to a distribution to patrons until 1943. In its tax return for 1943, the taxpayer showed \u25a0 a gross income of $63,383.45 and claimed deductions of $62,794.04, which included the sum of $5,088.55 which the association had set up in 1943 as a \u201cPatrons\u2019 Equity Reserve.\u201d The reserve was set up for the butterfat patrons, whether stockholders or not. It is the amount of additional tax resulting from the disallowance of the deduction from gross income of this $5,088.55 which has given rise to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">It is the taxpayer\u2019s contention that this sum was always the property of its patrons, derived from net proceeds which were required by the statute of Wisconsin<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be distributed annually, and therefore the sum should never have been included in the gross income of the taxpayer. The statute provides that \u201cthe directors * * * shall apportion the net proceeds of the business at least once annually * *</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">What part of those proceeds belonged as a matter of right to the patrons ? What part, if any, should go to the patrons rested in the discretion of the board of directors or a majority of the stockholders. Pearson v. Clam Falls Co-op. Dairy Ass\u2019n, 243 Wis. 369, 374, 10 N.W.2d 132, 134. Until distributed, it all belonged to the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">Since the taxpayer had at the beginning of 1943 accumulated a surplus of $25,430.-53, the directors obviously had not distributed annually all the net proceeds except in the sense that they were recognized as surplus. This, of course, is not a showing that the net proceeds were the patrons\u2019 property. When the taxpayer\u2019s board of directors came to make a distribution on December 14, 1943, after declaring a five per cent stock dividend it resolved:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">\u201c * * * that all the remaining net income for said fiscal year is hereby distributed among the patrons of this association, both members and nonmembers, in the form of patrons equity reserve, in proportion to the monetary value of the dairy products delivered to the association during said fiscal year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">The statute contemplates that such patron dividends shall be paid in cash or stock. Section 185.16, Wis.Stat.1943. This so-called patrons\u2019 equity reserve was set up on the books, and certificates to patrons were issued against it. These certificates could not be converted into cash or stock to be paid out of the reserve in any event. Instead, the certificates provided that the holder had \u201ca conditional equitable interest\u201d in the reserve and if \u201cin the opinion of the Board of Directors of said Association the cash reserves are greater than are reasonably necessary for sound financing of the Association\u201d such excess cash may be used to pay off these \u201cconditional equitable interests\u201d in the patrons\u2019 equity reserve. On the other hand, if the association had a loss, the directors might apply the patrons\u2019 reserve in its entirety to meet that loss. The certificates were transfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>able only on the books of the association and drew interest only if the directors so ordered. The debts of the association were prior to. this reserve, and finally, upon liquidation of the association, if there were any of these so-called \u201cconditional equitable interest\u201d certificates in existence, they did not even stand above the rights of the .common stockholders but had to share whatever was left, after payment of debts, with those stockholders. The certificates were issued pursuant to an amendment of the bylaws made at the annual' stockholders\u2019 meeting on February 2, 1944, at which meeting the resolution establishing the patrons\u2019 equity reserve made on December 14, 1943, was ratified and approved and the bylaws amended to set forth the limitations that were incorporated in the certificates as indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">It is clear; from the foregoing that instead of this patrons\u2019 equity reserve belonging to the patrons, it never left the control of the association which continued to treat it as its own. Its creation lay within the absolute discretion of the taxpayer\u2019s directors or stockholders and after creation, its continued existence was wholly at the will of the taxpayer\u2019s directors. This reserve never belonged to the patrons. It was and always remained the property of the taxpayer and was properly included by the Commissioner in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-20\"> Section 185.16 (1), Wis.Stat.1913.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
