As the case developed below, the defendant relied mainly on three defenses, all of which were ultimately upheld. The defense that the plaintiff was an exempt executive under \u00a7 13(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a)(1), was found in defendant\u2019s favor by a special verdict of a jury upon a trial to it. Thereafter the court determined as a matter of law that the plaintiff was also exempt as an \u201cemployee engaged in any retail or service establishment the greater part of whose selling or, servicing is in intrastate commerce,\u201d under \u00a7 13(a)(2), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a)(2), and that the defendant was not \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d within the meaning of the Act, \u00a7\u00a7 6-8, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 206-208. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the resulting judgment of dismissal of the complaint brings these rulings before us for review. It should be noted that the sustaining of any one of these defenses would prevent recovery by the plaintiff. Nevertheless we are constrained to reverse because we think the court was seriously in error in construing the statute, resulting in submission of the case to the jury under an erroneous charge and incorrect rulings on the two points of law separately decided by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Defendant leases and operates three interconnected buildings on Fifth Avenue in New York City for use as a retail store and for the custom manufacture of women\u2019s clothing. An associated enterprise, Bergdorf &amp; Goodman Fur Corporation, occupies part of one floor on the premises, where it manufactures furs and fur garments. Plaintiff was employed by defendant as an engineer in its maintenance and building service to operate the building and maintain the equipment, including the manufacturing equipment. Of the Company\u2019s more than $5,000,000 annual gross sales during the period in suit approximately 40 per cent was shipped to out-of-state customers. The annual gross sales of goods manufactured by the Company on the premises amounted to $800,000, of which approximately 45 per cent was shipped out of the state. The production of goods, an even smaller proportion of which is shipped across state lines, has long been held to constitute the production of goods for commerce within the meaning of the Act. Mabee v. White Plains Pub. Co., 327 U.S. 178, 66 S.Ct. 511, 90 L.Ed. 607. And a maintenance employee in an establishment \\vhere such goods are produced is engaged in the production of goods within the statutory definition of \u00a7 3(j), 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 203(j), since building maintenance work is considered to be an \u201coccupation necessary to the production\u201d of goods. Kirschbaum v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 86 L.Ed. 1638; Note, 55 Yale L.J. 421. This court has pointed out, in Bozant v. Bank of New York, 2 Cir., 156 F.2d 787, 789, that the limitation on coverage of maintenance employees applied in 10 East 40th St. Bldg. v. Callus, 325 U.S. 578, 65 S.Ct. 1227, 89 L.Ed. 1806, 161 A.L.R, 1263, was restricted to buildings where \u201cno actual physical manufacture went on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">So, also, the district court erred, in our judgment, in ruling that defendant\u2019s employees are exempted under the retail or service establishment exemption of \u00a7 13(a) (2). While at the time in question the greater part of the Company\u2019s selling was in intrastate commerce, nevertheless the ev <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>emption does not cover establishments also engaged in manufacturing. Roland Elec. Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657, 666, 66 S.Ct. 413, 417, 90 L.Ed. 383: \u201cIf read in connection with the declared purpose of the Act and in the light of its legislative history and administrative interpretation * * * the exemption reaches employees of only such retail or service establishments as are comparable to the local merchant, corner grocer or filling station operator who sells to or serves ultimate consumers who are at the end of, or beyond, that \u2018flow of goods in commerce\u2019 which it is the purpose of the Act to reach.\u201d Where a manufacturing department is on the same premises as a retail establishment where its products are sold, only the employees engaged in the retail department are exempt. Walling v. Goldblatt Bros., 7 Cir., 152 F.2d 475, certiorari denied 328 U.S. 854, 66 S.Ct. 1344, 90 L.Ed. 1627; Fred Wolferman, Inc., v. Gustafson, 8 Cir., 169 F.2d 759. And if the Company\u2019s manufacturing and selling activities cannot be separated for purposes of analysis, the exemption is altogether inapplicable. A. H. Phillips, Inc., v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 65 S.Ct. 807, 89 L.Ed. 1095, 157 A.L.R. 876; Armstrong Co. v. Walling, 1 Cir., 161 F.2d 515. The Company\u2019s operations are unlike those of the retail milk dealer near a \"state line, suggested in Roland Elec. Co. v. Walling, supra, as an example of the kind of exemption intended. It is more than incidentally engaged in interstate commerce; and in fact its manufacturing department' does not even take on a retail character, since \u201cno sales are made there and no direct contact is had with the customers.\u201d A. H. Phillips, Inc., v. Walling, 1 Cir., 144 F.2d 102, 106, affirmed 324 U.S. 490, 65 S.Ct. 807, 89 L.Ed. 1095, 157 A.L.R. 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Finally we must consider the claimed errors in the charge to the jury as to the exemption of \u00a713(a)(l) of \u201cany employee employed in a bona fide executive * * * capacity.\u201d This exemption assumed importance here because of defendant\u2019s evidence that plaintiff, a duly licensed engineer, wa.s \u201cchief engineer\u201d of defendant\u2019s concern, with extensive supervisory duties and control over a staff, with actual power to hire and fire. Plaintiff conceded that he performed \u201ccertain minor supervisory duties,\u201d but asserted that his \u201cprimary\u201d duty was the maintenance and mechanical repair of the building facilities and machinery \u2014 in fact that he worked in overalls for the major portion of his duties in actual manual labor. It is not necessary to rehearse the evidence here further than to point out how important became the issue as to the actual distribution of his time in his various duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In instructing the jury as to this exemption the court took note \u2014 as, indeed, it must, Schmidt v. Emigrant Indus. Sav. Bank, 2 Cir., 148 F.2d 294 \u2014 of the regulations established by the Administrator \u201cdefining and delimiting\u201d the term \u201cexecutive.\u201d 29 CFR, 1940 Supp. 541.1; 29 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 541.1. Six requirements are there enumerated, which must be satisfied in order to \u25a0 make the employee exempt. The last one states that such an employee must be one \u201c(F) whose hours of work of the same nature as that performed by nonexempt employees do not exceed 20 percent of the number of hours worked in the workweek by the nonexempt employees under his direction.\u201d In attempting to define the phrase \u201cwork of the same nature as that performed by nonexempt employees,\u201d the court charged: \u201cEven though the-plaintiff performed the work of a manual nature, if it were such that only he could do, being of a highly skillful or technical nature, then that work, even though it was manual, would not be of the same nature as that performed by other employees in the Building Department.\u201d This was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In Dolan v. Day &amp; Zimmerman, Inc., D.C.Mass., 65 F.Supp. 923, 934, the court pointed but that \u201cthe nonexempt work referred to in the regulation is not only the type of nonexempt work performed by employees under the direction of the employee in question. It is nonexempt work of any nature.\u201d After the decision in the Dolan case the Wage-Hour Administrator emphasized the holding by issuing a statement in which he said that \u201cthe court interpreted the term \u2018nonexempt work\u2019 in the regulations to mean nonexempt work of any na-</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ture and not solely the type of nonexempt \u2022work performed by employees under the foreman\u2019s direction. * * * These interpretations of the regulation are fully in accord with the position of the Divisions, according to the Administrator.\u201d 1946 Wage Hour Man. 105. Nonexempt work may be of a highly skilled or technical nature, as was the work of the operating engineers in McComb v. Utica Knitting Co., 2 Cir., 164 F.2d 670, or of the FCC-licensed \u201cradio engineer, first class,\u201d who was employed as chief radio engineer in Walling v. Sun Pub. Co, D.C.W.D.Tenn., 47 F.Supp. 180, 185, affirmed Sun Pub. Co. v. Walling, 6 Cir., 140 F.2d 445, certiorari denied 322 U.S. 728, 64 S.Ct. 946, 88 L.Ed. 1564. So if plaintiff performed no supervisory duties, but merely worked as one of several maintenance employees, the exemption would be inapplicable notwithstanding the skilled or technical nature of his activities. On the other hand, if much of his work was of the type which nonexempt skilled mechanics perform, but which, in this concern, only he performed, he still would not be exempt as the charge directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Thus the charge was damaging to the plaintiff as including within the tolerance limit of 20 per cent work of the kind which should not properly be so included. Since plaintiff duly excepted to this charge, it calls for a reversal as an inadequate and erroneous instruction for an appropriate special verdict. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 49(a), 28 U.S.C.A. As a matter of fact, this error was followed by a further manifest error, not objected to, as to the computation of the limitation of 20 per cent. For the court charged that the nonexempt hours were to be measured as a percentage of plaintiff\u2019s workweek, rather than of the workweek of the employees under his direction. (The correct interpretation is also pointed out in the Dolan case, and the Administrator\u2019s comments upon it, cited above.) Since plaintiff\u2019s workweek, as the jury found, averaged 70 hours, while that of his employees was 46, the difference is substantial, being that between 14 hours of nonexempt work before the exception became inapplicable under the charge, instead of 9 hours upon the facts as they appeared. Whether in view of the interconnection of the two parts of the definition attempted we should have ordered a reversal notwithstanding the absence of specific objection as required by Federal Rule 51, we need not decide; undoubtedly on a new trial care will be taken that this error also is not repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
