The real cause according to the claim, was the fault of the \u201cHanson\u201d in failing to recognize and comply with passing signals blown by the \u201cAhepa,\u201d which, because of a high wind, having elected the port side for reasons of safety, had signaled for a starboard to starboard passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-29\">The \u201cHanson\u201d and the other vessels denied this, and a great deal of evidence was taken orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-30\">Unfortunately for the appellant, here, the district judge, who heard all the witnesses orally, determined these issues flatly against it in findings of fact<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>conclusions of law <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which find, ample support in- the record, and the judgment must .be affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-19\"> \u201cFindings of Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-20\">\u201c(h) The collision occurred on the north side of the Channel, i. e.; north of the center line of the channel, where the \u2018H. Hanson\u2019 and her tow <em>should, have </em>\u00b0 <em>been and toere navigating </em>and where the \u2018Ahepa\u2019 and her tow <em>should not have been but were navigating. </em>There <em>is no </em>evidence here which I think excuses <em>v </em>justifies the \u2018Ahepa\u2019 and her tow navi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>'gating or being on the north side of the channel. They were negligent in being there.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">\u201c(c) I find that the Tug \u2018Ahepa\u2019 and those in charge of her were at fault and negligent in the following respects, which negligence was the proximate cause of the injury and damage to the Barge \u2018Walter Yott\u2019, the Barge \u2018RTC-93\u2019, and the Tug \u2018H. Hanson\u2019. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">\u201c(d) I find that neither the Tug \u2018H. Hanson\u2019 nor the Barge \u2018RTC-93\u2019, nor* those in charge of them, were in any way negligent in navigating or handling their respective vessels, and they were not at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-25\">\u201c(e) That as between the Tug \u2018Ahepa\u2019 and her tow, the Barge \u2018Walter Yott\u2019, I do not find that either the \u2018Walter Yott\u2019, or its owners were in any way negligent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-26\"> \u201cConclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-27\">\u201c1.

Hanson\u2019, the Barge \u2018R.TC-93\u2019, and the Barge \u2018Walter Yott\u2019 are entitled to recover their damages from the Tug \u2018Ahepa\u2019 and her owners and operators.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-28\"> Colvin v.
