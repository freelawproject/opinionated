The City of Dallas claims to have been aggrieved by the Administrator\u2019s determination to grant -such funds to the City of Fort Worth, and that we have jurisdiction, under Sections 309 and 1006 of 'the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and under the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pointing out that Sec. 309,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> invoked by peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tioner, contains no provision whatever for review, either here or elsewhere, and that Sec. 1006(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5expressly limits the review by the Circuit Court of Appeals provided for in it, to orders of the Authority (Board), the Administrator insists that nothing in the Civil Aeronautics Act supports the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Turning then to the review section of the Administrative Procedure Act, Sec. 1009,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he points to the precision with which it makes clear that agency action is reviewable only (1) by \u201cany special statutory review proceeding relevant to the subject matter in any court specified by statute\u201d; and (2) \u201cin the absence or inadequacy thereof, [by] any applicable form of legal action (including actions for declaratory judgment * * *) in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">No special statutory review proceeding, except Sec. 1006(a) is claimed by petitioner to exist. As has been pointed out above, that section deals only with orders of the Board. It makes no mention of review of determinations by the Administrator to furnish financial aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Petitioner is thus driven, by the absence of provisions for special statutory review, to the provisions of Sec. 1009, only to find that these provisions for review by \u201cany applicable form of legal action\u201d deal not with appellate court review but with review by an original action in a court of competent jurisdiction. The court of appeals is not such a court unless specially authorized by statutory grant of power.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are not in any doubt that this court has no such jurisdiction and that the petition must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">We need not, therefore, determine or even consider the Administrator\u2019s contentions that judicial review of his action may not he had in any court because (1) the controlling statute \u201cprecludes judicial review\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (2) that, if agency action, it is \u201cagency action by law committed to agency discretion\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-15\"> 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 459, and 646(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-16\"> 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1011, and particularly Sec. 1009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b170-17\"> \u201cIn the conduct of any public hearings or investigations authorized by this Act or by the Federal Airport Act, the Administrator or\" any duly designated examiner shall have the same powers to take evidence, issue subpenas, take depositions, and compel testimony as are vested in members of the Board and its duly designated examiners by section 1004 of this Act.
