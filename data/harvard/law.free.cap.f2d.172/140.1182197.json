The warrants were mailed on October 9, 1945 and would expire unless exercised on or before October 24, 1945. The defendant Dreyfus was an officer and director of the corporation and, as a stockholder of record, he received a large number of rights. Part of these rights he sold through a brokerage firm, realizing from the sale $5,915.14; part he exercised, receiving thereby 3,000 shares of common stock. Of the shares so acquired he made gifts of 1460 shares between November 12, 1945 and January 6, 1946. He received no consideration from any of the donees and none of them transferred any of the stock given them within six months from the date of the gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">The plaintiff is an owner of common shares who brought the present suit in behalf of the corporation after her request that it sue Dreyfus to recover his \u201cprofit\u201d had been refused. One count of the complaint seeks recovery of the sum realized by Dreyfus from his sale of rights; another seeks to compel him to account for the difference between the cost to him ($50 per share) of the shares given away and the market price on the Exchange on dates when the gifts were made. Both parties having moved for summary judgment on the pleadings and affidavits, the plaintiff\u2019s motion was denied and the defendants\u2019 motion granted. From the judgment of dismissal the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The appellant contends that a stockholder\u2019s receipt of rights, by virtue of the corporate \u2022 resolution was a \u201cpurchase\u201d of such rights within the intendment of \u00a7 16(b)., We think otherwise. The purpose of the section, as this court said in Park &amp; Tilford v. Schulte, 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 984, 987, certiorari denied 332 U.S., 761, 68 S.Ct. 64, was \u201cto protect the outside stockholders against at least short-swing speculation by insiders with advance information.\u201d \u201cInside\u201d information which the directors may have cannot possibly be used to the detriment of other stockholders in voting to grant rights to all stockholders of record in proportion to their existing holdings; all are treated equally. Their preemptive right to be offered the new stock and on equal terms inheres in their original shares and is essentially analogous to a stock dividend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cPurchase\u201d is not an apt word to describe the receipt by \u2022 a stockholder of shares representing a stock dividend or of warrants representing his preemptive right to subscribe for new shares. -Nor will the purpose of the statute be defeated by refusing so unusual a meaning to the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The appellant refers to section 3 (a) (13) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78c(a) (13), which defines \u201cpurchase\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AQY\">\u201cThe terms \u2018buy\u2019 and \u2018purchase\u2019 each include any contract to buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">But we do not think this definition aids . her contention. The popular or accepted import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The generally understood meaning of \u201cpur- ' chase\u201d is to acquire something by one\u2019s own act or agreement for a price. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dreyfus performed no act, made no agreement, paid no consideration for the receipt of his rights. The rights were not themselves a contract to acquire shares; they were mere offers by the corporation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which the offeree by acceptance could convert into contracts to purchase; but unless he did so, they remained mere offers. We agree with the district court that Dreyfus did not \u201cpurchase\u201d his rights on October 9th, and therefore his sale of some of them before their expiration on October 24th was not a transaction to which \u00a7 16(b) was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\"> The 3,000 shares acquired by the exercise of rights was a \u201cpurchase,\u201d and the question here is whether Dreyfus realized \u201cprofit\u201d from \u201cany purchase and sale\u201d when he made gifts of part of the purchased shares. Section 3(a) (14) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78c(a) (14), provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\u201cThe terms \u2018sale\u2019 and \u2018sell\u2019 each include any contract to sell or -otherwise dispose of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Certainly bona fide gifts, as these were conceded to be, are not within the accepted meaning of \u201csales\u201d; nor do they involve \u201cany contract to sell or otherwise dispose of\u201d the property given. In Park &amp; Tilford v. Schulte, 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 984, 987, we said that \u201cThe Act certainly applies as well to executed acquisitions as to executory contracts to acquire.\u201d But the acquisition there under consideration was one similar to a purchase. Schulte exercised an option to convert his preferred stock into common stock. Similarly, we would hold that the Act applies as well to executed dispositions as to executory contracts to dispose, provided the disposition is similar to a sale. But a bona fide gift is not a transaction similar to- a sale. Truncale v. Blumberg, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 80 F.Supp. 387, 389. Nor is it within the evil at which the statute was aimed. The statute authorizes the corporation to recover profits realized by \u201cinsiders\u201d from a \u201cshort swing\u201d transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tion. Whether recovery could tie had from either Dreyfus or his donee had the stock been sold within six months we need not say, but certainly so long as neither he nor his donee made any profit within six months period no unfair use of inside information, within the intendment of the statute, has occurred. It is plain that Dreyfus realized no profit by making the gifts. We see no justification for construing \u201cprofit realized from any purchase and sale\u201d to mean merely emotional gratification resulting from making the gift.

And unless we are to say rather arbitrarily that, since we must stop somewhere in a generous interpretation of the Congressional purpose, we shall stop right here, I do not think that this is a good place to draw the line. For the differences between these transactions and those already determined to be within the statute do not seem to me sufficient either logically or practically to justify a distinction here. Under the statute the term \u201csecurity\u201d includes the \u201cright to subscribe to or purchase\u201d stock, \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cpurchase\u201d each include a contract \u201cto buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire,\u201d and \u201csale\u201d and \u201csell\u201d each include a contract \u201cto sell or otherwise dispose of\u201d a security. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78c(a) (10), (13), (14). And \u201ccontract\u201d is broad enough to1 include an \u201cexecuted acquisition.\u201d Park &amp; Tilford, Inc. v. Schulte, 2 Cir., 160 F. 2d 984, 987, certiorari denied Schulte v. Park &amp; Tilford, Inc., 332 U.S. 761, 68 S.Ct. 64. 'fhe statutory language is therefore inclusive enough to reach these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">When we turn to the purpose of the legislation, to wring the profit out of short-swing transactions by insiders, I should think this same result was indicated. If \u25a0these transactions are without the scope of the Act, we have an area of considerable inducement to the insider to play for the short swing. When, indeed, the insider is a person of ample means and large public interests (as \u201cinsiders\u201d I fancy are prone to be), then the inducements here may be as substantial as, if not more so than, in the more prosaic cases heretofore decided. If one has at hand so ready a means of recompensing faithful personal service at home or in the office, or of making the ties of personal loyalty of company executive officers yet stronger than before, or, indeed \u2014though this case is not before us \u2014 of remembering bountifully one\u2019s favorite charities, I should think the necessity of doing so only through the use of the stock itself, instead of the money which might be realized therefrom, was one which could be accepted with considerable tranquility. So inside advance knowledge of an approaching issue of stock with grant of share-rights might point to the retention of stock already owned or the purchase of more, while the ordinary investor remains ignorant of the attractive possibilities about to open before him. In this instance, in fact, the gain is directly in money received on sale of the rights; if care must be taken to avoid direct subscription to the st6ck followed by sale \u2014 since that is within the statute under Park &amp; Tilford, Inc. v. Schulte, supra \u2014 yet that means simply a quicker return on a smaller investment. In all these instances the principle seems to me the same; the insider has an obvious and attractive advantage over others, unless all are held to be within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Of course computation of the amount of profit may be slightly more difficult than in the cases of direct purchase and sale. <em>But I cannot </em>see that it presents any insuperable difficulties. It seems to me but the ordinary task of valuing the security at its fair market price at the crucial dates of its acquisition and disposition. I would reverse and remand for that purpose here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
