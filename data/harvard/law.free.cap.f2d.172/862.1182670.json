It had, before the last war, fabricated electric plates that were to be used in connection with some of its coal and wood ranges, and had applied to them, as to its stoves and ranges, its trade-mark \u201cMajestic.\u201d The appellee had embodied the word \u201cMajestic\u201d in its corporate name since its incorporation in 1944. It manufactures and sells electric irons and toasters of the breakfast table type. It is a corporation wholly owned by the Dominion Electric and Mfg. Co., Inc., and its irons bear the mark \u201cDominion\u201d and on the bottom of the toasters the name \u201cDominion Electric and Mfg. Co.\u201d is stamped. When its appliances are shipped the master cartons bear the legend, \u201cFrom Majestic Electric Appliance Co., Inc., Gabon, Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-25\">Thus it will be seen that there is no specific competition between the parties, and we agree with the court below that the trade-mark is not original, arbitrary or fanciful and so a \u201cstrong mark\u201d coming within the principle of such cases as Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 407, L.R.A.1918C, 1039, certiorari denied 245 U.S. 672, 38 S.Ct. 222, 62 L.Ed. 540; Eastman v. Kodak Cycle Co., 15 R.P.C. 105; and France Milling Co., Inc., v. Washburn-Crosby Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 7 F.2d 304, certiorari denied 268 U.S. 706, 45 S. Ct. 640, 69 L.Ed. 1168, but raihet that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>calls for an application of the principle that where trade-marks are merely suggestive or descriptive they are weak marks affording protection to the owners only in the narrow and restricted field in which they have been applied. American Steel Foundries v. Robertson et al., 269 U.S. 372, 46 S.Ct. 160, 70 L.Ed. 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">As an additional reason for affirmance we note, and it is substantially conceded, that there was no proof of any confusion in the minds of customers as to the source of the products of the respective parties nor to develop a secondary meaning for the term \u201cMajestic\u201d as indicating appliances produced by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
