On March 18, 2010, he visited the ship\u2019s doctor who concluded that he was no longer able to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>duties of his job. Carnival then sent Montero to shore for further medical treatment, first in Mexico, then Miami, then Honduras, and finally Panama. In Panama, Montero was told that he needed major back surgery, which was performed on January 27, 2011. Montero contends that the surgery he received in Panama was medically unnecessary and did him more harm than good.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Montero filed suit against Carnival in Florida state court, asserting claims of Jones Act negligence, unseaworthiness, and maintenance and cure under maritime law. Carnival removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision contained in the \u201cSeafarer\u2019s Agreement,\u201d which is essentially the employment contract between Montero and Carnival. The district court granted the motion and ordered that the case be closed for administrative purposes. This is Montero\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">As an initial matter, Carnival contends that we lack jurisdiction because the district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration was a non-appealable interlocutory order, instead of an appealable final decision, because it did not dismiss Montero\u2019s claims. A \u201cfinal decision with respect to an arbitration\u201d is immediately appealable, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3), but an \u201cinterlocutory order ... compelling arbitration\u201d is not, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 16(b)(8).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A district court order directing that arbitration proceed and dismissing a plaintiffs claims, with or without prejudice, is \u201ca final decision with respect to an arbitration\u201d that is immediately ap-pealable. <em>Green Tree Financial </em>Carp.<em>Ala. v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 86-87, 121 S.Ct. 513, 519-20, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000) (dismissal with prejudice); <em>Hill v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2005) (dismissal without prejudice). By contrast, an order that compels arbitration but stays the proceedings is an interlocutory order that is not immediately ap-pealable. <em>Am. Express Fin. Advisors, Inc. v. Makarewicz, </em>122 F.3d 936, 939 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">In this case, the district court\u2019s order that compelled arbitration did not specifically state that Montero\u2019s claims were dismissed. It did state, however, \u201cthat for administrative purposes this case is hereby CLOSED.\u201d Notably, the district court\u2019s order did not stay the proceedings, nor did it contemplate any further action on this case. It effectively \u201cend[ed] the litigation on the merits and [left] nothing more for the [district] court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Green Tree, </em>531 U.S. at 86-87, 121 S.Ct. at 519. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order was a \u201cfinal decision with respect to an arbitration\u201d and we have appellate jurisdiction. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3); <em>Green Tree, </em>531 U.S. at 86-87, 121 S.Ct. at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Montero contends that the district court should not have compelled arbitration because the seafarer\u2019s agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>which contains the arbitration clause, had terminated before this dispute arose. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration. <em>Doe v. Princess Cruise Lines, Ltd., </em>657 F.3d 1204, 1213 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>applies if four jurisdictional prerequisites are satisfied: \u201c(1) there is an agreement in writing ...; (2) the agreement provides for arbitration in the territory of a signatory of the Convention; (3) the agreement arises out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered commercial; and (4) a party to the agreement is not an American citizen, or ... the commercial relationship has some reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.\u201d <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1294 n. 7. When the Convention applies, \u201ca court conducts a very limited inquiry\u201d when deciding a motion to compel arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 1294 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA district court must order arbitration unless (1) the four jurisdictional prerequisites are not met or (2) one of the Convention\u2019s affirmative defenses applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1294-95 (citation omitted). Affirmative defenses that apply in this context include where the agreement to arbitrate is \u201cnull and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\u201d <em>Bautista v. Star Cruises, </em>396 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Although Montero does not phrase his arguments in terms of the Convention\u2019s jurisdictional prerequisites or affirmative defenses, we take his argument to be that one or more of the affirmative defenses applies because the arbitration clause ceased to be effective when the agreement terminated and because this dispute falls outside the arbitration clause\u2019s scope. <em>See id. </em>(analyzing the plaintiffs arguments under the Convention\u2019s affirmative defenses even though the plaintiffs did not \u201carticulate their defenses in [those] terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Even though this dispute involves the Convention, which favors arbitration, the parties\u2019 intent controls. <em>See id. </em>at 1295 (\u201c[T]he Convention Act \u2018generally establishes a strong presumption in favor of arbitration of international commercial disputes.\u2019 \u201d). That is, we do not \u201ctwist the language of the contract to achieve a result which is favored by federal policy but contrary to the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>657 F.3d at 1214 (quoting <em>Goldberg v. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., </em>912 F.2d 1418, 1419-20 (11th Cir.1990)). To determine the parties\u2019 intent, we start with the language of the agreement. <em>See id. </em>The termination provision of the seafarer\u2019s agreement between Montero and Carnival states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">This Agreement shall automatically terminate without notice immediately upon Seafarer\u2019s unscheduled disembarkation of the assigned vessel if Seafarer disembarks the vessel for any reason, including but not limited to unscheduled personal leave, illness or injury, for more than one full voyage. This Agreement shall also terminate without notice immediately upon Seafarer being unfit or unable to serve in his or her stated position at the commencement of a new voyage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Under that language, the agreement terminated when Montero, before he was scheduled to do so, disembarked from the cruise ship to seek treatment for his back injury which was preventing him from doing his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The arbitration clause in the seafarer\u2019s agreement does not expressly state whether it survives the termination of that agreement, but the unambiguous language clearly contemplates that it does. It broadly provides that \u201cany and all disputes,\u201d other than certain wage disputes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\u201cshall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration,\u201d and it expressly includes disputes regarding the agreement\u2019s termination. Clearly the parties contemplated some circumstances in which the arbitration clause would survive termination of the agreement. And that makes sense because if it did not, there would be little room for the clause\u2019s operation. Montero would have us conclude that arbitration is not required if an employee brings a claim after the employment contract terminates. But that interpretation would allow an employee to avoid arbitration entirely by either disembarking from the ship ahead of schedule or waiting until his 10-month contract expires before he brings a claim. Such an interpretation would contradict the arbitration clause\u2019s broad language, as well as the Convention\u2019s policy in favor of arbitration. Accordingly, we conclude that the arbitration clause did not cease to be effective when Montero disembarked the vessel ahead of schedule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Montero contends that even if the arbitration clause survives the termination of the agreement, his claims fall outside its scope because they arise under the Jones Act, not the seafarer\u2019s agreement. As initial matter, we note that the arbitration clause, by its terms, is not limited to \u201cdisputes arising out of or in connection with [the seafarer\u2019s] agreement.\u201d It also requires arbitration of \u201cany and all disputes arising out of ... Seafarer\u2019s service on the vessel.\u201d Montero maintains that this language is not broad enough to encompass his suit, which he alleges arose out \u201cthe shoreside doctor\u2019s negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">We reject that argument. Montero\u2019s complaint raised four claims, two of which alleged Jones Act negligence, one of which alleged unseaworthiness, and one of which asserted a cause of action for maintenance and cure. But for Montero\u2019s service on the vessel, none of those claims would have been viable. <em>See Doe, </em>657 F.3d at 1220-21 (holding that claims arising under the Jones Act and allegations of \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d and \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d \u201care dependent on [the plaintiffs] status as a seaman employed by the cruise line and the rights that she derives from that employment status\u201d); <em>see also O\u2019Boyle v. United States, </em>993 F.2d 211, 213 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]n order to recover damages under the Jones Act, [a plaintiff] must have the status of a seaman.\u201d); <em>Hurst v. Pilings &amp; Structures, Inc., </em>896 F.2d 504, 505 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cThe Jones Act permits a seaman injured in the course of employment to bring an action against his employer for damages.\u201d); <em>Offshore Co. v. Robison, </em>266 F.2d 769, 781 (5th Cir.1959) (\u201cThe admiralty doctrine of absolute liability for unseaworthiness is based on protection of seamen who sign articles for a voyage and are then under the absolute control of a master with power to order seamen to do the ship\u2019s work in any weather, under any conditions, using such equipment as may be furnished by the shipowner.\u201d); <em>Flores v. Carnival Cruise Lines, </em>47 F.3d 1120, 1122-23 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cMaintenance and cure is a remedy with roots in the medieval sea codes; it is a remedy designed to protect seamen from the perils of living and working at sea.\u201d). Because none of Montero\u2019s claims would be viable if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>he had not served as an employee on one of Carnival\u2019s cruise ships, this dispute arises out of his service on the vessel and falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\">. Chapter 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act, which includes 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, does not directly apply to this case. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (''[NQothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen....\u201d). However, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which applies notwithstanding the fact that this case involves a contract of employment of a seaman, <em>Bautista v. Star Cruises, </em>396 F.3d 1289, 1300 (11th Cir.2005), incorporates the provisions of Chapter 1 that do not conflict with it, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. Because 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 does not conflict with the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, it applies to this case and we evaluate the jurisdictional issue under its framework.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\">. Montero also contends that Carnival is equitably estopped from enforcing the arbitration clause because Carnival treated the seafarer\u2019s agreement as terminated when it stopped paying his wages. That argument is without merit. Carnival\u2019s assertion that the arbitration clause survives termination of the seafarer\u2019s agreement is not inconsistent with treating the seafarer\u2019s agreement as terminated. <em>See Sea Byte, Inc. v. Hudson Marine Mgmt. Servs., Inc., </em>565 F.3d 1293, 1304 (11th Cir.2009) (equitable estoppel applies only when a party adopts a position that is \"contrary to\u201d an earlier asserted position).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
