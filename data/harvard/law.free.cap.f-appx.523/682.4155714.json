After a thorough review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss Castillo Sanchez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Castillo Sanchez entered the United States without inspection near Los Indios, Texas, on March 27, 2008. In August 2009, Castillo Sanchez was served with a notice to appear, charging that he was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Castillo Sanchez requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. The application for asylum was based on Castillo Sanchez\u2019s contention that he had been persecuted by the Mara 18 gang on account of his imputed anti-gang political opinion or his membership in a particular social group \u2014 in his case, young males who are actively recruited by gangs because they have no father or other protective male in the home. He testified at his hearing before the IJ that he had been attacked on several occasions by gang members, who demanded money from him every time. Although the IJ found Castillo Sanchez credible, the IJ ultimately denied his application and found him removable to El Salvador. The BIA, without adopting the IJ\u2019s reasoning, affirmed. The BIA found that while Castillo Sanchez might have been persecuted by the gang, his persecution did not satisfy the INA\u2019s requirement that one of five protected grounds form a \u201ccentral reason\u201d for the persecution. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00ae. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">In his petition, Castillo Sanchez only challenges the BIA\u2019s decision regarding his application for asylum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Castillo Sanchez also contends that the IJ violated his due process rights when the IJ refused to let Castillo Sanchez\u2019s expert witness testify by phone. We turn first to whether the BIA erred when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Castillo Sanchez\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AGaJ\">A. Application for Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence, \u201ca highly deferential standard.\u201d <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). We may reverse a factual finding only when doing so is compelled by the record, <em>see id., </em>and we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Seek v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General have the discretion to grant an alien asylum if the alien establishes that he is a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is a person who has been persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of five protected grounds: \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). In 2005, the REAL ID Act of 2005 \u00a7 101(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i), clarified the INA to require that a protected ground be \u201cat least one <em>central reason </em>for persecuting the applicant.\u201d (emphasis added). The BIA has interpreted the phrase \u201ccentral reason\u201d to mean that the protected ground \u201ccannot be incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for harm.\u201d <em>In re J-B-N &amp; S-M-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 208, 214 (BIA 2007). Because this is a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of the REAL ID Act, we owe it <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\u201c[A] court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The BIA in this case determined that, even assuming Castillo Sanchez belonged to a particular social group or had an anti-gang political opinion, the evidence indicated that the gang targeted him primarily to obtain money or recruit him for membership. Therefore, none of the central reasons for his alleged persecution were protected grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We conclude that substantial evi~ dence supports the BIA's conclusion that Castillo Sanchez was targeted by the gang for recruitment and extortionate purposes, and not because of his membership in a particular social group. For example, the evidence showed that in at least one mci-dent, the gang let Castillo Sanchez go without further incident after he gave them money. Castillo Sanchez only submitted conclusory statements that the gang members targeted him because he was in a fatherless household. Moreover, Castillo Sanchez presented no evidence, other than speculation, to indicate that the gang members even knew that he lived in a home without a father or a male figure. Even assuming that the gang members did know this, Castillo Sanchez admitted that neither of his two siblings experienced any problems with the gang, even though they would presumably fall within the same particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Similarly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Castillo Sanchez\u2019s political opinion was not a central reason for his persecution. As stated earlier, Castillo Sanchez\u2019s evidence indicated that the gang always asked him for money, and whether the members attacked him depended on whether he paid them. In other words, although Castillo Sanchez might have had a politically motivated opposition to the gang, he simply did not present enough evidence to demonstrate that it was a central reason for any harm that he suffered. Therefore, we cannot say that the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. We now turn to Castillo Sanchez\u2019s due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">B. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">We review constitutional challenges de novo. <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam). Aliens in removal proceedings are entitled to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Frech v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>491 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cDue process requires that aliens be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in their removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). For Castillo Sanchez to succeed on his due process challenge, he must demonstrate that the IJ\u2019s decision to disallow his expert from testifying telephonically caused him substantial prejudice. <em>Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1143. Substantial prejudice requires the applicant to demonstrate that, in the absence of the alleged error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Whether to permit telephonic testimony is a purely discretionary matter left to the IJ. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.25(c). \u201c[T]he failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Tang, </em>578 F.3d at 1275 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, Castillo Sanchez cannot establish a due process violation based on the IJ\u2019s decision not to permit the telephonic testimony. Moreover, even if the IJ had permitted the telephonic testimony, Castillo Sanchez cannot demonstrate substantial prejudice because the IJ had already received and examined the affidavit from Castillo Sanchez\u2019s expert. Although Castillo Sanchez argues that the affidavit was not exhaustive, the expert\u2019s testimony would have only reinforced two points: first, that Castillo Sanchez belonged to a particular social group; and second, that the gang members were part of Mara 18. Yet neither of these points would have established that a protected ground was a \u201ccentral reason\u201d for Castillo Sanchez\u2019s persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1 )(B)(I). Therefore, we conclude that the IJ did not violate Castillo Sanchez\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Castillo Sanchez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-11\">. Because he does not challenge the denials of withholding of removal and CAT relief in his brief, those issues have been abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
