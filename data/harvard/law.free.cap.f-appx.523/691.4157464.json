The district court construed the Motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and dismissed it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">On October 3, 2011, Rameses filed his Motion in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Rameses\u2019s Motion named various state and federal actors, as well as the \u201cUnited States District Court, For The Eastern District\u201d as respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">In the Motion, Rameses asserted that in 1988 he entered into a plea agreement with the United States and the State of Florida. Rameses attached a copy of the 1988 plea agreement to the Motion. As memorialized in the plea agreement, Rameses agreed to plead guilty to four counts of second degree murder in Florida state court and to cooperate with federal and state law enforcement in solving certain crimes. In exchange, the State agreed to dismiss other criminal charges against Rameses, to recommend that Rameses receive a 22-year sentence of imprisonment on the four murder counts, and to grant Rameses \u201cthe broadest type of use and derivative use immunity (but not transactional immunity)\u201d for crimes he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>committed before signing the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The United States was not a party to this 1988 plea agreement. However, in two letters written to Rameses by an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, the United States agreed to \u201cconsider[ ] itself bound by the terms of the written Plea Agreement between the State of Florida and [Rameses].\u201d These letters referenced the 1988 plea agreement\u2019s immunity provision and set forth that the United States \u201cagreed that no federal charges will be filed against [Rameses] for any of the criminal acts disclosed ... during the course of his interviews with federal and state law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Rameses ultimately served a sentence of fewer than ten years\u2019 imprisonment for his four Florida murder convictions. After his release from prison, Rameses made his way to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Twelve years after executing the 1988 plea agreement, Rameses in 2000 was convicted by a jury in California state court for passing bad checks. Pursuant to California\u2019s three-strikes law, the California state prosecutor submitted Rameses\u2019s four prior Florida second degree murder convictions to the jury. The jury, in turn, enhanced Rameses\u2019s sentence for the bad-checks offense to a term of 25 years to life imprisonment based on these prior convictions. Rameses is currently serving this enhanced sentence in California state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Before filing his Motion in the Southern District of Florida, Rameses made at least two prior attempts in California to obtain federal post-conviction relief related to his California bad-checks conviction. In 2005, Rameses filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in the Eastern District of California \u2014 where he is incarcerated \u2014 which that district court denied on the merits in 2008. <em>See Rameses v. Kernan, </em>No. CIV S-04-1173, 2008 WL 883108 (E.D.Cal. Mar. 31, 2008) (adopting magistrate judge\u2019s report, 2007 WL 4200814 (E.D.Cal. Nov. 27, 2007), and denying Rameses\u2019s petition in its entirety). One of the claims Rameses raised in his 2005 \u00a7 2254 petition was that California \u201cprosecutors were motivated to pursue [his] case as a Three Strikes case by relying, at least in part, on immunized testimony.\u201d <em>Rameses, </em>2007 WL 4200814 at *1. On May 13, 2011, Rameses filed a \u201cmotion for extraordinary remedy of specific performance as part of plea agreement\u201d in the Eastern District of California, which that district court construed as a successive \u00a7 2254 petition and dismissed in January 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">In his instant 2011 Motion, Rameses argued that the California prosecutor\u2019s pursuit of a three-strikes enhanced sentence, based on Rameses\u2019s four \u201cimmunized\u201d Florida murder convictions, violated the immunity provisions of the 1988 plea agreement. Rameses requested an evi-dentiary hearing and \u201cspecific performance of [his] plea agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">The federal government appeared on behalf of the federal respondents and filed a response to Rameses\u2019s 2011 Motion. In pertinent part, the federal government contended that (1) the district court should construe Rameses\u2019s Motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed under \u00a7 2254, in light of the injury Rameses alleged and the relief he requested; and (2) the Motion was a nearly verbatim copy of the earlier, successive \u00a7 2254 petition that Rameses had filed in 2011 in the Eastern District of California. The government argued that a person in state custody could file a \u00a7 2254 petition but only in the federal court for the district where he was incarcerated or where the state court is located that convicted and sentenced him to that custody. Because Rameses was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>convicted and sentenced in a state court located within the Eastern District of California, and was in state custody within the same district, the district court in the Southern District of Florida lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Following the federal government\u2019s response, a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) concerning Rameses\u2019s Motion. In the R &amp; R, the magistrate judge construed Rameses\u2019s Motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed under \u00a7 2254, explaining that the Motion necessarily relied upon \u00a7 2254 because Rameses was in state custody and he sought post-conviction relief in federal court related to his California bad-checks conviction and sentence. However, the magistrate judge then noted that \u00a7 2241(d) governs <em>where </em>persons in state custody can file \u00a7 2254 petitions challenging their state convictions and sentences. Under \u00a7 2241(d), Rameses could file a \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his California conviction and sentence in either (1) \u201cthe district court for the district within which the [sjtate court was held which convicted and sentenced him\u201d; or (2) \u201cthe district court for the district wherein [he was] in custody.\u201d <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 2241(d), because a state court located in California convicted and sentenced Rameses for passing bad checks, and because he was \u201cin custody\u201d serving his sentence in California, the magistrate judge found that Rameses\u2019s Motion, filed in the Southern District of Florida, did not satisfy \u00a7 2241(d). And, because \u00a7 2241(d) was not satisfied, the district court in the Southern District of Florida did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Motion. Accordingly, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing Rameses\u2019s Motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s R <em>&amp; </em>R without objection from either party and dismissed Rameses\u2019s Motion. Rameses then timely appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">A federal court may recharacterize a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion to create a better correspondence between the substance of the motion and its underlying legal basis. <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-82, 124 S.Ct. 786, 791-92, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). \u201c[A] state prisoner seeking post-conviction relief from a federal court has but one remedy: an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1062 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">All applications for writs of habeas corpus, including those filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 by persons in state custody, are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 2241(a), federal district courts may grant writs of habeas corpus only \u201cwithin their respective jurisdictions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a). For a person who is \u201cin custody under the judgment and sentence of a [s]tate court\u201d and who wishes to file a \u00a7 2254 application, \u00a7 2241(d) specifies the \u201crespective jurisdictions\u201d where such an application may be filed. Under \u00a7 2241(d), a person in custody under the judgment of a state court may file his application for a writ of habeas corpus in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the federal district (1) \u201cwithin which the [s]tate court was held which convicted and sentenced him\u201d; or (2) \u201cwherein [he] is in custody.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d); <em>see also Eagle v. Linahan, </em>279 F.3d 926, 933 n. 9 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Further, \u201c[a] petitioner is not \u2018in custody\u2019 to challenge a conviction when the sentence imposed for that conviction has completely expired.\u201d <em>Van Zant v. Fla. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>104 F.3d 325, 327 (11th Cir.1997). However, a habeas petitioner may challenge the use of a prior conviction with an expired sentence to enhance the sentence imposed for a later crime if he is currently serving the later, enhanced sentence. <em>Id. </em>For purposes of the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement, the petitioner is deemed to be challenging the sentence for his later conviction, which, in Rameses\u2019s case, is his California bad-checks conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Here, the district court properly construed Rameses\u2019s Motion as an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed under \u00a7 2254 and governed by \u00a7 2241\u2019s jurisdictional requirements. <em>See Castro, </em>540 U.S. at 381-82, 124 S.Ct. at 791-92. Because Rameses\u2019s Florida sentence for his state murder convictions \u201chas completely expired,\u201d Rameses is not \u201cin custody\u201d for the purpose of challenging those Florida convictions directly. <em>Van Zant, </em>104 F.3d at 327. Rather, Rameses is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of challenging the three-strikes enhancement to his California state sentence that resulted from his expired Florida murder convictions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Accordingly, Rameses\u2019s problem is that because he is \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to a sentence imposed by a state court located in California, and he is incarcerated in California, he plainly has filed his Motion in the wrong court. Here, the district court in Florida correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Motion because, under \u00a7 2241(d), Rameses may only petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court in California, which is both where \u201cthe [s]tate court was held which convicted and sentenced him\u201d and \u201cwherein [he] is in custody.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d); <em>see Eagle, </em>279 F.3d at 933 n. 9. The district court in the Southern District of Florida lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Rameses\u2019s Motion, which challenged his enhanced California sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rameses\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\">. In the R &amp; R \u2014 which the district court later adopted \u2014 the magistrate judge recommended that Rameses\u2019s Motion be \"denied.\u201d However, despite the use of this terminology, we construe the district court\u2019s disposition of Rameses's Motion as a dismissal, rather than a denial, in light of the district court's determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Diaz v. Fla. Fourth Judicial Circuit ex rel.
