Whether substantial evidence supports the denial of Zheng\u2019s application for asylum based upon an adverse-credibility determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">2. Whether substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s alternative finding that Zheng failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d review must be a highly deferential one. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination was supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d \u2014 including Zheng\u2019s swearing to two different dates of entry into the United States \u2014 and was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">Under the law, \u201cpersecution\u201d is an extreme concept and \u201cfear\u201d has an objectionably reasonable element. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1289 (11th Cir.2001). Even if Zheng had been credible, the BIA also found that Zheng did not meet his burden of showing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion. This finding was supported by substantial evidence: the level of mistreatment was not sufficiently extreme and the record does not compel the conclusion that the Chinese government was aware of Zheng\u2019s low-level political activity or that it would actually target him as a result of the activity. Because Zheng failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he has necessarily failed to meet the higher standards for withholding of removal or for CAT relief. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The BIA\u2019s discussion was announced adequately. The BIA is not required to address specifically each piece of evidence. <em>See Carrizo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>652 F.3d 1326, 1332 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
