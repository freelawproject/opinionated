The district court ruled that Tippins\u2019s dental condition did not qualify as a serious health condition involving continuing treatment because she was not incapacitated for a continuous period of more than three days. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.115(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Approximately five years after Honda hired Tippins, she was absent and failed to timely provide leave forms to excuse her absences. On September 28, 2009, Tippins \u201cclocked out\u201d one hour early. On October 7, 2009, Tippins submitted a request to excuse her absence on September 28 for medical treatment, but Honda denied the request as untimely based on its policy that employees seek approval of leave within 4 days of an absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">On October 15, 2009, Tippins did not report to work, but she submitted a request for a leave of absence on the basis that she had an \u201c[i]nfection and swelling of the face, nose, ears, lips and chin and eye.\u201d That afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Tippins met with Dr. Fred Atwell, an oral surgeon, who scheduled Tippins to undergo a tooth extraction on Wednesday, October 21, 2009. Tippins had her tooth removed as scheduled and remained at home the rest of the work week.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Dr. Atwell submitted medical leave forms to excuse Tippins\u2019s three-day absence. On October 26, 2009, Dr. Atwell sent Honda a certificate of health care provider form stating that Tippins underwent \u201cextraction of [a] tooth\u201d; her procedure did not involve a \u201cserious health condition\u201d; her \u201ccommence date of incapacity [was] 10-21-09\u201d; she could \u201creturn to normal activities [on] 10-24-09\u201d; and her only \u201cactual/expected date[ ] of treatment [was] 10-21-09.\u201d Honda immediately notified Tippins that her provider form stated she had been \u201cincapacitated but that it was not a serious health condition\u201d and asked her to \u201chave [her] physician correct certification and initial changes.\u201d On October 29, 2009, Dr. Atwell sent Honda a copy of the October 26 form on which Dr. Atwell had added that Tippins underwent the extraction for \u201cabscess tooth # 4.\u201d Honda again immediately notified Tippins that her \u201cdoctor [was] indicating that [she] was incapacitated but that it was not [a] serious health condition\u201d and instructed Tippins to have her \u201cphysician ... complete the <em>Certification of Health Care Provider </em>in order to certify condition as a serious health condition and FMLA.\u201d On November 3, 2009, Dr. Atwell sent Honda another copy of the same form on which Dr. Atwell had added that Tippins\u2019s condition was a \u201cserious health condition\u201d; her \u201ccommence date of incapacity [was] 10-21-09\u201d; she could \u201creturn to normal activities [on] 10-24-09\u201d; her \u201cin-person treatment visit(s) [were on] 10/15/09 [and] 10/21/09\u201d; and she received prescriptions for Amoxicillin and Lorcet.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Honda determined that Tippins\u2019s dental condition did not qualify for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. As a result, Honda refused to excuse Tippins\u2019s absence from work. Later, Honda fired Tippins for violating the company attendance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Tippins complained that Honda had denied her leave for a \u201cserious medical condition,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a), that involvefd] ... continuing treatment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2611(11). Honda answered and moved for summary judgment on the ground that Tippins\u2019s dental condition did not qualify as a \u201cserious medical condition involving continuing treatment\u201d because she did not have \u201c[a] period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.115(a). Tippins moved for partial summary judgment and argued that the \u201cremedial\u201d purposes of the Act allowed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>to combine her absences on September 28 and October 15 with her three-day absence to satisfy the period of incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The district court granted the motion of Honda for summary judgment and denied Tippins\u2019s motion. The district court ruled that Tippins could not combine her three-day absence with her nonsuccessive absences. The district court based its decision on the language of the regulation requiring that the \u201cperiod of incapacity [be composed] of more than three consecutive, full calendar days,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.115(a), and our decision in <em>Russell v. North Broward Hospital, </em>346 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.2003), holding that the term \u201cconsecutive\u201d in an earlier version of the regulation required that the period of incapacity be \u201ccontinuous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment against Tippins. For Tippins\u2019s dental condition to qualify as a \u201cserious health condition involving continuing treatment,\u201d her \u201cperiod of incapacity [had to consist] of more than three consecutive, full calendar days.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.115(a). In other words, Tippins had to prove that she had a <em>\u201ccontinuous </em>[, or uninterrupted,] period of incapacity extending more than 72 hours.\u201d <em>See Russell, </em>346 F.3d at 1338. Dr. Atwell certified that Tippins was incapacitated between October 21 and October 24, but that three-day period was not enough. And Tippins\u2019s absences on September 28 or October 15 did not count toward the period of incapacity because they were not \u201cconsecutive\u201d to, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.115(a), or \u201ccontinuous\u201d with, <em>Russell, </em>346 F.3d at 1338, the three-day absence attributable to her dental procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Honda.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
