The presentence report, which was adopted by the district court, calculated Perez\u2019s base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) because he had a prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation, which constituted an enumerated \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d namely burglary of a dwelling, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Perez argues that his base offense level was improperly calculated because Texas law defines the owner of a habitation as a person with merely a greater right to possession than the criminal actor and that this places the Texas crime outside the generic definition of burglary of a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">In <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>2013 WL 1473651 (May 13, 2013), we rejected this argument on plain error review, affirming a sentencing enhancement for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). We noted that we had recently rejected on de novo review a materially indistinguishable argument in <em>United States v. Joslin, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 139, 141-43 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1847, 185 L.Ed.2d 851 (2013), holding that, under the Armed Career Criminal Act, a conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>for Texas burglary of a habitation under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes generic burglary, notwithstanding the \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory. <em>Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">While Perez concedes that his argument should be reviewed for plain error and that it is foreclosed by our precedent in <em>Morales-Mota, </em>he wishes to preserve his argument that <em>Joslin </em>was wrongly decided for Supreme Court review. Because one panel of this court may not overrule the decision of another absent an en banc or superseding Supreme Court decision, <em>see United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002), Perez\u2019s argument that the \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d definition makes Texas burglary broader than generic burglary is foreclosed by <em>Morales-Mota. </em>Perez\u2019s motion for summary disposition is GRANTED. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
