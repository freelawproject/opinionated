(United). The debtor is James Bruce Jennings (Debtor). The appellee is the bankruptcy trustee, Emerson C. Nobel (Trustee).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-20\">In 2011, the Trustee filed a Chapter 7 Report Of No Distribution (Report). By this, he sought to convert the case to a no asset case, to discharge his fiduciary duties, and to abandon scheduled assets back to the Debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>United objected to the Report on the basis that it failed to list, identify or administer a $363,698.55 Michigan Judgment against United, listed on Debtor\u2019s Schedule B (Michigan Judgment), as an asset and a liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> United offered $10,000.00, for the Michigan Judgment, in settlement. Third party SCR Joint Venture, L.P. (SCR) also offered to buy the bankrupt estate\u2019s interest in the Michigan Judgment from the Trustee for $10,000.00. The Trustee refused to pursue the settlement or the purchase requests, and filed his Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">United objected to the Trustee\u2019s abandonment of the Michigan Judgment, arguing that this creates a potential windfall for the Debtor, to the detriment of the bankruptcy estate, and United. The bankruptcy court conducted a hearing, and, without comment, overruled United\u2019s objection to the Trustee\u2019s Report. At the hearing, the Trustee testified that the bankruptcy estate had no interest in the Michigan Judgment, scheduled by the Debtor. United argued that this was a complete reversal of the Trustee\u2019s earlier position on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">United appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court. The Trustee argued in his brief to the district court that he deemed the $10,000.00, in question to be inconsequential to the estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a). United argued that the bankruptcy court erred when it failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing, and made no findings of fact or conclusions of law. The district court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">The district court determined that the amount of general unsecured claims filed in Debtor\u2019s estate approximated $540,000.00. Had the entire $10,000.00, been received into the estate, for pro rata distribution to unsecured creditors, United, and others, would have received less than two cents on the dollar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a), the bankruptcy court gives deference to the business judgment of the Trustee. The district court found that the Trustee\u2019s decision not to pursue the $10,000.00 as inconsequential, was made in good faith, upon a reasonable basis, and within the scope of his authority under the Bankruptcy Code. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">. The Trustee did not file a brief in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">.The Michigan Judgment arose out of United's action against the Debtor and three other defendants in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The final judgment awarded $255,367.29, to United against the Debtor; $125,000.00 to the Debtor against United; and attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the Debtor and his co-defendants in the amount of $238,698.55, against United.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">. United claims that the Trustee did not make this argument to the bankruptcy court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1060-13\">. This estimated sum is calculated before any trustee's fees, attorney's fees and costs to be incurred in the distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
