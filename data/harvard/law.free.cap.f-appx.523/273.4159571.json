He contends that the agency wrongly rejected his claims that he had been continuously present in the United States for ten years and that removal would result in extremely unusual hardship to his then 22-month-old daughter. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">We are statutorily barred from reviewing the IPs and BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). Although this jurisdiction-stripping provision does not preclude review of constitutional claims or questions of law; \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377, we look past an alien\u2019s framing of an issue and will decline to consider \u201can abuse of discretion argument cloaked in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Without citation to the record or precedent, Felix-Agustin argues that the IJ\u2019s determination that he failed to show ten years\u2019 continuous presence \u201cnecessarily\u201d affected its analysis of the hardship of removal on his young daughter. As the agency\u2019s analysis of continuous presence relies on different factors focused on the alien himself while the analysis of hardship focuses exclusively on the qualifying relative, Felix-Agustin\u2019s daughter, his claim is unavailing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l); <em>Matter of Monreal-Aguinaga, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 63 (BIA 2001). His challenge remains in essence a disagreement with the agency\u2019s analysis of the hardship factors and its discretionary determination, over which this court lacks jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Accordingly, Felix-Agustin\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
