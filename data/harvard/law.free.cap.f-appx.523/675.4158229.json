After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b704-18\">We review a district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo. See, <em>e.g., Catron v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>658 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2011). A plaintiff must allege enough in his complaint to render a claim \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-19\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b704-20\">The district court properly dismissed the RICO claim because the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tiffs did not allege injury to their business or property. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c) (allowing recovery to \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property\u201d)- The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Ms. Santamar\u00eda suffered personal injury&amp;emdash;i.e., physical symptoms and emotional distress&amp;emdash;are legally insufficient. <em>See Williams v. Mohawk Ind., </em>465 F.3d 1277, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe terms \u2018business or property\u2019 are, of course, words of limitation which preclude [certain forms of] recovery.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>Grogan v. Platt, </em>835 F.2d 844, 847 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cIn our view, the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u2018injured in his business or property* excludes personal injuries, including pecuniary losses therefrom.\u201d). <em>See also Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979) (explaining that the phrase \u201cbusiness or property\u201d in the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, \u201cretains restrictive significance\u201d and \u201cwould ... exclude personal injuries suffered\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">As to the claim for infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiffs argue&amp;emdash;without any elaboration&amp;emdash;that they pled sufficient facts to state a claim. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief at 40. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Insofar as the plaintiffs alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress, the district court correctly held that the defendants\u2019 alleged conduct (e.g., not providing the plaintiffs with correct information concerning their mortgage loan, refusing to modify that loan, losing papers and documents, and threatening foreclosure) was not \u201cso outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.\u201d <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. McCarson, </em>467 So.2d 277, 278-79 (Fla.1985). <em>Compare Valdes v. GAB Robins North America, Inc., </em>924 So.2d 862, 866 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006) (defendants\u2019 alleged conduct&amp;emdash;falsely reporting to the division of insurance that plaintiff had committed fraud, which led to plaintiffs arrest&amp;emdash;\u201cis not the sort of outrageous conduct\u201d which permits a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">With respect to the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiffs did not allege a physical impact, which is generally required under Florida law, <em>see R.J. v. Humana of Florida, </em>652 So.2d 360, 362 (Fla.1995), and they did not come within any of the exceptions to the impact rule. <em>See generally Fla. Dept. of Corrections v. Abril, </em>969 So.2d 201, 206-07 (Fla.2007) (discussing exceptions to the impact rule). The district court therefore properly dismissed this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. We employ the same Rule 56 standard as the district court, which means that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving parties. <em>See, e.g., Waddell v. Hendry County Sheriffs Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">The plaintiffs argue that the district court failed to notify them of their \u201cduty\u201d to submit affidavits or other evidence in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief at 34-36. We find no reversible error. Although we require district courts to provide pro se litigants notice of their right to file affidavits and other materials in opposition to a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>for summary judgment, <em>see Griffith v. Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d 822, 824 (11th Cir.1985), there is no \u201cduty\u201d imposed on non-moving parties to file anything in response. And though the district court appears not to have provided the Rule 56 notice to the plaintiffs, that error is harmless because the plaintiffs filed a response in opposition and submitted evidence supporting their position that summary judgment was inappropriate. <em>See M.B. # 11072-054 v. Reish, </em>119 F.3d 230, 232 (2nd Cir.1997) (failure to provide pro se litigant with Rule 56 notice is not reversible error when the litigant \u201cresponds to the summary judgment motion with factual and legal submissions indicating that he understood the nature and consequences of summary judgment and \u2018the need to set forth all available evidence demonstrating a genuine dispute over material facts\u2019 \u201d). We note, as well, that in their depositions the plaintiffs confirmed that there were no additional facts, outside of those in their third amended complaint and exhibits, which supported their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The plaintiffs alleged that BOA and BAC violated 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e) by failing to respond to their \u201cqualified written request,\u201d and violated \u00a7 2605(c) by failing to send them, within the statutory time period, notice that their loan had been transferred from BOA to BAC. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both RESPA claims, and we conclude that it did not err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On the \u00a7 2605(e) claim, the district court explained that BAC sent two letters in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 qualified written request, which was mailed on April 30, 2010. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A) (acknowledgment must be provided within 20 days). The district court also noted that the plaintiffs did not dispute that these two letters constituted an adequate response to their request. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 May 14 response letter did not correct the incorrect information or remedy other problems with their account. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(2) (servicer must make \u201cappropriate corrections\u201d or explain why the account is correct within 60 days). The problem is that the plaintiffs did not make this argument below in their response to the motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>D.E. 61 at 4-5. As a result, we will not consider the argument here. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201can issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The district court also ruled that the two other letters sent by the plaintiffs on July 10 and August 16, 2010, were not qualified written requests under RESPA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(B) (defining a qualified written request). The plaintiffs argue that the defendants responded to these letters on November 24, 2010, well beyond RESPA\u2019s 60-day period. But they do not explain why their own letters constituted qualified written requests under RE SPA, and unless they did, the defendants had no statutory obligation to respond within 60 days. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s ruling with respect to these two other letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Turning to the \u00a7 2605(c) claim, the district court ruled that, even if the defendants failed to provide the plaintiffs with timely notice of the transfer of their loan, there was no RESPA violation allowing actual damages, in part because there was no evidence of a pattern and practice of non-compliance with RESPA on the part of the defendants. Thus, the plaintiffs could not recover statutory damages under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u00a7 2605(f)(1). The plaintiffs do not explain why this ruling was incorrect, so we deem the \u00a7 2605(c) claim abandoned.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The district court granted summary judgment on the fraud claim \u2014 which was largely based on allegations that the defendants falsely told the plaintiffs that they would qualify for a loan modification if they defaulted and then told them they had so qualified \u2014 because the plaintiffs had not proven actual harm. As the district court explained, although the plaintiffs kept making mortgage payments for a while and also made some home improvements, they were still living in the house secured by the mortgage loan. The plaintiffs do not offer any argument as to why the district court\u2019s reasoning was erroneous, so there is no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The district court\u2019s order is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-11\">. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, and discuss the allegations or evidence only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">. Given our ruling, we need not and do not address whether the district court erred in striking the treatment notes of Ms. Santama-ria\u2019s psychiatrist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-11\">. The plaintiffs do argue \u2014 as they did below\u2014 that they made a payment in September of 2009 to their prior mortgage company/servi-cer because of the defendants\u2019 untimely notice of the transfer of the loan. But they do not claim that this payment was not credited to their account. So, as the district court explained, the plaintiffs failed to show actual damages from any violation of \u00a7 2605(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-25\">. We affirm, without discussion, as to the other arguments made by the plaintiffs on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
