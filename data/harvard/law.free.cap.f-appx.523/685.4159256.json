For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Terry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">In 1992, Terry pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d) and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Terry\u2019s base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. However, because Terry was an armed career criminal, his guideline range was calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. Terry was sentenced to a total sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2011, Terry filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750 and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. After the government responded, the district court determined that Terry was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c) reduction based on Amendment 750, because his sentence was not based on any drug-related guidelines. Further, the FSA was not applicable to Terry because he was sentenced in 1992. Thus, the court determined that he was not entitled to a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">On appeal, Terry argues that he was entitled to a sentence reduction notwithstanding his career offender status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Citing to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), he argues that his sentence was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), which was amended by Amendment 750, because \u00a7 2D1.1(c) remained a point of reference throughout the process of calculating his guideline range. Terry argues that we should not rely on our decision in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>[\u2014 U.S. -] 133 S.Ct. 568 [184 L.Ed.2d 371] (2012), in the instant case because it relies unduly on Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>was not the controlling opinion in the case, does not specifically address career offenders, and lacks any in-depth analysis of the FSA\u2019s background. Terry further argues that he was entitled to be resentenced under the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties for crack-cocaine offenses. In his reply brief, Terry also argues that <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012), and <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013), are distinguishable from his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319. Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that a career offender is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where a retroactive guideline amendment reduces his base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). We further held that the rationale of <em>Moore </em>is applicable to armed career criminals, notwithstanding the fact that armed career criminals were sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.4 and career offenders were sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Lawson, </em>we rejected a career offender\u2019s argument that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>the holding of <em>Moore </em>was overruled, such that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750, despite his sentence being based on the career offender guideline. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319-21. In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. Neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule Moore\u2019s holding that a career offender was not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where his guideline range was not lowered by a retroactive amendment because it was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d to the issue that arose in <em>Moore. Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, we held that Lawson, a career offender, was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his guideline range based on \u00a7 4B1.1 was not reduced by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">In <em>Berry, </em>we addressed the applicability of Amendment 750 and the FSA in the context of an \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. 701 F.3d at 376-77. Berry was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and sentenced in 2002, and his initial guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment, which was based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 376. On appeal, we held that the district court did not have the authority to grant Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 had no effect on Berry\u2019s initial guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment or his guideline sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 377. In addition, we rejected Berry\u2019s argument that he was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under the FSA, determining that the FSA was not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>did not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Even assuming that Berry could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim still failed because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002 and the FSA did not apply retroactively to his 2002 sentences. <em>Id. </em>We pointed out that the general savings clause in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 states that the repeal of a statute shall not have the effect of releasing or extinguishing any penalty incurred under that statute unless the repealing Act expressly so provides. <em>Id. </em>We then agreed with \u201cevery other circuit to address the issue\u201d that there was no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced before the August 3, 2010, date of the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), noting that <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In <em>Hippolyte, </em>we rejected Hippolyte\u2019s arguments (1) that Congress intended for the FSA to apply to drug-crime sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for the same reasons articulated in <em>Dorsey </em>and (2) that it would be inconsistent to apply the more lenient sentencing ranges of Amendment 750, but keep the harsh pre-FSA mandatory m\u00ednimums in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding involving a defendant sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment. 712 F.3d at 539-40, 542. We determined that <em>Berry </em>was indistinguishable from Hippolyte\u2019s case, and thus, the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties did not apply to his case. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Based on our decision in <em>Thomas, </em>Terry is not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Terry was sentenced as an armed career criminal, and Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range, as Amendment 750 did not address \u00a7 4B1.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 748, 750; <em>Thomas, </em>545 F.3d at 1302. <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule <em>Thomas. </em>Specifically, neither the plurality nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.4. <em>See generally Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690-700. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>is not \u201cclearly on point\u201d to the issue that arose in <em>Thomas, </em>and <em>Thomas </em>is controlling in this case. <em>See Thomas, </em>545 F.3d at 1302; <em>see also Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 in Terry\u2019s case because he cannot show that Amendment 750 lowered his guideline range. Moreover, the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), which Amendment 750 amended, were not referenced in calculating Terry\u2019s base offense level, much less the guideline range upon which his sentence was ultimately based. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 748, 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">Terry also argues that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties. Pursuant to the armed career criminal guideline, Terry\u2019s sentence was calculated by referencing the career offender guideline, which bases a defendant\u2019s offense level on the statutory maximum for his offense. The PSI calculated his offense level under the career offender guideline based on the statutory maximum for his felon-in-possession case, not the statutory maximum for his crack-cocaine offense. However, even assuming that Terry\u2019s armed career criminal offense level was based on the statutory maximum for his crack-cocaine offense, he would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. As we stated in <em>Berry, </em>the FSA is not a guideline amendment, and thus, Terry is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the FSA. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376-77. To the extent Terry argues that <em>Berry </em>is distinguishable because he is seeking to reduce his sentence based both on Amendment 750 and the FSA, his argument is without merit because Amendment 750 has no application to this case. Further, nothing in <em>Dorsey </em>suggests that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory minimums should apply to defendants who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377-78; <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 539-40, 542. Thus, the FSA does not apply to Terry\u2019s case, and he has not shown that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because he has not shown that an amendment to the Guidelines has the effect of reducing his sentence. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Terry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-11\">. Terry erroneously refers to himself as a career offender throughout his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
