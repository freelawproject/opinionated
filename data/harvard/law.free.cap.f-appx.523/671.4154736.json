Through these motions, Rangel-Perez sought to reopen his application for cancellation of removal, filed pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 240(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a). For the reasons that follow, we dismiss in part and deny in part Rangel-Perez petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">I. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">Ordinarily, we retain jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reopen or to reconsider. <em>See Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 252-53, 130 S.Ct. 827, 840, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010) (concluding that INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) does not strip courts of jurisdiction to review denials of motions to reopen or reconsider made pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We lack jurisdiction, however, to review the denial of an application for cancellation or removal under \u00a7 1229b except in appeals that raise a constitutional claim or a question of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00a9, (a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9, (a)(2)(D); <em>see also Alhuay v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>661 F.3d 534, 549-50 (11th Cir.2011); <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221-22 (11th Cir.2006). Under our binding precedent, when review of the underlying order is barred by the INA\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping provisions, we also lack \u201cjurisdiction to entertain an attack on that order\u201d mounted through a motion to reopen or motion for reconsideration. <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1261-62 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Here, the IJ\u2019s final removal order, affirmed by the BIA, denied Rangel-Perez\u2019s request for cancellation of removal because he did not establish the hardship requirement. Whether an applicant demonstrates the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d needed for cancellation of removal is a discretionary determination not subject to review. <em>See Alhuay, </em>661 F.3d at 549-50. Under our binding precedent, we therefore also lack jurisdiction to review the denial of any motions to reopen or reconsider that determination. <em>See Patel, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>334 F.3d at 1262. Thus, to the extent Rangel-Perez argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying (1) his motion to reconsider the denial of his first motion to reopen; or (2) his second motion to reopen, we dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">II. LEGAL CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional or legal claims, Ran-gel-Perez raises two legal errors that are wholly without merit. We explain why.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Rangel-Perez\u2019s motion for reconsideration and second motion to reopen were both based on new evidence of his wife\u2019s recent diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The BIA denied the motion for reconsideration because Rangel-Perez\u2019s motion did not identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying his first motion to reopen. The BIA denied Rangel-Perez\u2019s second motion to reopen as both time-barred and number-barred. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A) &amp; (C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) &amp; (C) (limiting motions to reopen to one motion filed within ninety days of the final order of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">A. Second Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Rangel-Perez does not dispute that his motion to reopen was his second and that it was not filed within ninety days of his removal order. Instead, Rangel Perez argues, without citing any authority, that the BIA nonetheless was required as a matter of law to remand his case to the IJ to consider whether, in light of his new evidence, he now met the hardship requirement. However, the only motions to reopen not subject to the time and/or number limitations are motions to reopen asylum applications based on changed country conditions and motions to reopen based on allegations of a battered spouse, child, or parent. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(ii) &amp; (iv), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(ii) &amp; (iv). Rangel-Perez\u2019s second motion to reopen did not fall within either of these exceptions, and thus was both time- and number-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">Rangel-Perez also argues that as a matter of law the BIA was required to remand his case to the IJ because of an intervening change in the BIA\u2019s precedent. Rangel-Perez contends <em>Matter of Morales, </em>decided after his final removal order, required the IJ to consider the hardship to his stepson in addition to his wife. <em>See </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 186, 187 (BIA 2010) (concluding that a stepparent qualifies as a \u201cparent\u201d for purposes of establishing the hardship requirement for cancellation of removal).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">Given that the purpose of a motion to reopen is to present new facts, it is doubtful a motion to reopen is the proper vehicle to argue a change in the law. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) (requiring motion to reopen to \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted\u201d and to be \u201csupported by affidavits or other evidentiary material\u201d); <em>In re O-S-G, </em>24 I. &amp; \u00d1. Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006) (explaining that while a motion to reconsider \u201ccontests the correctness of the [BIA\u2019s] original decision based on the previous factual record,\u201d a motion to reopen \u201cseeks a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence\u201d). In any event, Ran-gel-Perez fails to cite any authority supporting his claim that a second motion to reopen based on a change in the law is exempt from the INA\u2019s time and number limitations. Indeed, the provision of the INA that governs motions \u25a0 to reopen does not include such an exception. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240A(c)(7), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">B. Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Unlike a motion to reopen, a motion to reconsider filed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b) may be based on a change in the law. <em>See In re O-S-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 57 (\u201cA motion to reconsider is a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of ... a change of law....\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). A motion to reconsider, however, must also show a factual or legal error in the BIA\u2019s prior decision&amp;emdash;in this case, the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Rangel-Perez\u2019s first motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>In re O-S-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 56-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\u25a0 Here, however, there was no legal error in the BIA\u2019s prior decision in light of <em>Matter of Morales. </em>Contrary to Rangel-Per-ez\u2019s contention, the IJ in fact considered the hardship to Rangel-Perez\u2019s stepson when he denied Rangel-Perez\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. Specifically, the IJ considered both Rangel-Perez\u2019s \u201cwife, and/or stepson\u201d to be \u201cqualifying relatives,\u201d discussed the hardships they would suffer and concluded that Rangel-Perez did not show the requisite level of hardship. In affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal, the BIA agreed that the hardships \u201chis wife and stepchild will suffer\u201d did not rise to the level needed for cancellation of removal. As such, the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal was consistent with <em>Matter of Morales, </em>and, in light of the lack of legal error, the BIA had no reason to reconsider its prior decision to denying Rangel-Perez\u2019s first motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">. \"We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\" Amaya-Artunduaga v.
