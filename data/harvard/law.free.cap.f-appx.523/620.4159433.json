He presents one issue: whether the District Court committed plain error in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal <em>sua sponte </em>at the close of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">Ordinarily, we review <em>de novo </em>whether sufficient evidence supports a conviction, drawing all reasonable factual inferences from the evidence in favor of the verdict. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 840 (11th Cir.2009). Evidence is sufficient if a reasonable trier of fact could find that it established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>However, where, as here, the defendant unsuccessfully moves for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case in chief, then presents evidence in his own defense and thereafter fails to renew the motion for judgment of acquittal, we will reverse his conviction only if there is a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice,\u201d such that \u201cthe evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Schier, </em>438 F.3d 1104, 1107 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Moreover, where the defendant raises a sufficiency argument on appeal that was not specifically raised below, we review that issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Joseph, </em>709 F.3d 1082, 1103 (11th Cir.2013). Plain error is: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; and (3) affects substantial rights; but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">Wire fraud is a crime which punishes anyone who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-18\">having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire ... communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348. The elements of wire fraud are thus: (1) intentional participation in a scheme to defraud, and (2) the use of interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme. <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d 1282, 1299 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">It is also illegal for a person to \u201ctransport[], transmit[], or transfer[] in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. Even though it is not explicitly stated in the statute, it is also a violation of \u00a7 2314 to cause the transportation of a qualifying good or item. <em>United States v. Block, </em>755 F.2d 770, 774 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The fraud underpinning Boswell\u2019s convictions in this case occurred through his participation on eBay. In March 2008, eBay user \u201cgoingfast3,\u201d which was registered to Boswell, listed 110 groups of Krugerrand gold coins for auction. Boswell received payment from the auction winners and spent their money, but he did not send them the coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In appealing his convictions for the \u00a7 2314 offenses, Boswell only argues that there was insufficient evidence linking him to the fraud. He correctly observes that none of his victims saw him in person. He ignores, however, the evidence that he used the proceeds of the fraud to purchase real estate. Since the jury was entitled to rely on such evidence, he has not demonstrated that a manifest miscarriage of justice would result if we affirmed \u00a7 2314 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">As to the \u00a7 1343 wire fraud offenses, Boswell argues, for the first time on appeal, that there was not enough evidence to establish that he intended to defraud the victims, because the victims never actually sent him any money. The act constituting the wire fraud was Boswell\u2019s inducement of the victims\u2019 electronic bids through a fraudulent listing on eBay, a website where users can list items for auction and other users can place electronic bids on those items. By listing South African gold Krugerrands for auction, Boswell solicited bids, and the high bidder expected to receive the coins. The fact that Boswell did not have the coins, or, if he did, that he did not intend to send the coins to the victims, was established by the testimony and evidence of numerous other victims who bid on Boswell\u2019s eBay auctions during the same time period. The fact that one witness testified that he received Krugerrands bought from Boswell in an eBay auction a month earlier failed to establish that the jury\u2019s verdicts were not based upon inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence. In sum, sustaining the \u00a7 1342 convictions would not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
