Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>11th Cir.2013, F.3d , (No. 11-14609, May 29, 2013) (per curiam), and substitute the following opinion in its place:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">William Gay, a Florida state prisoner serving a total sentence of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated battery, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Gay argued during closing arguments that he did not batter Sheila Finch, but that she had instead sustained her injuries after she tripped and fell over an oak tree\u2019s roots. In response to Gay\u2019s argument, the prosecutor argued that nobody testified that Finch tripped and fell on the oak tree\u2019s roots, and that \u201cnot one scintilla\u201d of evidence supported Gay\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">Gay first challenged the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments as improperly shifting the burden of proof to Gay in a \u201cmotion for rehearing and/or in the alternative petition for a writ of habeas corpus\u201d with the Florida District Court of Appeal, after it summarily affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his second motion to vacate under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. The Florida District Court of Appeal summarily denied Gay\u2019s motion. Gay also raised this same claim in his subsequent third Rule 3.850 motion, which the trial court summarily denied. The Florida District Court of Appeal thereafter summarily affirmed on appeal. Gay then filed the instant habeas petition with the district court, arguing that the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments improperly shifted the burden of proof to Gay. The district court denied Gay\u2019s claim as procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">On appeal, Gay argues that his claim is not procedurally defaulted because an adequate state procedural basis did not support the state court\u2019s denial of his claim. Alternatively, he argues that either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice excused his procedural default. Gay further argues that the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>cutor violated <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), by improperly commenting on his failure to testify in support of his theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition. <em>McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). Whether a claim is subject to procedural default is a mixed question of fact and law that we also review de novo. <em>Doorbal v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>572 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Where a state adjudicates a habeas petitioner\u2019s claims on the merits, our review is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Williams v. Allen, </em>598 F.3d 778, 787 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under such circumstances, a federal court may only grant habeas relief if the state court\u2019s merits adjudication: \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The petitioner bears the burden of establishing his right to habeas relief and proving all of the facts necessary to demonstrate a constitutional violation. <em>Romine v. Head, </em>253 F.3d 1349, 1357 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">A state-court decision is contrary to federal law if the court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the United States Supreme Court on a question of law, or if the state court decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a materially indistinguishable set of facts. <em>Dingle v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>480 F.3d 1092, 1098 (11th Cir.2007). Likewise, a state-court decision is an unreasonable application of federal law where the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle, but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the case before it. <em>See Ventura v. Att\u2019y Gen., Fla., </em>419 F.3d 1269, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Ultimately, a state court\u2019s merits determination precludes federal habeas relief where fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether the state court correctly decided the claim. <em>See Lawrence v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>700 F.3d 464, 476 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1807, 185 L.Ed.2d 826 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">An \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d is any state-court decision that does not rest solely upon a state procedural bar, including summary dispositions. See <em>Loggins v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1204, 1217 (11th Cir.2011). The Supreme Court has held that when a federal claim is presented to a state court, federal courts may presume that the state court adjudicated the petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits absent any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary. <em>See Harrington v. </em>Richter,-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 784-85, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). This \u201cpresumption may be overcome when there is reason to think some other explanation for the state court\u2019s decision is more likely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785. We have subsequently held that we will presume that the state court adjudicated the petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits unless the state court clearly stated that its decision was based solely upon a state procedural rule. <em>See Loggins, </em>654 F.3d at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">A federal court, however, will not review questions of federal law that are presented in a habeas petition where the state court rested its decision upon a state-law ground that is both independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment. <em>Doorbal, </em>572 F.3d at 1227. We apply a three-part test to determine whether a state-court judgment rested upon an independent and adequate state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>law ground: (1) the last state court rendering judgment must have clearly and expressly stated that it was relying upon state procedural rules to resolve the federal claim without reaching the merits; (2) \u201cthe state court\u2019s decision must rest solidly on state law grounds, and may not be intertwined with an interpretation of federal law\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe state procedural rule must be adequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In order to constitute an adequate state-law ground, the state procedural rule must be \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed.\u201d <em>Payne v. Allen, </em>539 F.3d 1297, 1313 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, a petitioner\u2019s procedural default may be excused if he demonstrates cause for his default and \u201cactual prejudice from the alleged constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1157 (11th Cir.2010). His procedural default may also be excused if he demonstrates a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 314-15, 326-27, 115 S.Ct. 851, 860-61, 867, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The Fifth Amendment guards a criminal defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination, and to this end, a prosecutor may not comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Griffin, </em>380 U.S. at 615, 85 S.Ct. at 1233. A defendant\u2019s rights are violated where the prosecutor\u2019s statement was either \u201cmanifestly intended to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify,\u201d or \u201cof such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on\u201d the defendant\u2019s silence. <em>Isaacs v. Head, </em>300 F.3d 1232, 1270 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have strictly enforced the defendant\u2019s burden to make such a showing, and the inquiry is not simply whether a jury possibly or even probably would view the statement in such a manner. <em>Id. </em>Rather, we must determine only \u201cwhether the jury necessarily would have done so.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In applying this test, we look to the context in which the prosecutor made the challenged statement in order to determine the manifest intention that prompted it, as well as the natural and necessary impact that it might have upon the jury. <em>Solomon v. Kemp, </em>735 F.2d 395, 401 (11th Cir.1984). A comment on the failure of the defense, as opposed to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, to counter or explain the testimony presented or evidence introduced does not impinge upon a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Duncan v. Stynchcombe, </em>704 F.2d 1213, 1215-16 (11th Cir.1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\"><em>Griffin </em>errors are subject to harmless error review. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24-26, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828-29, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (applying harmless error review to the defendants\u2019 <em>Griffin </em>claim). While a federal constitutional error may be considered harmless on direct review if the reviewing court can determine that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see Mansfield v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>679 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 861, 184 L.Ed.2d 675 (2013), a federal constitutional error is considered harmless on collateral review unless there is \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cActual prejudice\u201d requires that the error have had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d upon the verdict. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Under this standard, an error is not harmless where one is left in grave doubt as to whether the error substantially and injuriously affected or influenced the verdict. <em>See O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 437-38, 115 S.Ct. 992, 995, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Here, as an initial matter, although the state argues that Gay\u2019s federal habeas petition was untimely, we need not decide that issue, which the district court did not reach. Next, because no state court clearly and expressly stated that it decided Gay\u2019s <em>Griffin </em>claims solely upon a state procedural rule, it is not clear whether Gay\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted. Even assuming <em>arguendo, </em>however, that Gay\u2019s <em>Griffin </em>claims are not procedurally defaulted, we conclude that they are merit-less. Gay argues that the state improperly commented upon his failure to testify by arguing that: (1) the jury should base its verdict upon the credible evidence that it heard from the witness stand; (2) nobody testified that Finch tripped on the oak tree roots; (3) \u201cnot one scintilla\u201d of evidence supported the theory that Finch tripped on the oak tree roots; and (4) the jury should base its verdict on the witness testimony and evidentiary exhibits. Gay claims that these comments are fairly susceptible to being taken as comments on his failure to testify, inasmuch as only Gay could provide testimony contradicting Finch\u2019s factual account. He further argues that a jury would naturally understand the state\u2019s closing arguments as a comment on his failure to testify. Finally, Gay contends that the state\u2019s closing arguments prejudiced him because any statement that is reasonably susceptible to being interpreted as a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence creates a high risk of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s challenged statements were more likely comments on the failure of Gay\u2019s defense to explain or counter evidence of his guilt, rather than statements that were manifestly intended to comment on his failure to testify or that were naturally and necessarily interpreted as such. Accordingly, a jury would not have necessarily interpreted the state\u2019s arguments as improper comments on Gay\u2019s failure to testify, but could have plausibly taken them as comments on the quality of the evidence that Gay in fact presented. The prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments did not violate <em>Griffin. See Isaacs, </em>300 F.3d at 1270-71; <em>Duncan, </em>704 F.2d at 1215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Even assuming <em>Griffin </em>errors, the trial court\u2019s jury instructions rendered them harmless. The trial court instructed the jury regarding the state\u2019s burden of proof on multiple occasions, advising the jury that the state had to prove Gay\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Conversely, it instructed the jury that Gay enjoyed a presumption of innocence that remained with him unless the state bore its burden to prove his guilt, and that Gay held no burden to prove his innocence, present evidence, or otherwise prove or disprove anything. Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that Gay had the fundamental right not to testify, and that the jury could not hold Gay\u2019s decision not to testify against him in any manner. These instructions cured any prejudice that may have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments. As a result, Gay cannot demonstrate that any <em>Griffin </em>error substantially and injuriously affected or influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See O\u2019Neal, </em>513 U.S. at 437-38, 115 S.Ct. at 995; <em>Brecht, 507 </em>U.S. at 637-38, 113 S.Ct. at 1721-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the state court\u2019s denials of Gay\u2019s <em>Griffin </em>claims were not contrary to, and did not constitute an unreasonable application <em>of Griffin. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
