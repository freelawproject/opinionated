Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is proper if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). The party opposing summary judgment must present more than \u201c[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of [its] position ...; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the BOR because the record was unable to expose the BOR\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Simmons\u2019s termination\u2014 violation of work rules \u2014 as a pretext for retaliation. Although the investigation that led to his termination did not fully comply with employer-specified investigatory procedures, Simmons did not show that the investigation was conducted differently than other investigations or that the technical deviations \u2014 for example, a failure to record a complainant\u2019s interrogation \u2014 were due to a retaliatory motive. Besides, the record shows that the decision makers had a good faith reason \u2014 honest belief of work rule violations \u2014 for terminating Simmons\u2019s employment. For background, see <em>Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
