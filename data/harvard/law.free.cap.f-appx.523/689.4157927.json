App. C, Amend. 750 (2011). Johnson \u00e1rgues that he is entitled to relief because his sentence for conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine base yielded an applicable offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 that was higher than his career offender offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Specifically, Johnson\u2019s total offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 was 40 while his total offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1 was 37. The offense level of 40 was used to establish his Guideline range. Based on this, he asserts that he was sentenced \u201cbased on\u201d a Guideline range subsequently reduced by retroactive amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-22\">Johnson is not eligible for relief, however, because even under Amendment 750, which affected only the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense calculation, his Guideline range would have remained the same. It is not disputed that with the benefit of Amendment 750, Johnson\u2019s new \u00a7 2D1.1 total offense level would have been 36, which would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>yielded a lesser Guideline range. But neither is it disputed that the district court found that Johnson qualified as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. As a career offender with an offense level of 37, Johnson\u2019s recommended Guideline range was 360 months to life, the same as his Guideline range when sentenced with an offense level of 40. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), \u201cif the offense level for a career offender ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from ... this subsection shall apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). This means that even if Amendment 750 had been in effect at the time of his original sentencing, Johnson would have been sentenced as a career offender with the same Guideline range. A reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is therefore not authorized. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201ca reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline </em>\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">. Johnson also argues that <em>Moore </em>was abrogated by <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), and that therefore he is entitled to relief even assuming that the career offender guidelines govern his sentence. However, as Johnson acknowledges, we have rejected that argument and <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this circuit. See <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Moore </em>was not abrogated by Freeman), cert. denied,-U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
