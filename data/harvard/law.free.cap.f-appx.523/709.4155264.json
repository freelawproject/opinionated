No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In September 2006, Lane accepted a probationary position as Director of CACC\u2019s Community Intensive Training for Youth Program (\u201cCITY\u201d), a program for at-risk youth. Soon after assuming his duties, Lane audited CITY\u2019s finances and discovered that then-state representative Suzanne Schmitz was listed on CITY\u2019s payroll but was not reporting for work and had not otherwise performed tangible work for the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">When Lane raised his concerns about Schmitz internally, he was warned by CACC\u2019s then-president and by CACC\u2019s lawyer that terminating Schmitz\u2019s employment could have negative repercussions for both Lane and CACC. Despite these warnings, Lane terminated Schmitz\u2019s employment with CITY after Schmitz refused to report to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Schmitz filed a lawsuit seeking to get her job back. Schmitz also commented to another CITY employee that she planned to \u201cget [Lane] back\u201d for terminating her and that, if Lane requested money from the state legislature, she would tell him \u201cyou\u2019re fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Soon after Schmitz\u2019s job termination, the FBI began investigating Schmitz and contacted Lane for information. Lane testified before a federal grand jury and\u2014 pursuant to a subpoena \u2014 testified at Schmitz\u2019s August 2008 federal criminal trial for mail fraud and fraud involving a program receiving federal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Lane testified that Schmitz had not reported to work and had not submitted time sheets. Lane described a couple of telephone conversations he had with Schmitz during which Lane asked about Schmitz\u2019s work responsibilities and explained that he needed to account for her day-to-day activities for CITY. Lane instructed Schmitz\u2014 verbally and in writing \u2014 to start reporting daily to CITY\u2019s Huntsville office. Over the phone, Schmitz responded by telling Lane that she had gotten her job through her connections with the Executive Secretary of the Alabama Education Association. Schmitz later sent a letter in which she refused to report to the Huntsville office and requested that she be allowed to \u201ccontinue to serve the CITY Program in the same manner as [she had] in the past.\u201d Lane testified the he had expressed his concerns about Schmitz\u2019s position with CACC\u2019s interim president, who agreed that Lane needed to get Schmitz to report to work. Lane testified to these facts again at Schmitz\u2019s second criminal trial in February 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">In late 2008 \u2014 due to substantial budget cuts \u2014 Lane and Franks began discussing the possibility of employee layoffs, including laying off all probationary employees. In January 2009, Franks sent termination letters to 29 CITY employees with less than 3 years of service, which included Lane. A few days later, however, Franks rescinded nearly all of those terminations: Lane was one of only two employees whose termination was not rescinded. According to Franks, he rescinded the other terminations after discovering that many of the CITY employees were not in fact probationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Lane filed a civil action against Franks \u2014 in both his official and individual capacity \u2014 alleging that Franks terminated Lane in retaliation for testifying against Schmitz, in violation of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Franks\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Although the district court couched its decision in terms of qualified immunity, it determined that Lane\u2019s speech was made pursuant to his official duties as CITY\u2019s Director, not as a citizen on a matter of public concern. We reach the same conclusion. Because Lane has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, we do not decide about Franks\u2019s defense of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we view the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Shop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if the evidence establishes \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCormick v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>333 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">To establish a claim of retaliation for protected speech under the First Amendment, a public employee must show, among other things, that he \u201cspoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>See Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1958, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006) (a decision further restricting public employees\u2019 protected speech). A government employee whose speech is made pursuant to his official duties is not speaking as a citizen. <em>See id. </em>at 1960; <em>Battle v. Bd. of Regents, </em>468 F.3d 755, 760 (11th Cir.2006). Even if an employee was not required to make the speech as part of his official duties, he enjoys no First Amendment protection if his speech \u201cowes its existence to [the] employee\u2019s professional responsibilities\u201d and is \u201ca product that \u2018the employer itself has commissioned or created\u2019 \u201d. <em>See Abdur-Rahman v. Walker, </em>567 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Whether the subject speech was made by the public employee speaking as a citizen or as part of the employee\u2019s job responsibilities is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>See Vila v. Padron, </em>484 F.3d 1334, 1339 (1 1th Cir.2007). In determining whether a government employee\u2019s statement is protected by the First Amendment, \u201cwe look to the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Abdur-Rahman, </em>567 F.3d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">In <em>Morris v. Crow, </em>we determined that a police officer\u2019s speech \u2014 which consisted of the officer\u2019s accident report and his <em>subpoenaed </em>deposition testimony made in conjunction with judicial proceedings, \u201creit-eratfing]\u201d the observations made in his accident report \u2014 was unentitled to First Amendment protection. 142 F.3d 1379 (11th Cir.1998). Because the officer prepared his accident report in the normal course of his official duties, the report did not constitute speech \u201cmade primarily in the employee\u2019s role as citizen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>1382. And because the officer\u2019s deposition testimony was given merely \u201cin compliance with a subpoena to testify truthfully\u201d \u2014 and not as a \u201cpublic comment on sheriffs office policies and procedures, the internal workings of the department, the quality of its employees or upon any issue at all\u201d \u2014 it was unprotected under the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 1382-83 (\u201cThe mere fact that Morris\u2019s statements were made in the context of a civil deposition cannot transform them into constitutionally protected speech.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">No one disputes that Lane was acting pursuant to his official duties as CITY\u2019S Director when he investigated Schmitz\u2019s work activities, spoke with Schmitz and other CACC officials about Schmitz\u2019s employment, and ultimately terminated Schmitz\u2019s employment. That Lane testified about his official activities pursuant to a subpoena and in the litigation context, in and of itself, does not bring Lane\u2019s speech within the protection of the First Amendment. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, because formal job descriptions do not control, that Lane\u2019s official duties did not distinctly require him to testify at criminal trials falls short of triggering First Amendment protection. <em>See Abdur-Rahman, </em>567 F.3d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Although not dispositive, we consider it pertinent that the subject matter of Lane\u2019s testimony touched only on acts he performed as part of his official duties. <em>See Abdur-Rahman, </em>567 F.3d at 1282. As in <em>Morris, </em>nothing evidences that Lane testified at Schmitz\u2019s trial \u201cprimarily in [his] role as a citizen\u201d or that his testimony was an attempt to comment publicly on CITY\u2019s internal operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In the light of our precedents, the record fails to establish that Lane testified as a citizen on a matter of public concern: as a matter of law, he cannot state a claim for retaliation under the First Amendment. Franks was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">. On appeal, Lane has abandoned expressly (1) his claims against <em>CACC; </em>(2) his claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>for violation of the Alabama State Employee Protection Act, Ala.Code \u00a7 36-26A-3; (3) his claims for violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985; and (4) his claim for money damages against Franks in his official capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. Having concluded that Lane failed to establish even a <em>prima facie </em>case for a violation of a federal right, we necessarily also conclude that Lane failed to demonstrate that Franks violated a federal right of Lane\u2019s that was already clearly established before Franks acted. Thus, even if \u2014 if, which we think is not correct \u2014 a constitutional violation of Lane\u2019s First Amendment rights occurred in these circumstances, Franks would be entitled to qualified immunity in his personal capacity. <em>See Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir.2002) (government officials acting within the scope of their discretionary authority are immune from individual civil liability if the official's conduct violates no \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-19\">. Other circuits seem to have decided this issue differently. <em>See Morales v. Jones, </em>494 F.3d 590, 598 (7th Cir.2007) (concluding that a public employee\u2019s subpoenaed deposition testimony about speech he made pursuant to his official duties was protected by the First Amendment); <em>Reilly v. City of Atlantic City, </em>532 F.3d 216 (3d Cir.2008) (explaining that a police officer's trial testimony was protected by the First Amendment because, although the testimony stemmed from the officer\u2019s official duties, the officer had an \"independent obligation as a citizen to testify truthfully.\u201d). But <em>Morris </em>is the law in this Circuit on the question of public employee speech per a subpoena in the context of judicial proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
