After review, we affirm Bodison\u2019s convictions and sentences. However, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>instructions that the district court correct a clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A. Indictment and Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In 2011, a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Florida returned a four-count indictment against defendant Bodi-son and a co-defendant, Roderick Mobley. Count 1 charged Bodison and Mobley with conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), and 846; Count 2 charged both defendants with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C); Count 8 charged Bodison with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute crack cocaine, methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (\u201cMDMA\u201d or \u201cEcstasy\u201d), and N-Benzylpiperazine (\u201cBZP\u201d), in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C); and Count 4 charged Bodison with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute both crack cocaine and MDMA, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">B. \u201cOperation Woodchop\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">At trial, the evidence showed that the charges resulted from \u201cOperation Wood-chop,\u201d a 17-month investigation of drug and firearm trafficking in the area around Zellwood and Tangerine, Florida. This investigation eventually led to the arrests of between 60 and 70 individuals. During the course of Operation Woodchop, law enforcement officers recruited a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d), Keith Brown, to conduct three controlled purchases from Bodison.</p>\n<p id=\"AGS\">C. June 15, 2011 Controlled Purchase</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">The first controlled purchase occurred on June 15, 2011. On that date, Cl Brown met defendant Mobley at a predetermined location in Zellwood. Mobley then entered Brown\u2019s vehicle and instructed him to drive to Bodison\u2019s residence, located at 6360 Wadsworth Road, Zellwood, Florida. There, Brown gave $800 to Mobley, who entered the house and purchased seven grams of crack cocaine from defendant Bodison while Brown waited in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">D. June 28, 2011 Controlled Purchase</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">On June 28, 2011, Cl Brown completed the second controlled purchase. This time, Brown drove directly to defendant Bodison\u2019s house on Wadsworth Road. There, Brown found Bodison standing in a shed adjacent to the house, cooking crack cocaine. That day, Brown purchased from defendant Bodison $1,000 worth of crack cocaine, MDMA, and BZP.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">E. August 5, 2011 Controlled Purchase</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Five weeks later, on August 5, 2011, the third controlled purchase occurred. Again, Cl Brown drove to defendant Bodi-son\u2019s house. There, he found Bodison sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle parked in the driveway. Brown approached the vehicle and, through the window, saw what he later described as \u201ca pistol\u201d lying on the passenger\u2019s seat. Defendant Bodison agreed to sell Brown a \u201chalf circle\u201d of crack cocaine and 20 MDMA tablets. Bodison exited the vehicle, walked to a nearby wood line and removed drugs from a paper bag lying on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">Bodison then reentered his vehicle. At that time, Brown leaned into the vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and paid Bodison $460 for the drugs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">F. Motion for Acquittal, Verdict, and Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">After the government rested its case, Bodison moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts. The district court denied the motion as to the three substantive drug charges in Counts 2, 3, and 4, and reserved ruling as to the conspiracy charge in Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The jury found Bodison guilty on all four counts. The jury found that the Count 4 offense (based on the August 5, 2011 controlled purchase) involved crack cocaine but did not involve MDMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Defendant Bodison moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(b)(2). Bodison argued that the government\u2019s background evidence about Operation Woodchop violated Rules 404(b) and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and that the admission of this evidence had prevented him from receiving a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The district court granted defendant Bodison\u2019s pending motion for acquittal as to the conspiracy count, finding that there was no evidence that Bodison and Mobley had formed an agreement to distribute drugs to Cl Brown. The district court denied the motion for a new trial, determining that the Operation Woodchop evidence did not run afoul of Rule 404(b). Even if it did, the district court concluded that the evidence did not substantially influence the jury\u2019s verdict, and, therefore, any error in admitting it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">G. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Bodison was responsible for 27 grams of crack cocaine and 5.15 grams of MDMA and BZP, which resulted in a base offense level of 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(8). The PSI applied a 2-level increase under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) because Bod-ison possessed a firearm in connection with his offense, leading to an adjusted offense level of 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">The PSI classified Bodison as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 due to his prior 2005 conviction for fleeing or attempting elude, and his 2007 conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, which resulted in a total offense level of 34. Although Bodison\u2019s criminal record originally warranted a criminal history category of IV, his career offender designation automatically placed him into a criminal history category of VI, yielding a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">Bodison filed written objections to the PSI, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the two-level increase for possessing a firearm, and (2) his designation as a career offender. Bodison argued that he never possessed a firearm, was not charged with possessing a firearm, was never seen holding or carrying a firearm, and that no firearm was ever recovered from him. Bodison asserted that Cl Brown made only a \u201cvague reference to a firearm being on the seat of the car,\u201d and that Brown may have seen something only resembling a firearm, such as a toy or a BB gun. As to the career offender designation, Bodison argued that his 2005 conviction for fleeing or eluding was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines, and that the 2007 drug conviction could not be authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>H. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">At the sentencing hearing, defendant Bodison reiterated his objection to the firearm increase, contending that (1) the only evidence of a gun was Cl Brown\u2019s statement about seeing a pistol on the seat of Bodison\u2019s car; (2) the pistol Brown saw may not have been a real gun; and (3) Brown was not credible because he had denied using or selling drugs at trial, and yet belonged to a drug gang. Bodison also reiterated his objection to the career-offender designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The district court overruled Bodison\u2019s objection to the firearm increase, finding that the government proved his possession of a firearm by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court sustained Bodison\u2019s objection to the career offender designation, concluding that there was insufficient evidence in the record to determine whether his prior conviction for fleeing or eluding qualified as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Given these rulings, the district court set Bodison\u2019s offense level at 26 and placed him into a criminal history category of IV (as calculated by the PSI before the career offender designation), which yielded an advisory guidelines range of 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The district court imposed a within-guidelines sentence of 100 months on each of Counts 2, 3, and 4, to run concurrently, and a total 6-year term of supervised release. The district court explained that a 100-month total sentence was appropriate in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and noted that it would have imposed the same sentence even if Bodison was classified as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Bodison timely appealed his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">II. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">A. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dortch, </em>696 F.3d 1104, 1110 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 993, 184 L.Ed.2d 771 (2013). Where the defendant did not object contemporaneously at trial to the admission of the testimony that later forms the basis of his motion for a new trial, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Nixon, </em>918 F.2d 895, 904-05 (11th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that the purpose of requiring contemporaneous objections is (1) to protect judicial resources \u201cby ensuring that the trial courts will have an opportunity to avoid errors that might otherwise necessitate time-consuming retrial,\u201d and (2) to \u201cprevent counsel from \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the courts by withholding a valid objection from the trial court in order to obtain a new trial when the error is recognized on appeal\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">B. Rules 404(b) and 403</p>\n<p id=\"b633-18\">Before reviewing the particular evidence Bodison claims should not have been admitted, we set forth the general Rule 404(b) and Rule 403 principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Rule 404(b) provides that \u201c[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1). We previously explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">evidence of criminal activity other than the charged offenses ... falls outside the scope of the Rule when it is \u201c(1) an uncharged offense which arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, (2) necessary to complete the story of the crime, or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1344 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1205 n. 9 (11th Cir.2005)). Evidence is \u201cinextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense\u201d when it \u201cforms an \u2018integral and natural part of the witness\u2019s accounts of the circumstances surrounding the offenses for which the defendant was indicted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edouard, </em>485 F.3d at 1344 (quoting <em>United States v. Foster, </em>889 F.2d 1049, 1053 (11th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Even if it is not barred by Rule 404(b), evidence of other criminal activity \u201cmust still satisfy the requirements of Rule 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under Rule 403, a district court \u201cmay exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">C. Statements About Operation Wood-chop</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">On appeal, defendant Bodison argues that the district court was required to grant his motion for a new trial because the court violated Rule 404(b) by admitting testimony from law enforcement witnesses that the investigation and prosecution of Bodison stemmed from Operation Wood-chop. Because Bodison did not object at trial to the statements regarding Operation Woodchop on Rule 404(b) grounds, we review the admission of these statements for plain error. <em>See Nixon, </em>918 F.2d at 904-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">A review of the record establishes that three of the government\u2019s witnesses mentioned Operation Woodchop. First, Detective Grant Meade of the Orange County Sheriffs Office (\u201cOCSO\u201d) explained that he had first begun conducting surveillance of Bodison while working on Operation Woodchop. Detective Meade stated that Operation Woodchop involved \u201ca two-month wiretap and several hours of physical surveillance as well\u201d around \u201c[pjretty much the whole area of Zellwood.\u201d He also stated that he had recruited Brown to work as a Cl in the broader investigation and that Brown had performed controlled purchases from various drug dealers, including Bodison, during the two-year investigation. Second, Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) Special Agent Dominick Braccio testified that he had worked on \u201cthe case on Mr. Bodison, as well as an operation known as Operation Woodchop which encompassed several more individuals in a larger area.\u201d Third, Special Agent Joshua Baker, also with the DEA, testified that he had been the \u201clead agent over the entire case.... not just Mr. Bodison, but all other defendants and targets [the law enforcement agencies] were investigating.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>These brief references to Operation Woodchop provided context to the witnesses\u2019 investigations of Bodison. They were \u201cnatural part[s] of the witness[es\u2019] accounts of the circumstances surrounding the offenses,\u201d and therefore were outside of Rule 404(b)\u2019s scope. <em>See Edouard, </em>485 F.3d at 1344 (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the effect of the Operation Woodchop references was not so unfairly prejudicial as to substantially outweigh their probative value in violation of Rule 403. Because the testimony about Operation Woodchop was not barred by Rules 404(b) or 408, the district court committed no abuse of discretion, much less plain error, in denying Bodisoris motion for a new trial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">D. Brown\u2019s Statements About a Murder and About Being Shot</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Bodison next argues that a new trial was warranted because the district court violated Rule 404(b) by admitting Cl Brown\u2019s testimony that (1) the intersection where Brown and Mobley arranged to meet on June 15, 2011 was where Brown\u2019s former acquaintance, Bradley Blanton, had been killed; and, (2) during the course of Operation Woodchop, Cl Brown \u201cgot shot at twice.\u201d Bodisoris arguments fail for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"Apz\">First, although Bodison objected at trial to Brown\u2019s two statements, he did not challenge these statements in his motion for a new trial. The district court could not have abused its discretion in declining to grant a motion for a new trial on grounds not even raised in that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Second, even if we were to construe Bodisoris appellate brief as directly challenging the district court\u2019s admission of Cl Brown\u2019s two statements (rather than challenging the denial of a motion for new trial), his arguments fail. \u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion, but will reverse only if the error may have had a substantial influence on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Augustin, </em>661 F.3d 1105, 1127 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In this case, even if the admission of Cl Brown\u2019s two statements was erroneous, it could not have substantially influenced the trial. As for Brown\u2019s testimony about the death of his former acquaintance, Bradley Blanton, Brown testified that, while waiting to conduct a controlled purchase from defendant Mobley on June 15, 2011, Brown stood at an intersection where \u201cBrad got killed at.\u201d When the government attempted to elicit details about Blanton\u2019s death, Bodison objected on relevance grounds and the district court sustained the objection. There was no suggestion whatsoever that Bodison had anything to do with Blanton\u2019s killing, and Bodison does not explain how this statement was otherwise prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">As for Cl Brown\u2019s testimony about being \u201cshot at twice,\u201d Brown made this statement during the course of questions regarding payments he received from the DEA for his work as a Cl and for relocation expenses. Specifically, the government asked whether anything happened to cause Brown to fear for his safety, and, over Bodison\u2019s objections, Brown responded: \u201cWell, I got shot at twice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Again, there was no suggestion that Bodison had anything to do with this shooting. In fact, when the district court expressed concern that Brown\u2019s testimony was \u201cgetting something in that shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the government expressly stated that it was \u201cnot suggesting that Mr. Bodison had anything to do with [Brown being shot at].\u201d Cl Brown agreed, testifying: \u201cnot him, just over the whole investigation, what we [were] talking about, I got shot at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>twice_[i]n Zellwood.\u201d Afterwards, the district court advised the government to \u201cmove on\u201d and the government returned to the broader discussion of payments Brown received for his Cl work.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In light of the foregoing, there is no possibility that the admission of Brown\u2019s statements about the death of Blanton and being shot at, even if erroneous, had \u201ca substantial influence on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>See Augustin, </em>661 F.3d at 1127 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the district court on this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">III. EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE UNDER <em>BRADY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Bodison also argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the government withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Specifically, Bodison contends that the government failed to disclose the fact that Cl Brown had been a member of a gang that sold drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Because Bodison did not make this argument in his motion for a new trial, we review it only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1293 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cWhen a defendant does not raise a <em>Brady </em>objection in his motion for a new trial, [this Court] need only conduct a plain error review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97. To establish the existence of a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must show that: (1) the government possessed favorable evidence, including impeachment evidence; (2) the defendant did not possess the evidence, and he could not obtain it himself through reasonable diligence; (3) the government suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1234 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cFailure to meet any one of these elements will defeat a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Starrett, 55 </em>F.3d 1525, 1554 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[a] \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 109-10, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Bodison satisfied the first and third elements because the government knew that Brown had been a member of a gang that dealt drugs, and failed to disclose this information before trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bodison, however, did not establish the fourth element&amp;emdash; that a reasonable probability exists that disclosure of Brown\u2019s experience as a gang member would have resulted in a different outcome in the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Bodison argues that a \u201creasonable probability\u201d exists because Brown\u2019s having been in a gang would have damaged his credibility, and, according to Bodison, \u201c[t]he whole case rested upon ... Brown\u2019s credibility.\u201d Bodison\u2019s argument fails because the whole case did not, in fact, rest on Brown\u2019s credibility&amp;emdash;there was ample evidence, in addition to Brown\u2019s testimony, to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">For example, the jury heard audio recordings from the June 28, 2011 controlled purchase, during which the jury listened to defendant Bodison (1) cook crack cocaine; (2) give instructions to Brown on how to cook crack cocaine; and (3) advise Brown on how to sell crack cocaine without being robbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The jury also heard the testimony of Detective Paul Harvey of the Tavares, Florida Police Department. Detective Harvey, working undercover, was with Brown during the August 5, 2011 controlled purchase. Detective Harvey directly corroborated Brown\u2019s testimony about the controlled purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Other law enforcement officers provided some corroboration for Brown\u2019s accounts of the other two controlled purchases. Specifically, Detective Meade testified about the June 15, 2011 and June 28, 2011 controlled purchases. Detective Meade was in concealed surveillance positions during these controlled purchases. Special Agents Braccio and Baker testified that they also observed the June 28, 2011 controlled purchase from a concealed location that was approximately 30 yards from Bodison\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Moreover, witnesses also testified about (1) the precautions that law enforcement officers took to ensure that any drugs that Brown turned over after a controlled purchase actually came from Bodison (either directly or through Mobley), and not from some other source; (2) the chains of custody for the drugs recovered during the June 28, 2011 and August 5, 2011 controlled purchases; and (3) the chemical analyses performed on the drugs recovered during the controlled purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">In light of this extensive evidence, we conclude that defendant Bodison has not shown a reasonable probability that even if the jury heard about Brown\u2019s prior gang affiliation, it would have found Bodison not guilty on any count. Consequently, any failure by the government to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Brown\u2019s prior gang affiliation does not entitle Bodison to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">IV. SECTION 2Dl.l(b)(l) ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In challenging his sentence, Bodison argues that the district court improperly applied the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing \u201ca dangerous weapon (including a firearm)\u201d in connection with his drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for clear error, and the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts de <em>novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides for a two-level increase to a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The enhancement is appropriate \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.ll(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">To justify a \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) firearms enhancement, \u201cthe government must either establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct or prove that the defendant possessed the firearm during conduct associated with the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006). If the government meets this initial burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate \u201cthat a connection between the weapon and the offense was \u2018clearly improbable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">In this case, the district court did not clearly err in finding that defendant Bodison possessed a firearm during his drug offense. Brown testified at trial that, during the August 5, 2011 controlled purchase, he saw \u201ca pistol\u201d lying \u201c[o]n the seat\u201d of Bodison\u2019s vehicle. Detective Harvey testified that Bodison was sitting in the vehicle when Brown handed him the money. This testimony sufficiently establishes that Bodison possessed a firearm during the charged conduct, thereby fulfilling the government\u2019s initial burden. <em>See Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220; <em>see also United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 91-92 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cCases decided under \u00a7 2D1.1 recognize that proximity between guns and drugs, without more, is sufficient to meet the government\u2019s initial burden under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).\u201d). And we have no reason to doubt that the district court properly credited Brown\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002) (stating that we must accept the district court\u2019s credibility determinations unless the disputed testimony \u201cis contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">Because the government proved that defendant Bodison possessed a firearm during the August 5 drug transaction, the burden shifted to Bodison to show that the \u201cconnection between the weapon and the offense was \u2018clearly improbable.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220. Bodison failed to meet this burden. Nothing in the record suggests that it was \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the firearm was connected to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Defendant Bodison argues that the firearm was not connected to the offense because Brown observed the gun lying on the seat of Bodison\u2019s vehicle, whereas the actual drug transaction occurred outside of the vehicle. We disagree. Even if the actual drug-money exchange on August 5 occurred outside of Bodison\u2019s vehicle, the firearm was still close enough for Bodison to use it against Brown. <em>See Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 92 (\u201cWhile ... facts, such as whether the firearm is loaded, or inside a locked container, might be relevant to negate a connection, there is a strong presumption that a defendant aware of the weapon\u2019s presence will think of using it if his illegal activities are threatened. The firearm\u2019s <em>potential </em>use is critical.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 847 (11th Cir.1998) (affirming the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement, even though the firearm was in a different room within a warehouse where the drug transaction occurred, because the evidence supported the conclusion that that \u201cthe gun was there for personal security in the event something went wrong in connection with the drug trafficking transaction\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In light of the foregoing, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in applying the two-level enhancement to Bodi-son\u2019s offense level provided for in \u00a7 201.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">V. ACCURACY OF THE JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Although the parties do not address it, we raise <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of whether the final judgment accurately reflects Bodison\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The final written judgment reflects his conviction on Count 4 for an offense involving crack cocaine, MDMA, and BZP. However, Count 4 alleged that Bodison\u2019s offense involved only crack cocaine and MDMA. The jury found that the offense involved only crack cocaine. Therefore, the judgment should state that, on Count 4, Bodison was convicted of an offense involving only crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for the district court to correct the clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Bodison\u2019s convictions and sentences. We remand for the district court to correct the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\">. Mobley later pled guilty to Count 2, and the government dismissed the conspiracy charge (Count 1) against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-11\">. At trial, a forensic chemist who analyzed the drugs acquired during the August 5, 2011 controlled purchase stated that defendant Bodison had actually sold Brown a quantity of 5-methoxy-N, N-diisopropyltryptamine, in addition to crack cocaine. The chemist testified that this drug resembled, but was different from, MDMA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\">. To satisfy the plain-error standard, we must find that (1) the district court committed \"error\u201d in that \"a legal rule was violated,\u201d (2) the error was plain or \"obvious,\u201d and (3) the error \"affect[ed] substantial rights\u201d in that the error was prejudicial and not harmless. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these criteria are met, we may, in our discretion, correct the plain error if the error \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735-36, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\">. The government also sought to solicit testimony regarding controlled drug purchases from other targets of the investigation; however the district court excluded such testimony on relevance grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b636-10\">. We also reject Bodison\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s introduction of this evidence violated the district court\u2019s pretrial order excluding Rule 404(b) evidence. In that pretrial order, the district court excluded (1) evidence of Bodison\u2019s prior conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell, and (2) testimony from a proposed witness, Theresa Hawkins. The district court did not exclude <em>all </em>evidence potentially subject to Rule 404(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b636-13\">. To the extent that Bodison argues that the district court abused its discretion when it did not hold a hearing on his motion for a new trial, this argument is deemed abandoned. Bodison mentions it only in a heading of his brief, and does not return to the issue in an argument section. <em>See Cheffer v. Reno, </em>55 F.3d 1517, 1519 n. 1 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">. Bodison argues that it was not until his sentencing hearing that he first learned that Brown had been a member of a gang that sold drugs. During that hearing, Detective Meade testified that Brown \"was a gang member involved in this gang.\u201d Bodison contends that, during his trial testimony, Detective Meade intentionally avoided referring to Brown as a gang member so as not to damage Brown\u2019s credibility. We need not consider this argument, as bad faith is not an element to a <em>Brady </em>violation. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b637-13\">. The government argues that Bodison also has not established the second element. The government contends that \u201d[a]s a drug dealer, Bodison was part of the criminal element in Zellwood.\u201d Thus, the government concludes that \"Bodison certainly knew or easily could have learned that Brown had been a member of a Zellwood gang.\u201d Because we conclude that the Bodison has not met his burden on the fourth element, we need not address this argument on the second element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">. We reject Bodison\u2019s arguments that Brown\u2019s description of the firearm as a \"pistol,\u201d without additional details, was too vague to establish the existence of an actual firearm, or that the government was required to refute the possibility that Brown confused some other object for a firearm. Brown testified that he saw a firearm, the district court credited his testimony, and nothing in the record suggests that what Brown saw was not an actual firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">. We may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in a judgment and we may remand with instructions to the district court to correct those errors. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006). It is a fundamental error for a district court \"to enter a judgment of conviction against a defendant who has not been charged, tried, or found guilty of the crime recited in the judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
