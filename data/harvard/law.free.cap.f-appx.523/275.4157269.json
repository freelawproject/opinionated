A summary judgment, which we review <em>de novo, Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009), \u201cshall\u201d be entered \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Harris contends that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs by denying him treatment for his Hepatitis C infection and back problems. The record shows that Harris did receive treatment for those ailments and that his claim amounts to a disagreement with the treatment and a desire for more. That is not enough for a viable claim of deliberate indifference. <em>See Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, Institutional Div., </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">To the extent Harris argues that certain defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity, there is no error, because the MJ did not consider whether those defendants were entitled to that immunity. Similarly, Harris\u2019s conclusional assertions attacking the MJ\u2019s discovery and injunction rulings do not show that the MJ abused his discretion in denying the disputed motions. <em>See Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>392 F.3d 812, 817 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Women\u2019s Med. Ctr. of Nw. Houston v. Bell, </em>248 F.3d 411, 418-19 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">Because Harris has shown no error, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-13\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
