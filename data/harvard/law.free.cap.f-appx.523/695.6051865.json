On June 12, 2012, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>the district court dismissed Cabot\u2019s appeal because he had not timely filed his initial brief. Cabot filed his brief that same day. Cabot later moved for reconsideration, arguing that he had believed his appeal was docketed on May 29, 2012, because that is the date the Bankruptcy Notice of Entry was entered on the docket. The district court denied Cabot\u2019s motion for reconsideration, explaining that it was apparent from the record that Cabot\u2019s appeal was docketed on May 25, 2012, and that Cabot had failed to show excusable neglect for his belated filing. The district court also reviewed Cabot\u2019s brief, and concluded the brief was \u201cpatently meritless\u201d because \u201cit fail[ed] to sufficiently provide the Court with a basis to reverse or modify the decision of the bankruptcy court.\u201d On appeal, Cabot argues the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing his appeal. Cabot also raises arguments related to his separate appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order striking his designated issues on appeal to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">Any error that the district court may have made in dismissing Cabot\u2019s appeal for failure to comply with Bankruptcy Rule 8009(a)(l)\u2019s 14-day deadline was harmless because the district court reviewed Cabot\u2019s brief when it denied his motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9005 (incorporating Fed.R.Civ.P. 61\u2019s harmless error standard). The district court did not err in determining that Cabot\u2019s brief was without merit because he failed to raise any arguments on appeal in the district court. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that although pleadings filed by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are construed liberally, a <em>pro se </em>appellant abandons any issues not meaningfully addressed in the initial brief). Rather, Cabot\u2019s brief contained one short paragraph of argument with no citations to the record or any authority, in which he stated broadly that the bankruptcy court had attempted to prevent his appeal and acted erroneously in striking his designated issues on appeal. Moreover, Cabot\u2019s argument concerning the bankruptcy court\u2019s order striking his designated issues on appeal was not properly before the district court and is not properly before us because he has appealed that order in a separate proceeding. <em>See id. </em>(noting that where an appellant notices the appeal of a particular judgment, the reviewing court lacks jurisdiction to review other judgments or issues not expressly referenced or impliedly intended for appeal). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cabot\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
