On appeal, Hernandez asserts that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) credibility determination regarding her complaints of pain was not supported by substantial evidence. She argues that the ALJ erred in relying exclusively on the objective medical findings because her case involved pain and symptoms related to fibromyalgia, which could not be properly evaluated solely with objective testing. She further asserts that the ALJ did not provide good cause to support the decision to give little weight to the opinions of her treating physicians, Drs. J.A. Halim and Jean Pierre. Hernandez asserts that the ALJ ignored evidence regarding the severity of her conditions, and that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the consultative physicians was misplaced. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">In Social Security appeals, we treat the decision of an ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and consider whether the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">When a claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony concerning pain or other subjective symptoms, \u201cthe claimant must satisfy two parts of a three-part test showing: (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201cThe claimant\u2019s subjective testimony supported by medical evidence that satisfies the standard is itself sufficient to support a finding of disability.\u201d <em>Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir.1991) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">\u201cAfter considering a claimant\u2019s complaints of pain, the ALJ may reject them as not creditable, and that determination will be reviewed for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam). The ALJ must explicitly and adequately articulate his reasons if he discredits subjective testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>mony. <em>Id. </em>When evaluating a claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms, the ALJ must consider such things as: (1) the claimant\u2019s daily activities; (2) the nature and intensity of pain and other symptoms; (3) precipitating and aggravating factors; effects of medications; and (5) treatment or measures taken by the claimant for relief of symptoms. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3). We have recognized that fibromyalgia \u201coften lacks medical or laboratory signs, and is generally diagnosed mostly on a[n] individual\u2019s described symptoms,\u201d and that the \u201challmark\u201d of fibromyalgia is therefore \u201ca lack of objective evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">A review of the record shows that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination. The ALJ found that the objective medical records and Hernandez\u2019s self-reports to her doctors did not support the alleged severity of her symptoms, and that the records were inconsistent with the degree of impairment alleged by Hernandez. Furthermore, there was no explanation in the record or on appeal as to how Hernandez was able to walk with a normal gait and have no complaints of pain when visiting her neurological doctors, but needed a wheelchair or ankle brace and complained of debilitating pain when seeing her orthopedic doctors. Based on this record, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Hernandez\u2019s testimony regarding the severity and limiting effect of her pain was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">When evaluating an applicant\u2019s claim for social security disability benefits, the ALJ must give \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to the opinion of the applicant\u2019s treating physician \u201cunless good cause exists for not heeding the treating physician\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583 (11th Cir.1991); <em>see also Broughton v. Heckler, 776 </em>F.2d 960, 962 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (\u201cIt is not only legally relevant but unquestionably logical that the opinions, diagnosis, and medical evidence of a treating physician whose familiarity with the patient\u2019s injuries, course of treatment, and responses over a considerable length of time, should be given considerable weight.\u201d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">\u2018[Gjood cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records. When electing to disregard the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must clearly articulate its reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP-\"><em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). If the ALJ disregards or accords less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must clearly articulate his reasons, and \u201cthe failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>Callahan, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. The opinion of a reviewing, non-examining physician does not establish the good cause necessary to reject the opinion of a treating physician. <em>Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988). However, good cause may arise when a treating physician\u2019s report is wholly conclusory or not accompanied by objective medical evidence. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">A review of the record shows that the ALJ provided good cause for affording little weight to the opinions of Hernandez\u2019s treating physicians because those opinions were inconsistent with the doctors\u2019 own treatment notes and with the objective medical evidence. For example, in a letter dated September 15, 2010, Dr. Halim stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ed that the nerve tests confirmed that Hernandez\u2019s right carpal tunnel syndrome was only \u201cmild\u201d and that the pain medication seemed to help with Hernandez\u2019s lower back pain. Yet, a few days letter, on September 22, 2010, Dr. Halim wrote another letter and stated that because of Hernandez\u2019s chronic lower back pain and carpal tunnel, she could not work. Similarly, Dr. Pierre\u2019s opinion that Hernandez suffered from fibromyalgia and severe arthritis is not supported by the record. Dr. Pierre\u2019s report was limited to the time from November 1, 2007, through December 31, 2008. The record indicates that Hernandez did not report having symptoms of fibromyalgia until June 2009. Thus, the record does not support Dr. Pierre\u2019s assertion that Hernandez suffered from fibromyalgia during the relevant time period \u2014 November 1, 2007, through December 31, 2008. These inconsistencies gave the ALJ good cause to accord less weight to Hernandez\u2019s treating physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">.
