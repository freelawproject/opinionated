Bus. Credit v Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co., </em>79 NY2d 695, 702 [1992]; <em>Credit Alliance Corp. v Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>65 NY2d 536, 551 [1985]; <em>Barrett v Freifeld, </em>64 AD3d 736, 738 [2009]). Here, the defendants Bernard Chipetine and Chipetine, Neu &amp; Silverman, LLP (hereinafter together the appellants), established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Under the circumstances of this case, the evidence of \u201clinking conduct,\u201d a single phone call made by the plaintiffs accountant to the appellants, was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the appellants owed the plaintiff a duty <em>(see Security Pac. Bus. Credit v Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co., </em>79 NY2d at 704-705). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. Accordingly, the appellants were entitled to summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging negligence insofar as asserted against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In order to establish accounting fraud, the plaintiff must show representation of material fact, falsity, scienter, reliance, and damages <em>(see Barrett v Freifeld, </em>64 AD3d at 738). Since the fraud claim at issue here is based on an omission or concealment of material fact, the plaintiff must also demonstrate that the appellants had a duty to disclose material information and failed to do so <em>(id.). </em>A duty to disclose may arise where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>a fiduciary or confidential relationship, or one party\u2019s superior knowledge of essential facts renders nondisclosure inherently unfair <em>(id.). </em>With respect to the- alleged failure to disclose that the appellants and the defendant Steven Freifeld had made certain investments together unrelated to the pharmacy business Freifeld sold to the plaintiff, the appellants established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by demonstrating that there was no duty to disclose this information <em>(see Manti\u2019s Transp., Inc. v C.T. Lines, Inc., </em>68 AD3d 937, 940 [2009]). With respect to the appellants\u2019 alleged failure to disclose, in the financial documents they had prepared for Freifeld, that Freifeld had been arrested for involvement in a scheme to purchase and sell expired, counterfeit, and stolen medicine, the appellants established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by demonstrating that Freifeld\u2019s arrest was a matter of public record which could have been discovered through the exercise of ordinary diligence and, thus, the plaintiff did not justifiably rely on the appellants to disclose that information <em>(see National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v Red Apple Group, </em>273 AD2d 140, 141 [2000]; <em>Auchincloss v Allen, </em>211 AD2d 417 [1995]). In opposition to these showings, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. Accordingly, the appellants were entitled to summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging fraud insofar as asserted against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions have been rendered academic or are without merit.
