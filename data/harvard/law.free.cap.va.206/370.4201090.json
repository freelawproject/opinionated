A jury trial resulted in a verdict for defendants. After overruling plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, the trial court entered judgment on the verdict. Plaintiff is here on a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The mishap occurred on May 3, 1961, at about 12:30 p.m. on U. S. Route 340 between Charles Town, West Virginia and Berry-ville, Virginia, approximately 250 yards inside the Virginia border line. At the scene, the highway consisted of one northbound lane and one southbound lane which were divided by a broken white line. The weather was clear, and the macadam surface of the road was dry. Wagner, the plaintiff, was operating his automobile in the southbound lane at a speed of approximately 40 to 45 miles an hour. He was accompanied by a friend, Jerry Krejcik, who rode on the front seat. The destination of the two men was Culpeper, but it \u201cwas a beautiful spring day,\u201d and they were discussing the possibility of \u201ctaking some side roads or something or another to observe the beautiful friendly countryside.\u201d Krejcik was looking at a map, and he thought that if a place could be found where the car could be driven off the roadway then he and Wagner could examine the map to determine what side roads they might take.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Plaintiff was aware that a tractor (Dove\u2019s) had been following him \u201cat a reasonable distance\u201d of \u201cmaybe two or three car lengths.\u201d As plaintiff approached a \u201cslight upgrade\u201d in the road followed by a \u201cdeclining curve to the right\u201d he \u201ceased up\u201d on the accelerator and diminished his speed, he said, \u201cslightly\u201d or about \u201cfive to ten miles an hour.\u201d At that time he did not look into his rear view mirror to determine how close the tractor was behind him. He gave no hand signal of his intention to slow down nor did he indicate such inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tion by means of his brake lights. The evidence shows that plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was traveling at a speed of 25 to 35 miles an hour in the right lane when its left rear was struck by the right front of the tractor driven by Dove. The tractor \u201cturned around in the road\u201d and faced in the opposite direction. The automobile \u201cwent forward and off to the right and over a little culvert or ditch,\u201d and was brought to a standstill by an embankment. However, there was no showing that the car was damaged. Plaintiff drove it from the scene after the accident had been investigated by a State trooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Krejcik testified that he was sitting \u201chalf sideways in the front seat\u201d as Wagner\u2019s car approached the curve; that he heard the wheels of the tractor \u201cslapping the road\u201d; and that \u201cfrom the sound of the wheels\u201d he could tell that the vehicle was \u201cbouncing.\u201d When he looked back he observed that the tractor was \u201cclosing down on us\u201d and he shouted to Wagner \u201cto hit the gas.\u201d Immediately thereafter, he said, plaintiff\u2019s car was struck in the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Dove testified that he had been following plaintiff\u2019s automobile in the southbound lane at a distance of 50 to 60 feet and at a speed of 40 miles an hour; that plaintiff\u2019s car \u201cwas gradually running slower\u201d; that without sounding his horn he drove his tractor partly into the left or northbound lane for the purpose of passing plaintiff\u2019s vehicle; that as he did so he saw the curve \u201ccoming up\u201d and could not see ahead; that he turned back into the right or southbound lane, and that plaintiff\u2019s vehicle slowed down \u201ca whole lot\u201d which he estimated to be \u201cten or fifteen miles an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Dove further testified that he suddenly applied his brakes, but the tractor \u201cstarted bouncing\u201d and struck the rear of plaintiff\u2019s automobile, and that his tractor left tire marks on the highway prior to the point of collision. Later, in response to a question propounded by the court Dove stated, contrary to what he had previously said, that plaintiff\u2019s vehicle did not start to slow down until after he had decided not to pass and had turned back into the right or southbound lane. He said that immediately after he turned back plaintiff\u2019s car \u201cstarted slowing down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Trooper D. A. Sheetz, the investigating officer, stated that he found tire marks 96 feet long in the southbound lane which began in a \u201cfairly straight line and then went off to the left or in towards the center of the road.\u201d He also observed a short set of tire marks with spaces between them \u201coff the right side of the road in a southwesterly direction.\u201d On cross-examination defendants made the trooper their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>own witness. In response to a question concerning what plaintiff had told him about the accident, the trooper stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cHe [plaintiff] said he was headed south on Route 340 and was slowing up to pull off when he found a proper place, to look at a road map, and then he got hit. He knew the truck [tractor] was behind, he didn\u2019t know how far but considered it to be a safe distance. He was not giving any sort of signal as he was not ready to turn off yet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The crucial question presented by plaintiff\u2019s assignments of error is whether the court erred in granting Instruction No. 5, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201cThe Court instructs the jury that if they believe from the greater weight of the evidence that the <em>plaintiff intended to stop, turn, or partly turn, from a direct line, </em>then it was his duty, first, to see that such movement could be made in reasonable safety, and, if the operation of the defendant\u2019s vehicle might reasonably be affected by such movement, <em>to give a signal of his intention to make such movement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201cIf the plaintiff failed in such duties and <em>suddenly slowed </em>the speed of his vehicle, he was guilty of negligence, and if the jury believe from the greater weight of the evidence that such negligence was a proximate cause of the collision, they must find a verdict for the defendants.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Plaintiff contends, among other things, that this instruction was erroneous because there was no evidence to support a finding that at the time of impact he \u201cintended to stop, turn, or partly turn, from a direct line\u201d or that he \u201csuddenly slowed\u201d the speed of his vehicle. For reasons stated <em>infra </em>we are of opinion that plaintiff\u2019s contention is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Leavitt, Adm\u2019r, </em>201 Va. 919, 926, 927, 114 S.E. 2d 732 we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">\u201cNothing is better settled in Virginia than that an instruction should not be given when there is no evidence tending to prove the facts upon which the instruction is based. 10 Michie Jur., Instructions, \u00a7 20, pages 213 <em>et seq. </em>and a multitude of cases cited.\u201d See also <em>Baker, Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>201 Va. 834, 838, 839, 114 S.E. 2d 599; <em>Gabbard </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>202 Va. 40, 47, 116 S.E. 2d 73; <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Firth, </em>202 Va. 900, 904, 121 S.E. 2d 369; <em>Irvan </em>v. <em>Oil Company, </em>205 Va. 1, 5, 135 S.E. 2d 153.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The reason for this principle of law is given in 10 M.J., Instructions, \u00a7 20, p. 213 <em>et seq., supra. </em>There it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">\u201cIt has been repeatedly held that an instruction should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>given when there is no evidence tending to prove the facts upon which the instruction is based, for the reason that the tendency of such instruction is to mislead the jury by withdrawing their attention from the legitimate points involved in the issue. Juries are sufficiently prone to indulge in conjectures, without having possible facts not in evidence suggested for their consideration. And before either party is entitled to an instruction there must be more than a scintilla of evidence introduced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The first paragraph of Instruction No. 5 was apparently based upon the provisions of Code, \u00a7 46.1-216.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no evidence adduced, however, to show that at the time of the collision plaintiff intended \u201cto * * * stop, turn or partly turn from a direct line\u201d as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">It is true that plaintiff and Krejcik were discussing the possibility of taking a side road for the purpose of sightseeing and anticipated that they would pull off the roadway and observe the map together when a proper place could be found. It is also true that trooper Sheetz testified that \u201cto the best of my recollection\u201d there was sufficient room for a motorist to pull off the hard surface onto the shoulder of the road in the vicinity of the accident. On the other hand, plaintiff testified that there was \u201cno place to pull off to the side of the road.\u201d In either event, the record shows that the collision occurred while plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was still entirely within the southbound lane proceeding at a speed of 25 to 35 miles an hour, and that plaintiff had no immediate intention to stop or turn from a direct line. Trooper Sheetz, while testifying as a witness for defendants, said that plaintiff told him that \u201c[h]e was not giving any sort of signal as he was not ready to turn off yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u25a0 The second paragraph of Instruction No. 5 permitted the jury to find plaintiff guilty of negligence if he failed to give a signal of his intention to \u201cstop, turn, or partly turn, from a direct line\u201d and \u201csuddenly slowed\u201d the speed of his automobile, but the only fair inference to be drawn from the evidence is that plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was not \u201csuddenly slowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The uncontradicted evidence was that plaintiff had been driving down the. highway at a rate of between 40 and 45 miles an hour before he slackened his speed. Plaintiff testified that as he approached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the curve in the road he \u201ceased up\u201d on the accelerator \u201cslightly\u201d thereby reducing his speed about \u201cfive to ten miles an hour.\u201d Krejcik said that plaintiff\u2019s car was moving between 25 and 35 miles an hour when it was struck. Dove testified on direct examination that plaintiff\u2019s vehicle slowed down \u201ca whole lot,\u201d but he explained this statement by saying that the diminution of speed was \u201cten or fifteen miles an hour.\u201d On cross-examination Dove stated that it \u201cslowed down fast\u201d and that \u201che was gradually running slower.\u201d Finally, when asked whether plaintiff had slowed down \u201csuddenly\u201d or \u201cjust gradually,\u201d his response was: \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say it was suddenly. He was going upgrade, slowing down as he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Defendants argue that Code, \u00a7 46.1-216, <em>supra, </em>when read in conjunction with Code, \u00a7 46.1-217,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is incorporated into the former section by reference, requires a driver to give a signal of his intention to \u201cslow down\u201d for the purpose of stopping, turning or partly turning, and that plaintiff was guilty of negligence when he failed to comply with this statutory duty. Plaintiff contends that \u00a7 46.1-216 does not require a motorist to give a signal of his intention to slow down, and that even if such a signal is required, his failure to give it was not a proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Sections 46.1-216 and 46.1-217 are related and deal with the same subject matter. They should be read and construed together. When this is done it is evident that the General Assembly intended that a motorist be required to give a signal of his intention to slow down for the purpose of stopping, turning or partly turning from a direct line whenever the operation of any other vehicle may be affected. The words \u201cslowing down\u201d must be given a reasonable construction. They were never intended to apply where a motorist slightly reduces his speed on a highway by easing up on the accelerator without any present intention of stopping, turning or partly turning from a direct line.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Since we find that there was not sufficient evidence adduced tending to prove the facts upon which Instruction No. 5 was based, we hold that the granting of it constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In other errors assigned plaintiff contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>trial court erred in overruling his motion to set aside the verdict as being contrary to the law and evidence and to enter judgment in his behalf, because the evidence shows that, as a matter of law, he was free of contributory negligence and defendants were guilty of negligence which was the sole proximate cause of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We are unable to state whether the jury\u2019s verdict for defendants was based on a finding (1) that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, or (2) that defendants were not guilty of primary negligence, or (3) that plaintiff failed to prove with reasonable certainty that his alleged injuries or any aggravation of a pre-existing condition resulted from the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Generally, negligence, contributory negligence, and proximate cause are questions for the jury. It is only where reasonable men may draw but one conclusion from the facts that they become questions of law for the court to decide. <em>Greyhound Lines </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>203 Va. 950, 952, 953, 128 S.E. 2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Here, plaintiff knew that Dove had been traveling about \u201ctwo or three car lengths\u201d behind him for some distance. There was no compelling reason for him to reduce his speed, yet he did so without first looking into his rear view mirror to determine the proximity of the tractor to his automobile and whether it was safe to slacken his speed at the time. It was a question for the jury to decide whether he exercised ordinary care under the circumstances. Hence, we cannot say that plaintiff was, as a matter of law, free of contributory negligence. Neither can we say, under the evidence, that defendants were, as a matter of law, guilty of negligence which was the sole proximate cause of the accident. That issue also presented a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Because of the error in granting Instruction No. 5, the judgment appealed from is reversed; the verdict set aside; and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\"> Sec. 46.1-216. \u201cEvery driver who intends to start, back, stop, turn or partly turn from a direct line shall first see that such movement can be made in safety and whenever the operation of any other vehicle may be affected by such movement shall give such signals as are required in \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-217, 46.1-218 or 46.1-220, plainly visible to the driver of such other vehicle, of his intention to make such movement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\"> Sec. 46.1-217. \u201c(a) The signal required by \u00a7 46.1-216 shall be given by means of the hand and arm or by some mechanical or electrical device approved by the Superintendent, in the manner herein specified.
