Price, a pediatrician practicing in Arlington County, carried a Physicians\u2019, Surgeons\u2019 and Dentists\u2019 Professional Liability Coverage policy with Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, with a $50,000 limit of liability for each claim, or $150,000 in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>aggregate. The policy period was for one year from August 12, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">On November 2, 1953, a baby girl, Michele Neyland, was born to Mr. and Mrs. Herbert M. Neyland in Arlington Hospital. Mrs. Neyland was attended at the birth and prior thereto by Dr. Donald C. McCollum, and his partner, Dr. Charles K. Latven.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The child came under the pediatric care of Dr. Price, although his partner, Dr. Robert H. Detwiler, first saw and examined the infant girl immediately after her birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">On October 25, 1956, an action was instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by the infant, Michele Neyland, by John F. Nieman, her next friend, and by her father in his own right against Doctors McCollum, Latven, Detwiler and Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The complaint filed in that action alleged that the child had \u201ccontracted a destructive blood disease known as \u2018erythroblastosis fetalis,\u2019 suffering extensive damage to her brain and nervous system, as a direct and proximate result of the negligence and carelessness\u201d of the four doctors. The basis of the negligence charged against the doctors was that they had failed to give the child a necessary exchange blood transfusion immediately after her birth. The action sought $200,000 in damages for the infant and $80,000 for her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Only Dr. McCollum, who was a resident of the District, and Dr. Price, who had privileges in the District hospitals, were served with process in the Neyland action. Aetna, which carried malpractice insurance on all four doctors named in the action, employed John L. Laskey, a member of the District bar, to represent Doctors McCollum and Price. The doctors denied all responsibility for the child\u2019s condition and all liability for the claims asserted against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The case was not brought to trial until February, 1962. Before the trial commenced, the court, upon its own motion, dismissed the two unserved doctors from the case. Upon motion of Mr. Neyland, the <em>ad damnum </em>clause in his claim was increased from $80,000 to $280,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. McCollum. However, verdicts were returned against Dr. Price in the amounts of $20,000 on the infant\u2019s claim and $100,000 on the father\u2019s claim. The verdicts were approved by the court in its final judgments. On appeal, the judgments were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">Aetna, pursuant to an order of the District Court, paid into the registry of the court $20,000, plus interest and costs, to cover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>$20,000 judgment and $50,000, plus interest and costs, to apply on the $100,000 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Thereafter, Dr. Price brought an action against Aetna in the Circuit Court of Arlington County, seeking to recover the sum of $50,000.. representing the balance due by him on the District of Columbia judgment. His motion for judgment, in the Arlington action, was based upon Aetna\u2019s alleged negligence and bad faith in refusing to settle the Neyland claims against him for $45,000, an amount within the limits of his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Aetna filed grounds of defense denying liability for Dr. Price\u2019s claims. A jury trial was held which resulted in a verdict against Aetna in the sum of $50,000, which was approved by the trial court in its final judgment. Aetna was granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In the trial court, there was introduced into evidence, as an exhibit, a \u201cJoint Appendix,\u201d containing the relevant testimony in the trial of the case of <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Price </em>in the District of Columbia. From that testimony the sad story of Michele Neyland is unfolded.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Michele\u2019s mother, Susanne Neyland, had Rh negative blood while her father, Herbert Neyland, had Rh positive blood. A child born of parents with such a difference in the Rh factor in their blood may be harmfully affected by such incompatibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Usually, where such a blood incompatibility exists, there is no difficulty in the first or second pregnancies. However, as a result of a previous birth of an Rh positive baby to an Rh negative mother, a subsequent child may be affected if its blood is also Rh positive. This is so because, in the earlier pregnancy with the Rh positive baby, the blood of the Rh negative mother becomes sensitized. When so sensitized, the mother\u2019s blood produces an antibody,, or a protein substance which \u201cis a protective mechanism on the part of the mother to protect herself against the red cells of the child.\u201d When the red cells of the Rh positive baby get into the circulation of the Rh negative mother, \u201cthey are foreign red cells to the mother and the mother tries to protect herself against these red cells and then produces this antibody which in turn destroys the red cells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">If the Rh negative mother, having once given birth to an Rh positive baby, is later pregnant with another Rh positive child, her blood sensitivity may increase. This is due to the activity of the antibodies in the mother\u2019s blood as they attack and destroy the red blood cells of the unborn infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">A child born of an Rh negative mother and an Rh positive father may have either Rh negative or Rh positive blood. It is possible, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>conducting pre-natal blood examinations of the parents, to determine their Rh blood type, to predict the Rh blood factor of the child and to gain an indication as to whether the baby might be adversely affected by the Rh incompatibility of the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">One of the examinations, known as a zygosity test, is performed on the father\u2019s blood. His Rh positive blood may fall into one of two main blood groups. The first is heterozygous Rh positive, \u201cwhich means that there is a roughly 50-50 chance that the child may inherit the father\u2019s Rh-positive blood type. There is an equal chance that the child may take after the mother and be Rh-negative.\u201d The second group is homozygous Rh positive in which \u201cevery one of those children would have to inherit the father\u2019s Rh-positive blood type.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Examination of the pregnant Rh negative mother\u2019s blood will disclose if there is an increase in her blood sensitivity caused by the activity of the protective antibodies developed by her. Such an increase indicates the presence of an Rh positive fetus and is \u201cpresumptive evidence that the baby may have trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The trouble which the new-born baby may have, if it is Rh positive, is the disease of erythroblastosis fetalis. This is a disease \u201cin which an excessive destruction of red blood cells in the infant occurs.\u201d The disease may cause anemia, jaundice, brain damage, cerebral palsy and even death. If the destruction of the new-born child\u2019s red cells causes jaundice, there may be an accumulation of bilirubin,, the blood pigment, in the tissues of the baby. If this accumulation becomes excessive, \u201cthe toxic effect of this jaundice pigment, the bilirubin, can affect the cells of the brain to such a degree that they will be incapacitated and may even die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">When the child\u2019s brain cells, those located in the stem of the brain, are affected by the jaundice pigment, a condition known as kernicterus, which is a form of cerebral palsy, may result from erythroblastosis. Kernicterus \u201cis a disturbance of the growth processes within the brain and ... the child suffering from such a condition will have mental retardation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The possible presence of the disease of erythroblastosis in a newborn child may be discovered by what is known as the Coombs test, performed on the infant\u2019s blood. A positive result of the test \u201cmeans that you have to be careful and to do some more tests.\u201d A negative result evidences that the disease does not exist and \u201cmeans that you have no problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">Erythroblastosis also evidences its presence by a number of symp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>toms, appearing in the first five or six days of life of the new-born baby. These symptoms are: anemia; jaundice, usually appearing within the first twenty-four to thirty-six hours after birth; enlargement of the spleen or liver; respiratory difficulty; lethargy; weak cry; weak sucking reflex; spasms of the muscles in the back, and choreoathetoid, or wormlike, movements of the extremities. The presence of jaundice, which is the most significant symptom, can be observed clinically and its severity may be determined by a,serum bilirubin test. Such a test was \u201cnot done in\u201d Arlington Hospital in possible erythroblastosis cases in 1953, however,, according, to the hospital pathologist, because \u201cits application to this disease entity is a recent development.\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Medical witnesses who testified in the Neyland trial- agreed that an exchange transfusion of the blood of a new-born infant suffering from erythroblastosis is the proper method of treating the disease. In such a transfusion, most of the infant\u2019s sensitized blood is removed and replaced with compatible blood. It is important, however, that such transfusions be \u201cgiven early and repeated as necessary.\u201d But the exchange transfusion \u201cis sometimes a hair raising experience,\u201d and can cause severe complications or even death of the 'child.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Michele was the third child of Mr. and Mrs. Neyland. Their first two children were born without defects resulting from the Rh incompatibility in the parents\u2019 blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">During her third pregnancy, however, Mrs. Neyland encountered difficulty toward the end of her term. Approximately one month before Michele was born, a test of the mother\u2019s blood showed \u201ca rising RH antibody titer,\u201d which meant \u201cthat her blood cells [were] producing an antibody which... [could] be unfavorable to her new-born\u201d child. Another test conducted some time later showed that \u201cthere was a rise in her antibodies. There were more on this blood examination than on a previous one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">On October 30, 1953, blood was again withdrawn from Mrs. Neyland for another test. When Dr. Latven received the results of the test on November 2, and found that \u201cthe antibody titer was even higher,\u201d he telephoned Mrs. Neyland \u201cand insisted she come in to the hospital for an induction of labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Dr. Latven delivered Michele at Arlington Hospital on November 2, 1953. He withdrew blood from the new-born baby\u2019s umbilical cord and ordered it subjected to a Coombs test. The test was conducted by Dr. William Dolan, the pathologist at Arlington Hospital. The results of the test were negative and Dr. Latven \u201cwas quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>happy about that.\u201d The blood was also tested for the Rh factor and the results showed that it was Rh negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Dr. Detwiler was in the hospital when Michele was born. A nurse asked him to see the baby because she had \u201cspit up some <em>mucuous, </em>as many babies frequently do.\u201d He examined Michele and,, to him, she \u201cappeared normal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Dr. Price visited the hospital the next day, November 3, and examined Michele. He inspected the baby\u2019s chart and noted that the mother had had a \u201crising titer,\u201d which alerted him to the possibility that he \u201cmight have an erythroblastotic baby.\u201d He saw that the report of the Coombs test showed that its results were negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Dr. Price conducted a \u201ccomplete examination on the baby,\u201d after which he noted on her chart \u201cnormal female infant, no evidence of birth injury or congenital defect.\u201d He reported to Mrs. Neyland that Michele was \u201ca normal, healthy, little girl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Michele had none of the symptoms of erythroblastosis within the first five or six days, except that on November 4, fifty hours after her birth, she developed jaundice. Dr. Price examined the child, conferred several times with Dr. Dolan about her condition and diagnosed it as physiologic jaundice, which occurs \u201cfrequently in newborn infants,\u201d as opposed to pathologic jaundice. He ordered the injection of clysis, a fluid \u201cto go under the skin to help clear up the jaundice.\u201d An exchange transfusion was not performed because Dr. Dolan \u201cdid not think an exchange transfusion was indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ai8\">Michele was discharged from the hospital on November 7, at which time she was still jaundiced. Mrs. Neyland, at Dr. Price\u2019s direction, reported periodically to him concerning Michele\u2019s continued jaundiced condition after the child had been taken home. When the baby was about three weeks old, Dr. Price, who \u201cwas talking to Dr. Dolan about this baby all during the time of the jaundice,\u201d directed that she be brought to his office. After examining Michele, Dr. Price instructed the parents to take her to the laboratory at Arlington Hospital, where blood was withdrawn from the baby. Two other visits were made to the laboratory, on each of which blood was withdrawn from the child for tests. On December 7, a report of a Coombs test, performed by Dr. Dolan on the child\u2019s blood, showed that it was negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The yellowness in Michele\u2019s skin caused by the jaundice continued for \u201c20 to 30 days,\u201d after which the skin cleared up, although her eyes and gums were yellow for \u201cnearly four months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Soon after she was taken home from the hospital, Michele had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>choking spell while her father was giving her water. The parents rushed her to Arlington Hospital, where she was found to be \u201csleeping nicely\u201d and the parents were told they \u201cmight as well take her home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Michele had another choking spell when she was five weeks old. The parents \u201cthought this was a convulsion\u201d and they \u201cprobably called Dr. Price about it.\u201d The child continued to have \u201clittle seizures\u201d which the mother reported to Dr. Price, who prescribed a medication for the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">As Michele\u2019s convulsions began to occur more frequently and she displayed other signs of abnormality, the parents became alarmed. When Michele was eight or nine months old, the mother told Dr. Price that she was going to take the child to another pediatrician. Dr. Price suggested, instead, that the child be taken to a neurologist. Accordingly, Michele was examined by Dr. Lambros,, a neurologist, after which Dr. Price informed Mrs. Neyland that \u201che had this report from Dr. Lambros, and that the baby had brain damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5Mc\">Michele was examined in September, 1954, by Dr. Jonathan Williams, a neurological surgeon, and, in 1956, by Dr. Oscar Hunter, a pathologist, who was \u201cthe one that brought the technique of exchange transfusion ... to this area.\u201d It was Dr. Hunter who found, for the first time, that Michele\u2019s blood was Rh positive. It was he who first discovered that Mr. Neyland\u2019s blood was homozygous Rh positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Doctors Williams and Hunter were witnesses at the Neyland trial. Dr. Williams testified that he diagnosed the child as suffering from cortical atrophy (a shrinkage or failure of growth of the brain), generalized kernicterus and convulsions. With regard to his diagnosis of kernicterus, however, Dr. Williams said that he could not \u201cbe certain that it was a case of kernicterus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Dr. Hunter testified that \u201cthe possibility certainly exists that this child could have suffered from kernicterus but I couldn\u2019t draw that conclusion.\u201d When asked if he could say whether or not, \u201cif exchange transfusions had been done,, the child would have been benefitted by it,\u201d the doctor replied, \u201cOh no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Various medications and treatments were prescribed by the doctors and hospitals in an effort to improve Michele\u2019s condition. Her condition did not improve, however, but deteriorated. At the time of the trial in Washington, when she was then eight years old, Michele was \u201ca helpless cripple, not being able to see, speak, or move.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axs\">Turning now to the present action, we find that when Doctors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>McCollum and Price were served with process in the Neyland action in 1956, it was \u201cthe first notice that [Aetna] had that a claim was being presented against one of their insureds.\u201d Aetna employed John L. Laskey, a competent member of the District bar, experienced and skilled in handling malpractice cases, to represent the doctors. Aetna also assigned an adjuster to the case and instructed him to tell Laskey \u201cthat anything [he] wanted they would do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Laskey and other representatives of Aetna undertook an investigation of the case. The four doctors who were named as defendants in the Neyland action were interviewed on a number of occasions by Laskey and the details of their handling of the Neyland child were secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Laskey told the doctors that \u201cthe amount of the suit was in excess of the limits of their policies.\u201d He discussed with them \u201ctheir right to have additional counsel\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t discuss the need of additional counsel. [He] didn\u2019t feel the need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Dr. Dolan, the pathologist at Arlington Hospital, also insured by Aetna, was interviewed by Laskey. Laskey tried for several years before he was able to secure authorization from the Neylands\u2019 counsel to talk to Doctors Williams and Hunter, who had examined and treated Michele at the request of the parents. When the authorization was finally secured, Laskey interviewed the doctors and learned the full details of their knowledge of Michele\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Laskey conferred at length with Dr. Harris, Aetna\u2019s full-time surgical adviser, about the case. He consulted with Dr. Edith Potter, a pediatrician of Chicago,, and Dr. Lewis K. Diamond, a pathologist of Boston, \u201camong the foremost authorities in the field.\u201d Laskey \u201creceived an opinion from Dr. Potter that was favorable.\u201d Dr. Diamond \u201cwas very positive that this was not kernicterus and that it did not result from any failure to... exchange transfuse this child during the period it was in the hospital, the first two to five days of life.\u201d Dr. Diamond placed marked emphasis \u201con the lack of clinical symptoms of the Neyland child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Laskey, at Aetna\u2019s request, had Michele examined by Dr. William T. Spence, a neurosurgeon of the District, who reported that Michele was not suffering from kernicterus, but from cortical atrophy, a congenital condition unrelated to kernicterus. The child was also examined, at Laskey\u2019s request, by Dr. Frederic G. Burke, a pediatrician of Alexandria. Laskey also consulted Dr. Richard W. Palmer, a pathologist of Alexandria.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Laskey spent \u201cmany hours\u201d in a medical library making an \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>dependent study\u201d of erythroblastosis and kernicterus. He kept Aetna advised as to the development of the case and conferred with the local representatives of the company, one of whom was an attorney, \u201cin many instances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">At the completion of the investigation, Laskey and the representatives of Aetna \u201creached the conclusion that [Dr. Price] had not been negligent\u201d and evaluated the case as one \u201cof no liability.\u201d Aetna established a reserve of $18,000 for the case, covering the four doctors named in the Neyland action, and Dr. Dolan as well. This reserve was \u201cto take care of the exposure of expenses, attorney\u2019s fees, and things like that\u201d and not for \u201ca case of liability.\u201d The reserve was never changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The Neyland action languished on the docket for a number of years. The Neylands\u2019 original counsel, Joseph O. Janousek, \u201cnever responded\u201d to Laskey\u2019s telephone calls. There was \u201cfrequent change in associate counsel.\u201d Laskey \u201cwas in contact with at least four different sets of attorneys associated with Mr. Janousek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Finally, Laskey filed a motion that the action be dismissed for lack of prosecution or that it be advanced for trial because, in his words, \u201cwe were dealing with a technical field in which medical knowledge was advancing every day; that was a factor that I considered was dangerous to the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The motion to dismiss was denied, but the action was advanced for trial. Richard W. Galiher, a member of the District bar, then entered the case on behalf of the Neylands. On February 7, 1962, he directed a letter to Laskey stating that \u201cI believe that your company should talk settlement.\u201d Laskey forwarded a copy of the letter to the four doctors named in the action, as well as Dr. Dolan, and in a covering letter stated that \u201cwhile I do not seek or desire the assistance of associate counsel, I would have no resentment whatever if any of you should decide to retain counsel of your own selection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Laskey and Galiher had \u201csome preliminary sparring... about settlement discussions without any mention of figures.\u201d They then met with Chief Judge McGuire, of the District Court, for the purpose of discussing settlement, without success. On February 27, 1962, the day the trial was to commence, Laskey and Galiher met with Judge George L. Hart, Jr., of the District Court, who was assigned to try, the case, to discuss settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">The details of this latter conference were supplied by Judge Hart, who appeared as a witness at the trial of the present action and testified on behalf of Dr. Price. According to the witness, it was brought out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>in the conference that Judge McGuire \u201chad recommended a figure of $67,500.\u201d Galiher, on behalf of the Neylands, first demanded $100,000, but then reduced his demand to $75,000. Laskey, according to Judge Hart, said that \u201che would recommend $45,000.\u201d Judge Hart stated, in the conference, that he \u201cthought a figure somewhere between 40 and 5 0 thousand dollars might be reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Galiher requested time overnight to talk to his clients. When the attorneys returned to the judge\u2019s chambers the next morning, Galiher advised the court that the Neylands would accept $45,000. Judge Hart testified that Laskey then advised him \u201cthat his client would not pay that much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The trial then proceeded, commencing on February 28, 1962, and consuming two weeks of the court\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">On March 6, during the course of the trial, Dr. Price addressed a letter to Laskey in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">\u201cIt is our understanding that you have had the opportunity to settle the case of John F. Nieman, et al. v. Donald C. McCollum, et al. Civil Action No. 4231-56 for a sum within the limits of our insured policy coverage. In the circumstances, we hereby notify you that we will hold you responsible in the event of a judgment in excess of our policy limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">\u201cThe record will disclose that we were agreeable to a settlement of $45,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">In reply, Laskey, on March 9, addressed a letter to Doctors Detwiler and Price, stating that the doctors had maintained throughout \u201cthat there is no liability on your part to these plaintiffs.\u201d The letter further stated, \u201cif you have evidence or information of any kind which, in your opinion, makes this a case of liability on your part, the Aetna Company and I both want it immediately.\u201d. No reply was received by Laskey or Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">The case went to the jury after 4 p.m. on March 8. The jury did not return its verdicts until after 4 p.m. on March 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Before we approach a decision of this case, there are a number of evidentiary matters to which we must give our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">We find, upon examining the brief filed on behalf of Dr. Price, and thoroughly reading the \u201cJoint Appendix,\u201d that considerable liberty has' been taken in the brief in interpreting the evidence presented at the trial in Washington. For example, the brief asserts that the evidence showed that although the Coombs test, made of Michele\u2019s blood on the day she was born, was negative, a second such test, performed three days after- birth, was positive. The brief asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>that the evidence showed that a zygosity test had been performed on the blood of Mr. Neyland before the birth of Michele, showing that his blood was homozygous Rh positive. The brief asserts that Dr. Price admitted that Michele had erythroblastosis and that he had diagnosed her condition as kernicterus.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">It would unnecessarily prolong an opinion which is already lengthy to point out in detail why these assertions are not fairly interpretive of the evidence in the Neyland trial. Suffice to say, that there is simply no satisfactory evidence, by which Dr. Price was bound, set forth in the \u201cJoint Appendix,\u201d to support the assertions and they will, therefore, be excluded in our consideration of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">We will also exclude from our consideration all testimony relating to the statements of Judge McGuire and Judge Hart, of the District Court, concerning their recommendations of amounts for which the Neyland claim should have been settled. That testimony was inadmissible. Its prejudicial effect was compounded when Judge Hart, himself, departed his bench in Washington, appeared as a witness in the trial of the present action and was permitted to repeat, to the jury, what had been his and Judge McGuire\u2019s recommendations. An air of unfairness crept into the trial below when Judge Hart was asked by Dr. Price\u2019s counsel, \u201cHow did you receive your appointment, Judge?\u201d and Judge Hart replied, \u201cI was appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">As has been noted, we have not previously decided whether an insurance company is liable when it refuses to settle a claim against its insured for an amount within the policy limits and a judgment in excess of such limits is thereafter recovered against the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The problem, however, has frequently been before other courts of final jurisdiction and the rule has become firmly established that the insurer may, under proper circumstances, be held liable to the insured for the whole amount of a judgment exceeding the policy limits. 29A Am. Jur., Insurance, \u00a7 1444, p. 556; 45 C.J.S., Insurance, \u00a7 936, p. 1067, at pp. 1069-1070; <em>7A </em>Applemen, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 4711, p. 551 ff.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">The reason for the rule becomes obvious when it is noted that, in the usual liability insurance contract, control of the defense of any claim covered by the contract is vested in the insurer and it is permitted, as the language of the policy before us permitted Aetna, to \u201cmake such investigation, negotiation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient.\u201d In such a situation, a relationship of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>confidence and trust is created between the insurer and the insured which imposes upon the insurer the duty to deal fairly with the insured in the handling and disposition of any claim covered by the policy. <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Union Fire Insurance Company, </em>174 Neb. 375, 118 N.W. 2d 318, 320-323; <em>Cowden </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, </em>389 Pa. 459, 134 A. 2d 223, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The salutary purpose behind the rule, as displayed by the decided cases, prompts us readily to adopt the rule imposing liability upon an insurer for an excess judgment against the insured for failure to settle within the policy limits, in proper cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The problem does not end there, however. How is the liability of the insurer for such a failure to be measured?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In the trial court, Aetna was granted instructions which told the jury that its liability to Dr. Price was dependent upon whether it had refused to settle the Neyland claims in bad faith. Dr. Price sought, but was refused, instructions which would have predicated Aetna\u2019s liability upon mere negligence alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Dr. Price now agrees that the bad faith rule was properly adopted by the trial court. Even so, we must decide if that is the proper measure of liability of an insurer in such circumstances, because the importance of the question transcends this single case.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">An examination of the authorities, both case and text, discloses a divergence of opinion upon the subject. It would clearly appear that a majority of the jurisdictions which have passed upon the question favor the bad faith rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">In a number of jurisdictions, the negligence rule has been adopted. In others, the two rules have been merged into one.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">See Annotation, Duty of Liability Insurer to Settle or Compromise, 40 A.L.R. 2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">Bearing in mind that, in situations such as is now before us, the insured has paid a specified premium for a fixed amount of insurance, but balancing against that the extent of the control retained by the insurer of the defense and settlement of any claim, we believe that sound reason compels the adoption of the bad faith rule, rather than the negligence rule, for this type of case. In applying the bad faith rule, the language of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in the case of <em>Radio Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mut. Ins. Co., </em>31 N. J. 299, 157 A. 2d 319, 322, 323, <em>offers </em>appropriate guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-13\">\u201c... [T]he obligation assumed by the insurer with respect to settlement is to exercise good faith in dealing with offers of compromise, having both its own and the insured\u2019s interests in mind. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>And it may be said also that a reasonably diligent effort must be made to ascertain the facts upon which a good faith judgment as to settlement can be formulated....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">\u201c... A decision not to settle must be an honest one. It must result from a weighing of probabilities in a fair manner. To be a good faith decision, it must be an honest and intelligent one in the light of the company\u2019s expertise in the field. Where reasonable and probable cause appears for rejecting a settlement offer and for defending the damage action, the good faith of the insurer will be vindicated....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Tested by these principles, we now examine the points upon which Dr. Price relies to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the existence of bad faith on Aetna\u2019s part in refusing to settle the claim against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Dr. Price first contends that Aetna should be held guilty of bad faith for \u201clack of investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">It is difficult to perceive how Dr. Price can sincerely make this contention in the face of the thorough,, comprehensive investigation conducted by Aetna, extending over a period of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The gist of Dr. Price\u2019s complaint seems to be that Laskey failed to learn that Dr. Williams, who examined and treated Michele Neyland in September of 1954, would testify that the child \u201cdid have kernicterus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">This complaint may be answered by a direct quotation from Dr. Price\u2019s brief in opposition to granting an appeal, filed in this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">\u201cTo our knowledge there was no evidence introduced against Dr. Price in the District of Columbia case which came as a surprise or which was not known to Aetna or its attorneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Moreover, the record shows that in his interview with Dr. Williams, Laskey learned fully what the doctor later testified to in the Washington trial. And it is doubtful that the doctor\u2019s statements were sufficient to fix liability for Michele\u2019s condition upon Dr. Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">When pressed by Judge Hart, Dr. Williams said that \u201cbased on the reasonable medical certainty of the information at hand,\u201d he diagnosed Michele as having kernicterus. But the doctor\u2019s testimony showed that there was a great deal of information about Michele\u2019s case which he did not have \u201cat hand\u201d when he made his diagnosis and he freely admitted, \u201cI cannot be certain it was a case of kernicterus.\u201d And when asked if there was any relationship between Michele\u2019s condition and the blood incompatibility, about which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>finger of malpractice was pointed at Dr. Price, Dr. Williams candidly-conceded, \u201cI really couldn\u2019t establish a relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Dr. Price next contends that Aetna evidenced its bad faith because Laskey failed to file a motion <em>forum non conveniens, </em>in the District action, so that the case would have to be dismissed and refiled in Virginia, where Dr. Dolan, the pathologist, could be added as a defendant, thus reducing the exposure of Dr. Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">For the same reason, Dr. Price says Laskey should have filed a third party complaint against Dr. Dolan in the District action and should have submitted Dr. Detwiler, Dr. Price\u2019s partner, to the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The contention with respect to the motion <em>forum non conveniens </em>is answered by saying that Laskey fully considered filing such a motion, researched the question, discussed it with the doctors and decided that such a motion was not proper. He was supported in his opinion by uncontradicted expert testimony, given in the trial below, that had the motion been filed, it would not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">With respect to the possible filing of a third party complaint against Dr. Dolan, all that need be said is that Dr. Price has neither alleged nor shown that Dr. Dolan could have been served in the District of Columbia with such a complaint, had it been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Concerning Laskey\u2019s failure to submit Dr. Detwiler to the jurisdiction of the District Court, it may be pointed out that Laskey presented this question to the four doctors named in the Neyland action, explained the situation to them and requested that they advise him if such action should be taken. He was never so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Dr. Price next contends that Aetna failed to advise him of the opportunity to settle within the policy limits and thus was guilty of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">It is undisputed that Laskey advised Dr. Price that Galiher, the Neylands\u2019 attorney, had instituted settlement negotiations. In the trial below, Laskey testified positively that he advised Dr. Price of the details of the settlement discussions and of Aetna\u2019s response to the settlement offer. Dr. Price, when asked if he had been so advised, merely answered, \u201cI don\u2019t recall any discussion regarding settlement ... If I don\u2019t recall it how can I either deny or not deny it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Moreover, Dr. Price\u2019s letter, sent to Laskey during the course of the trial, concerning his position about settlement, conclusively showed that he had knowledge of the settlement negotiations. The letter concluded with the statement, \u201cThe record will disclose that we were agreeable to a settlement of $45,000.\u201d That statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>could hardly have had reference to anything other than the settlement negotiations, about which Dr. Price now claims he was not advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Dr. Price\u2019s next contention is that Aetna was guilty of bad faith because it refused to accept the recommendation of its counsel to settle the Neyland claims for $45,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Although there was conflict in the trial below as to whether Laskey actually recommended the settlement to Aetna, the jury\u2019s verdict resolved that conflict and established as a fact that Laskey did recommend the settlement and that Aetna refused to follow his recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">We have read the cases, cited by Dr. Price in support of this contention, but we must point out that in none of them is the failure of an insurer to accept the settlement recommendation of its attorney, standing alone, sufficient to sustain a charge of bad faith, nor is it sufficient here.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Dr. Price\u2019s position here is inconsistent with that taken in connection with his contention, just previously discussed, that he was not advised of the offer to settle for $45,000. His policy provided that his written consent must first be given before Aetna could settle a claim against him. If he did not know of the settlement offer, he hardly could have consented to the settlement, and without such consent Aetna was not free to accept Laskey\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Be that as it may, Aetna\u2019s refusal to accept Laskey\u2019s single recommendation, made when there had been no change whatsoever in the liability picture, was completely consistent with its position throughout that Dr. Price had not been negligent and was not liable to the Neylands. Nothing had occurred, at the time of Laskey\u2019s recommendation, which should have changed Aetna\u2019s appraisal of its probabilities of success in going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Aetna\u2019s position was also consistent with that taken and constantly maintained by Dr. Price that he had not been negligent and was not to blame for Michele\u2019s condition. It does not now behoove Dr. Price to point out in his brief where he was negligent, thus to impose liability upon Aetna for not recognizing his negligence, and then to assert, even as he did in oral argument before the bar of this court, and with some justification, we believe, that he had done no wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">The most that can be said of the evidence of Dr. Price\u2019s negligence is that it posed a jury question. That must be said because the Neyland case was submitted to the jury and its verdicts were permitted to stand. But that does not mean that Aetna, after an accurate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>complete investigation, aware that if liability was established recovery would exceed the policy limits, heedful of its insured\u2019s interests as much as its own, honestly and intelligently weighing the probabilities of success in a trial, acted in bad faith in refusing to settle the Neyland claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">To the contrary,, we are of opinion that the evidence was patently insufficient to show bad faith on the part of Aetna. Accordingly, the judgment appealed from will be reversed and final judgment will be here entered in favor of Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
