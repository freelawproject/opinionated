Bell and twelve other persons,, plaintiffs, all of whom are related by blood or marriage, were the owners of two adjacent parcels of land containing approximately 2.5 acres on Columbia Pike in Fairfax county and appealed from a judgment entered November 30, 1964, whereby they were denied recovery of a real estate commission in the sum of $15,800 which they had paid Routh Robbins Real Estate Corporation, defendant, hereinafter referred to as Robbins Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Initially, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment seeking damages in the amount of $100,000 against Donald S. Thorn, Joseph C. O\u2019Brien, Hugh F. Baker, and Robbins Corporation. The motion alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendant Robbins Corporation and defendant Baker, its agent and salesman, had breached their fiduciary duty in the sale of plaintiffs\u2019 property and that defendants Baker, Thorn and O\u2019Brien had been guilty of fraud with respect to the transaction. The damages sought included the real estate commission paid Robbins Corporation,, the profit realized by certain of the other defendants from the resale of a portion of the land claimed to have been fraudulently released from the lien of the deed of trust, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AEt\">Baker, who had departed from this State, was not served with process. He filed no pleadings and made no appearance before the court. Hence, this action could not proceed against him. Upon motion of the remaining defendants and without objection of plaintiffs, the court separated for trial the cause of action stated against Robbins Corporation and Baker from that stated against Baker, Thom, and O\u2019Brien. A trial by jury was waived, and the matter came on to be heard upon plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action against Robbins Corporation for a recovery of the real estate commission in the amount of $15,800 which they had paid it for the sale of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>The evidence discloses that in September, 1960, Marguerite Bell Cheatham, one of the owners of the two adjacent parcels of land in question, with the consent of the other owners contacted Hugh F. Balter, a salesman for Robbins Corporation, and informed him that the owners wished to sell \u201cthe entire piece of property as one transaction.\u201d Shortly thereafter plaintiffs executed an exclusive listing agreement with Robbins Corporation dated September 30, 1960, which provided, among other things, that defendant was to have 60 days in which to sell the property; that the sale price was to be $158,000, and that in the event of sale defendant was to receive a commission of $15,800 at the time of settlement. The agreement also bore the signatures \u201cHugh F. Baker (Agent)\u201d and \u201cRouth Robbins pres. (Realtor)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">About a week later, Baker advised plaintiffs that he had secured a purchaser for the property. He presented to them a \u201cPURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d dated October 6, 1960, which showed that the land was to be purchased by \u201cD. S. &amp; T. CORPORATION, a Virginia Corporation.\u201d The agreement had already been signed by Baker as \u201cSalesman\u201d, by Routh Robbins as \u201cOfficer\u201d of the Robbins Corporation, and by D. S. Thorn as \u201cPresident\u201d of D. S. &amp; T. Corporation, the purchaser. It provided, among other things, that the purchase price was $158,000; that cash payment was $45,820; that the balance was to be secured by a first deed of trust, and that \u201cAt time of settlement Seller herein agrees to release frontage to a depth of 200 feet on Columbia Pike and width of approximately 200 feet, for building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Plaintiffs had never sold real estate before, and they questioned Baker about the meaning of the release provision. Baker explained that the provision was \u201ca standard real estate transaction\u201d and that its purpose \u201cwas only to release the frontage so that the builders could go ahead and build. It did not mean that we actually would turn the ground loose, that we would give a deed to it \u2014 that it was just for the purpose of building so that we could go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Plaintiffs telephoned their attorney in an attempt to obtain his advice before signing the contract, but the attorney was busy and stated that he would be able to discuss the matter with them the following day. Baker, however, told plaintiffs that he \u201cwas in such a rush\u201d to get the contract signed because the purchaser was flying back to New York and that if they \u201cdid not go through with the deal that night\u201d they \u201cwere going to lose it.\u201d Plaintiffs then signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the contract. The record indicates that they did not see Baker thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Settlement of the transaction was postponed twice. Plaintiffs were told by an officer of D. S. &amp; T. Corporation that the second delay was caused in part by the fact that contact could not be made with \u201ca woman with race horses\u201d who \u201chad the money\u201d and was \u201cbacking\u201d the transaction. Settlement was finally achieved on May 26, 1961. Several months prior thereto Baker\u2019s employment with Robbins Corporation had terminated, and he was not present at the closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">At the settlement Robbins Corporation was represented by its executive vice-president, Leonard C. Whitecar; D. S. &amp; T. Corporation was represented by D. S. Thorn and Joseph C. O\u2019Brien, its president and secretary, respectively, and plaintiffs were present with their attorney. Counsel for plaintiffs had previously learned of the contract provision which released approximately 40,000 square feet of the land\u2019s valuable frontage from the lien of the deed of trust. He was concerned about the provision and discussed it with plaintiffs, but it was decided that settlement would be made. D. S. &amp; T. Corporation gave plaintiffs a check for $29,549.55, signed a note for $112,180, and executed a deed of trust on the property, less the released portion, to secure the note. Robbins Corporation received a check for its commission in the amount of $15,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">About January, 1961, which was after plaintiffs had agreed to sell their land to D. S. &amp; T. Corporation and before settlement, D. S. &amp; T. Corporation contracted to sell the released portion of the land to Excalibar Corporation. The conveyance was later made for a consideration of approximately \u201c$70,000 to $75,000 cash\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">D. S. &amp; T. Corporation defaulted in making the first payment of $10,000 on the deed of trust note held by plaintiffs due on May 26, 1962, and the trustees were instructed to institute foreclosure proceedings. At the trustees\u2019 sale held on August 13, 1962, plaintiffs purchased the property for $50,000. Thereafter they resold it for $88,036.50 and were required to pay a real estate commission of $5,292.19 on the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Because of the default and foreclosure, plaintiffs requested their attorney to make an investigation of the status of D. S. &amp; T. Corporation and as a result of the investigation this action was instituted. A copy of the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d was filed as an exhibit. It shows that Hugh F. Baker, Joseph C, O\u2019Brien and Donald S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Thorn executed it as incorporators on January 9, 1961, and that they constituted the initial board of directors. The exhibit also shows that the State Corporation Commission issued the certificate of incorporation on January 18, 1961. Thus, it is evident that the corporation was not in existence on October 6, 1960, when it signed the purchase agreement with plaintiffs. However, it had been chartered by the time the agreement was slightly amended on March 15 and May 17, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">O\u2019Brien, Baker\u2019s brother-in-law and a witness for plaintiffs, testified that he was \u201cinvolved in syndication of real estate\u201d. He stated that in the early part of October, 1960, Baker informed him of the listing agreement which he had secured from plaintiffs and inquired if he (O\u2019Brien) could \u201cline up financing\u201d for the purchase of the property. O\u2019Brien said that he then contacted Thorn and that he, Thorn and Baker made \u201ca tentative arrangement\u201d to form the D. S. &amp; T. Corporation, which was before the purchase agreement was entered into on October 6, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">O\u2019Brien was asked by counsel for defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-7\">\u201cQ. <em>* * * </em>Mr. O\u2019Brien and let me once again ask a simple question. Do you have any evidence of any kind, written or oral, of Mr. Baker\u2019s involvement in the D. S. &amp; T. Corporation other than the articles of incorporation which have been previously introduced in evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-8\">\u201cA. I think I have a couple here. Let\u2019s see. Here is one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">There was a short interval, and then counsel for plaintiffs said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-10\">\u201cIf Your Honor please, this is a little irregular, but I wanted to ask Mr. O\u2019Brien a question because it\u2019s relevant to this discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-11\">\u201cDo you have a memorandum on yellow paper in Mr. Baker\u2019s own handwriting dated October 5, 1960?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-12\">\u201cThe Witness: I sure do. But they were not in my files.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">O\u2019Brien explained that in preparation for the trial he contacted Baker\u2019s mother to secure anything he could find pertaining to the corporation. He went to her apartment and located this memorandum. At this point in his testimony the contents of the memorandum, which consisted of 4 sheets of yellow paper, were not disclosed, but later, on re-direct examination, the memorandum itself was admitted in evidence as exhibit No. 12 over the objection of defendant. The papers appeared to be minutes of several meetings of the D. S. &amp; T. Corporation. They were written in longhand and bore the signature \u201cHugh F. Baker\u201d at the end of each paragraph. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>indicated, among other things, that the first meeting of the \u201cinitial incorporators\u201d, Thorn, Baker and O\u2019Brien, was held on October 5, 1960, and that the incorporators were elected president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer, respectively. O\u2019Brien said that the memorandum of this meeting was \u201csimilar to the facts\u201d. In response to a question by the court he stated that to his knowledge a formal meeting of the incorporators was held for the purpose of electing officers; that Thorn was not present at the meeting but was contacted by telephone, and that the above named officers were elected. He further stated that Thorn paid $7,000 into the corporation but that he and Baker did not \u201cput up\u201d any amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">According to O\u2019Brien, he and Thorn were the real owners of the corporation but it was understood that Baker was to receive the commission for the \u201cacquisition\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 property as well as a commission for the resale of any portion of it. \u201c[H]e was only to have real estate commission in and out.\u201d However, no commissions were ever paid to Baker by D. S. &amp; T. Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">O\u2019Brien further testified that Baker, as a director of the corporation, had a right to vote with respect to corporate affairs and that although no corporate stock had been issued, if a division of stock had been made, it was \u201cpossible\u201d that Baker would have received some of it. He stated that he asked Baker twice whether he had disclosed to plaintiffs his interest in D. S. &amp; T. Corporation. The first time he inquired Baker replied \u201cSure\u201d. However, Baker later stated that he had not informed plaintiffs of his interest and said, \u201cNo, the Bells do not have knowledge that I am in the corporation.\u201d Baker also informed O\u2019Brien that the \u201cofficers and management people\u201d of Robbins Corporation had no knowledge of his connection with D. S. &amp; T. Corporation, and the evidence does not disclose that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The plaintiffs did not learn of Baker\u2019s connection with D. S. &amp; T. Corporation until sometime after the trustees had sold the property under the terms of the deed of trust, and they did not ratify his actions after gaining such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">In holding for defendant the trial court included the following findings and conclusions in its final order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-9\">\u201cAnd the Court having found that Hugh F. Baker, sales agent of Defendant Routh Robbins Real Estate Corporation, was one of the signatories to the articles of incorporation of the buyer corporation, that Baker participated in the initial meeting of the incorpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>tion of said buyer corporation, that he participated in the election of the buyer corporation\u2019s directors, and was elected vice-president thereof, and that Baker may have had some interest in seeing the sale consummated in that the buyer corporation had represented that he would be compensated by subsequent commissions upon resale of the property in question, but that this (when considered in the light of all the evidence presented) does not constitute an interest in the land or an ownership interest in the buyer corporation on the part of the agent, Balter; that he, did not disclose to plaintiff sellers his association with the buyer corporation; that the Defendant Routh Robbins Real Estate Corporation should not be required to forfeit any portion of the full commission of $15,800.00;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Apparently, the trial court was of opinion that since there was no showing that Baker had any ownership interest in the buyer corporation the broker was entitled to retain the commission. In rendering its decision from the bench, the court concluded by stating, \u201cThere is no evidence, as has been stated in different ways two or three times before, that he [Baker] had any ownership in the corporation. And in the absence of any ownership in the corporation, why, of course, there is nothing he could tell them [plaintiffs] about * #</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The crucial question presented in this appeal is essentially whether the evidence established, as a matter of law, that Baker, defendant\u2019s salesman and agent, breached the fiduciary duty which a broker owes to his client, thereby causing a forfeiture of the real estate commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">In <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>94 Va. 1, 26 S.E. 397, 40 L.R.A. 234, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-8\">\u201cNothing is better settled than that a man cannot be the agent of both the seller and the buyer in the same transaction, without the intelligent consent of both. Loyalty to his trust is the most important duty which the agent owes to his principal. Reliance upon his integrity, fidelity, and ability is the main consideration in the selection of agents, and so careful is the law in guarding this fiduciary relation that it will not allow an agent, to act for himself and his principal, nor to act for two principals on opposite sides in the same transaction. All such transactions are voidable, and may be repudiated by the principal, without showing that he was injured. In such cases the amount of consideration, the absence of undue advantage, and other like features are wholly immaterial. Nothing will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>defeat the principal\u2019s right of remedy except his own confirmation after full knowledge of all the facts. Actual injury is not the principle upon which the law holds such transactions voidable. The chief object of the principle is not to compel restitution where actual fraud has been committed, or unjust advantage gained, but it is to prevent the agent from putting himself in a position \u2018in which to be honest must be a strain on him,\u2019 and to elevate him \u2018to a position where he can not be tempted to betray his principal.\u2019 \u2018Under a less stringent rule,\u2019 it was said by the court in <em>Parlin </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>[sic, <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Woodruff], </em>36 N.J. Eq., 174, 180, \u2018fraud might be committed, or unfair advantage taken, and yet owing to the imperfections of the best human institutions, the injured party be unable either to discover it or to prove it in such manner as to entitle him to redress. To guard against this uncertainty, all possible temptation is removed, and the prohibition against an agent acting in a dual character is made broad enough to cover all his transactions. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">\u201c* * * To be secretly in the service of the opposite party, while the agent is acting ostensibly for his principal only, is a fraud upon the later and a breach of public morals which the law will not permit. # # *\u00bb 94 Va. at pp. 8 and 9. See also, <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Wallinger, </em>125 Va. 361, 377, 99 S.E. 680; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>188 Va. 53, 62, 49 S.E. 2d 260; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Sickels, </em>197 Va. 298, 302, 89 S.E. 2d 14; <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Brickies, </em>203 Va. 447, 450, 451, 124 S.E. 2d 895.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">It is likewise well settled that a broker who breaches the fiduciary duty which he owes to his principal forfeits any right to a commission. <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Wallinger, supra, </em>125 Va. at p. 377; <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Brickles, supra, </em>203 Va. at p. 451; 3 M.J., Brokers, \u00a7 34, p. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The evidence clearly supported the court\u2019s finding that Baker was a signer of the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d of the buyer corporation; that he participated in the initial meeting of the \u201cincorporation\u201d; that he participated in the election of the directors; that he was elected vice-president of the corporation; that he \u201cmay have had some interest in seeing the sale consummated in that the buyer corporation had represented that he would be compensated by subsequent commissions upon resale of the property in question,\u201d and that he did not disclose to plaintiffs his connection with the buyer corporation. While the trial court did not specifically find that he was a director of the corporation, the undisputed evidence reveals that he was. These facts were in themselves sufficient to show that Baker had a substantial interest in D. S. &amp; T. Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Moreover, the evidence further established that Baker\u2019s interest in the corporate buyer commenced prior to October 6, 1960, the date the purchase agreement was executed. He, Thorn and O\u2019Brien had made \u201ca tentative arrangement\u201d to form the corporation to purchase plaintiffs\u2019 property, and a meeting of the initial incorporators, which Baker attended, had been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">It was not essential that Baker have an \u201cownership interest\u201d in the corporation in order to forfeit the commission. Defendant has cited no case, nor have we found one, which stands for the proposition that a broker or its salesman must have such an interest in the corporate buyer before there is a duty to make a disclosure of the interest to the seller-client.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">In our view, the evidence conclusively shows that Baker breached his fiduciary duty to plaintiffs in failing to make a full disclosure to them of his interest in, or connection with, D. S. &amp; T. Corporation, the purchaser. Even though defendant\u2019s management had no knowledge of Baker\u2019s connection with the buyer corporation, defendant was responsible, under familiar agency principles, for Baker\u2019s actions while in the scope of his employment, and its right to retain the commission can rise no higher than the right of Baker. Thus, it is evident that plaintiffs are entitled to recover from defendant the full amount of the commission they paid it for the sale of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Defendant has assigned cross-error to the court\u2019s action in admitting in evidence plaintiffs\u2019 exhibit No. 12, heretofore described. It argues that the \u201cgenuineness and authenticity\u201d of the exhibit were not established; that Baker\u2019s signature and handwriting were not proved, and that the exhibit \u201cshould be stricken from the record in considering this case on its merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">In overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of the exhibit, the trial court made this observation: \u201cI don\u2019t think the proper foundation has been laid for the admissibility of this instrument, but I think when you asked the question as to whether or not Mr. O\u2019Brien had any evidence, any tangible evidence, I believe you said, of Mr. Baker\u2019s interest in the corporation, I think that that, in effect, did open the door for the introduction of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The record shows that during the cross-examination of O\u2019Brien counsel for defendant repeatedly asked whether there was any tangible evidence of Baker\u2019s involvement with D. S. &amp; T. Corporation other than his execution of the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Counsel\u2019s final question was: \u201cMr. O\u2019Brien and let me once again ask a simple question. Do you have any evidence of any kind, written or oral, of Mr. Baker\u2019s involvement in the D. S. &amp; T. Corporation other than the articles of incorporation which have been previously introduced in evidence?\u201d O\u2019Brien replied: \u201cI think I have a couple here. * * It was in response to these questions propounded by counsel for defendant that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel produced and introduced in evidence exhibit No. 12. As the trial court said, defendant \u201copened the door\u201d for the introduction of the exhibit. Hence, it was not error to admit it in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment appealed from is reversed and final judgment entered for plaintiffs in the amount of $15,800 with interest thereon from November 30, 1964, the date judgment was rendered for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\n<em>Reversed and pnal judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
