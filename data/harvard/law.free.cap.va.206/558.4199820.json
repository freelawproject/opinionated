No abrasion or open wound resulted from the fall. Later in the same day plaintiff developed a fever, and on March 18, 1963, he was admitted to a hospital suffering from pain in his left knee and fever.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">An X-ray examination of plaintiff\u2019s knee was negative, but a physical examination revealed a tenderness to touch. While in the hospital he developed a pain in his chest. He was discharged from the hospital on March 27, with a diagnosis of virus infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Subsequently plaintiff visited his physician\u2019s office at monthly intervals during which time the only finding was a slight swelling of the left knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">In August, 1963, when plaintiff began playing football, he experienced pain in his knee. X-rays taken at this time showed a Brodie\u2019s abscess (an infection) in the lower portion of the left femur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>near the knee. On September 23, 1963, he was readmitted to the hospital and the abscess was opened and removed by curettement. He remained in the hospital until October 11, 1963, and was last seen by his doctor on December 5, 1963, at which time he appeared to have completely recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">It was the opinion of plaintiff\u2019s physician, an orthopedic surgeon, that the trauma resulting from plaintiff\u2019s fall \u201ccaused the infection to develop into the Brodie\u2019s abscess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The amount of medical expenses incurred by the plaintiff, or on his behalf, is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The contract sued on contains the following relevant provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOX\">\u201cTHIS IS A LIMITED POLICY-READ IT CAREFULLY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-l\">\u201cTHIS POLICY IS NOT RENEWABLE. IT PROVIDES BENEFITS FOR LOSS OF LIFE, LIMBS OR SIGHT CAUSED BY ACCIDENTAL BODILY INJURY, AND FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES INCURRED DUE TO ACCIDENTAL BODILY INJURY, TO THE EXTENT HEREIN LIMITED AND PROVIDED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The \u201cINSURING AGREEMENTS\u201d provide in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">\u201cIf any person, as a result, directly and independently of all other causes, of bodily injuries caused by an accident occurring while insured hereunder and while</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">(1) attending school during the hours and on the days when school is in session;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\"># # # # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">(which injuries are herein called \u2018such injuries\u2019) shall suffer loss of life, hands, feet or sight within ninety days following the date of the accident causing such injuries or shall actually be examined in person and treated by a physician or .dentist within thirty days following the date of such accident and shall incur expenses for such treatment or for hospital confinement, professional ambulance service or the services of a Registered Nurse within twelve months following the date of such accident, Pilot Life shall pay, subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy, the benefits hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">An \u201cEXCLUSIONS\u201d clause provides, among other things, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">\u201cNo payment of any kind shall be made for <em>injuries, death, or any other loss caused, wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, by</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\"><em>* </em>* * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-16\">* * <em>* infections, other than infections occurring through </em>(4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>an open visible wound resulting from \u2018such injuries\u2019; * * *\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Defendant argues that the terms and provisions of the policy are clear and unambiguous and since the Brodie\u2019s abscess did not develop as a result of infection from an open visible wound there was no coverage under the policy for plaintiff\u2019s expenses. Thus the sole question presented is that of coverage, which must be determined by a construction of the contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Contracts of insurance are to be liberally construed in favor of the insured, but if they are plain and clear and not in violation of law or inconsistent with public policy, we are bound to adhere to their terms. It is the function of the court to construe the language of the contract as written, and the court cannot make a new contract for the parties different from that plainly intended and thus create a liability not assumed by the insurer. <em>Welborn </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>175 Va. 163, 166, 7 S. E. 2d 99, 100; <em>Sterling Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dansey, </em>195 Va. 933, 939, 81 S. E. 2d 446, 450; <em>Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Dollins, </em>201 Va. 73, 77, 109 S.E. 2d 405, 409. See also Anno: Student Accident Policy \u2014 Coverage, 74 A. L. R. 2d 1253, 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">It has been generally held that when an accident insurance policy excludes payment for loss caused, wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, by infections, except infections occurring through an open visible wound resulting from bodily injuries, no liability arises in case of an infection resulting from a bruise or traumatic injury if there was no open visible wound. <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(10th Cir.), 51 F. 2d 187, 189; <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Travelers\u2019 Protective Ass\u2019n of America, </em>211 Ky. 435, 277 S. W. 467, 469; <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers of </em>America, 276 Mich. 648, 268 N. W. 767; <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(8th Cir.), 154 F. 484, 486, 487, 11 L. R. A., N. S., 1069, 12 Ann. Cas. 181; 45 C. J. S., Insurance, \u00a7 755, p. 785; Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, 1A, \u00a7 395, p. 61; 10 Couch on Insurance, 2d, \u00a7 41:777, p. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The applicable language of the contract in the present case is plain and unambiguous. It insures against hospital, medical and doctors expenses incurred as a result, directly and independently of other causes, of bodily injuries caused by an accident occurring while the insured is attending school or engaged in activities closely related to school attendance. But it expressly excludes <em>payment of any kind </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>for loss caused, wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, by infections, except infections occurring through an open visible wound, </em>resulting from bodily injuries connected with school attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Under the agreed statement of facts, the plaintiff\u2019s fall on the school gymnasium floor did not cause an abrasion or open visible wound. The trauma resulting from his fall \u201ccaused the infection to develop into the Brodie\u2019s abscess,\u201d but there is no claim that septic matter entered the plaintiff\u2019s body through an open visible wound. Hence the expenses incurred in treatment of the infection, which did not have its inception through an open visible wound, were expressly excluded from coverage under the policy sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Notwithstanding the plain language of the contract and the agreed statement of facts, the plaintiff argues that he is entitled to recover because the trauma to the knee was the proximate cause of the loss and the infection was merely a link in the chain of causation. He cites <em>Mutual Benefit Health Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ryder, </em>166 Va. 446, 185 S. E. 894; and <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>General Acci., Etc., Corp., </em>180 Va. 117, 21 S. E. 2d 772, in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The <em>Ryder </em>case is clearly distinguishable from the present case. There blood poisoning resulted from an accidental open wound, and we affirmed a recovery under the <em>terms </em>of a health and accident policy on the ground that the infection was not the proximate cause of the death, but merely a link in the chain of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">In the <em>Crowder </em>case, recovery was denied under the contract on the ground that at the time insured fell, injuring his hip, he was found to be incapacitated by reason of a former injury, and the latter injury had merely aggravated the preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that his fall was the proximate cause of the loss and the infection was merely a link in the chain of causation has no application here. The doctrine of proximate cause was eliminated by the very terms of the contract itself excluding payment for infections, except infections occurring from an open visible wound resulting from accidental bodily injury. We have no alternative but to enforce the clear and unambiguous terms of the contract as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court below is set aside and reversed, and final judgment is here entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
