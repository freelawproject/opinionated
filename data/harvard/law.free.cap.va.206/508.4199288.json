He was found guilty of second-degree murder, his punishment was fixed at twenty years in the penitentiary and he was sentenced accordingly. He was granted a writ of error and here contends that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict and that prejudicial errors were committed in his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-19\">He claimed in the court below that the killing was done not by him but by his companion, Herbert Lee Capps. Capps was the main witness for the Commonwealth, and the substance of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>given by him and other witnesses for the Commonwealth was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Harmon was a sailor stationed at Oceana Naval Air Station, Virginia Beach. He met two girls in Virginia Beach, Ernestine Leigh and Christine Turner, who had adjoining rooms in an apartment where Harmon had visited them earlier in the night of the shooting in October, 1963. He told friends that he planned to go back there to spend the night. He went back later and without knocking entered the room occupied by Ernestine, who was asleep. She was frightened and cried out. At that time, about 11 p.m., Capps was with Christine on her bed in the adjoining room. He got up and went into Ernestine\u2019s room, saw Harmon standing by the door and asked him what he was doing there. Harmon replied that the girl knew him and the door was unlocked. Capps then told him he should not have come in the way he did. That seemed to end the matter and when Capps got ready to leave about fifteen minutes later, Harmon asked him if he would take him in his car over to Harmon\u2019s base in Oceana, and Capps said he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Instead of taking Harmon to Oceana, Capps drove to the home of defendant Westry, whom Capps described as his pal or buddy. Capps was twenty years old and Westry twenty-three. In his statement made afterwards Capps said he went to Westry\u2019s house to get Westry to teach Harmon \u201cnot to be breaking into people\u2019s houses.\u201d Christine was Capps\u2019 girl friend and Westry was well acquainted with Ernestine.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">When they arrived at the home of Westry, Capps went into the house, leaving Harmon in the car, and after a few minutes Harmon sounded the horn two or three times. Westry inquired who was in the car and Capps told him who it was and what had happened at the apartment, whereupon Westry proposed that they go out and teach Harmon a lesson. Westry put on his coat, took his gun out and told Capps to hold it for him. They went out to the car, Capps told Harmon to get out of the car and they had a few words, whereupon Westry jumped in and \u201ctook it over,\u201d saying, \u201cHe is supposed to be a wise guy.\u201d He snatched the gun out of Capps\u2019 hand and he and Harmon began arguing, then before Capps could do any thing Westry shot twice. The first struck the chrome on the car door, and the second hit Elarmon in his chest as he was standing beside the car. As Harmon staggered into the road, Westry struck him over the head twice with the pistol and broke the barrel. Capps testified that Westry arranged the whole thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Westry then placed Harmon\u2019s body in Capps\u2019 car and took it to a wooded area. Coming back he met Capps, who was walking toward his home; Capps got into the car and Westry drove it back to Westry\u2019s house. They both then walked or ran to where Westry had left the body and dragged it into some bushes. On the way back Westry threw the pistol into a pool of water, from which it was afterwards recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">These events occurred before daybreak on Sunday, and about dark that evening Westry and Capps drove back with shovels, dug a hole and buried the body. They attempted to cover their tracks but a hand of Harmon was left protruding from the grave where the body was discovered some four months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">A few weeks after the discovery of the body, and on information furnished by Capps, Westry was arrested and charged with the killing. He denied knowing Harmon or knowing anything about his murder, but afterwards admitted that he had been a party to his death and made a written statement which was introduced in evidence by his attorney whom he had employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Westry testified at his trial and was his only witness. The substance of both his testimony and his statement was that on the night in question Capps drove into his yard and came into the room where he was in bed. He asked Capps what the trouble was and Capps replied that it was just a little problem he could solve and said, \u201c \u2018Give me the pistol,\u2019 and I gave him the gun.\u201d Westry then put on his pants and shoes and went out. There was an argument going on \u201cbetween this fellow and Capps\u201d and some bad words between them. Harmon was coming up \u2022 toward Capps and Westry reached for Capps\u2019 arm, saying to him, \u201cdon\u2019t do it,\u201d and the gun went off. Harmon grabbed his chest, spun away from the car and into the ditch. Westry ran to him and shook him but he did not say anything and was limber. He, Westry, then said, \u201cLord, Herb, you shot this man,\u201d grabbed the gun from him and said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get him out of my yard before somebody come along and see him here.\u201d He recounted the things done by him and Capps to dispose of the body about as above described, and he admitted taking a watch and a ten-dollar bill from the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">He was asked why he did not tell a neighbor or somebody what had happened and get the police there. He replied, \u201cWell, because I had been convicted down here once and I didn\u2019t want to be sent back to pull time. So before I knew it, I was all deep involved into it, a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>in it, and I was just afraid. Didn\u2019t even think.\u201d He stated that he had previously been convicted of a felony and sent to the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The jury weighed the evidence, resolved the conflicts and divided the true from the false. The question as to who was the immediate perpetrator of the crime and fired the shot that killed Harmon was theirs to decide and their verdict was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The defendant contends that nevertheless his conviction should be reversed for the following alleged errors in his trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The refusal of his motions to make available to the defendant all statements made by the defendant and by Capps, a list of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and their \u201creports\u201d as to \u201cevents and activities\u201d in connection with the case; to take discovery depositions of two police officers; and for a bill of particulars stating whether defendant was to be tried as perpetrator or as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In response to his motions the court ordered the Commonwealth to furnish the statement made by the defendant and a bill of particulars stating the Commonwealth\u2019s theory as to whether the defendant perpetrated the offense charged or acted as an accomplice. The Commonwealth complied and the court overruled the other motions. There was no error in these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">We have no statute or rule or practice in Virginia permitting the taking of depositions in a criminal case except the deposition of a victim of rape. Code \u00a7 18.1-47. In <em>Setliff </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. 805, 811, 173 S.E. 517, 519, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201cWhile depositions have been used in chancery proceedings since early times, their use as evidence in criminal cases, or in civil suits at law was unknown to the common law. The right to take depositions in other than equity cases can, therefore, be conferred only by statute, which must be clear, and its requirements fully complied with before such evidence can be received.\u201d See 17 Am. Jur., Discovery and Inspection, \u00a7 32, p. 36.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">There is no showing of prejudice to the defendant in the court\u2019s refusal to require the Commonwealth to present to the defendant a list of witnesses and their reports \u201ctouching events and activities in connection with this case.\u201d Several weeks before the trial the defendant made his written statement of his version of the parts played by him and Capps in the killing. There is no complaint by the defendant that his counsel was not at liberty to talk to Capps and any other witness for the Commonwealth at any time prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the trial. The evidence given by the witnesses other than Capps was on undisputed points. The court\u2019s refusal to grant the blanket request of the defendant was not harmful to the defendant and was not error. <em>Abdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>173 Va. 458, 2 S.E. 2d 293; 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law, \u00a7 328, p. 354 and <em>\u00a7 </em>331, p. 358<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">(2) The admission of photographs of the body of deceased taken after its discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Defendant concedes that the admission of such evidence is in the sound discretion of the court, <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 205, 129 S.E. 2d 697; Anno., 73 A.L.R. 2d 769, 780. Defendant\u2019s contention is that these photographs were not relevant or material and tended only to inflame the jury. There is nothing to indicate that they had that effect. \u201cThe picture of the wounded body of a man in the repose of death should excite no more sympathy or prejudice than the exhibition of a living person with a bruised, broken and torn body.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 1009, 1022, 37 S.E. 2d 43, 49. The photographs here afforded some corroboration of the medical testimony and of the testimony of Capps, and as was said of those admitted in <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>they were admissible \u201cto show the degree of atrociousness of the crime, or the malice with which it was committed.\u201d 204 Va. at 214, 129 S.E.2d at 703. See Anno., 73 A.L.R.2d at p. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">(3) Refusing to allow defendant\u2019s counsel to read to the jury the bill of particulars in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The indictment was in the statutory form for murder. Code \u00a7 19.1-166. The bill of particulars, filed in response to defendant\u2019s motion, simply stated as above indicated that the defendant was present at the time the offense was committed and was the perpetrator of the offense.. It was only a written statement by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney as to what he expected to prove. It was not evidence, reading it to the jury would have served no proper purpose and it was properly forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">(4) Giving at the request of the Commonwealth Instructions 5, 7 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Instruction 5 told the jury that it might consider defendant\u2019s prior conviction of a felony as affecting his credibility but not as evidence of his guilt. It was permitted by Code \u00a7 19.1-265 and the evidence on which it was based was first volunteered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Instruction 7 told the jury that if Capps and defendant \u201cagreed, planned or designed\u201d to do bodily harm to Harmon, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>while engaged in carrying out such plan one of them shot and killed Harmon, and that such shooting should have been contemplated as a probable result of the common design, they were equally guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cEvery person who is present lending countenance, aiding or abetting another in the commission of an offense is liable to the same punishment as if he had actually committed the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201cIf there is concert of action with the resulting crime one of its incidental probable consequences, then whether such crime was originally contemplated or not, all who participate in any way in bringing it about are equally answerable and bound by the acts of every other person connected with the consummation of such resulting crime. * <em>Spradlin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 523, 527, 528, 79 S.E.2d 443, 445.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The evidence was that Capps took Harmon by Westry\u2019s house to get Westry to teach him a lesson. When Harmon sounded the horn several times Westry proposed that they go out and perform that mission. They did so and Harmon was killed by the use of the pistol furnished by Westry.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Instruction 7 correctly stated the legal principle involved, was warranted by the evidence and no error occurred in giving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Instruction 9 undertook to explain what constituted reasonable doubt. It was neither helpful nor harmful, but not reversible error. <em>Strawderman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 855, 108 S.E.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">(5) Refusing defendant\u2019s offered Instructions C, C-1, E-1, E-2, H-1 and H-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Instruction C as offered stated that if two persons had the same opportunity to commit the offense and there was a reasonable doubt about who did it, the jury should find the defendant not guilty. Defendant\u2019s complaint is that the court added \u201cunless * <em>* </em>the two were engaged together in carrying out a design # * as set forth in Instruction No. 7.\u201d The addition was properly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">C-l was on reasonable doubt and the court properly refused it on the ground that it was repetitious of Instruction A on the same subject given for the defendant. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 501, 507, 32 S.E.2d 711, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">E-1 would have told the jury that the absence of motive when there was reasonable doubt as to who committed the offense affords a strong presumption of innocence. The court gave Instruction G, which told the jury that it was not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove motive, but its presence or absence should be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>as bearing on defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. It was a more accurate statement of the law than E-l and was sufficient on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Defendant argues that E-2 or H-l should have been given to the effect that if the defendant and Capps acted independently of each other, only the one who did the killing could be convicted, and if there was a reasonable doubt as to which one did it the defendant must be acquitted. They were both properly refused because not warranted by the evidence and they omitted the element of joint design set forth in Instruction C.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">H-2 defined accessory after the fact and would have told the jury that if Capps shot Harmon and defendant knew it, and thereafter assisted in removing and burying the body, they must find the defendant guilty as an accessory after the fact. It was a peremptory instruction based on only a part of the evidence. Defendant admitted that he did these things, but they were done after the killing, and the instruction left entirely out of view what the defendant had done or shared in doing before these subsequent things occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The court gave in all seventeen instructions, nine on motion of the Commonwealth and eight on motion of the defendant. They fully and fairly explained to the jury the principles of law applicable to the issues in the case and we find no error with respect to those refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">(6) Defendant next complains because the court overruled his objection to a statement by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney in his argument to the jury that when Capps drove around to Westry\u2019s house Capps \u201cknew Westry and he knew the type of man Westry was, too.\u201d Westry had stated, as referred to above, that he did not tell anybody about the killing because he had been in the penitentiary and did not want to be sent back \u201cto pull time.\u201d In overruling defendant\u2019s objection the court instructed the jury that counsel were allowed to argue as to conclusions which they thought the jury might draw from the evidence, but that their argument was not evidence and the jury must draw its own conclusions from the evidence. No error occurred in this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">(7) Finally, defendant claims the court should have granted his motion for a mistrial made when the defendant was on the witness stand in his own behalf and was being cross-examined as to his written statement which he had put in evidence about his connection with the killing. Ele was asked what other things he talked to the officer about and he replied, \u201cHe talked to me about some more cases.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>was then asked, \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d His counsel objected and the court sustained the objection. Defendant argues that it was apparent to the jury that this refered to some other charges then pending against defendant which had no place in this trial. That conclusion is only a supposition, and in any event it derives from a statement by the defendant which affords no sufficient ground for declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">For the reasons stated the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
