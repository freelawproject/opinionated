Dervishian and Anne G. Dervishian, against defendant, National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford, to recover for loss or damage to trees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>shrubs under a \u201ccomprehensive dwelling policy\u201d of insurance issued to plaintiffs. Trial by jury was waived and the case was submitted to the trial judge upon an agreed statement of facts. There was a judgment for the plantiff in the amount of $900, and the defendant is here on a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The sole question presented is: Does the contract of insurance insure the plaintiffs against loss or damage to trees and shrubs from weight of snow and ice?</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 dwelling house and certain trees and shrubs located on the premises in Richmond, Virginia, were damaged by a snow storm on March 5-6, 1962. Defendant company paid the loss sustained to the dwelling, but denied payment for the admitted loss or damage to trees and shrubs on the ground that such loss was not covered under the terms of the policy of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Defendant agreed that plaintiffs had satisfied all policy requirements as to notice and election to exercise the optional extension of coverage hereinafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 dwelling was insured for $50,000, and the policy also covered the contents of the building and other personal articles for different amounts. Attached to the policy was a fire and allied perils endorsement, designated as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\u201cCOVERAGE GROUP A-BROAD FORM, BUILDING (S) AND CONTENTS. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY AND COVERAGE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Subdivision I of the endorsement, captioned \u201cDESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">\u201cA. <em>Buildings: </em>Insurance on buildings shall cover buildings, including additions in contact therewith, occupied principally for dwelling house purposes; lawns; fences; also, if the property of the insured and when not otherwise covered, building equipment, fixtures and outdoor equipment, all pertaining to the services of the described premises and while located thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Subdivision II, with catch line \u201cCOVERAGE,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">\u201cThis company agrees to pay for direct loss to those classes of property specifically insured under Group A of the Schedule [dwelling, contents and personal articles] caused by the following perils as defined and limited herein and further subject to all other conditions, limitations and exclusions contained in this policy and having specific reference thereto:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Then follows a list of thirteen \u201cPerils,\u201d with the definition and limitation of coverage for each. Peril No. 10 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u201c10. <em>Weight of Snow, Ice or Sleet: </em>Loss by weight of snow, ice or sleet shall mean only physical injury to the building (s) covered or containing the property covered caused by weight of snow, ice or sleet. This company shall not be liable as respects this peril for loss to outdoor radio and television antennas and aerials including their lead-in wiring, masts and towers, outdoor equipment, fences, retaining walls not constituting a part of a building covered, driveways, walks, lawns, trees, shrubs and plants, except as the direct result of the collapse of a building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Subdivision III, entitled \u201cOPTIONAL EXTENSIONS OF COVERAGE,\u201d provides under \u201cC. <em>Trees, Shrubs and </em>Plants:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201cThe insured may apply up to 5% of the amount specified for Item 1 of the Schedule to cover trees, shrubs and plants (except those grown for commercial purposes) on the described premises, but this company shall not be liable for more than its proportion of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) on any one tree, shrub or plant. This company shall not be liable under this Extension of Coverage for loss to trees, shrubs and plants resulting from the perils of Windstorm and Hail, Falling Objects and Collapse as defined herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Subdivision IV, catchline \u201cADDITIONAL COVERAGES,\u201d under category \u201cC\u201d, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">\u201cIf an amount of insurance and a premium have been inserted in a blank item of the Schedule, this company agrees to cover on trees, shrubs and plants (except those grown for commercial purposes) on the described premises, provided, however, that this company shall not be liable for more than Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) on any one tree, shrub or plant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Defendant company says that the contract of insurance \u201cis a \u2018limited peril\u2019 policy; that the perils or risk insured against are clearly defined, and where necessary limited in the classes of property to which they may be made applicable; that peril No. 10, entitled \u2018weight of Snow, Ice or Sleet\u2019 is expressly and as a part of its definition and limitation made inapplicable to loss to \u2018trees, shrubs and plants.\u2019 \u201d Thus it argues that the coverage provided by and limited in those portions of the policy denoted \u201cDescription of Property\u201d and \u201cCoverage\u201d could not be extended to cover damage to trees and shrubs from the weight of snow and ice under either subdivisions III (C) or IV (C), even if an additional premium had been paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>(which was not done in this case) for coverage under this latter subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Defendant company has not cited a single case in support of its argument, except cases setting forth the universally accepted principle that when a contract of insurance is clear and unambiguous the court has no alternative but to interpret it as written. E.g., <em>Pilot Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Crosswhite, </em>206 Va. 558, 145 S.E. 2d 143, this day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The parties agree that the language of subdivision I of the endorsement does not afford coverage for loss to trees, shrubs and plants, and that the language of peril No. 10, \u201cWeight of Snow, Ice or Sleet,\u201d under subdivision II, excludes liability for any loss to trees, shrubs and plants, except loss incurred as the direct result of the collapse of a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">However, they disagree on the effect and construction of subdivision III, \u201cOptional Extensions of Coverage,\u201d subsection \u201cC\u201d, where trees, shrubs and plants are specifically singled out and made the subject of coverage. There it is plainly and clearly stated that the insured may at his option apply an amount up to <em>5% </em>of the amount of coverage on the dwelling to \u201ccover\u201d loss of trees, shrubs and plants on the premises, with a certain limitation on the amount to be paid for each tree, shrub or plant. The only limitation of liability under this extension of coverage is that there is no coverage for trees, shrubs and plants if the loss results from the perils of \u201cWindstorm and Hail, Falling Objects and Collapse,\u201d which are defined as perils 2, 6 and 9, respectively, under subdivision II, \u201cPerils.\u201d Significantly, peril 10, \u201cWeight of Snow, Ice and Sleet,\u201d is not mentioned. If the defendant company had intended excluding the peril of the weight of snow, ice and sleet from the extension of coverage it could have easily done so by including this peril along with the three perils specifically named and excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Hence we construe the language of subdivision III (C), \u201cOptional Extensions of Coverage,\u201d to mean that since no coverage was afforded for loss to trees, shrubs and plants from the weight of snow, ice and sleet under either subdivision I or subdivision II, except as a direct result of the collapse of a building, plaintiffs may, if they elect to do so, apply 5% of the $50,000 coverage on the building, within specified limitations, to cover loss to trees, shrubs and plants resulting from the weight of snow, ice or sleet. If the language used is not so interpreted it would be meaningless and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The interpretation we have placed on the policy is fortified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>rule that where the language of an insurance contract is susceptible of two constructions, as manifested in the argument, it is universally held that it is to be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Fratarcangelo, </em>201 Va. 672, 677, 112 S.E.2d 892, 895; 10 Mich. Jur., Insurance, \u00a7 25, pp. 315, 316; 29 Am. Jur., Insurance, \u00a7 258, p. 640; 44 C.J.S., Insurance, \u00a7 297, pp. 1169-1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Plaintiffs having exercised the option provided for under subdivision III (C), they were entitled to recover under this provision of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Since plaintiffs did not claim coverage under subdivision IV (C) it is unnecessary that we discuss defendant\u2019s argument relating to this provision of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The trial court correctly denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for an attorney\u2019s fee, claimed under the provisions of \u00a7 38.1-70, Code of 1950, as amended, 1953 Repl. Vol. This section is clearly not applicable to the case at bar as it deals with \u201cforeign or alien\u201d insurance companies not authorized to do business in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
