Part Payment\u2014Acceptance of, When in Satisfaction of a Debt.\u2014 When a debtor offers his creditor a sum of money less than the amount of an unliquidated debt, accompanying his offer with the condition that the money, if received at all, must be received in full satisfaction of the debt, the payment taken under such condition will amount to a satisfaction; but the statement that the payment is conditional, and is to be taken in full or not at all, must be such that the creditor does not or can not have failed to understand it. The mere statement that tire amount offered is \u201cin full of all demands to date,\u201d or \u201cin full of account to date,\u201d is not sufficient.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\" pgmap=\"320\">Assumpsit, for money had and received.

Abbott, attorney for appellant,</attorneys><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3t\" pgmap=\"320\">contended that receiving and retaining a conditional tender, although received under the statement that it is in part satisfactory-only, operates as a satisfaction of an unliquidated debt. 18 Am. and E. Enc., 154; McDaniels v. Lapham, 21 Vt. 222; McDaniels v. Bk. of Rutland, 29 Vt. 230; Fuller v. Kemp, 138 N. Y. 238.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\" pgmap=\"320\">A payment by check of a lesser sum than is admitted to be due operates as a satisfaction of a larger indebtedness. Goddard v. O Brien, 21 Am. L. Reg. (N. S.) 637; Jaffray v. Davis, 124 N. Y. 164; Sebree v. Tripp, 15 M. &amp; W. 26.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqB\" pgmap=\"320(100) 321(19)\">The general principle is : Where a debtor offers to the \u25a0 creditor a certain sum in payment of the debt, the amount of which is open and unliquidated, and accompanies his offer with the condition that the money, if taken at all, must be received in full, or in satisfaction of the debt, and the creditor receives it, this operates as a payment even though the creditor, when receiving the money, declares that he will only take it as part satisfaction of the debt, and as far as it wrill extend. 18 Am. and E. Enc., 154; McDaniels v. Lapham, 21 Vt. 222; McDaniels v. Bank of Rutland, 29 Vt. 230; Fuller v. Kemp, 138 N. Y. 238.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-4\" pgmap=\"321\">S. Leonard Boyce, attorney for appellee,</attorneys><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azd\" pgmap=\"321\">contended that where any ascertained sum of money is fully due and payable from one to another, if the creditor accepts a less sum in satisfaction, the payment is a discharge of only so much as it amounts to. Bishop on Contracts, Chap. 3, Sec. 50, p. 19.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\" pgmap=\"321\">Payment of a lesser sum in satisfaction of a greater, can not be any satisfaction for the whole, because it appears-that by no possibility a lesser sum can be a satisfaction to the plaintiff for a greater sum. Pinnel\u2019s Case, 3 Coke, 238.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\" pgmap=\"321\">The rule is well settled that an acceptance by the creditor of a sum less than the amount due, in satisfaction, or an agreement to take a less sum in satisfaction, is, in the first case, a discharge of only so much of the debt, and in the other case the promise is void as without consideration. Hayes et al. v. Mass. Life Ins. Co., 125 Ill. 638.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\" pgmap=\"321\">The general principle that the acceptance of a less sum in money than is actually due can not be a satisfaction, and will not operate to extinguish the whole debt, although-agreed by the creditor, seems to be recognized in books of unquestionable authority. The reason of the rule is, as stated by Lord Ellenborough in Fitch v. Sutton, 5 East, 232, that there must be some consideration for the relinquishment of the excess due beyond the sum paid\u2014something to show the possibility of benefit to the party thus relinquishing a legal right, otherwise the agreement is nudum paotum. Brooks v. White, 2 Metc. 285.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-8\" pgmap=\"321(88) 322(66)\">The authorities are numerous, and, it is believed, uniform, that the payment, in money, of a debt due and payable in money by the debtor, at the place where he was bound to make it, of a sum less than the full amount, and at the same time an agreement of the creditor to discharge the residue, will not operate as a defense to a suit for the balance. The reason is' obvious; the agreement of discharge is without consideration. By the payment of a part, the defendants laid no foundation for an obligation in the plaintiff, but merely made discharge, jyro tanto, for their own, which they had long omitted. Bailey v. Day, 26 Maine, 88; see also Pinnel\u2019s Case, 3 Coke, 238; Heathcote v. Crookshanks, 2 T. R. 24; Cumber v. Wane, 1 Strange, 426; Bishop on Contracts, Chap. 3, Sec. 50, p. 19; 2 Parsons on Contracts (6th Ed.), 618.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\" pgmap=\"322\">The payment of a less sum of money than the real debt would be no satisfaction of a larger sum without a release by deed. Titsworth v. Hyde, 54 Ill. 386.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\" pgmap=\"322\">- A debt is liquidated when it is certain what is due, and how much is due, for although it may appear something is due, if it does not appear how much is due, the debt is not liquidated. \u201c An unliquidated debt is one which one of the parties can not alone render certain \u201d (i. e., when it can not be made certain by mere calculation). 1 Sutherland on Damages, 10; 2 Bouvier, L. D. 13; Clark, Jr., v. Denton, 69 Ill. 521.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-7\" pgmap=\"322\">It is a general rule that where the amount of a-debt is fixed and certain, or capable of being reduced to certainty by computation, the payment of a part of such debt can not have the effect of an accord and satisfaction without a release under seal. But where the amount or debt is unascertained and not fixed or certain, the rule is otherwise, and the payment and acceptance in satisfaction of a less sum will support a plea of accord and satisfaction. Capital City Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Detwiler, 23 Ill. App. 659; see also Palmerton v. Huxford, 4 Den. 166; Mathias v. Bryson, 4 Jones (N. C. Law), 508; Cool v. Stone, 4 Iowa, 219; McDaniels v. Lapham, 21 Vt. 222; Taylor v. Nussbaum, 2 Duer, 302; Harris v. Story, 2 E. D. Smith, 363; Neary v. Bostwick, 2 Hilt. 514.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-8\" pgmap=\"322(60) 323(18)\">The specific tender by a debtor, with acceptance by the creditor, of a sum less than the amount claimed by the latter to be due, constitutes an accord and satisfaction between the parties where the claim is for an unliquidated amount, or the thing paid or given in satisfaction of a liquidated amount is personal property or securities, something other than money, and not otherwise. Martin v. White, 40 Ill. App. 282; Tompkins v. Hill, 145 Mass. 379.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-4\" pgmap=\"323\">\u201c If a creditor having an unliquidated or disputed claim against his debtor, accepts a sum smaller than the amount claimed in satisfaction of his claim, he can not afterward maintain an action for the unpaid balance of his original claim.\u201d Tuttle v. Tuttle, 12 Met. 551; Donohue v. Woodbury, 6 Cush. 148.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\" pgmap=\"323\">The tender and acceptance of a lesser sum only amount to an agreement, and unless there is some new consideration, must be as ineffectual to discharge the debt as an agreement otherwise formed. To amount to an accord and satisfaction the creditor must receive some actual benefit that he would not otherwise have had. See Am. and Eng. Ency of Law, title \u201c Accord and Satisfaction,\u201d and cases there cited.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\" pgmap=\"323\">If the plaintiff had a cause of action for the balance of the account it could only be extinguished by a satisfaction which he agreed to accept, but such agreement must be on a new and sufficient consideration. See Cumber v. Wane, 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 606, and notes; Neal v. Handley, 116 Ill. 418; Hayes v. Mass. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 125 Ill. 626-638; Rose v. Hall, 26 Conn. 392; Miller v.

Peterson v. Grant, 84 Vt. 201; Cole v. The Transportation Co., 26 Vt. 87; McDaniels v. The Bank of Rutland, 29 Vt. 230; Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, Vol. 18, p. 154; Western Union Ry. Co. v.
