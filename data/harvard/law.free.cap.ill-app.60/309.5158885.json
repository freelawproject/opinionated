A judgment against a party without notice, either actual or constructive, is void. It is not a judgment; it is a blank, as if it had not been written. Vail v. Iglehart, 69 Ill. 334; Smith v.

Hallo well, 34 Ill. 168, an action of debt was brought upon a judgment of a Circuit Court in Hew York. The record was silent as to whether there was service of process on the defendant. The court held that jurisdiction would be presumed. Judge Lawrence in his opinion disposes of the case as follows :</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-6\" pgmap=\"308\">\u201c It is contended by the plaintiff in error that this record is not even prima facie evidence of jurisdiction. This is the only question presented for the decision of the court. We consider the point too well settled for serious controversy. The judgment itself is f rima facie evidence of jurisdiction.\u201d Citing Horton v. Critchfield, 18 Ill. 135, and other cases. See also Grignon v. Astor, 2 How. (N.Y.) 319; Galfin v.

Marie * * * it is thus contained.\u201d Also the certificate, apparently under the same seal, of the inspector of public offices, that the signature to the first certificate is the signature of the local registrar. Also under the same seal a certificate of the president of that court that the person certifying as local registrar is such, and the signature genuine. And last, a sweeping certificate by the lieutenant-governor of the Province of Ontario, under the seal of the province, to the existence of the court, the official positions of the persons certifying as president and local registrar, the genuineness of their signatures, and that the local registrar has the legal custody of the records of the court.</p> <p id=\"b309-9\" pgmap=\"309\">This last certificate is signed, \u201cBy Command, J. W. Insor, Secretary of the Province of Ontario.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b309-11\" pgmap=\"309\">This certificate as well as the first mentioned is addressed \u201c Victoria, by the Grace of God, of the Hnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, etc., etc. To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b309-12\" pgmap=\"309\">With some misgiving, we hold that we are to assume, or take judicial notice of the organization of the Dominion of Canada, of which the last certificate says that the Province of Ontario is part, and therefore to treat these certificates as competent proof of what they state. Gunn v. Parker, 36 Minn. 177, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b309-14\" pgmap=\"309(21) 310(16)\">As to the second question, the record thus certified is only of the judgment by itself, purporting to be upon a verdict. No process, appearance, pleading, trial, verdict\u2014\u2022 nothing preceding the judgment\u2014is in the record produced.</p> <p id=\"b310-4\" pgmap=\"310\">This suit was commenced in the Circuit Court on the 27th of March, 1894, and the summons served on the 2d of April. The judgment at Sault Ste. Marie was rendered November 20, 1893.</p> <p id=\"b310-5\" pgmap=\"310\">Whether there be any presumption that the plaintiff in error resides here or not, the proximity of these dates suggests that great burdens may be imposed upon our citizens by the rule that a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction must be held to have been rendered in the due exercise of that jurisdiction over person and subject-matter, unless the contrary be shown. Dunbar v. Hallowell, 34 Ill. 168.</p> <p id=\"b310-6\" pgmap=\"310\">It would be safer, the affirmative being much easier proved than the negative, if the jurisdiction, at least, over the person, were required to be shown, as in Thurber v. Blackbourne, 1 N. H. 242, and Allen v. Blunt, 1 Blatehford, 480. Perhaps this last ease is distinguishable because of the peculiar character of the United States judicial system. But we must follow the Supreme Court and affirm the judgment.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
