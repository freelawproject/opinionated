J. Walsh, who states that he is the agent of the complainant therein named, Edwin Pardridge; that he has read the foregoing bill of complaint and knows the contents thereof and knows the same to be true of his own knowledge, except as to such matters and things as are therein stated to be upon his information and belief, and as to those things so stated he believes them to be true.</p> <p id=\"b476-9\" pgmap=\"476\">As the charges in the bill are made by Edwin Pardridge, who therein \u201c represents \u201d that various matters exist, the affidavit in effect is that Walsh knows that Pardridge represents certain things to be as set forth in the bill; with the exception as to those matters as \u201c are therein stated to be upon {his \u2019 information and belief; \u201d that is, upon the information and belief of Walsh. As nothing in the bill is stated upon the information or belief of Walsh, the affidavit is in this regard meaningless.</p> <p id=\"b476-10\" pgmap=\"476\">\u00a1Nor was it made to appear that the rights of the complainant would be unduly prejudiced if an injunction was not issued without notice. What was made to appear was that E. J. Walsh was advised and informed and stated the fact to be that the complainant would be unduly prejudiced if \u201c the \u201d injunction in this cause \u201c is \u201d (were) not issued immediately and without notice to the defendant. This statement is a conclusion of the affidavit; neither to the master nor the court was thereby anything made to appeal save the conclusion of E. J. Walsh. It is to the court that the necessity for the issue of an injunction without notice must be made to appear, and facts from which the court can arrive at such conclusion should be set forth. Brough v.

J.</author> <p id=\"b477-6\" pgmap=\"477\">The affidavit of Walsh to dispense with notice of the application is in its fair construction an affidavit that Pardridge was advised, etc., which, if true, might better be sworn to by Pardridge himself.
