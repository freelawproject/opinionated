Citing Fisher v. Deering, 60 Ill. 114; Schiedt v. Beltz, 4 Brad. 431; Harms v. McCormick, 132 Ill. 104.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-3\" pgmap=\"425\">The document offered in evidence as a lease consisted of two parts, the first of which was intended to be a demise by the Phenix Insurance Company of certain premises, but not executed; and the second part, which purports to be executed by plaintiff in error, contains stipulations to pay rent, among other things. The consideration of the covenant to pay rent is the covenant by the lessor for quiet enjoyment, and where that covenant is lacking, because of the absence of the execution by the lessor, the action of covenant can not be sustained upon proof of the execution by the lessee alone.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-4\" pgmap=\"425\">A lessee entering and holding under a lease, not executed by his landlord, is not estopped, in an action by the assignee of the lessor, from showing such non-execution; and under such circumstances, although the lease is executed by the lessee, if it is not executed by the lessor, the lessee is not liable upon the covenants therein, for, the lease being void, there is no consideration for his covenants, even though he occupies during the entire term. 1 Wood\u2019s Landlord &amp; Tenant (2d Ed.), 441; Woodfall\u2019s Landlord and Tenant (Am.

The right of suit is constituted by covenantor\u2019s execution of the deed. The acceptance of the deed by the covenantee and his production of it at the trial sufficiently testify his assent to the contract, if necessary to render it binding.

Pbesiding Justice Gaby</author> <p id=\"Aayh\" pgmap=\"426\">delivebed the opinion of THE CoUET.</p> <p id=\"b426-7\" pgmap=\"426\">, The Phenix Insurance Company of Brooklyn, N. Y., being probably the owner of the Phenix building, in Chicago, intended to demise to the plaintiff in error, three rooms therein, and as a mode of so doing kept in its own possession a document, purporting to be a certificate that it had so demised, which certificate contained the terms of such supposed demise, and ended (being a printed blank) with a statement that the insurance company had \u201c affixed its corporate seal and caused these presents to be signed by its general agent \u201d on a date therein named.</p> <p id=\"b426-8\" pgmap=\"426\">No corporate seal or signature was affixed, so that in fact there was no such demise as was stated in the certificate. On the other side of the same sheet was a certificate by the defendant in error under seal containing the usual covenants by leases.</p> <p id=\"b426-9\" pgmap=\"426\">Now this suit is by the assignee of the reversion\u2014the grantee in fee of the insurance company. To enable an assignee to sue upon a covenant, it must be one that runs with the land, which can not be, unless there \u201c be a privity of estate between the covenanting parties.\u201d Keegan v. O\u2019Callaghan, 35 Ill. App. 142.</p> <p id=\"b426-10\" pgmap=\"426\">When the certificate of the plaintiff in error was executed it had no estate in the intended-to-be demised premises. If it ever obtained any estate, it was such as was implied by law from subsequent occupation and payment of rent. It would seem to be clear that the defendant in error can not maintain an'action of covenant. It is, however, not necessary to decide that question.</p> <p id=\"b427-3\" pgmap=\"427\">The declaration alleges that the Phenix Insurance Company, \u201c by a certain indenture then and there made between the said Phenix Insurance Company of the one part\u201d * * \u201c did demise \u201d -x\" * * \u201c and the said Corning Steel Company did thereby for itself covenant,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b427-4\" pgmap=\"427\">The plaintiff in error pleaded\u2014inter alia\u2014non estfactmn. Under that plea a variance between the declaration and the instruments produced was fatal. 1 Ch. PL (Ed. 1844), 483.</p> <p id=\"b427-5\" pgmap=\"427\">When the certificates were offered in evidence, the defendant in error objected on the ground of variance, but the objection was overruled and the defendant in error excepted.</p> <p id=\"b427-6\" pgmap=\"427\">There was a variance. Ho indenture, in either acceptation of the word\u2014as an instrument between two or more, or as an instrument under seal, whereby the insurance company demised, and the \u201c steel company did thereby for itself covenant \u201d\u2014was produced.</p> <p id=\"b427-7\" pgmap=\"427\">The certificate should have been rejected. We need not consider other questions.</p> <p id=\"b427-8\" pgmap=\"427\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
