We see no objections to the fifth instruction, of which appellant complains. It correctly states the law, and did not, so far as we can see, have a tendency to divert the jury from the main controversy of fact. The damages are within the showing made by the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b450-10\" pgmap=\"450\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
