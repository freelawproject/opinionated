An examination was had by the justice, and the defendant was recognized to appear at the next term of the criminal court.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\" pgmap=\"350\">The after proceedings, material to this case, are described and set forth in the following final order entered March 7, 1895:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\" pgmap=\"350\">And afterward, on the 7th day of March, 1895, it being the term of court aforesaid, the following, among other proceedings, were had and entered of record, to wit:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\" pgmap=\"350(311) 351(73)\">\u201c And now come the parties hereto, the people of the State of Illinois, by Jacob J. Kern, state\u2019s attorney, the complaining witness, Clara Wolff, being represented by F. W. Jaros, as her counsel, the defendant being present in open court, and being also represented by Henry Severin, his guardian ad litem, and also by Louis Danzinger and Edwin A. Munger, his attorneys; and this cause being now about to be called for trial, and it appearing to the court that a trial of this suit was had before the judge now presiding therein, namely, Arthur Chetlain, and a jury, on the 13th and 14th days of February, 1895, and that on the trial of said suit the complaining witness, said Clara Wolff, testified in the presence and hearing of this court that a child was born to her on the 13th day of March, 1894, which died on the 16th day of March, 1894, and that the defendant was the father of said child, which evidence was, on said trial, controverted by said defendant; that the jury on said trial disagreed and were discharged; and it further appearing to the court that said guardian ad litem, on behalf of said defendant, for the purpose only of avoiding the expense of further litigation touching the issues of this suit, has this day paid the costs of this suit in full, and has also this day in open court tendered to said Clara W olff and to her said counsel the sum of $25, which tender was by them refused, and that said sum was thereupon paid by the said guardian ad litem, to the clerk of this court, for the use and benefit and subject to the order of said Clara Wolff; and it further appearing to the court that said sum of $25 is the full amount to which by law said Clara Wolff would be entitled should the issues of this case be found in her favor, it is therefore ordered that said clerk pay said sum of $25 to said Clara Wolff. Whereupon said state\u2019s attorney moves the court that this suit be dismissed, without costs; and whereupon said counsel for said Clara Wolff demand an ' immediate trial of the issues of this suit.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\" pgmap=\"351\">And the court, being fully advised in the premises, doth overrule the motion of said counsel for said Clara Wolff, and doth sustain the motion of said counsel of said state\u2019s attorney, and it is thereupon ordered and adjudged that this suit be dismissed without costs.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\" pgmap=\"351\">To which order and judgment of the court, the said complainant, by her attorney, then and there excepted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-6\" pgmap=\"351\">E.
