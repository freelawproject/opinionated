Bent, the appellee herein, filed a bill in equity in the Superior Court of Cook County, against the appellants, alleging that the complainant below had a large manufacturing establishment, manufacturing \u201c Crown \u201d pianos, and had a large capital invested in said business, and a trade established throughout the United States,</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\" pgmap=\"371\">It was also alleged that the Everett Piano Company and others, made defendants in the bill, &lt;e with the intention of willfully and maliciously destroying the business of your orator, as aforesaid, in the manufacture and sale of pianos, * * * malignantly caused a circular to be issued to all parties throughout the United States dealing in your orator\u2019s pianos, as aforesaid, in which said circular the Everett Piano Company, aforesaid, falsely and maliciously stated that every person making, selling or using the pianos so manufactured by your orator as aforesaid, is an infringer and liable to prosecution as such.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-11\" pgmap=\"371(27) 372(102)\">Also that said false representations and statement had greatly interfered with the complainant\u2019s trade and caused many to rescind orders for goods, and caused many to state that they desired either to give up the business of selling the \u201c Crown \u201d piano in their towns and cities, or that the complainant should guarantee such dealers and customers against any loss or damage; that unless some relief could be had from such interference with complainant\u2019s trade, it was feared that his trade would be entirely ruined; that he had requested the defendants to desist from such malicious interference with his trade, but, notwithstanding such request, they had continued said interference. The usual prayer for an injunction was made, together with a prayer for a decree for recovery of damages.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-4\" pgmap=\"372\">The defendants in their answer admitted the issuing of such circulars, but denied the malicious intent as well as the allegations that they were false,'setting forth that they did not know whether they interfered with complainant\u2019s trade or not. A preliminary injunction was issued upon the filing of said bill. Afterward, on motion of the defendants to dissolve the injunction, affidavits were filed by both parties, upon which full arguments were had in the court below, and the motion to dissolve the injunction was overruled. Whereupon it was stipulated by both parties that the affidavit filed might be used as testimony in the case and the case proceed to final decree, whereupon a final decree was entered, making the preliminary injunction perpetual; also that the damages in said cause having been waived by the complainant, it was further ordered that the complainant recover of the defendants its cost to be taxed.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">An appeal was taken to this court, it being stipulated between the parties that the exparte affidavits, together with the exhibits and models used in the court below be used as evidence in said cause.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372\">The circular complained of is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\" pgmap=\"372\">\u201c Office and Factory of the Everett Piano, 1 Albany street, from Wareham to Malden streets, j Boston, Nov. 14, 1894.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-8\" pgmap=\"372\">Notification\u2014Infringement of the Pleotraphone.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-9\" pgmap=\"372(19) 373(48)\">All persons are hereby notified that the so-called 1 Orchestral Attachment\u2019 contained in the \u2018 Crown Pianos\u2019 manufaetured by George P.

This plectraphone attachment was patented.

Boston Diatite Co. v. Florence Mfg. Co., 114 Mass. 69; High on Injunctions, Secs. 1015-1093.</p> <p id=\"b375-13\" pgmap=\"375\">It is urged, however, that in the present case, a false statement was made concerning \"appellant\u2019s property and business, calculated and intended to intimidate customers and ruin his trade; that appellant, before an adjudication as to the same, could not know that the \u201c so-called orchestral attachment \u201d was an infringement of letters patent Ho. 515,-426; that its conduct in causing to be published in a trade journal the statement that it was about to begin suit against appellee for such alleged infringement, when no such suit had been instituted, and none, it is insisted, was then intended, shows that its circular was false and malicious. That appellant had the right to assert its belief that the \u201c orchestral attachment\u201d was an infringement, and to warn persons not to use the same, is admitted.</p> <p id=\"b375-17\" pgmap=\"375\">A person believing himself to be the owner of property, and that none other has \"title thereto, can not be by a court of equity restrained to stating his claim in this regard as a mere belief. Dicks v. Brook, L. R., 15 Ch. Div. 22-39; Halsey v. Brotherhood, L. R. 19, Ch. Div. 386.</p> <p id=\"b375-19\" pgmap=\"375\">It is insisted in this cause that a court of equity will interfere when such statements are false and malicious.</p> <p id=\"b375-20\" pgmap=\"375\">The record fails to make clear that the statement made by appellant is either false or malicious.</p> <p id=\"b376-4\" pgmap=\"376\">The assertion that the \u201c orchestral attachment \u201d is an infringement of appellant\u2019s patent may be untrue, but such untruth can be conclusively determined only by the judgment of a Federal court, and is a question, the investigation of which, under the allegations of this bill, a State court ought not to enter upon. Baltimore Car Wheel Co. v. Bemis et al., 29 F. R. 95; International Tooth Crown Co. v. Carmichael, 44 Fed. R. 350.</p> <p id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376\">That the circular in question was maliciously put forth does not appear. Appellant had been advised by counsel that the attachment manufactured by appellee is an infringement; its public assertion of what it had apparently in good faith been advised, and, so far as appears, believed, can not be held to be malicious. Hovey v. Rubber Tip. Co., 57 N. Y. 119; Celluloid Manfg. Co. v. Goodyear Co., 13 Blatch. 375.</p> <p id=\"b376-6\" pgmap=\"376\">The granting of injunctions in Casey v. Cincinnati Typographical Union and others, 45 Fed. Rep. 135, Cceur D\u2019Alene Consolidated &amp; Mining Co. v. Miners\u2019 Union et al., 51 Fed. Bep. 260, Blindell v. Hagan, 54 Fed. Rep. 40, Toledo &amp; Ann Arbor Railway Co. v. Penn. Co., 54 Fed. Bep. 730, and Sherry v. Perkins, 147, Mass. 212, cited by appellee, in each case depended upon the existence of a conspiracy to injure the business of the complainant, in which conspiracy there had been clearly manifested a malicious design to thwart his legitimate efforts to carry on his trade.' Ho such conspiracy or design is here shown.</p> <p id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">It does not appear that appellant is not perfectly responsible and able to respond for any pecuniary loss that appellee may sustain by reason of the issuance of the circular in question, or others of a similar nature; a feature of this case which it is apparent did not exist in any of the instances in which the acts of strikers and boy cotters have been enjoined as an unlawful interference with the business of those they sought to injure.</p> <p id=\"b376-8\" pgmap=\"376\">The decree of the Superior Court is reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
