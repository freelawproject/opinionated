Leibold knew for two months that the street was being paved, and saw the roller three hundred feet off, before he drove up toward it, but drove on, and when near to it, steam was blown, scaring the horse and injuring the appellant.</p> <p id=\"b341-9\" pgmap=\"341\">The court rightly instructed the jury to find for the city.</p> <p id=\"b341-10\" pgmap=\"341\">Mo defect is alleged in that part of the avenue occupied by the street railway. As to the residue, the duty of the city to keep it in condition for travel was susp\u00e9nded while paving was being done. Osgood v. Chicago, 44 Ill. App. 532; 154 Ill. 194.</p> <p id=\"b341-11\" pgmap=\"341(11) 342(41)\">Indeed, the claim of the appellant is not because of the condition of the street, but upon the theory that the reservation in the contract with Conway, of superintendence by the commissioner of public wo *ks, makes the\u2019 city liable, for the careless (if it was careless) act of blowing steam.</p> <p id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342\">Such superintendence did not constitute the driver of the steam roller the servant of the city. Fitzpatrick v. Chicago &amp; W. Ind. R. R., 31 Ill. App. 649.</p> <p id=\"b342-6\" pgmap=\"342\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
