In rejecting defendant\u2019s motion to be tried first on his self-defense claim and instead proceeding solely with the insanity issue, the trial court was guided by our opinion in <em>State v. Khan, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 417 A.2d 585 (App.Div.1980), which prescribes a bifurcated procedure that gives primacy to the adjudication of an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we decline to adhere to the bifurcation sequence set forth in <em>Khan. </em>We do so because <em>Khan </em>conflicts with several aspects of our State\u2019s Criminal Code; <em>Khan </em>relied upon District of Columbia case law that is no longer valid; and <em>Khan </em>is contrary to the approach of other states that have addressed the question. We instead hold that a defendant who wishes to present a substantive defense based upon at least some evidence, or who otherwise wishes to put the State to its burden of proving the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, should not be required to first submit to a trial restricted to the issue of insanity. Such an insanity trial, which might result in the defendant\u2019s indefinite commitment in a mental institution, should not have to proceed first.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Because, under the flawed mandate of <em>Khan, </em>defendant was not afforded the opportunity to present his claims of self-defense to a jury, we remand for further proceedings to provide that opportunity, on certain terms and conditions detailed in this opinion. We also refer the many issues of procedural design and potential rulemaking implicated by this case for prospective consideration by the Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Criminal Practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The procedural history of this case is lengthy and complicated. Moreover, the operative facts are substantially disputed and unresolved, given the absence of a trial on the merits. With those constraints in mind, we describe what presently appears in the record, recognizing that additional relevant facts may be developed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\n<em>The Fatal Stabbing and the Events That Preceded It.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">This case arises out of the fatal stabbing of Arthur Cooper, defendant Robert Handy\u2019s uncle, on January 13, 2004. They lived together in a residence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Paterson with defendant\u2019s grandmother, Pauline Cooper, and another relative, Mary Clay.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Defendant has long-standing mental health problems, including several hospitalizations for psychiatric illness. Four months prior to the stabbing, defendant was encountered by police officers in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he had walked all the way from Paterson. He was sitting on a bench, acting in what the officers perceived to be a bizarre manner. Defendant reportedly told the officers that all of his bones were broken and that he could not walk. Based on defendant\u2019s aberrant behavior, he was admitted to a psychiatric program at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hospital Center (\u201cSt. Luke\u2019s\u201d) in New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The physicians at St. Luke\u2019s determined that defendant was suffering from increased symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. After defendant\u2019s condition stabilized, St. Luke\u2019s discharged him in early October 2003, with instructions to continue treatment and take his medication. Defendant returned to live in the family residence in Paterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">There were no eyewitnesses to the stabbing that took place at the residence three months later on January 13, 2004. It is undisputed that defendant stabbed his uncle once, killing him. Defendant contends, however, that his uncle was high on cocaine at the time, that his uncle had attacked him with a metal pipe, and that he had used the knife only in self-defense. The State disputes that the uncle attacked defendant, contending that defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense is delusional and inconsistent with the circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Regardless of the impetus for the parties\u2019 fatal encounter, it is undisputed that several Paterson police officers came to the residence early that afternoon. Neighbors had apparently called the police because they had heard the uncle yelling for help and had seen him outside the residence bleeding. The police found the uncle lying in blood, approximately twenty-four-and-a-half feet from the front door of the dwelling, on a grassy patch off the front walkway. There was blood on the driveway, on the grass, and on the cement landing by the house. The uncle was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">According to the testimony of Sergeant Jose Fermin, one of the officers who responded to the scene, the front door of the residence was open. The residence, as Fermin described it, had \u201ca large amount\u201d of blood. Blood was smeared on the front door handle and frame. Fermin noted that a couch in the first room inside was \u201creally soiled with blood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The police discovered a metal pipe with blood on it, partly hidden underneath the couch. The pipe, which was approximately three or four feet long, had been painted green and marked with the words \u201cKing Reveal.\u201d The uncle had the same words tattooed on his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Family members who thereafter arrived at the scene identified the uncle and defendant from photographs in the residence. At about 3:00 p.m., while the police were still there, defendant returned to the residence, pushing a laundry cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Detective Agapito Guzman, one of the other responding officers, testified that defendant \u201clooked normal\u201d and that defendant had no difficulty in providing his biographical information or in relating what had happened. Other family members had informed Detective Guzman of defendant\u2019s prior mental problems but, \u201cjust looking at him,\u201d Guzman observed no indication of mental instability. One of the relatives who lived with defendant later told the police that a few days before the stabbing incident, defendant had been \u201cwalking throughout the residence ... in a threatening manner with a red-handled knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Detective Guzman asked defendant when he last saw his uncle. According to Guzman, defendant \u201ctold me that prior to him leaving to do his laundry [his uncle] hit him with [a] pipe. He immediately turned around and cut him, stabbed him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">At that point, Detective Guzman stopped the discussion. Defendant was informed of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, and he was arrested. The police recovered a red folding knife from his pocket, as well as a substantial amount of cash, $5400, apparently from a Social Security check.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">According to the autopsy report, the uncle died from one stab wound to the left side of his chest that penetrated his rib, lung, and heart. Cocaine was found in his blood and liver. The parties stipulated that, given the rate of metabolization, the amount of cocaine found in the uncle\u2019s body indicated \u201crecent use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Statement to the Police and the Police Investigation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Defendant was interviewed at the police station at approximately 4:00 p.m. that day. Sergeant Ferm\u00edn recalled that defendant had no apparent difficulty understanding his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he waived. Ferm\u00edn observed nothing during the interview to corroborate the mental health issues reported by defendant\u2019s family members. While providing background information, defendant indicated that he took medication for \u201canxiety,\u201d but added that he had taken no medication that day!</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">During the course of his police interview, defendant repeatedly maintained that he had stabbed his uncle in self-defense. He gave the following statements, which were later transcribed and read aloud in court by the prosecutor and Detective Ferm\u00edn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">Q. Do you know where you are at the present time and the reason you are here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">A. At the complex, <em>because I defended, myself with a weapon.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">Q. In your own words, can you tell me what knowledge you have concerning this incident?____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>A. I don\u2019t remember the time, but I think it was sometime before the afternoon. I was awakened by Arthur, he was banging on my bedroom door. He then asked me did I go into his room and cut the fan off, which he had in his room, I told him no, that Ma, (Pauline Cooper) had cut it off. He started to yell and argue with me, so I went to the bathroom took a shower and was getting ready to go and do my laundry. The whole time I was doing this he kept yelling and fussing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">While I was downstairs getting ready to leave he came downstairs like he wanted to fight me. I told him I was going to do laundry, whatever you want to do is on you. I had gone outside the house, and he came behind me. When I turned around ho had a metal pipe in his hands, holding it like if it was a baseball bat. He was saying something and glutting his teeth, 1 kept telling him to leave me alone over and over again. <em>Then he swung the pipe at my head and I blocked it with my left arm, which broke my ynistwatch. He kept swinging at me and I kept moving behind a tree to avoid him from hitting me, then I cut him. </em>When I cut him he backed up, it seems that he wanted to come forward but he went into the house, I gues[s]. He turned around and I left to do my laundry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">Q. Have you ever had any problems with Arthur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">A. Yeah, well I didn\u2019t have problems he had problems with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">Q. What types of problems did he have with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">A. He just don\u2019t like me, when we were younger we were in the hospital in East Orange. He hit me on the face with a squeegee because I wouldn\u2019t have sex with him. That\u2019s how I got the scar on my lip. After that happened he put a shotgun to my face and threaten[ed] me so that I would not say anything about what happened, it belonged to his father who was a Vet. Then in 2000 I was at St. Joseph\u2019s hospital in the Psychiatric unit!,] he was among one of the guys who sexually assaulted me and raped me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">Q. Robert!,] you stated that Arthur followed you after you walked out of the apartment and that when you turn[ed] and saw that it was him you hid behind a tree. Where is the [t]ree that you talk about in your statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">A. I think i[t\u2019]s in front of 118 Pearl Street, it\u2019s got a \u201cU\u201d in gold glued on with sparkles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-14\">Q. Where did he hit you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-15\">A. <em>He hit me once by my wrist and broke my watch band.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-1\">Q. Did you know that what you did was wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAG\">A. <em>I felt I was defending myself. If someone comes a,t you with a weapon how could that be wrong.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-18\">Q. Did you understand what you were doing when you stabbed him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-19\">A. <em>I was defending myself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Q. Do you know why Arthur came after you with the pipe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">A. No[,] but <em>he was drinking. </em>I saw him drinking a can of Budw[e]iser when I went to take my shower. <em>He probably was smoking crack, I smelled it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Defendant described the pipe and drew a sketch of it for the officers. He told the police that, after the stabbing, he cleaned the knife in water from a puddle. Then he went to the laundromat to wash his clothes, which he claimed had no blood on them. He said that he carried a knife everywhere he went, keeping it in his pocket in ease he had to defend himself. Defendant further stated that he had stabbed his uncle once before, when he thought his uncle \u201cwas going to get a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Detective Ferm\u00edn observed that the only damage to defendant\u2019s watch was a broken hinge that connected the band. Ferm\u00edn saw no physical injuries on defendant and, specifically, none to his left wrist area.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The police located the tree near the residence that defendant had described. According to Detective Ferm\u00edn, it had \u201ca U[shape] with glitter shiny stuff on it and some chunks of the bark that had been, looked like it had been struck by something.\u201d The missing chunks were on the ground. The tree was described by Ferm\u00edn as being sixty-nine feet from the residence, although defendant contests that measurement because it was not the straightest distance to the dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\"><em>As </em>further support for the claim of self-defense, defendant\u2019s submissions indicate that the uncle had a lengthy criminal history, much of it involving drags, including several convictions. In particular, a police report in defendant\u2019s appendix reflects that the uncle was arrested on January 6, 2004, a week before the stabbing, for selling crack cocaine. The defense contends that this history of drug involvement and criminal conduct bolsters defendant\u2019s claim that the uncle initiated the attack.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>On January 18, 2004, five days after he stabbed his uncle, defendant was interviewed at the Passaic County Jail by a licensed psychologist, Peter D. Paul, Ph.D. Dr. Paul diagnosed defendant as having paranoid schizophrenia. However, Dr. Paul perceived that: \u201c[defendant\u2019s] symptoms [did] not seem to impair his ability to think rationally about his legal ease\u201d; he was competent to stand trial; and that he would not present a danger to himself or anyone else if released. Defendant remained in the jail at that point, pending the anticipated criminal proceedings arising from the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In April 2004, a Passaic County grand jury indicted defendant and charged him with the purposeful or knowing murder of Arthur Cooper, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(1) or (2) (count one); unlawful possession of a knife under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for its use, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5d (count two); and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d (count three). Defendant pled not guilty to these charges, rejecting the State\u2019s repeated overtures to agree to a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Meanwhile, Dr. Paul recommended that defendant be transferred from jail to the Ann Klein Forensic Center (\u201cAnn Klein\u201d), where defendant was admitted in April 2005. Defendant was forcibly medicated while at Ann Klein and his mental status improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">\n<em>The Competency Evaluations and Proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">In December 2005, Evan Feibusch, M.D., a clinical psychiatrist at Ann Klein, found defendant competent to stand trial. Dr. Feibusch recommended that defendant be returned to the jail and that he continue with his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">On a date that is unclear from the record supplied to us,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court apparently found, in its initial review of the matter, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>defendant had waived his right to assert an insanity defense. However, that initial finding was revisited when a different judge assumed responsibility for the case. That second judge ordered a re-evaluation of defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and also his capacity to waive an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">At that point, defendant was evaluated by Susan Chung, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist at Ann Klein, whom the court had ordered to evaluate defendant\u2019s competency. Defendant was also examined by Roger M. Harris, M.D., a private forensic psychiatrist retained by his counsel. Dr. Chung and Dr. Harris reached differing conclusions on the subject. The court considered their respective opinions at competency hearings held in February 2008 and October 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">According to Dr. Chung, defendant has suffered from paranoid delusions. The delusions included perceptions that bats were entering his ears and were about to kill him; that his bones were broken when they were not; that during his twenty-four-hour stay at a hospital he was beaten, tortured, electrocuted, and sexually assaulted by hundreds of individuals; and that, while at Ann Klein, he had a child with one of the staff members. At times, defendant believed that his attorney and a judge who had previously presided over his case were among the persons that had sexually assaulted him at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Despite defendant\u2019s delusions, Dr. Chung concluded that he was competent to stand trial. Dr. Chung confirmed that she had considered the statutory requirements under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-4, and that defendant met all of the criteria. She noted that defendant was oriented to person, place, date, and time, and that he possessed a factual and rational understanding of the legal process and understood the different roles of the judge, the public defender, and the prosecutor. In her view, he understood the charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>against him and showed \u201cthat he\u2019s able to engage in a discussion of various legal options with his attorney.\u201d In addition, Dr. Chung noted that defendant\u2019s attitude towards his attorney had improved. She further noted that defendant \u201c[m]ost likely\u201d would continue to be competent to stand trial, as long as he was compliant with his medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Defendant\u2019s own expert, Dr. Harris, disagreed. In Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion, until defendant was freed from his delusions, he would be incompetent to stand trial. According to Dr. Harris, defendant\u2019s delusions were \u201cthe most problematic\u201d symptom for his anti-psychotic medication to address. Given the longstanding nature of those delusions, Dr. Harris concluded that the prognosis was \u201cpoor\u201d that defendant would ever be free of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Dr. Harris specifically disagreed with Dr. Chung\u2019s conclusion that defendant no longer had any delusions towards his attorney. According to Dr. Harris, although defendant \u201cvery much\u201d understood his attorney\u2019s role, and knew that the attorney was urging the defense he sought, he still linked her to \u201csome delusional idea that [she was] present in 2000 at [the hospital] and that [she] passively participated in his being ... assaulted and raped[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Dr. Harris did acknowledge that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that defendant\u2019s claim that he had acted in self-defense was \u201ccompletely truthful.\u201d In Dr. Harris\u2019s discussions with defendant, \u201cnot only did [defendant] seem to understand\u201d the legal ramifications of his self-defense claim, but \u201che told a coherent story about self-defense.\u201d Dr. Harris noted that defendant understood that \u201cself-defense means an acquittal[.]\u201d Defendant \u201cwas shocked that he was arrested,\u201d because he \u201cthought the defense is so strong that he wouldn\u2019t even be charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">\n<em>The Competency Ruling and The Bifurcation Ordered Pursuant to Khan.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">At oral argument in the trial court in October 2008, the prosecutor argued that defendant was competent to stand trial. However, the prosecutor further asserted that \u201cbased on the findings that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>really does not necessarily understand the complexities of his mental health condition, and probably never will, ... he [was not] competent to waive a psychiatric defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Citing to our opinion in <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 73, 417 A.2d 585, the prosecutor argued that because issues of insanity and self-defense were both present, the insanity issues must be tried first, despite defense counsel\u2019s opposition to that sequencing. The prosecutor acknowledged that defense counsel had made a \u201cvery effective argument that it <em>[Khan </em>] ... may not be the most practical sense of what the law should be[.]\u201d Nevertheless, the prosecutor asserted that the trial court was bound to follow <em>Khan </em>and try the insanity issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The prosecutor noted that \u201cthe fact finder could have significant difficulties when assessing the [defendant\u2019s] ability to act purposely, knowingly, or [recklessly] based upon the delusional psychiatric condition that unfortunately [defendant] has, and has had, and will have.\u201d The prosecutor argued that bifurcating the trial and adjudicating the insanity issue first, pursuant to <em>Khan, </em>could reduce such conceptual challenges for jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Significantly, in her own oral argument to the trial court, defendant\u2019s attorney did not adopt Dr. Hams\u2019s specific opinion that her client was incompetent to stand trial, apparently because she did not anticipate her expert would render that opinion. Instead, she agreed with the State\u2019s position, as supported by Dr. Chung\u2019s testimony, that defendant was competent to proceed. Defense counsel also agreed with the State, consistent with other portions of Dr. Harris\u2019s testimony, that her client was not competent to waive a psychiatric defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Defense counsel then turned to the procedural question of how the insanity and self-defense issues should be adjudicated. <em>As </em>we have already noted, defense counsel opposed the bifurcation process prescribed by <em>Khan, </em>in which the insanity issue must be tried first. Instead, defense counsel moved to have the court try her client\u2019s self-defense claim first, because no second proceeding would be required if that substantive defense proved successful. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>She asserted that the two defenses could not be tried together because the prejudice that \u201cspills over from the psychiatric defense to the self[-]defense [claim], is absolutely fatal to the self[-Jdefense case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">After considering these arguments and the experts\u2019 testimony, the trial court first concluded that defendant was competent to stand trial, so long as he continued to take his prescribed medications. The judge did not elaborate upon this point, which, as we have noted, was a position agreed to by both counsel. The judge further determined, again with the agreement of counsel, that defendant was not competent to waive an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Pursuant to <em>Khan, </em>the judge then determined that the insanity defense should be tried first in a bifurcated proceeding. The judge acknowledged that while some of the criticisms of <em>Khan </em>raised by defense counsel were \u201ccompelling,\u201d he was bound to follow <em>Khan </em>as precedential authority. In accordance with <em>Khan, </em>the judge ruled that a fact-finder \u201cshould first hear an issue that goes to the element of a crime before any sort of affirmative defense.\u201d The judge reasoned that the issue of insanity bore directly on the mens rea element of the homicide charges. As the judge put it, \u201c[wjithout the requisite mens rea, the rest of the issue [of culpability] becomes moot, and the case is over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The trial court memorialized these determinations in a written order dated October 20, 2008. The order specifically denied defendant\u2019s application to be tried first on his self-defense contentions. Defendant moved for leave to appeal that order, an application which we denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Thereafter, defendant waived his right to a trial by jury on the insanity issue that, pursuant to <em>Khan, </em>was to be tried first. The trial court determined that jury waiver to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\n<em>The Insanity Trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The insanity issues were developed through evidence in a bench trial that consumed three days in May and June 2009. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>outset of that trial, defense counsel briefly renewed her objection to proceeding first on the insanity defense. Counsel stipulated to the admission of the findings of the medical and toxicology reports concerning defendant\u2019s uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The State presented testimony from Sergeant Fermin and Detective Guzman, who described their investigation of the stabbing. None of the family members testified. The State also presented defendant\u2019s videotaped police statement, along with various items of physical evidence, including the red-handled knife, the metal pipe, and defendant\u2019s wristwateh with the broken band. The State did not present any expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The defense called Dr. Harris, who had previously testified at the competency hearing, as its sole witness at the insanity trial. Once again, Dr. Harris described defendant\u2019s psychiatric history and his interviews with defendant. He specifically noted defendant\u2019s prior psychiatric hospitalizations, including St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in 2000, St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in 2002, and St. Luke\u2019s in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">According to Dr. Harris, in his first attempt to interview him in March 2004, defendant was \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cjust felt like a teapot about to explode.\u201d Defendant was \u201cirritable, threatening, extremely suspicious, and hypervigilant.\u201d When defendant was told that his trial counsel had hired Dr. Harris, defendant immediately ended the interview because, as he perceived it, the attorney had been involved in \u201cnefarious things[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Dr. Harris next interviewed defendant in June 2006, by which point he had been on antipsychotic medication for two years. This time, defendant was \u201cmore cooperative\u201d and he told Dr. Hams about the circumstances of the stabbing event. However, defendant became agitated at times because he believed that \u201cthere are these forces that are plotting against him that aren\u2019t allowing him ... the day in court to have justice.\u201d Defendant insisted that he had no psychiatric illness. He said that he wanted his day in court because he believed the court would immediately see that he had acted in self-defense, that the case would be dismissed, and that he could \u201cgo on his way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Dr. Harris found it significant that defendant\u2019s delusions had not disappeared in two years of treatment. In Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion, defendant\u2019s delusions \u201corganize] ] the way that he experiences the world.\u201d The expert suggested a different psychiatric medication should be tried \u201cbecause of how resistant his delusions have been[.]\u201d Dr. Harris found that defendant would destabilize and become \u201cfloridly psychotic\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> within a few weeks after he stopped taking medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In an undated writing, defendant had listed forty names in what Dr. Harris described as an attempt to \u201cthink through who he can trust.\u201d As part of that writing, defendant placed his uncle\u2019s name at the top of a list of people who he perceived had harmed him or who could not be trusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">With specific respect to the stabbing incident, Dr. Harris acknowledged, as he had at the competency hearing, that \u201cit is possible that [defendant] was absolutely defending himself against Mr. Cooper.\u201d Whatever happened on that date, Dr. Harris felt that defendant was \u201ccertainly\u201d in a florid psychotic state at the time. In the expert\u2019s opinion, defendant understood the nature and quality of his actions, but he did not appreciate that what he was doing was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Dr. Harris was not questioned about the observations of the police officers that defendant appeared \u201cnormal\u201d when they interviewed him on the day of the stabbing. Nor was Dr. Harris questioned about the impact on his diagnosis of the arguably coherent portions of the statement that defendant provided the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Following these proofs, defense counsel limited her summation to the insanity issues. However, she reiterated that insanity was not defendant\u2019s \u201cpreferred defense,\u201d reserving her arguments on self-defense. In response, the prosecutor agreed that the court should accept Dr. Harris\u2019s conclusions and \u201cmake a finding that Robert Handy be not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d The prosecutor then asserted several reasons for treating defendant\u2019s self-defense claim as untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Insanity Ruling and the Final Judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">After summations, the trial judge immediately rendered his oral decision. In essence, the judge accepted Dr. Harris\u2019s testimony in its entirety and found defendant not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The judge first noted that there was no dispute that the victim died as a result of a stab wound and that defendant had stabbed him. The judge also found that defendant had not been taking the medications prescribed for him by St. Luke\u2019s, and adopted Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion that he was \u201cfloridly psychotic at the time of this incident.\u201d Additionally, the judge was persuaded that defendant understood the nature and quality of his actions, but that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The judge then offered some comments about defendant\u2019s self-defense claim. The judge examined the pipe and described it on the record, observing that \u201cit would just seem to me [that] if someone were wielding that pipe in anger and hit another human being at relatively close range in the arm, arguably, as the [p]rosecutor [suggested] earlier, there might be more damage than just a broken watchband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The judge acknowledged, however, that the self-defense issue \u201cwasn\u2019t probed to the extent\u201d that both counsel would have desired. The judge recognized that the record was only \u201ccomplete to the extent\u201d that the prosecutor had noted \u201csome of what his arguments might have been had self-defense been a jury question[.]\u201d Consequently, the judge rendered no final determination on whether defendant had established his self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Consistent with these rulings, on June 3, 2009, the trial court issued a final judgment of acquittal on all counts of the indictment, finding defendant not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The next day, the court ordered that defendant be committed to a psychiatric facility in the custody of the Department of Human Services, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-8b(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s commitment status was to be periodically reviewed thereafter, in accordance with <em>State v. Krol, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>236, 344 A.2d 289 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\n<em>The Present Appeal.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>7</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">This appeal followed. Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to proceed first with a trial on his asserted self-defense claim deprived him of his federal and state constitutional rights to present a defense and to due process and equal protection of the laws. Defendant specifically alleges violations of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as well as Article I, paragraphs one and ten, of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Defendant\u2019s central argument is that <em>Khan </em>was wrongly decided and is not good law. He contends that the bifurcation sequence mandated by <em>Khan </em>is contrary to both constitutional principles and the procedural approach of virtually all other jurisdictions that have since considered similar issues. Defendant maintains that, in spite of <em>Khan, </em>he should have been given the chance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>present his claim of self-defense to a jury before the trial court adjudicated whether he was not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant seeks a remand to proceed with such a plenary trial on his self-defense claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In response, the State contends that, despite what may be its conceptual imperfections, <em>Khan </em>remains the law, and that the trial court did not err in following <em>Khan </em>here by adjudicating the insanity issues first. The State denies that defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were transgressed in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The State opposes a remand for a trial on the self-defense issues. It argues that defendant\u2019s claim that he stabbed his uncle to avoid being hit with a pipe is fanciful and inconsistent with the forensic and circumstantial evidence. In this regard, the State emphasizes that defendant exhibited no injuries to his hand where he claims to have been struck by the pipe. The State asserts that it is far-fetched to believe that defendant\u2019s watch, which did not break except for the wristband, cushioned the alleged blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Following oral argument, the parties supplied us, at our request, with supplemental briefs addressing the double jeopardy implications if, hypothetically, the matter were remanded to adjudicate defendant\u2019s self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We now examine these various issues and, in particular, the continued viability of our prior decision in <em>Khan.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The issue of bifurcation and the related issues before us are essentially ones of procedural structure. At one level, they impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>cate very practical considerations of how courts should proceed when a defendant potentially could be exonerated of criminal charges based upon a substantive justification such as self-defense, but he might also be found not guilty of the charged conduct by reason of insanity. Those considerations entail what issue or issues should be tried, in what order, and in what manner. Beyond these practical concerns, the issues implicate several fundamental aspects of our system of criminal justice and the manner in which our courts deal with individuals with mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We approach our analysis with a frank recognition that the many issues of procedural structure posed by this appeal are multi-faceted and difficult, and that perfect solutions to them may be elusive or unattainable. Such issues have perplexed judges, scholars, and policymakers elsewhere, and there is no uniform national approach to addressing them. What is readily apparent is that the bifurcation procedures developed three decades ago in <em>Khan </em>to address these issues are sufficiently flawed to warrant reexamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We begin with some fundamentals. Under our system of criminal justice, the State has an important sovereign interest to deter wrongful acts and to punish appropriately the persons who commit them. The elements of those offenses are itemized, in as rational a manner as they can be expressed, in our Criminal Code. In a manner likewise designed to be coherent, rational, and fair, the Code also spells out the ranges of associated penalties for those crimes, which depend upon the particular characteristics of the offenses and of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">We also have a rich constitutional tradition of assuring that persons who are charged with crimes are treated fairly. In particular, under the Sixth Amendment and other cognate provisions, defendants are guaranteed a full opportunity to defend themselves in a robust manner and, subject to rules of ethics and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>court procedure, to mount their defense in the way that they themselves deem most beneficial to their overall interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Our Criminal Code details a variety of potential justifications, excuses, and defenses, and it is typically up to the accused himself, aided by the effective assistance of counsel, to decide which, if any, of those arguments to put forth before the trier of fact. Presumably, at the conclusion of the trial process, the jury or judge will have been enlightened by the self-determined advocacy of both the prosecution and the defense, and thereby reach a verdict that is fair, impartial, and grounded rightly upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">All of that becomes more complicated where, as here, the court is dealing with a defendant who suffers from a mental illness. At the threshold, the court must determine whether the defendant\u2019s thought processes are sufficiently afflicted that he lacks the competency to stand trial. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:4-4; <em>State v. Purnell, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 47, 925 A.2d 71 (App.Div.2007). Inherent in that competency requirement is the defendant\u2019s capacity to confer meaningfully with his trial counsel, and to identify which theories and strategies are most likely to produce a favorable outcome for him. If the defendant is not competent to stand trial, then his criminal ease does not proceed, and he typically would be thereafter confined in civil commitment until he gains or regains the competency to be tried. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-6b.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Apart from questions of competency, a defendant\u2019s mental illness also can bear upon the elements of the charged offense itself and the defendant\u2019s potential criminal responsibility. Depending upon the offense at issue, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the required mens rea, i.e., state of mind. If an accused, because of a diminished mental capacity, lacks the required state of mind, he may be acquitted on that basis. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2. The Code further authorizes a defendant to be found not guilty by reason of insanity, based upon his mental state at the time of the alleged criminal act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-1; <em>see also State v. Rivera, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>472, 485-88, 16 A.3d 352 (2011) (explaining the distinctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>among competency, insanity, and diminished capacity). However, if such an insanity-based verdict is rendered, the defendant might not go free. Instead, he may be committed to confinement in a facility for the criminally insane, where he will be periodically evaluated to determine when, and if, his freedom might be secured. <em>See Krol, supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 255-66, 344 A.2d 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We also are cognizant of our State\u2019s administrative and judicial processes for the civil commitment of mentally ill persons who pose a danger to themselves or others. If such illnesses and dangers have been sufficiently established, a person can be civilly confined, by judicial order, in a mental health facility, even if he has not committed a crime or violated the law. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.1 to -27.23; <em>R. </em>4:74-7f. This system is necessary for the protection of society, but it is tempered by our equally important values of civil liberties and individual autonomy. As part of those liberty interests, we recognize a mentally ill person\u2019s right, as a vulnerable member of our society, to be protected from physical harm or abuse. Within that right, we further recognize the individual\u2019s prerogative, in appropriate circumstances, to ward off physical harm through permissible acts of self-defense. Like any other human being, a mentally ill person has the right to defend himself, by reasonable means, from attacks by others. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Having outlined these important core principles, we now focus upon the specific questions of procedural structure implicated by this appeal. A number of questions are posed. Specifically, how should the courts handle a scenario such as this one, where the accused has a potential substantive defense that, if accepted by the fact-finder, might lead to his complete acquittal of the indicted offenses, but who also could be found not guilty by reason of insanity and potentially confined in a non-penal mental health treatment facility? Should such defenses, which to some extent may overlap and conflict, be tried together, or separately? If they should be tried separately, in what sequence? Should there be two trials, or one trial in two phases? And, who determines that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>consolidation or sequence? The defendant alone? The parties by-agreement? Or the court itself, irrespective of the parties\u2019 wishes?</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We attempted to resolve these thorny issues of procedural structure, at least to some extent, in our 1980 opinion in <em>Khan. </em>We now examine that opinion in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The defendant in <em>Khan </em>was indicted for murder and weapons offenses. <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 75, 417 A.2d 585. He claimed that he shot the victim in self-defense after the man charged at him, brandishing a hammer. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 417 A.2d 585. However, there was \u201coverwhelming psychiatric opinion evidence that [the] defendant\u2019s belief that he acted in self-defense and the facts he cite[d] in support thereof ha[d] no basis in reality and [we]re the product of a paranoid delusion.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Psychiatric experts diagnosed Khan with paranoid schizophrenia, but, at multiple competency hearings between 1977 and 1979, they disagreed on whether he was competent to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 76-77, 417 A.2d 585. At a competency hearing held in February 1979, the trial court found the defendant competent to stand trial, and denied his attorney\u2019s application for a hearing on his insanity at the time of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 417 A.2d 585. The court directed the public defender to assert an insanity defense on the defendant\u2019s behalf, and appointed a special attorney to present the defendant\u2019s self-defense contentions. <em>Ibid. </em>The court ordered that both defenses be presented, by separate counsel, at a single trial before the same jury. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Khan moved for leave to appeal. <em>Ibid. </em>Like defendant in the present case, Khan did not want his attorney to raise the insanity defense at trial because he maintained that he had acted in self-defense. <em>See id. </em>at 76, 417 A.2d 585. We granted Khan\u2019s motion for interlocutory review. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 417 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>On appeal, Khan\u2019s special counsel and the State argued that the court had correctly found that the defendant was competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>All the parties agreed that, if the defendant was deemed competent to stand trial, the insanity defense could not be interposed over his objection. <em>Ibid. </em>Only the public defender objected to a single trial on both defenses before the same jury. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The panel in <em>Khan </em>determined that a new competency hearing was necessary, in part because the defendant\u2019s delusions regarding his justification for the homicide might \u201cbe closely intertwined with his ability to consult intelligently with counsel relative to his defense[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 417 A.2d 585. It directed that the competency hearing be conducted according to the standards of competency set forth in the newly-revised Criminal Code at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-4b. <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 79, 417 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The <em>Khan </em>panel then considered what procedure should be employed if, hypothetically, the trial court found the defendant competent to stand trial, but he persisted in objecting to the presentation of an insanity defense. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 417 A.2d 585. Resolving that hypothetical question, the panel adopted what it construed as the rationale and holding of a case from the District of Columbia, <em>Frendak v. United States, </em>408 A.2d 364, 379-81 (D.C.1979). In particular, <em>Khan </em>determined that a trial judge has the discretion to interpose, sua sponte, a defense of insanity if it has found that the defendant \u201cis not capable of making, and has not made, an intelligent and voluntary decision\u201d to waive the defense. <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 81, 417 A.2d 585 (quoting <em>Frendak, supra, </em>408 A.2d at 379).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>Khan </em>expressed concern that the simultaneous presentation of both a self-defense claim and an insanity defense at a single trial could be \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d to the defendant. <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 83, 417 A.2d 585. The panel therefore concluded that \u201cthe unique circumstances\u201d of that case warranted bifurcation. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 417 A.2d 585. The panel specifically instructed that the proofs on the insanity defense should be presented and tried first. <em>Ibid. </em>If the jury found that the defendant was not insane at the time of the crime, then, and only then, would the trial proceed on the general issue of guilt or innocence and the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. <em>Ibid. </em>The panel provided no express reasoning, however, for requiring this sequence in such \u201cunique circumstances.\u201d <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>Khan </em>has been followed or mentioned in only a handful of our State\u2019s reported cases, none of which have questioned its underlying validity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The sole opinion of our Supreme Court that has mentioned <em>Khan, State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 270-71 n. 62, 524 A.2d 188 (1987), cited it in a footnote for an incidental proposition that does not directly pertain to the bifurcation issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that are raised in this appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">For numerous compelling reasons, we decline to follow the bifurcation approach set forth in <em>Khan. </em>First, <em>Khan\u2019s </em>approach cannot be readily harmonized with the criminal procedures prescribed under our Criminal Code. Second, the legal rationale for <em>Frendak </em>in the District of Columbia has essentially been overruled. Third, other jurisdictions addressing the subject have generally not endorsed or followed <em>Khan\u2019s </em>bifurcation approach. We amplify each of these reasons in the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The trial and appellate proceedings in <em>Khan </em>spanned the implementation and amendment period of the Criminal Code, <em>L. </em>1978, c. 95, amended by <em>L. </em>1979, c. 178, which became effective in our state on September 1, 1979, ten months before <em>Khan </em>was decided.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The new Code significantly altered the procedures to be followed when a criminal defendant appeared to be insane and, for the first time, established a comprehensive statutory standard for competency determinations. In several respects, the procedures adopted in <em>Khan </em>were not in sync with previous New Jersey law, nor with the procedures established by the new Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Our revised criminal statutes that had been in place since 1922, which were in effect when the criminal episode in <em>Khan </em>occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>and at the time of the competency hearings, mandated several procedures for the consideration of a defendant\u2019s competence and insanity. <em>See </em>Former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-2. Among other things, the fact-finder was to determine \u201cnot only the sanity of the accused at the time of the hearing, but [also] the sanity of the accused at the time the offense charged against him [was] alleged to have been committed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If the fact-finder decided that the accused was sane at the time of the offense, but insane at the time of the hearing, the defendant was to be confined to a mental health institution. <em>Ibid. </em>Conversely, if the accused was deemed insane at the time of the offense, then the charges against him were to be dismissed. <em>Ibid. </em>If the accused was also deemed to be insane at the time of the hearing, then defendant would be confined indefinitely at the State mental hospital in Trenton. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Notably, the insanity hearing under former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:163-2 was a civil, not a criminal, proceeding. <em>See Aponte v. State, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>441, 455, 153 A.2d 665 (1959). The pre-Code law afforded the trial court the discretionary authority to conduct a trial of the insanity issue \u201cin a preliminary proceeding under terms which would not prejudice the accused, <em>i.e., </em>a dismissal of the indictment if he is adjudged to have been insane at the time of the crime, and otherwise a right to retry the issue under the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 153 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The procedures under former <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:163-2 \u201cwere not intended to permit an accused to by-pass the criminal trial if he is able to defend, or to entitle him to a trial run of his defense of insanity by the expedient of asserting incapacity to defend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 153 A.2d 665. Instead, the purpose of the procedures \u201cwas to permit a termination of the criminal proceeding <em>if the accused is unfit for trial.\u201d Ibid. </em>If a defendant\u2019s incapacity was found under the terms of former <em>Title </em>2A, the court had the discretion to conduct a further inquiry, alone or with a jury, into the defense of insanity. <em>Aponte, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 455, 153 A.2d 665. The former statute did not require that the insanity defense be tried at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the time of the inquiry into the defendant\u2019s ability to stand trial, or that the defense be tried at all. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The ensuing adoption of <em>Title </em>2C and the comprehensive Criminal Code eliminated the two-part civil inquiry of former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:163-2. In its place, the Code provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-6f that \u201c[t]he fact that the defendant is unfit to proceed does not preclude determination of <em>any legal objection to the prosecution </em>which is susceptible of fair determination <em>prior to trial and without the personal participation of the defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The commentators to the Code explained that this provision was designed to allow for the pre-trial determination of certain issues, including insanity, when the defendant was found unfit to proceed. 2 <em>Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, </em>comment 6 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-6 (1979). It was intended to address concerns stemming from the ongoing \u201cconfinement of a defendant without an adjudication of guilt at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The procedure in <em>Khan, </em>isolating the determination of a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the crime from both the determination of his guilt, and the determination of other defenses, was therefore rooted in some respects in the separation of those issues under former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:163-2. However, <em>Khan </em>significantly departed from the civil proceedings called for under the former statute. <em>See Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84, 417 A.2d 585. <em>Khan </em>prescribed that the determination of insanity in a <em>criminal </em>proceeding, which could otherwise terminate in a judgment of acquittal, should occur prior to the determination of a defendant\u2019s actual guilt or innocence. <em>Ibid. </em>Neither <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:163-3, nor the Code provision that replaced it, specifically authorized a defendant\u2019s insanity to be tried and determined in such a separate criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Apart from that troublesome departure, the procedures in <em>Khan </em>also are at odds with the legal classification within <em>Title </em>2C of insanity as an affirmative defense. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:4-1. The 1979 Criminal Code codified the standards of the <em>M\u2019Naghten</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><footnotemark>14</footnotemark> test for insanity, which New Jersey had embraced since 1846. <em>See State v.

In particular, the Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">A person is not criminally responsible for conduct if at the time of such conduct he was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.

Delibero, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>90, 99, 692 A.2d 981 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The advancement of a claim of insanity under the Code does not relieve the State of its burden of proof. <em>Jimenez, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 406, 908 A.2d 181; <em>Delibero, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 99-100, 692 A.2d 981. To the contrary, the State remains \u201cconstitutionally responsible to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Delibero, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 100, 692 A.2d 981. However, juries must consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s insanity with respect to his ability to form the requisite mental state, which, as an element of the crime, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 106, 692 A.2d 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The procedures developed in <em>Khan </em>depart materially from these basic tenets. Rather than require the State to prove the elements of an offense in a criminal proceeding, <em>Khan </em>essentially presumes that the State has already done so. <em>See Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84, 417 A.2d 585.

That provision requires that the competency determination be based in part on a finding that the defendant was able to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his rights in a plea bargain. <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 82, 417 A.2d 585. The panel in <em>Khan </em>acknowledged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>If the same kind of assurance were to be required in the case of a defendant\u2019s waiving the defense of insanity, it could not be said logically that a person found competent to stand trial may nevertheless, under the same standai\u2019d, be incompetent to make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary choice to fox'ego the defense of insanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>[Ibid..]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"><em>Khan </em>attempted to remedy this potential inconsistency by directing that the inquiry into the waiver of the insanity defense \u201cshould avoid an incursion into the area of mental capacity which might develop into an irreconcilable conflict with the finding of competency to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82-83, 417 A.2d 585. Instead, \u201cthe inquiry into whether the choice [to waive the defense of insanity] was knowing, intelligent and voluntary should be in terms of defendant\u2019s awareness of his rights and available alternatives, his comprehension of the consequences of failing to assert the defense and the freeness of the decision to waive the defense[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 417 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In fashioning these procedures, the panel in <em>Khan </em>was largely persuaded by aspects of the District of Columbia Court in <em>Frendak. Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 80-82, 417 A.2d 585 (citing <em>Frendak, supra, </em>408 A.2d at 373-79). In particular, <em>Khan </em>adopted <em>Frendak\u2019s </em>rationale that a competency finding was not intended to measure a defendant\u2019s ability to make intelligent decisions on matters related to his defense. <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 81, 417 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\"><em>Khan </em>and <em>Frendak </em>both cited <em>Whalem v. United States, </em>346 F.2d 812 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 <em>U.S. </em>862, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>124, 15 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 100 (1965), as part of their analysis. The issue in <em>Whalem </em>was \u201cwhether or not a competent defendant may refuse to plead insanity even though there may be facts available to support that defense; and if so, whether the trial judge commits error by not raising the issue of insanity sua sponte and instructing the jury.\u201d <em>Whalem, supra, </em>346 F.2d at 818. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held in <em>Whalem </em>that a trial judge \u201cmust have the discretion to impose an unwanted defense on a defendant and the consequent additional burden of proof on the Government prosecutor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court issued two opinions that emphasized defendants\u2019 \u201cright to make decisions central to their defense.\u201d <em>Frendak, supra, </em>408 A.2d at 375. The first, <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 <em>U.S. </em>25, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), held that it was not unconstitutional for a trial judge to accept a guilty plea from a defendant who proclaimed his innocence. The second, <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>806, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), guaranteed a defendant\u2019s right to represent himself and prohibited a state from compelling a defendant to accept representation by an attorney. Those Supreme Court cases reasoned that a defendant must be permitted to make choices central to his own defense, even if they might prove to be detrimental.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In 1991, twenty-six years after <em>Whalem </em>was decided, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia repudiated <em>Whalem </em>in <em>United States v. Marble, </em>940 F.2d 1543, 1545 (D.C.Cir. 1991). As the court noted in <em>Marble, </em>\u201c[n]o other federal court of appeals has imposed a duty upon the district court to raise the insanity defense; indeed, only a few have even considered the issue.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court further noted in <em>Marble </em>that the imposition of an insanity defense, over the objection of a defendant who was competent to stand trial, raised \u201ctroubling questions\u201d for several reasons. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">First, <em>Marble </em>observed that the <em>Whalem </em>line of eases was in \u201csubstantial tension\u201d with the propositions expressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Alford </em>and <em>Faretta, </em>holding that the court may defer to a defendant\u2019s strategic decision to accept criminal responsibility even where the defendant\u2019s \u201cactual culpability is neither proven nor admitted.\u201d <em>Marble, supra, </em>940 <em>F.2d </em>at 1546. Second, to compel a defendant to assert a particular defense that forces him to affirm that he is insane renders both counsel and the defendant, in effect, organs of the State. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In keeping with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Alford </em>and <em>Faretta, </em>the Court of Appeals in <em>Marble </em>overruled <em>Whalem. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>Marble </em>held that \u201ca district court must allow a competent defendant to accept responsibility for a crime committed when he may have been suffering from a mental disease.\u201d <em>Marble, supra, </em>940 F.2d at 1546. The trial court \u201cmust honor the choice of a competent defendant not to raise the insanity defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1548. It is only \u201c[w]hen a defendant can make no clear choice for or against raising the defense, and the evidence suggests that the defense is viable, it might then be appropriate for the court to exercise its discretion to instruct the jury sua sponte.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">With respect to the critical issue of bifurcation presented here, <em>Khan </em>endorsed a trial sequence that was actually contrary to the then-existing procedures utilized in the District of Columbia and noted in <em>Frendak. </em>The District of Columbia did permit a bifurcated proceeding when a defendant raised an insanity defense. <em>Frendak, supra, </em>408 A.2d at 369 n. 4. But the issue of insanity was not to be considered by the trier of fact in the District of Columbia until the prosecution had established the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ibid. </em>Only when a jury had already found a defendant guilty of the charged offense could it then consider the insanity defense. <em>Id. </em>at 377; <em>see also Bethea v. United States, </em>365 A.2d 64, 94 n. 67 (D.C.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>911, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2979, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1095 (1977).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Hence, <em>Khan </em>departed from the procedures of the District of Columbia by directing that issues of insanity and self-defense be bifurcated at trial, with the insanity issue tried first. <em>Khan, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84, 417 A.2d 585. Under the <em>Khan </em>approach, only if the defendant is found not to have been insane at the time of the crime does the trial then proceed on the general issue of innocence or guilt, where defendant might raise substantive defenses, such as self-defense. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In sum, <em>Khan\u2019s </em>reliance upon <em>Frendak </em>and <em>Whalem </em>is now misplaced, in light of current federal law. Moreover, the bifurcation sequence adopted in <em>Khan </em>is contrary to the sequence that had been provided for in the District of Columbia when <em>Frendak </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Defendant further argues that the sequencing called for under <em>Khan </em>is inconsistent with the law of most other states that have addressed the scenario. Defendant is correct in this observation, and the State has not shown otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">For example, in California, \u201c[w]hen a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, and also joins with it another plea or pleas, the defendant shall first be tried as if <em>only </em>such other plea or pleas has been entered!.]\u201d <em>See Cal.Penal Code </em>\u00a7 1026(a) (Deering 2011) (emphasis added). At that initial trial, \u201cthe defendant shall be conclusively presumed to have been sane at the time the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If the jury shall find the defendant guilty, or if the defendant pleads only not guilty by reason of insanity, \u201cthen the question whether the defendant was sane or insane at the time the offense was committed shall be promptly tried, either before the same jury or before a new jury in the discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Other states provide a defendant with the statutory right to a bifurcated trial when he pleads not guilty by reason of insanity and also asserts other defenses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In those states allowing such bifurcation, the dominant approach is to have the substantive defenses tried <em>first, </em>and, if necessary, the insanity defense tried thereafter. <em>See generally </em>Debra T. Landis, Annotation, <em>Necessity or Propriety of Bifurcated, Criminal Trial on Issue of Insanity </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Defense, </em>1 A.L.R.4th 884 (1980 &amp; Supp.2010);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Verla Seetin Neslund, Comment, <em>The Bifurcated Trial: Is It Used More Than It Is Useful?, </em>31 <em>Emory L.J. </em>441 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Some state legislatures have provided for a procedure allowing a criminal defendant to make an election as to the sequencing of his defenses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Other states leave the issue of bifurcation to the sound discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A pivotal consideration in several of those states is whether \u201cthe accused has a substantial defense on the merits which may be prejudiced by the admission of evidence as to the insanity defense.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Landis, supra, 1 A.L.R.4th 884 at \u00a7 2[a]. However, not all states follow that approach. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4; <em>see also </em>Neslund, <em>supra, </em>31 <em>Emory L.J. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>486-87.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, some states have held that mandating bifurcation of these issues is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Despite these wide variations in practice among the states, one thing is clear. The bifurcated sequence called for under <em>Khan, </em>mandating that the insanity issues be tried first, is an outlier. The vast majority of states that have considered the issue have not adopted a similar approach. In fact, neither of the parties have identified in their briefs another jurisdiction that follows the <em>Khan </em>bifurcation sequence. That only increases our reluctance to reaffirm <em>Khan\u2019s </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">These abundant reasons persuade us to depart from the bifurcated sequence set forth in <em>Khan. </em>We do not agree with <em>Khan </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>an interposed insanity defense must be tried first before the State has met its evidential burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or before a defendant has received an opportunity to seek an acquittal on the merits. <em>Khan </em>also prescribes a sequence that is opposite to that followed by most other states allowing bifurcation. In fact, the trial judge in this very case expressed in his bench comments some reluctance to apply <em>Khan. </em>For these reasons, we decline to follow <em>Khan </em>in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">That said, we face considerable constraints, particularly as an intermediate appellate court deciding an appeal involving only two lawyers<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and a rather idiosyncratic procedural history, in designing an optimal procedure that prospectively should take <em>Khan\u2019s </em>place. For many reasons, the design issues are troublesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The simultaneous pendency of a self-defense claim and an insanity defense in a homicide trial places both sides in an awkward position. The proofs necessarily must delve, at least to some degree, into the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the killing. In endeavoring to secure a conviction in this ease, for example, the prosecution will want to show that defendant had no justification to use deadly force, and that his perceived need to defend himself from an attack was irrational. However, if the State presses that argument of irrational perception too far, it runs the risk that doing so will help validate defendant\u2019s insanity defense. On the other hand, defendant must be careful in advancing his self-defense theory of portraying himself too much as a rational actor, for if the self-defense theory fails, his assertion that he knew what he was doing in deploying deadly force will undermine his separate contention of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">When a mental health expert who has evaluated a defendant testifies, trial counsel for both sides can have ambivalence about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the opinions that the expert renders. If the expert states that the defendant was delusional, that could help defeat the self-defense claim, but also could bolster an insanity defense. Similarly, an expert who opines that the defendant is and was perfectly sane may help the State on the insanity issue, but also might fortify the defendant\u2019s contention that he justifiably perceived the need to ward off an attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">These strategic problems may be heightened at a so-called \u201cunitary\u201d trial, at which the fact-finder receives proofs on all of the issues, including the insanity defense, and renders a comprehensive verdict. The problems arguably might be abated, to some degree, by sequencing the proofs in a two-phased trial before the same jury, in which the insanity issue is reserved for a second, conditional phase only if the self-defense claim fails in the first phase and the defendant is found guilty.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such phasing can be time-consuming and does not eliminate the problems of evidential overlap and inconsistency of advocacy. Jurors may have difficulty appreciating how a defendant can legitimately argue in the first part of the trial that he acted rationally to defend himself and then take a seemingly opposite stance in the second phase by asserting his insanity. The jury might have similar concerns about what may appear to be a \u201crole reversal\u201d by the State. Moreover, favorable evidence adduced by one side on state-of-mind issues in the first phase might be used to impeach that same party\u2019s different contentions in the second phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">These difficulties of inconsistency and overlap conceivably might be tempered if the case is structured as two separate trials before two separate fact-finders, with the insanity trial occurring second, and only if necessary. That arrangement is even more inefficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and time-consuming. It also does not eliminate the potential for evidence from the first trial being used to undercut the position of the party who had previously adduced it. There is also the prospect of inconsistent fact-finding, for example, if the first jury concludes that the defendant was delusional and that his use of force was therefore unreasonable, and the second jury concludes, to the contrary, that the defendant\u2019s behavior was not delusional and that he was not excused from his acts by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">No optimal solution is apparent that will eradicate these difficulties. We commend these prospective issues to the Supreme Court\u2019s Criminal Practice Committee for fuller consideration and potential rule-drafting, by a wider segment of practitioners, scholars, experts, and judges.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We need only express here our view that <em>Khan </em>should no longer be followed. Specifically, we hold that it is improper to force a defendant to submit to an initial trial solely on insanity and thereby deprive him of the opportunity to have substantive defenses tried that potentially could lead to his outright acquittal rather than his commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Having explained why we believe <em>Khan </em>is not sound law, we now turn to the implications of our ruling with respect to defendant\u2019s own particular circumstances. We begin by considering, in more depth, his desire to assert a theory of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The parameters of the use of force to defend oneself are set forth in the Code at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-1 to -4. In general, \u201cthe use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4a. However, the statute also proscribes the use of deadly force in self-defense under certain circumstances, providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this section unless the actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily harm; nor is it justifiable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">(a) The actor, with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, provoked the use of force against himself in the same encounter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">(b) The actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating or by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by complying with a demand that he abstain from any action which he has no duty to take, except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">(i) The actor is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling, unless he was the initial aggressor!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">[N.J.S.A 2C:3-4b(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">In addition, defendant\u2019s belief that he needed to resort to deadly force against his uncle must be shown to have been objectively reasonable and sincere. <em>See State v. Rodriguez, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>165, 173, 949 A.2d 197 (2008). A defendant\u2019s sincere, but delusional, belief in the need to use deadly force would be insufficient to sustain a claim of self-defense. <em>See State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 199-200, 478 A.2d 364 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">We recognize that defendant\u2019s statement to the police that he encountered his uncle outside their residence, and the proofs suggesting that robbery may have been the motive for his uncle\u2019s attack, undermine his contention that he justifiably acted in self-defense. The use of deadly force is not justifiable when an actor knows he can avoid it with complete safety by retreating or by surrendering demanded property. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(2)(b). The Code does not provide a victim with \u201ca license to kill a robber, even when the victim knows he can safely retreat without resort to deadly force.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 949 A.2d 197. The law does not assume that the victims in all robberies will reasonably believe that they are \u201clikely to suffer death or serious bodily injury and cannot safely retreat.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The factual record in this case was not sufficiently developed to apply these legal standards. There are a variety of unresolved factual issues, including: (1) where the altercation actually began and ended, (2) whether defendant reasonably believed that stabbing his uncle was necessary to protect himself from death or serious bodily harm, and (3) whether defendant knew he could have avoided the use of deadly force by retreating or by surrendering his property. These are all viable issues that should be determined at a trial. <em>See id. </em>at 174-75, 949 A.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">A trial court is obliged to instruct a jury on self-defense as long as the charge is requested and there is \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support it. <em>Id. </em>at 174, 949 A.2d 197; <em>see also RPC </em>3.1 (prohibiting attorneys from knowingly presenting non-meritorious affirmative contentions, but nevertheless allowing criminal defense counsel to \u201cso defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established\u201d). The factual issues reasonably bearing on defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, and the possibility of his exoneration, were left unresolved when the trial court bifurcated the ease pursuant to <em>Khan </em>and decided the insanity issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\u201cThe Federal and New Jersey Constitutions guarantee criminal defendants \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147, 168, 827 A.2d 243 (2003) (quoting <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>683, 690, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2142, 2146, 90 L.Ed.2d 636, 645 (1986)), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>1160, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1169, 157 L.Ed.2d 1204 (2004). Defendant here was not afforded this guaranteed opportunity to present a defense that might have resulted in his acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The State argues that defendant\u2019s claims \u2014 that his uncle swung the pipe at him, that he warded off the attack with his arm, and that the pipe struck his wrist watch \u2014 are patently incredible. The State emphasizes that the watch was not shattered and that no marks from the pipe were apparently left on defendant\u2019s arm. The State also raises doubts about defendant\u2019s claim that his altercation with his uncle occurred by the tree, since no blood was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>found on or near the tree, and the tree is a substantial distance from where the uncle\u2019s body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Although we understand, as did the trial judge, the State\u2019s reasons for being skeptical of defendant\u2019s account, we cannot say that his account is so patently without evidential support that it should not be presented, in a plenary fashion, to a trier of fact. The failure of the watch to shatter, as well as the absence of physical marks on defendant\u2019s arm and blood stains on the tree, do not necessarily preclude the possibility that defendant was attacked in some manner by his uncle and that he was attempting to defend himself. The substantial cash in defendant\u2019s possession, the uncle\u2019s motive to attempt to rob him of that cash, and the discovery of the pipe bearing the uncle\u2019s tattooed nickname provide sufficient counter-proof that could be reasonably consistent with a self-defense theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The self-defense claim in this case cannot be precluded out of hand, despite its potential weaknesses. Those weaknesses can, of course, be explored by the State at a trial, both through the cross-examination of defense witnesses and the presentation of the State\u2019s own proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We also note that the bifurcation sequence employed here impinged upon the presumption of innocence to which defendant was entitled. It effectively relieved the State of its responsibility to prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Wakefield, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>397, 576-77, 921 A.2d 954 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 <em>U.S. </em>1146, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>1074, 169 L.Ed.2d 817 (2008). To obtain a conviction for purposeful or knowing murder, the State was required to prove that defendant\u2019s \u201cconscious object\u201d was to cause death or serious bodily injury resulting in death. <em>See State v. Jenkins, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>347, 362, 840 A.2d 242 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The State presented little, if any, evidence at the insanity trial that defendant attacked his uncle with the conscious object to kill him, or to cause serious bodily injury. This was not a case where the victim sustained multiple stab wounds that might circumstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tially indicate a defendant\u2019s intention to cause suffering and harm. <em>Cf. State v. Hunt, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>330, 389, 558 A.2d 1259 (1989). To the contrary, the victim here died from a single stab wound, consistent with defendant\u2019s claim to have ceased his own assault once he thwarted his uncle\u2019s attack. Defendant\u2019s writings, identifying his uncle as one of several persons that he did not trust or like, do not necessarily prove that he intended on this occasion to use deadly force against the uncle without justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">For these reasons, defendant was manifestly prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure (albeit one mandated by <em>Khan) </em>to allow him to present, in a plenary fashion, evidence that he acted in justifiable response to an attack by his uncle. An acquittal by reason of insanity terminates the criminal proceedings against a defendant, but nevertheless subjects an individual to a deprivation of liberty in the form of commitment. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:4-7 to -8; <em>see State v. W.K., </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 731 A.2d 482 (1999). On the other hand, a successful defense of justification will exonerate a defendant from criminal liability with no loss of liberty. <em>State v. Jenewicz, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>440, 450, 940 A.2d 269 (2008); <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 197-98, 478 A.2d 364 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">As a criminal defendant who has been committed after an adjudication of not guilty by reason of insanity, defendant\u2019s continued commitment is subject to a lesser standard of proof than that of persons who are civilly committed. The burden of proof for continued commitment of a criminal defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity is a preponderance of the evidence. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:4-8b(3). By contrast, persons who are civilly committed are subject to continued commitment only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.15; <em>In re Commitment of Edward S., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>118, 130-31, 570 A.2d 917 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Persons acquitted by reason of insanity and civilly committed individuals are all subject to periodic hearings to consider whether their continued involuntary commitment is warranted based on dangers they may pose to themselves or others. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-8b(3); <em>see also N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.16; <em>In re Commitment of J.R., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 529-33, 916 A.2d 463 (App.Div.2007). In addition, the future consideration of the continued commitment of a defendant who is the subject of an insanity disposition by a criminal judge must \u201cgive substantial weight to the nature and seriousness of the crime committed by defendant and its relationship to his present mental condition.\u201d <em>Krol, supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 261, 344 A.2d 289. As we have already shown, the \u201cnature and seriousness\u201d of defendant\u2019s crime was not fairly adjudicated here, because evidence that he acted in self-defense was precluded under the bifurcated procedure called for under <em>Khan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Even if the State proves the elements of its case and defendant\u2019s conduct proves insufficient to acquit him on the basis of self-defense, the self-defense proofs would at least be relevant to the \u201cnature and seriousness\u201d of his crime, and germane to the consideration of his dangerousness for purposes of his continued confinement at future <em>Krol </em>hearings. Defendant should have been given a chance to develop those mitigating proofs at a plenary trial. Further, the proofs might have led a jury to find him guilty of a lesser-included homicide, such as manslaughter, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4, which could also bear on the <em>Krol </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">We reject the State\u2019s argument that defendant received the functional equivalent of a trial on self-defense during the insanity proceedings. Although he made some incidental comments about defendant\u2019s self-defense theory, the trial judge himself explicitly recognized that the parties had not been afforded a full opportunity to present, or to refute, evidence bearing upon his self-defense theory. Moreover, the court made no ultimate findings about the merits of the self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">For these reasons, we conclude that defendant was unfairly precluded from having a fact-finder fully consider a defense that could have resulted in his acquittal. In reaching that conclusion, we do not fault the trial judge for applying the bifurcation sequence presented by <em>Khan, </em>which he was bound to follow as precedent. Nevertheless, the process utilized here was erroneous and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We finally consider the question of how to remedy the trial court\u2019s deprivation of defendant\u2019s right to present his self-defense claims in a plenary manner to a fact-finder. Defendant requests the remedy of remanding the ease for a trial on the self-defense issue, and, if he prevails at such a trial, an order for judgment of acquittal and his release from institutional commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Defendant\u2019s prayer for relief is flawed, in that he seeks the proverbial objective of \u201chaving one\u2019s cake and eating it too.\u201d He seeks to retain the benefits of his present insanity-based disposition, essentially as a back-up means of avoiding prison. He argues that, under double jeopardy principles, the State and this court cannot divest him of his acquittal predicated on insanity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In its post-argument letter briefs, the State concurs that double jeopardy principles do not allow defendant\u2019s present disposition to be taken away from him involuntarily. Even so, the State disputes defendant\u2019s claimed entitlement to a remand and to a plenary trial on the merits, including his self-defense contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution guarantees that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. V. Its prohibition is extended to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>784, 794, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2056, 2062, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716 (1969); <em>State v. Widmaier, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>475, 490, 724 A.2d 241 (1999). The New Jersey Constitution also guards against double jeopardy, in its provision that \u201c[n]o person shall, after acquittal, be tried for the same offense.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Double jeopardy principles disallow repeated attempts to obtain a conviction against a defendant after he has been acquitted of criminal or quasi-criminal charges. <em>Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 724 A.2d 241. This constitutional prohibition \u201cassures that the State with its great resources will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>permitted to harass and oppress the individual by multiple prosecution or punishment for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Currie, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>531, 536, 197 A.2d 678 (1964); see <em>also United States v. Scott, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>82, 87, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2187, 2192, 57 L.Ed.2d 65, 71-72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We can remain faithful to double jeopardy principles and still avoid the inequitable prospect of giving defendant the opportunity to obtain, in effect, a windfall of two separate and logically-incompatible acquittals \u2014 one based on an insanity defense and the other based on a self-defense claim. In lieu of such a windfall, we will require defendant to choose to relinquish his present insanity-based disposition as a condition of obtaining a trial on the merits and presenting his contentions of self-defense. Requiring defendant to make such an election does not violate double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Our law recognizes that the defense of double jeopardy may be waived. <em>State v. Allah, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>269, 282, 787 A.2d 887 (2002). The defense must be raised by motion before trial and the failure to do so constitutes a waiver. <em>Ibid.; see also R. </em>3:10-2(e). Moreover, the defense of double jeopardy is not available to a defendant who, by his own initiative, causes his previous plea or conviction to be set aside. <em>See In re Smigelski, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>513, 525, 154 A.2d 1 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The United States Supreme Court has explained that \u201cto require a criminal defendant to stand trial again after he has successfully invoked a statutory right of appeal to upset his first conviction is not an act of governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>at 91, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2194, 57 L.Ed.2d at 74. The Court firmly rejected the notion that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited any new trial after the setting aside of a judgment of conviction against the defendant or that it \u2018guarantees to him the right of being hung, to protect him from the danger of a second trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Keen, </em>26 <em>F.Cas. </em>686, 690 (C.C.Ind.1839))(No. 15, 510). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Defendant has provided us with no legal justification for obtaining a new trial on the merits, while retaining his existing insanity-based disposition if he is unsuccessful in that trial. Instead, presuming that defendant is found competent on remand, we require him to make a fair choice: either retain his insanity-based acquittal and forego a plenary trial, or, alternatively, waive his present disposition and start, in essence, with a clean slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Our decision to impose such a fair choice upon defendant is consistent with principles expressed elsewhere. In fact, similar reasoning was applied in <em>State v. Lewis, </em>188 S.W.3d 483, 485-86 (Mo.Ct.App.2006). There, the defendant, who had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, proffered a defense of mental disease or defect that would negate the culpable mental state for charges of assault. However, in a bench trial, the State argued that he should be found not guilty by reason of-insanity and, with no objection by the defendant, it submitted his medical records as evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 485. At the close of evidence, the defendant stated to the court that he sought only a judgment of guilty or not guilty, and that he did not rely on the insanity defense. <em>Id. </em>at 486. Nevertheless, the trial court found him not guilty by reason of insanity, and the defendant appealed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Ibid. </em>The relevant statutes placed the burden of injecting the insanity issue and the burden of persuasion on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 487. It was an affirmative defense that must be initiated and proven by the defendant; nothing in the Missouri statutes allowed the defense to be raised by the State or the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 487-88. The trial court in <em>Lewis </em>had no authority to acquit him based on that defense or to order his civil commitment. <em>Id. </em>at 488. According to the Missouri appeals court, the trial court improperly had \u201cfocused solely on the requirements of the affirmative defense of [not guilty by reason of insanity] and neither considered nor found whether the State had earned its burden of proof to show that the appellant had the requisite <em>mens rea, </em>as to the offenses charged[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Most importantly for our purposes, double jeopardy did not attach in <em>Lewis, </em>because the judgment there had declared the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity. <em>Ibid. </em>The appellate court consequently reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial judge who heard all of the evidence, for his consideration of whether the State had carried its burden to prove the elements of the offenses, specifically the mens rea element to which the defendant had asserted the defense of mental disease or defect. <em>Id. </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Applying such double jeopardy principles here, we conclude that defendant is not precluded from seeking relief from his present disposition of a final judgment of not guilty by reason of insanity. However, as a fair condition of receiving the plenary trial on self-defense and other substantive issues that he desires on remand, defendant must voluntarily relinquish his insanity-based disposition in order to proceed with a trial on the merits. He is not entitled to both retain that judgment and obtain a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Consequently, we now delineate the appropriate terms of a remand, in which defendant will be obligated, if he has the mental capability to do so, to make the choice we have prescribed. The remand process will entail several steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">First, given the substantial lapse of time since the competency assessment of defendant was last made by the trial court in 2008, a renewed competency hearing must be performed before any new trial is begun in the trial court. The hearing should be preceded by one or more updated examinations of defendant by mental health experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Second, if defendant is found competent to stand trial on that renewed assessment, the court should then ascertain if he wishes to waive his double jeopardy rights.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If he does, his judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>not guilty by reason of insanity should be vacated, and he should be granted a new trial at which he can raise any appropriate defense based on the evidence, including self-defense and, if he so chooses, insanity.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, if defendant does not waive his double jeopardy rights, then the present insanity-based disposition should be left unaltered and no new trial shall be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The question then arises as to whether a trial on remand should be a unitary proceeding \u2014 at which all issues, including any insanity defense, are presented and decided \u2014 or, alternatively, whether the proofs and the verdicts should be sequenced so as to reserve the insanity proofs and issues for a later phase of the same trial or for a second trial before another fact-finder. We have already canvassed the problems associated with each of these options. The State has urged that, if any tidal is ordered on remand, it should be a unitary trial. Defendant argues that a unitary trial places him in an untenable position with inconsistent theories of defense, and that a sequenced or bifurcated process instead must be utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We recognize that our State has a strong general preference for unitary criminal dispositions. As we observed in <em>Haseen, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 567, 468 A.2d 448, \u201c[a] single trial is preferable because it conserves judicial resources and avoids the inherent unfairness of giving the accused two bites at the apple of acquittal.\u201d \u201c \u2018By trying all issues together, time and expense to both parties is conserved, and the single jury is given the entire picture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Levier, </em>226 <em>Kan. </em>461, 601 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>1116, 1119 (1979)). Moreover, <em>Haseen </em>recognized that \u201c[t]he overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that have ruled on the subject have concluded that bifurcated trials are not required <em>when [the] defendant creates the hard choice.\u201d Haseen, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 567, 468 A.2d 448 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Here, the defense of insanity was not elected by defendant in the first instance, but rather was interposed on his behalf against his express wishes. Defendant did not initially choose to present inconsistent theories to the court. He did not, as in <em>Haseen, </em>\u201ccreate the hard choice.\u201d The situation has instead evolved, in essence, from a paternalistic endeavor to prevent him from waiving a defense that may not have been in his best interests to waive.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As we have noted, the involuntary interposition of that defense was not contested or briefed on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The particular circumstances before us are also factually distinguishable from <em>Haseen </em>because that case involved a defendant\u2019s assertion of both an insanity defense and an alibi defense. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 468 A.2d 448. There was no self-defense claim in <em>Haseen. Ibid,. </em>Unlike an alibi defense, a self-defense claim requires the trier of fact to evaluate the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the incident, and the reasonableness of his response to a perceived attack. Consequently, <em>Haseen </em>did not have to address the difficulties of coupling a state of mind inquiry for self-defense purposes with a parallel inquiry of mindset for insanity purposes. The potential for prejudice to the defendant from a unitary trial is more palpable in the self-defense context.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In other special circumstances, our courts have departed from the unitary trial model in order to prevent undue prejudice to a defendant. For example, in <em>State v. Ragland, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>189, 193-95, 519 A.2d 1361 (1986), the Supreme Court held that when a defendant is charged simultaneously with unlawful possession of a weapon and illegal possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the possession-by-a-felon offense must be tried in a second phase before the same jury, in order to limit prejudice to the defendant. At the second phase of the trial, the jury must be carefully instructed \u201cto consider anew the evidence previously admitted but to disregard ... completely its prior verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 519 A.2d 1361. The Court recognized that such a two-step process was wasteful, but that loss in efficiency was justified in order to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>Ibid. </em>On the other hand, sequencing the trial in two phases before the same jury avoids the need to empanel a new jury and \u201cthe waste of everyone\u2019s time involved in re-introducing evidence that has already been admitted.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Chenique-Puey, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>334, 678 A.2d 694 (1996), the Court found it unfair to conduct a unitary trial where a defendant is charged with both terroristic threats and with contempt of a domestic violence restraining order. The Court recognized that a jury at such a unitary trial, in considering the terroristic threat charges, might improperly interpret the existence of the prior restraining order as a \u201cjudicial imprimatur on the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 678 A.2d 694. Consequently, the Court directed that, in future cases, the courts try the charges on the underlying present offense first and the contempt charges immediately thereafter, before the same jury. <em>Ibid. </em>Again, the Court recognized the inconvenience resulting from such sequential trials, but determined that such inconvenience was outweighed by the promotion of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Applying similar logic here, we conclude that a trial on remand should be conducted in two phases before the same jury.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> First, there shall be a trial on the merits, including defendant\u2019s contentions of self-defense. Second, if necessary, a second trial before the same jury will proceed on any asserted insanity defense. Because this sequencing is designed to protect, most of all, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>fairness to the accused, defendant may elect to waive such a sequenced trial if he believes it is tactically in his best interests to do so. The jury in the second trial should also be issued appropriate instructions stressing the need to consider the evidence anew and not be influenced in the insanity trial by the positions that the State and defendant took in the first trial. Although we appreciate that such an instruction may be difficult to fashion and may not preclude improper spillover effects from the first trial, we believe such a procedure is preferable to a trial on insanity before a newly-impaneled jury. If, however, our approach in this case is deemed unwise, the Supreme Court and the Legislature are, of course, free to develop and require other alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We reject the State\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury in the insanity proceedings represented a plenary waiver of his right to a jury on his self-defense claims, or any other proceedings on remand, in the event of an appellate reversal. <em>See State v. Di Frisco, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>253, 283, 571 A.2d 914 (1990) (noting that neither party is bound by a prior jury waiver after an appellate remand); <em>see also State v. Campbell, </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 998 A.2d 500 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Furthermore, we should clarify that if defendant provides a waiver and the present judgment is accordingly vacated, the State is free to contest defendant\u2019s insanity if the insanity issue is retried. The State would not be estopped from abiding by its earlier position at the first trial agreeing that defendant was insane. This is because, by virtue of defendant\u2019s waiver, the court\u2019s original decision relying on the State\u2019s position would be vacated.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We detect no \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d in mutually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>allowing both the State and defendant to conduct a potential retrial on the insanity issues unfettered by whatever positions they had taken in the past. <em>See Jenkins, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 359, 840 A.2d 242 (quoting <em>Kimball, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 608, 760 A.2d 794) (noting that courts invoke judicial estoppel only \u201c \u2018when a party\u2019s inconsistent behavior will otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">For the reasons we have set forth, the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
