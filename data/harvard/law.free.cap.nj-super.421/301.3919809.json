Defendant, who was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in 2002, argues on appeal that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>entitled to a \u201cpersonal use defense\u201d and Ms sentence is excessive. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">A State grand jury charged defendant with first-degree maintaimng or operating a production facility for manufacturing marijuana, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-4 (count one); second-degree manufacturing of marijuana in an amount greater than ten but less than fifty plants, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(a)(1) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(b)(10)(b) (count two); and third-degree possession of psilocybin mushrooms, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-10(a)(1) (count three). The court denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss counts one and two of the indictment on March 20, 2009, and it subsequently granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to bar defendant from asserting a personal use defense and from referencing his medical condition at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">On December 17, 2009, a jury acquitted defendant of count one, but found him guilty of counts two and three. The trial court determined the presumption of imprisonment for a second-degree crime had not been overcome, and it imposed a five-year prison term on count two and a three-year concurrent term on count three. The court also granted defendant\u2019s application for bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Defendant presents three arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY HOLDING THAT THE MEDICAL/PERSONAL USE OF MARIJUANA WAS NOT AVAILABLE AS A DEFENSE TO A CHARGE OF MANUFACTURING MARIJUANA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY BARRING THE DEFENSE EXPERT, DR. DENNIS PETRO, FROM TESTIFYING ABOUT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF MARIJUANA ON MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND BY PRECLUDING MR. WILSON FROM REFERRING TO HIS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-18\">MR. WILSON\u2019S SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-19\">Based on our examination of the record, the briefs, and the applicable law, we conclude that defendant received a fair trial and his sentence is not excessive or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>On August 18, 2008, a National Guard helicopter was conducting a \u201cmarijuana search mission\u201d over Somerset County. A possible \u201cmarijuana grove\u201d was discovered, and GPS coordinates of the target area were relayed to State Police officers on the ground. Officers Matthew Mancil and William Peacock drove to the location, an old farm house on approximately one acre of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">When Mancil and Peacock arrived, they immediately observed \u201cthe tops of several marijuana plants ... [at] the end of the driveway.\u201d The officers exited their vehicle and spoke with defendant, who was standing in the yard. Both officers testified that when asked if he knew why the police were at his house, defendant responded it was because of the marijuana plants. Defendant then signed a \u201cMiranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Warning Acknowledgement Card\u201d and a consent form for \u201ca complete search of [the] residence, yard, and out buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Peacock, who was qualified as an expert witness \u201cin the areas of marijuana and cultivation of marijuana,\u201d described the search as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">A. ... [W]e checked the area in the backyard for additional marijuana plants other than the ones we immediately saw when we drove up to the [house].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">Q. And what did you see when you examined his backyard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">A. We noticed there were trails ... [that] started from [the] yard and they led from plant to plant. The trails were worn through the grass all the way down to the bare earth. If you followed the trail, it led you from plant to plant to plant through the yard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">Q. After looking at the trails and seeing where they led, did you examine the plants themselves?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">Q. And what did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">A. We found 17 ... marijuana plants that were just ringed around that yard from trail to trail to trail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">Q. Approximately how tall [were] the plants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">A. Between five and six-[feet] tall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Q. Based on your opinion, were the plants well-cared for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">A. Yes, they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Q. What did you base that opinion on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">A. ... They were very high, they appeared very lush.... The ground around [them] was loose and it appeared they\u2019d been watered recently. You could see the trails going through there. Somebody had been by those plants almost daily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The officers also discovered plant food and \u201cMiraele-Gro Quick Start Planting and Transplant Starting Solution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">While searching defendant\u2019s residence, the officers recovered \u201ca small amount of marijuana\u201d and a plastic bag containing psilocybin mushrooms in his bedroom. However, neither officer recalled asking defendant why he was growing marijuana or what he was going to do with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Defendant testified in his own defense. When asked if he was \u201cin the process of growing\u201d the seventeen marijuana plants, he responded, \u2018Tes, I was.\u201d Defendant admitted he purchased marijuana seeds \u201cover the Internet\u201d and planted about twenty of them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">Q. ... [Y]ou planted [the marijuana] seeds, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">Q. You went out and cultivated the land and tilled it ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">A. I didn\u2019t till it, I just kind of broke it up a little with a shovel to loosen the dirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">Q. But you cleared the land in anticipation of planting, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-15\">A. I mean, it\u2019s a little space, not a large space, a foot space, a foot-and-a-half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2F\">Q. A foot-and-a-half, and you did that 20 times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-16\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-17\">Q. For 20 different seeds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-18\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-19\">Q. ... You didn\u2019t do any follow-up care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-20\">A. I watered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-21\">Q. So ... over a course of two-and-a-half months, [you] made sure that these plants were going to grow and be healthy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-22\">A. That\u2019s what I was trying to do, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">In addition, to impeach the officers\u2019 credibility, defendant was allowed to testify he told Mancil and Peacock he was using the marijuana to treat his MS symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>In his first point, defendant argues that he should have been allowed \u201cto present a personal use defense\u201d to count two, which charged him with manufacturing marijuana under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5. According to defendant, \u201cthe Legislature intended a personal use exemption to apply to all facets of the manufacturing process specified in the definition of manufacturing.\u201d In response, the State contends that the personal use exemption \u201cis specifically limited to the preparation or compounding of a controlled dangerous substance [ (CDS) ] already in existence.\u201d After examining the relevant statutory language, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s broad interpretation. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cManufacture\u201d is defined as \u201cthe production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion or processing\u201d of a CDS. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-2. The statute also states, however, that the definition \u201cdoes not include the preparation or compounding of a[CDS] ... by an individual for his own use.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, the Legislature limited the exemption to only two of the six enumerated activities, and an individual who engages in the production, propagation, conversion, or processing of a CDS \u2014 even for his own use \u2014 commits a proscribed activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In the present matter, we agree that defendant\u2019s actions did not fall within the narrow personal use exemption because he did not engage in \u201cthe preparation or compounding\u201d of a CDS \u201cfor his own use.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, defendant\u2019s actions exemplified the \u201cproduction\u201d of marijuana, which, by definition, includes \u201cplanting, cultivation, growing, or harvesting.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Although no New Jersey court has previously considered whether there is a personal use defense to growing marijuana,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> other jurisdictions have enacted nearly identical definitions of \u201cmanufacture\u201d with \u201cpersonal use\u201d exemptions. <em>See, e.g., Ark.Code Ann. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u00a7 5-64-101(16)(A)-(C) (2011); <em>Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. </em>\u00a7 333.7106(2) (LexisNexis 2011); <em>Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 28-401(14) (LexisNexis 2011); <em>N.C. Gen.Stat. </em>\u00a7 90-87(15) (2011). Courts in these states have consistently determined that the plain language of their statutes limits the personal use exemption to preparation or compounding of a CDS. <em>See People v. Pearson, </em>157 <em>Mich.App. </em>68, 403 N.W.2d 498, 500, <em>appeal denied, </em>428 <em>Mich. </em>893 (Mich. 1987); <em>State v. Bossow, </em>274 <em>Neb. </em>836, 744 N.W.2d 43, 52 (2008). These courts have also recognized that the purpose behind the personal use exemption \u201cis to avoid finding an individual liable for the ... manufacturing [of] a [CDS] when that individual is already in possession of the controlled substance and is simply making it ready for use, such as rolling marijuana into cigarettes for smoking or combining it with other ingredients for use.\u201d <em>Bossow, supra, </em>744 N.W.2d at 51-52; <em>see Stone v. State, </em>348 <em>Ark. </em>661, 74 S.W.3d 591, 594-95 (2002) (same) (citing <em>Owens v. State </em>325 <em>Ark. </em>110, 926 S.W.2d 650, 657-58 (1996)); <em>State v. Childers, </em>41 <em>N.C.App. </em>729, 255 <em>S.E.2d </em>654, 656 (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>298 <em>N.C. </em>302, 259 S.E.2d 916 (1979); <em>see also Pearson, supra, </em>403 N.W.2d at 500-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Similarly, we hold that the personal use defense for the preparation or compounding of a CDS does not apply to a charge of growing marijuana under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5. <em>See State v. Ciancaglini, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>597, 606, 10 A.3d 870 (2011) (\u201cIf the language of a statute is clear on its face, the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). As other courts have found, the purpose of the personal use exemption is to allocate culpability consistent with an individual\u2019s participation. Therefore, those who engage in \u201ca significantly higher degree of activity\u201d with a CDS, such as growing it, cannot avail themselves of the exemption. <em>Childers, supra, </em>255 <em>S.E.2d </em>at 656. Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with New Jersey\u2019s stated policy \u201cto distinguish between drug offenders based on the seriousness of the offense, considering principally the nature, quantity and purity of the [CDS] involved, and the role of the actor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-1.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Because there is no personal use defense to growing marijuana, defendant\u2019s second point (that the trial court erred in barring his proposed expert witness) is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). The trial court correctly concluded the proposed testimony, which would have been offered to establish the benefits of using marijuana to treat MS symptoms, was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In his third point, defendant argues that his sentence for manufacturing marijuana is manifestly excessive and should be reduced to \u201ca period of probation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Manufacturing marijuana plants in an amount greater than ten plants is a second-degree offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(b)(10)(b), and defendant was sentenced to five years, the minimum term of imprisonment for a second-degree offender, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The presumption of imprisonment may be overcome if \u201chaving regard to the character and condition of the defendant, [the court] is of the opinion that [defendant\u2019s] imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(d). As a result, the Criminal Code leaves \u201ca residuum of power in the sentencing court not to imprison in those few cases where it would be entirely inappropriate to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 358, 471 A.2d 370 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has \u201cconsistently held that this residuum of power may be legitimately exercised in those \u2018truly extraordinary and unanticipated\u2019 cases where the \u2018human cost\u2019 of punishing a particular defendant to deter others from committing his offense would be \u2018too great.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Evers, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>355, 389, 815 A.2d 432 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Rivera, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>122, 125, 590 A.2d 238 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">When deciding whether the presumption has been overcome, \u201ca trial court should determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that there are relevant mitigating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>present to an <em>extraordinary </em>degree and, if so, whether cumulatively, they so greatly exceed any aggravating factors that imprisonment would constitute a serious injustice overriding the need for deterrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 815 A.2d 432. It is the quality of the mitigating factors, not their quantity, that controls. <em>See id. </em>at 394, 815 A.2d 432 (stating that not \u201cevery mitigating factor will bear the same relevance in weight in assessing the character and condition of the defendant; it is the quality of the factor or factors and their uniqueness in the particular setting that matters\u201d). In this case, the trial court found three aggravating factors (risk of recidivism, prior criminal record, and need to deter) and two mitigating factors (serious harm not contemplated, and conduct unlikely to recur), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a) and (b), and it determined that the mitigating factors did not outweigh the aggravating.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In terms of the aggravating factors, defendant specifically contends that aggravating factor number nine, \u201c[t]he need for deterring the defendant and others from violating the law,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(9), is not supported by the record. At sentencing, the judge noted that defendant\u2019s adult criminal record included: the successful completion of a pretrial intervention program after he had been arrested and charged with three counts of burglary and two counts of criminal mischief; the entry of a final restraining order (FRO) that required defendant to surrender all weapons; charges of contempt and harassment in violation of the FRO; and a guilty plea to the harassment charge. The judge also observed: \u201cMany people who suffer from MS and other chronic diseases do not use those diseases as a justification to break the law.\u201d We are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>See State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989) (\u201cAn appellate court is bound to affirm a sentence, even if it would have arrived at a different result, as long as the trial court properly identifies and balances aggravating and mitigating factors that are supported by competent credible evidence in the record.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Next, defendant claims that additional \u201cmitigating factors should have been found by the trial court,\u201d and the quality of those factors would overcome the presumption. Most notably, defendant submits that his imprisonment \u201cwould entail excessive hardship.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(b)(11). The trial court rejected this factor, however, reasoning as follows: \u201cAlthough you suffer from MS, which I find as a matter of fact, I do not find Mitigating Factor 11 applicable because ... there is nothing in the record to indicate that your medical needs could not be adequately met in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>State v. M.A., </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. 353, 369, </em>954 A.2d 503 (App. Div.2008), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that mitigating factor number eleven did not apply to a defendant with \u201cAIDS, compounded by diabetes and coronary artery disease.\u201d Despite these medical conditions, we agreed that the defendant \u201cwas functioning at a reasonable level; he was undergoing active treatment; and there was nothing in the record indicating his needs could not be adequately met in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 954 A.2d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Furthermore, in <em>State v. Lebra, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>500, 510-11, 815 A.2d 1020 (App.Div.2003), we reversed the trial court\u2019s determination that the presumption of imprisonment had been overcome. In that case, \u201cthe trial court found as a mitigating factor that imprisonment would pose an excessive hardship to defendant\u201d because he was diagnosed with a brain tumor between the time he was arrested and sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 815 A.2d 1020. Nevertheless, we concluded that defendant\u2019s medical needs could be \u201cadequately met while [he was] incarcerated.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Here, defendant\u2019s presentenee report indicated \u201che was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2002\u201d and \u201cis currently not taking any prescription medication because he has no medical insurance.\u201d Instead, defendant stated he was \u201ctreating his symptoms with Bee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Venom Therapy\u201d and \u201cadmitted to the daily use of marijuana to help alleviate his symptoms.\u201d Although we sympathize with defendant\u2019s medical condition, the record is devoid of any evidence that he will not obtain satisfactory medical treatment while incarcerated. As a result, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that there are no extraordinary mitigating factors in this case. <em>See State v. Jabbour, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 570 A.2d 391 (1990) (noting that \u201c[ijmprisonment generally results in hardship\u201d and \u201c[i]t is not enough ... that a defendant would find incarceration difficult\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">There are a limited number of decisions in which the presumption of imprisonment has been overcome. <em>See State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 398, 555 A.2d 559 (1989) (presumption inappropriate for a mentally retarded and psychotic woman who pled guilty to the manslaughter of her infant child); <em>State v. E.R., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 272, 641 A.2d 1072 (App.Div.1994) (presumption inappropriate \u201cbased on the fact that defendant was suffering from HIV neuropathy, severe anemia, and leukopenia\u201d and only had six months to live). The current matter is distinguishable from these cases, and we find no abuse of discretion or error of judgment by the trial court. <em>Roth, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 363-64, 471 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-17\"> <em>Miranda v.
